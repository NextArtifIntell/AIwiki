  abstract     = {In the paper, we investigate the exponential stability of nonlinear delayed systems with destabilizing and stabilizing delayed impulses, respectively. Specifically, the study can be divided into two cases: (1) stability of delayed systems with destabilizing delayed impulses, where the time delays in impulses can be flexible and even larger than the length of impulsive interval, and (2) stability of delayed systems with stabilizing delayed impulses, where the time delays in impulses are flexible between two consecutive impulsive instants. In order to address the time-delay term in impulses, the concept of average impulsive delay (AID) is proposed. Using the ideas of average impulsive interval and AID, we present some Lyapunov-based exponential stability criteria for delayed systems with average-delay impulses, where the delays in impulses satisfy the proposed AID condition. It is shown that time delay in impulse has double effects, namely, it may destabilize a stable system or stabilize an unstable system. Interestingly, it is also shown that for some stable delayed systems with stabilizing delayed impulses, under certain conditions, the stability can be ensured regardless of the size of delay in continuous dynamics. Further, we apply the theoretical results to the impulsive synchronization control of Chua&#39;s circuits with both transmission delay and sampling delay. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate the validity of the derived results.},

The problem is featured with a principal&#39;s participating incentive compatible constraint, which particularly stands in the context of asset management with motivation to safeguard the benefit of the principal. After a thorough investigation, it turns out to be a complicated double S-shaped utility optimization problem. We propose a new classification approach to study the optimal final asset allocation. First, it is classified into two cases: (a) One-side-loss case in which either both parties suffer liquidation, or one gains and the other loses, or both make profit. (b) Option case in which either both parties suffer liquidation or both make profit. Further, we demonstrate an asymptotic classification of the optimal asset allocation that the single utility maximization of the principal is the limit of the option case, while that of the agent is the limit of the one-side-loss case. More importantly, we find a division reservation utility which the optimal asset allocation belongs to the option case beyond and to the one-side-loss case below. Thus, the key factor resulting in different risk choices is the size of the reservation utility. As an application, we numerically visualize these results with a specific participating contract, which illustrates some novel mechanisms in asset management.},

Numerically optimized bounds converge to the value function from below as polynomial degree increases to infinity under suitable technical conditions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel intermittent compensation switching strategy is designed for the stabilization of switched nonlinear systems. By making use of composite multiple Lyapunov-like functions, the designed switching strategy intermittently checks the worst direction of state and then compensates for the corresponding worst state. The associated Lyapunov-like functions are allowed to increase their values both during the active interval and at the switching instant. This removes the two conservative nonincreasing requirements which are commonly used in the classical switching law design. Practically, to implement the switching strategy, we only need to check the switching conditions and transmit the state information on a discrete time sequence, and Zeno behavior is avoided with a dwell-time in the nonlinear situation. Some sufficient conditions in their algebraic forms are proposed to make the equilibrium point of the closed-loop systems asymptotically stable. An example demonstrates the effectiveness.},

The function perturbation problem of LCNs is formulated, and the perturbation analysis for controllability of LCNs is divided into four cases based on whether the perturbed control can be replaced. By virtue of the matrix-based method, a kind of controllability perturbation matrix is constructed for each case to reveal the change of controllability matrix of the original LCNs. In addition, a kind of controllability perturbation set is proposed via the graph-based method, which provides a concise resolution for perturbation analysis with respect to controllability.

  abstract     = {Policy gradient (PG) methods have been one of the most essential ingredients of reinforcement learning, with application in a variety of domains. In spite of the empirical success, a rigorous understanding of the global convergence of PG methods appears to be relatively lacking in the literature, especially for the infinite-horizon setting with discounted factors. In this work, we close the gap by viewing PG methods from a nonconvex optimization perspective. In particular, we propose a new variant of PG methods for infinite-horizon problems that uses a random rollout horizon for the Monte Carlo estimation of the policy gradient. This method then yields an unbiased estimate of the policy gradient with bounded variance, which enables using the tools from nonconvex optimization to establish the global convergence. Employing this perspective, we first point to an alternative method to recover the convergence to stationary-point policies in the literature. Motivated by the recent advances in nonconvex optimization, we have modified the proposed PG method by introducing a periodically enlarged stepsize rule. More interestingly, this modified algorithm is shown to be able to escape saddle points under mild assumptions on the reward functions and the policy parameterization of the reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Specifically, we connect the correlated negative curvature condition of [H. Daneshmand et al., Escaping saddles with stochastic gradients, in Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, Stockholm, Sweden, 2018, pp. 1155--1164] to the fact that the reward must be strictly positive or negative. Under the additional assumption that all saddle points are strict, this result essentially establishes the convergence to actual locally optimal policies of the underlying problem and thus rigorously corroborates the overclaimed argument in the literature on the convergence of PG methods. In this aspect, our findings justify the benefit of reward-reshaping in terms of escaping saddle points from a nonconvex optimization perspective.},

  abstract     = {In this work we address the problem of boundary feedback stabilization for a geometrically exact shearable beam, allowing for large deflections and rotations and small strains. The corresponding mathematical model may be written in terms of displacements and rotations (geometrically exact beam), or intrinsic variables (intrinsic geometrically exact beam). A nonlinear transformation relates both models, allowing us to take advantage of the fact that the latter model is a one-dimensional first-order semilinear hyperbolic system, and deduce stability properties for both models. By applying boundary feedback controls at one end of the beam while the other end is clamped, we show that the zero steady state of the intrinsic geometrically exact beam model is locally exponentially stable for the $H^1$ and $H^2$ norms. The proof rests on the construction of a Lyapunov function, where the theory of Bastin and Coron [Stability and Boundary Stabilization of $1$-D Hyperbolic Systems, in Progr. Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl. 88, Birkhäuser/Springer, Cham, 2016] plays a crucial role. The major difficulty in applying this theory stems from the complicated nature of the nonlinearity and lower order term where no smallness arguments apply. Using the relationship between both models, we deduce the existence of a unique solution to the geometrically exact beam model, and properties of this solution as time goes to $+\infty$.},

The cost functional contains a term that measures the size of the support of the control, which is the so-called $L^0$-norm. We provide necessary and sufficient optimality conditions of second order. The sufficient second-order condition is obtained by analyzing a partially convexified problem. Interestingly, the structure of the problem yields second-order conditions with different bilinear forms for the necessary and for the sufficient conditions.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic nonlinear complementarity problem (DNCP) consisting of a nonlinear differential system and a complementarity system has been used to formulate and study many dynamic problems. In a Gauss--Seidel type method for DNCPs, by first guessing a solution of the differential system, we can solve the complementarity system and then with the computed solution we can solve the differential system to update the guess. Upon convergence at the current time point we can move to the next one. The idea can be easily generalized to a multipoint version: instead of doing iterations at each single time point, we can do iterations for a number of time points, say $J$ time points, all at once. Despite its simplicity and easy implementation, convergence of this method is not justified so far. In this paper, we present interesting convergence theorems for this method. We show that the method with a fixed length of time interval converges superlinearly and the convergence rate is robust with respect to the step-size $h$. Moreover, we show that the method with a fixed number of time points converges with a rate $\mathcal{O}(h)$. Since at each iteration the differential system and the complementarity system are solved separately, many existing solvers are directly applicable for each of these two systems. It is notable that we can solve the complementarity system at all the $J$ time points in parallel. Numerical results of the method to solve the 4-diode bridge wave rectifier with random circuit parameters and the projected dynamic systems are given to support our findings.},

By introducing a sliding-mode manifold, the incommensurate fractional-order MAS is transformed into an integer-order MAS. Then, practical fixed-time bipartite consensus protocols with constant and adaptive gains are designed, respectively, for the obtained integer-order MAS. By artfully constructing a Lyapunov function, it is shown that the practical bipartite consensus can be achieved with a settling time. Moreover, the upper bound of the settling time can be estimated explicitly, which is irrelevant to any initial conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed practical fixed-time bipartite consensus schemes is illustrated by numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of constructing flat inputs for multi-output dynamical systems. The notion of flat inputs has been introduced by Waldherr and Zeitz in [Internat. J. Control, 81 (2008), pp. 439--443; IFAC Proc. Vol., 43 (2010), pp. 695--700] and can be seen as dual to that of flat outputs. In the single-output case, a flat input can be constructed if and only if the original dynamical system together with its output is observable. In the multi-output case, the observability is not necessary for the existence of flat inputs. The observable case has been treated by Waldherr and Zeitz in [IFAC Proc. Vol., 43 (2010), pp. 695--700], where a system of linear algebraic equations has been proposed in order to determine the control vector fields associated to the flat inputs. The goal of this paper is to treat the unobservable case for multi-output dynamical systems. We start by discussing the case when the dynamical system together with the given output is observable and we present a generalization of the 2010 results of Waldherr and Zeitz by relating them with the notion of minimal differential weight. Then we give our main results. We consider the unobservable case for which locally, around any point of an open and dense subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we construct control vector fields $g_1,\ldots, g_m$ such that the associated control system is flat (where $n$ and $m$ denote, resp., the state and the output dimensions). Finally, we explain how our results can be applied to private communication.},

Our goal in the present paper is to select appropriate kernel functions such that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable. We first choose an exponentially stable system as a target system. Meanwhile, we introduce an appropriate auxiliary system. After that we construct two transformations. The first one is used to establish the equivalence between the original controlled time-delay system and the auxiliary system. This step mainly removes the effect of input memory. The second one is used to establish the equivalence between the auxiliary system and the stable target system. This step is to eliminate the negative effect of the anti-damping. Herein we mainly give an approach to selecting parameter functions in both transformations and hence get an exponentially stable-type feedback controller. Finally, some simulations are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

We prove it is not null-controllable if $\rho$ is analytic on a conic neighborhood of $\mathbb R_+$ and $\rho(\xi) = o(|\xi|)$. The proof relies essentially on geometric optics, i.e., estimates for the evolution of semiclassical coherent states. The method also applies to other equations. The most interesting example might be the Kolmogorov-type equation $(\partial_t -\partial_v^2 + v^2\partial_x)f(t,x,v) = \mathbbm{1}_\omega u(t,x,v)$ for $(x,v)\in \Omega_x\times \Omega_v$ with $\Omega_x = \mathbb R$ or $\mathbb T$ and $\Omega_v = \mathbb R$ or $(-1,1)$. We prove it is not null-controllable in any time if $\omega$ is a vertical band $\omega_x\times \Omega_v$.

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to study the controllability of the bilinear Schrödinger equation on compact graphs. In particular, we consider the equation $(BSE)$ $i\partial_t\psi=-\Delta\psi+u(t)B\psi$ in the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathscr{G},\mathbb{C})$, with $\mathscr{G}$ being a compact graph. The Laplacian $-\Delta$ is equipped with self-adjoint boundary conditions, $B$ is a bounded symmetric operator, and $u\in L^2((0,T),\mathbb{R})$ with $T&gt;0$. We provide a new technique leading to the global exact controllability of $(BSE)$ in $D(|\Delta|^{s/2})$ with $s\geq 3$. Afterwards, we introduce the “energetic controllability,” a weaker notion of controllability useful when the global exact controllability fails. In conclusion, we develop some applications of the main results involving, for instance, star graphs.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant progress on stability analysis of conventional multiagent networked systems with weakly coupled state-network dynamics, most of the existing results have shortcomings in addressing multiagent systems with highly coupled state-network dynamics. Motivated by numerous applications of such dynamics, in our previous work [SIAM J. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 1757--1782], we initiated a new direction for stability analysis of such systems that uses a sequential optimization framework. Building upon that, in this paper, we extend our results by providing another angle on multiagent network dynamics from a duality perspective, which allows us to view the network structure as dual variables of a constrained nonlinear program. Leveraging that idea, we show that the evolution of the coupled state-network multiagent dynamics can be viewed as iterates of a primal-dual algorithm for a static constrained optimization/saddle-point problem. This view bridges the Lyapunov stability of state-dependent network dynamics and frequently used optimization techniques such as block coordinated descent, mirror descent, the Newton method, and the subgradient method. As a result, we develop a systematic framework for analyzing the Lyapunov stability of state-dependent network dynamics using techniques from nonlinear optimization. Finally, we support our theoretical results through numerical simulations from social science.},

The price process of each stock is described by a collection of partially observed point processes. They are the noisy observation of an intrinsic value process, assumed to be Markovian. However, the control problem with partial information is non-Markovian and depends on an infinite-dimensional measure-valued input. To solve the challenging problem, we first establish a separation principle, which divides the filtering and the control problems and reduces the infinite-dimensional input to finite-dimensional ones. Building upon the result of nonlinear filtering with counting process observations, we solve the control problem by employing the stochastic maximum principle for control with forward-backward SDEs developed in [SIAM J. Control Optim., 48 (2009), pp. 2945--2976]. We explicitly obtain the efficient frontier and derive the optimal strategy, which is based on the filtering estimators.},

The higher prolongations extend the positive semiorbit and determine a great number of stability concepts, indexed by the ordinal numbers. The highest stability is named absolute stability and can be characterized by a continuous Lyapunov functional. It is proved that compact positively invariant uniform attractors and positive semiorbits of dispersive control systems are absolutely stable sets. The higher prolongational limit sets determine the generalized recurrence, which extends the recursive concepts of Poincaré recurrence and nonwandering points. The notion of chain prolongation is introduced in order to discuss the generalized recurrence. The main result shows that the chain prolongation is the largest extension of the positive semiorbit, and then the chain recurrence is the more general concept of recurrence.},

In particular, we provide sharp end-to-end guarantees on the stability and the performance of the designed distributed controller and prove that for sparse systems, the number of samples needed to guarantee robust and near optimal performance of the designed controller can be significantly smaller than the dimension of the system.

The aim of this paper is to design delay feedback control functions based on the discrete-time observations of the system states and the Markovian states in order for the controlled switching diffusion system (SDS) to be exponentially stable in the $p$th moment with probability one as well as stable in $H_\infty$. The designed control principles are implementable to stablize quasi-linear and highly nonlinear SDSs. For quasi-linear SDSs the criteria are sharp that under the control with high strength the controlled SDSs will be stable (bounded) while under the weaker control they will be unstable (unbounded) in the mean square. The sample and moment Lyapunov exponents are estimated which have a close relationship to the time delays.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a data-driven method for approximation of the maximum positively invariant (MPI) set and the maximum controlled invariant (MCI) set for nonlinear dynamical systems. The method only requires knowledge of a finite collection of one-step transitions of the discrete-time dynamics, without the requirement of segments of trajectories or the control inputs that effected the transitions to be available. The approach uses a novel characterization of the MPI and MCI sets as the solution to an infinite-dimensional linear programming (LP) problem in the space of continuous functions, with the optimum being attained by a (Lipschitz) continuous function under mild assumptions. The infinite-dimensional LP is then approximated by restricting the decision variable to a finite-dimensional subspace and by imposing the nonnegativity constraint of this LP only on the available data samples. This leads to a single finite-dimensional LP that can be easily solved using off-the-shelf solvers. We analyze the convergence rate and sample complexity, proving probabilistic as well as hard guarantees on the volume error of the approximations. The approach is very general, requiring minimal underlying assumptions. In particular, the dynamics is not required to be polynomial or even continuous (forgoing some of the theoretical results). Detailed numerical examples up to state-space dimension 10 with code available online demonstrate the method.},

In particular, it is proved that this number is exponential in the order of the system for a class of problems. Since every point in each of these components is the unique solution of the ODC problem for some quadratic objective functional, the results of this work imply that, without prior knowledge for initialization, local search algorithms cannot solve the ODC problem to global optimality for all decentralized control structures.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a wave of research activities in systems science toward the study of population systems. The driving force behind this shift was geared by numerous emerging and ever-changing technologies in life and physical sciences and engineering, from neuroscience, biology, and quantum physics to robotics, where many control-enabled applications involve manipulating a large ensemble of structurally identical dynamic units, or agents. Analyzing fundamental properties of ensemble control systems in turn plays a foundational and critical role in enabling and, further, advancing these applications, and the analysis is largely beyond the capability of classical control techniques. In this paper, we consider an ensemble of time-invariant linear systems evolving on an infinite-dimensional space of continuous functions. We exploit the notion of separating points and techniques of polynomial approximation to develop necessary and sufficient ensemble controllability conditions. In particular, we introduce an extended notion of controllability matrix, called the ensemble controllability matrix. This enables the characterization of ensemble controllability through evaluating controllability of each individual system in the ensemble.

  abstract     = {For sequential stochastic control problems with standard Borel measurement and control action spaces, we introduce a general (universally applicable) dynamic programming formulation, establish its well-posedness, and provide new existence results for optimal policies. Our dynamic program builds in part on Witsenhausen&#39;s standard form, but with a different formulation for the state, action, and transition dynamics. Using recent results on measurability properties of strategic measures in decentralized control, we obtain a standard Borel controlled Markov model. This allows for a well-defined dynamic programming recursion through universal measurability properties of the value functions for each time stage. In addition, new existence results are obtained for optimal policies in decentralized stochastic control. These state that for a static team with independent measurements, it suffices for the cost function to be continuous (only) in the actions for the existence of an optimal policy under mild compactness (or tightness) conditions. These also apply to dynamic teams which admit static reductions with independent measurements through a change of measure transformation. We show through a counterexample that weaker conditions may not lead to the existence of an optimal team policy. The paper&#39;s existence results generalize those previously reported in the literature. A summary of and comparison with previously reported results and some applications are presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with optimal control problems described by a controlled version of Moreau&#39;s sweeping process governed by convex polyhedra, where measurable control actions enter additive perturbations. This class of problems, which addresses unbounded discontinuous differential inclusions with intrinsic state constraints, is truly challenging and underinvestigated in control theory while being highly important for various applications. To attack such problems with constrained measurable controls, we develop a refined method of discrete approximations with establishing its well-posedness and strong convergence. This approach, married to advanced tools of first-order and second-order variational analysis and generalized differentiations, allows us to derive adequate collections of necessary optimality conditions for local minimizers, first in discrete-time problems and then in the original continuous-time controlled sweeping process by passing to the limit. The new results include an appropriate maximum condition and significantly extend the previous ones obtained under essentially more restrictive assumptions. We compare them with other versions of the maximum principle for controlled sweeping processes that have been recently established for global minimizers in problems with smooth sweeping sets by using different techniques. The obtained necessary optimality conditions are illustrated by several examples.},

These sufficient conditions are given by an uncertainty relation and a dissipation estimate. Our approach unifies and generalizes the respective advantages from earlier results obtained in the context of Hilbert spaces. As an application we consider the example where $A$ is an elliptic operator in $L_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and where $C = {1}_{E}$ is the restriction onto a thick set ${E} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. In this case, we show that the above system satisfies a final state observability estimate if and only if ${E} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a thick set. Finally, we make use of the well-known relation between observability and null-controllability of the predual system and investigate bounds on the corresponding control costs.},

This quantity appears in a number of applications including the stability of switched and hybrid systems. A popular method used for the stability analysis of these systems searches for a Lyapunov function with convex optimization tools. We investigate dual formulations for this approach and leverage these dual programs for developing new analysis tools for the JSR. We show that the dual of this convex problem searches for the occupations measures of trajectories with high asymptotic growth rate. We both show how to generate a sequence of guaranteed high asymptotic growth rate and how to detect cases where we can provide lower bounds on the JSR.

The purpose of the control law is to asymptotically stabilize the closed-loop system around states at which the output function attains a local minimum. An implementation of the control law only requires measurements of the output values. The approach employs highly oscillatory inputs with suitably chosen frequencies. A detailed averaging analysis reveals that the closed-loop system is driven approximately into descent directions of the output function along Lie brackets of the control vector fields. Those descent directions also originate from an approximation of suitably chosen Lie brackets. The approximation properties are ensured if the amplitudes and frequencies of the oscillatory inputs are sufficiently large. The proposed method can lead to practical asymptotic stability even if the control vector fields do not span the entire tangent. It suffices instead that the tangent space is spanned by the elements in the Lie algebra generated by the control vector fields. This novel feature extends extremum seeking by Lie bracket approximations from the class of fully actuated systems to a larger class of nonholonomic systems.},

One of our objective is to propose a convex programming formulation for this type of MDP. It will be shown that the values of the constrained control problem and the associated convex program coincide. Moreover, if there exists an optimal solution to the convex program then there exists a stationary randomized policy which is optimal for the MDP. It will be also shown that in the framework of constrained control problems, the supremum of the ETRs over the set of randomized policies is equal to the supremum of the ETRs over the set of stationary randomized policies. We consider standard hypotheses such as the so-called continuity-compactness conditions and a Slater-type condition. Our assumptions are quite weak to deal with cases that have not yet been addressed in the literature. Examples are presented to illustrate our results.},

Unlike most existing results on the ACOI, our result does not require any compactness and continuity conditions on the MDPs. Instead, the main idea is to use the almost-uniform-convergence property of a pointwise convergent sequence of measurable functions as asserted in Egoroff&#39;s theorem. Our conditions are formulated in order to exploit this property.

  abstract     = {We present an emergent stochastic flocking dynamics of the Cucker--Smale (CS) ensemble under randomly switching network topologies. The evolution of the CS ensemble with randomly switching topologies involves two random components (switching times and choices of network topologies at switching instants). First, we allow switching times for the network topology to be random so that the successive increments are i.i.d. processes following the common probability distribution. Second, at each switching instant, we choose a network topology randomly from a finite set of admissible network topologies whose union contains a spanning tree. Even for the fixed deterministic network topology, the CS ensemble may not exhibit a monocluster flocking, depending on the initial data and the decay mode of the communication weight functions measuring the degree of interactions between particles. For the flocking dynamics of the CS ensemble with these two random components, we first use a priori conditions on the network topologies and the uniform boundedness of the position diameter, and derive the flocking estimates via matrix theory together with a priori conditions, and then replace the a priori condition for the position diameter by some suitable condition on system parameters and communication weight. A priori conditions on the network topology will be guaranteed by the suitable spanning tree time-blocks with probability one.},

In order to take into account this uncertainty, we consider optimal control problems for a system with an uncertain initial state. A finite terminal time is given. On account of the uncertainty of the initial state, it is not possible to prescribe an exact terminal state. Instead, we are looking for a control that steers the system into a given neighborhood of the desired terminal state with sufficiently high probability. This neighborhood is described in terms of an inequality for the terminal energy. The probabilistic constraint in the considered optimal control problem leads to optimal controls that are robust against the inevitable uncertainties of the initial state.

This scheme, referred to as the order reduction finite difference scheme, does not use numerical viscosity and yet preserves the uniform exponential stability. The paper consists of four parts. In the first part, the original wave equation is first transformed by order reduction into an equivalent system. A standard semidiscretized finite difference scheme is then constructed for the equivalent system. It is shown that the semidiscretized scheme is second-order convergent and that the discretized energy converges to the continuous energy. Very unexpectedly, the discretized energy also preserves uniformly exponential decay. In the second part, an order reduction finite difference scheme for the original system is derived directly from the discrete scheme developed in the first part. The uniformly exponential decay, convergence of the solutions, as well as uniform convergence of the discretized energy are established for the original system. In the third part, we develop the uniform observability of the semidiscretized system and the uniform controllability of the Hilbert uniqueness method controls. Finally, in the last part, under a different implicit finite difference scheme for time, two numerical experiments are conducted to show that the proposed implicit difference schemes preserve the uniformly exponential decay.},

To this end, a set of matrix inequalities is given by constructing a new Lyapunov function as a weighted $H^2$-norm of the classical Cauchy solution and the integral of boundary output. Furthermore, the traffic flow dynamics of a freeway section are modeled with the Aw--Rascle--Zhang model. To stabilize the oscillations of traffic demand, a local PI boundary feedback controller is designed with integration of on-ramp metering and variable speed limit control.

Thus, it is a challenging task to derive criteria, especially algebraically verifiable ones, for output-controllability of nonlinear systems. In this paper, we consider output-controllability of a class of fundamental driftless discrete-time bilinear systems. We show that output-controllability of such systems cannot be fully deduced by controllability; however, near-controllability plays a key role in studying the output-controllability problem. A general necessary and sufficient condition as well as an algebraically verifiable sufficient condition is obtained for output-controllability of the systems via near-controllability. Our study reveals that output-controllability of a nonlinear system needs to be determined by its near-controllability instead of its controllability. Furthermore, inspired by near-controllability, we introduce a new notion, called output-near-controllability, for nonlinear systems and demonstrate it on the bilinear systems. Necessary as well as sufficient algebraic conditions for output-near-controllability of the bilinear systems are presented. Examples are given to demonstrate the conceptions and results of this paper.},

The necessary and sufficient condition for a RKHS to be stable, i.e., to contain only BIBO stable linear dynamic systems, has been known in the literature since at least 2006. However, an open question still persists and concerns the equivalence of such a condition with the absolute summability of the kernel. This paper provides a definite answer to this matter by proving that such correspondence does not hold. A counterexample is introduced that illustrates the existence of stable RKHSs that are induced by nonabsolutely summable kernels.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we establish an observability inequality for the heat equation with bounded potentials on the whole space. Roughly speaking, such a kind of inequality says that the total energy of solutions can be controlled by the energy localized in a subdomain, which is equidistributed over the whole space. The proof of this inequality is mainly adapted from the parabolic frequency function method, which plays an important role in proving the unique continuation property for solutions of parabolic equations. As an immediate application, we show that the null controllability holds for the heat equation with bounded potentials on the whole space.},

This path dependency is the novelty of the model and leads to an infinite dimensional stochastic optimal control problem. We solve the problem completely and find explicitly the optimal controls in feedback form. This is possible because we are able to find an explicit solution to the associated infinite dimensional HJB equation, even if state constraints are present. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first infinite dimensional generalization of Merton&#39;s optimal portfolio problem for which explicit solutions can be found. The explicit solution allows us to study the properties of optimal strategies and discuss their financial implications.},

Though in this context of Kelvin--Voigt damping, such an approach is unlikely to allow for the optimal results when additional geometric assumptions are considered, it turns out that using this method, we can obtain the usual logarithmic decay which is optimal in general cases. We also present some applications of this approach giving decay rates in some particular geometries (tori).},

We investigate the possible limits in the norm of uniform convergence topology of values defined through Abel means or Ceàro means when $ \lambda \to 0^+ $ and $T \to + \infty $, respectively. Here we give two types of new representation formulas for the accumulation points of the values when the averaging parameter converges. We show that there is only one possible accumulation point which is the same for Abel means or Cesàro means. The first type of representation formula is based on probability measures on the product of the state space and the control state space, which are limits of occupational measures. The second type of representation formula is based on measures which are the projection of invariant measure on the space of relaxed controls. We also give a result comparing the both sets of measures involved in both classes of representation formulas. An important consequence of the representation formulas is the existence of the limit value when one has the equicontinuity property of Abel or Cesàro mean values. This is the case, for example, for nonexpansive stochastic control systems. In the end some insightful examples are given which help to better understand the results.},

The optimality criterion here is to maximize the expected value of the aggregate discounted dividend payments up to the time of ruin. In the framework of the classical Cramér--Lundberg risk model, we solve the corresponding two-dimensional optimal control problem and show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation. We also show that the value function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by ratcheting strategies with only a finite number of possible dividend rates and identify the free boundary and the optimal strategies in several concrete examples. These implementations illustrate that the restriction of ratcheting does not lead to a large efficiency loss when compared to the classical unconstrained optimal dividend strategy.},

We place ourselves in the framework of relaxed optimal stopping, which amounts to looking for the optimal occupation measure of the stopper rather than the optimal stopping time. This framework allows us to prove the existence of a relaxed Nash equilibrium and the uniqueness of the associated value of the representative agent under mild assumptions. Further, we prove a rigorous relation between relaxed Nash equilibria and the notion of mixed solutions introduced in earlier works on the subject and provide a criterion under which the optimal strategies are pure strategies, that is, behave in a similar way to stopping times. Finally, we present a numerical method for computing the equilibrium in the case of potential games and show its convergence.},

The problem stems from applications in optimal design and more specifically topology optimization. We propose a novel parametrization of nonlocal material properties. With this parametrization the nonlocal diffusion law in the limit of vanishing nonlocal interaction horizons converges to the famous and ubiquitously used generalized Laplacian with SIMP (solid isotropic material with penalization) material model. The optimal control problem for the limiting local model is typically ill-posed and does not attain its infimum without additional regularization. Surprisingly, its nonlocal counterpart attains its global minima in many practical situations, as we demonstrate in this work. In spite of this qualitatively different behavior, we are able to partially characterize the relationship between the nonlocal and the local optimal control problems. We also complement our theoretical findings with numerical examples, which illustrate the viability of our approach to optimal design practitioners.},

The agents have limited capability to sense the movement information of their local neighbors determined via the spatial relative distance, and make movement decisions accordingly. The objective is to guide the followers to move with the same preferred direction as leaders have (i.e., reaching a stable consensus). We provide detailed analysis for the information transfer between the subgroups of leaders and followers, and establish quantitative results on the proportion of leaders needed to reach the stable consensus for two cases: leaders with the same preference and leaders with different preferences. For the system where the leaders have the same preference, we provide an upper bound (impossibility theorem) and a lower bound (sufficient condition) for the proportion of leaders needed in reaching the stable consensus. When the leaders have two different preferences, we provide a sufficient condition and a necessary condition on the proportions of two subgroups of leaders to achieve stable consensus decisions.},

  abstract     = {We study the controlled dynamics of the ensembles of points of a Riemannian manifold $M$. Parameterized ensemble of points of $M$ is the image of a continuous map $\gamma:\Theta \to M$, where $\Theta$ is a compact set of parameters. The dynamics of ensembles is defined by the action $\gamma(\theta) \mapsto P_t(\gamma(\theta))$ of the semigroup of diffeomorphisms $P_t:M \to M, \ t \in \mathbb{R}$, generated by the controlled equation $\dot{x}=f(x,u(t))$ on $M$. Therefore, any control system on $M$ defines a control system on (generally infinite-dimensional) space $\mathcal{E}_\Theta(M)$ of the ensembles of points. We wish to establish criteria of controllability for such control systems. As in our previous work [A. Agrachev, Y. Baryshnikov, and A. Sarychev, ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var., 22 (2016), pp. 921--938], we seek to adapt the Lie-algebraic approach of geometric control theory to the infinite-dimensional setting. We study the case of finite ensembles and prove the genericity of the exact controllability property for them. We also find a sufficient approximate controllability criterion for continual ensembles and prove a result on motion planning in the space of flows on $M$. We discuss the relation of the obtained controllability criteria to various versions of the Rashevsky--Chow theorem for finite- and infinite-dimensional manifolds.},

  abstract     = {Optimal controller synthesis is a bilinear problem and hence difficult to solve in a computationally efficient manner. We are able to resolve this bilinearity for systems with delay by first convexifying the problem in infinite dimensions, i.e., formulating the $H_\infty$-optimal state-feedback controller synthesis problem for distributed-parameter systems as a linear operator inequality, which a form of convex optimization with operator variables. Next, we use positive matrices to parameterize positive “complete quadratic” operators, allowing the controller synthesis problem to be solved using semidefinite programming (SDP). We then use the solution to this SDP to calculate the feedback gains and provide effective methods for real-time implementation. Finally, we use several test cases to verify that the resulting controllers are optimal to several decimal places as measured by the minimal achievable closed-loop $H_\infty$ norm, and as compared against controllers designed using high-order Padé approximations.},

First, we present some results on the existence, uniqueness, exponential boundedness, and convergence rate of solutions to an equilibrium point of mixed fractional-order systems with time-varying delays. In particular, we show that in general the convergence rate of solutions to an equilibrium point is subpolynomial. This is a significant difference from ordinary differential equations. Then, we investigate the Mittag--Leffler stability of time delay fractional-order systems. To do this, we use the linearization method combined with a new weighted type norm which is compatible with the dependence on history and the hereditary property of these models. Based on an integral presentation of solutions and some special properties of Mittag--Leffler functions, we also obtain a criterion on the asymptotic stability of fractional-order systems with unbounded time-varying delays. Finally, some examples with simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

In particular, we generalize the fundamental notions of invariance and controlled invariance to the fractional setting. We then exploit this new geometric framework to address the disturbance decoupling problem via static pseudostate feedback, with and without stability. Our main contribution is a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the disturbance decoupling problem that are related to the input-output properties of the closed-loop system, and hence they are applicable not just to Caputo-type derivatives but, more broadly, to any type of fractional system. These results show that, while the conditions for guaranteeing the existence of a decoupling pseudostate feedback remain essentially unchanged, the underlying theoretical framework is substantially different, because the fractional derivative is a nonlocal operator and this property plays a major role in the characterization of the evolution of the pseudostate trajectory. In particular, we show that, unlike the integer case, the infinite-dimensional nature of fractional systems means that feedback control is insufficient to maintain the pseudostate trajectory on a controlled invariant subspace, unless the entire past history of the pseudostate has evolved on that subspace. However, feedforward control can achieve this task under certain necessary and sufficient geometric conditions.},

  abstract     = {We extend recent work on solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimal control problems (MIOCPs) to the case of integer control functions subject to constraints that involve a pointwise coupling of the state with the integer controls. We extend a theorem due to [S. Sager, H. Bock, and M. Diehl, Math. Program. Ser. A, 133 (2012), pp. 1--23] to the case of MIOCPs with constraints on the integer control and show that the integrality gap vanishes in function space when the coarseness of the rounding grid is driven to zero even after adding constraints of this type. For the time-discretized problem, we extend a sum-up rounding (SUR) scheme due to [S. Sager, C. Reinelt, and H. Bock, Math. Program. Ser. A, 118 (2009), pp. 109--149] to the new problem class. Our scheme permits one to constructively obtain an $\varepsilon$-feasible and $\varepsilon$-optimal binary feasible control. We derive new, tight upper bounds on the integer control approximation error made by SUR. For unconstrained binary controls on equidistant grids, we reduce the approximation error bound from $\mathcal{O}(|\Omega|)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log |\Omega|)$ asymptotically for $|\Omega| \to \infty$ and a fixed coarseness of the rounding grid, where $|\Omega|$ is the number of binary controls. For constrained binary controls, we show that the approximation problem is more difficult, and we give a proof of an approximation error bound of complexity $\mathcal{O}(|\Omega|)$. A numerical example compares our approach to a state-of-the-art mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver and illustrates the applicability of our results when solving MIOCPs using the direct and simultaneous approach.},

Starting from an initial guess, Howard&#39;s policy improvement algorithm separates the step of updating the trajectory of the dynamical system from the optimization and iterations of this should converge to the optimal control. In the discrete space-time setting this is often the case and even rates of convergence are known. In the continuous space-time setting of controlled diffusion the algorithm consists of solving a linear PDE followed by a maximization problem. This has been shown to converge; in some situations, however, no global rate is known. The first main contribution of this paper is to establish global rate of convergence for the policy improvement algorithm and a variant, called here the gradient iteration algorithm. The second main contribution is the proof of stability of the algorithms under perturbations to both the accuracy of the linear PDE solution and the accuracy of the maximization step. The proof technique is new in this context as it uses the theory of backward stochastic differential equations.},

  abstract     = {We study a full-knowledge pursuit-evasion problem where cooperating pursuers attempt to capture a single evader of equal (and without loss of generality, unit) speed in a closed, bounded, two-dimensional arena whose boundaries may be curved. By a famous result of Besicovitch, a point-sized lion (pursuer) can evade a single point-sized man (evader) indefinitely. If the lion is endowed with a capture radius in the form of an outstretched paw of length $r$, by a result of Alonso, Goldstein, and Reingold, the man can evade the lion for time that is superlinear in the diameter of circular arena. We propose a pursuit algorithm by which two pursuers can capture an evader in a simply connected arena in time that is linear in the diameter of the arena, even when the capture radius is zero. This algorithm is clearly asymptotically optimal, highlights the performance gap between one pursuer and two pursuers (even in a convex domain) and clearly establishes that no more than two pursuers are needed for optimal pursuit in simply-connected domains. Furthermore, we propose a pursuit algorithm by which three pursuers are guaranteed to capture an evader in a general two-dimensional arena with $h$ obstacles in time that is proportional to $hd$ (when capture radius is zero). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that has provable capture guarantees at the generality of an arbitrary two-dimensional domain in continuous-time (the hardest case) and that, equally importantly, yields the best time-capture bounds (in comparison to the existing literature) when specialized to polygonal domains.},

  abstract     = {We study the following optimization problem over a dynamical system that consists of several linear subsystems: Given a finite set of $n\times n$ matrices and an $n$-dimensional vector, find a sequence of $K$ matrices, each chosen from the given set of matrices, to maximize a convex function over the product of the $K$ matrices and the given vector. This simple problem has many applications in operations research and control, yet a moderate-sized instance is challenging to solve to optimality for state-of-the-art optimization software. We propose a simple exact algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time when the given set of matrices has the oligo-vertex property, a concept we introduce in this paper for a finite set of matrices. We derive several sufficient conditions for a set of matrices to have the oligo-vertex property. Numerical results demonstrate the clear advantage of our algorithm in solving large-sized instances of the problem over one state-of-the-art global optimization solver. We also propose several open questions on the oligo-vertex property and discuss its potential connection with the finiteness property of a set of matrices, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In stochastic control applications, typically only an ideal model (controlled transition kernel) is assumed and the control design is based on the given model, raising the problem of performance loss due to the mismatch between the assumed model and the actual model. Toward this end, we study continuity properties of discrete-time stochastic control problems with respect to system models (i.e., controlled transition kernels) and robustness of optimal control policies designed for incorrect models applied to the true system. We study both fully observed and partially observed setups under an infinite horizon discounted expected cost criterion. We show that continuity can be established under total variation convergence of the transition kernels under mild assumptions and with further restrictions on the dynamics and observation model under weak and setwise convergence of the transition kernels. Using these continuity properties, we establish convergence results and error bounds due to mismatch that occurs by the application of a control policy which is designed for an incorrectly estimated system model to a true model, thus establishing positive and negative results on robustness. Compared to the existing literature, we obtain strictly refined robustness results that are applicable even when the incorrect models can be investigated under weak convergence and setwise convergence criteria (with respect to a true model), in addition to the total variation criteria. These entail positive implications on empirical learning in (data-driven) stochastic control since often system models are learned through empirical training data where typically a weak convergence criterion applies but stronger convergence criteria do not.},

The result is established for a class of infinite-dimensional linear-quadratic optimal control problems with time-independent dynamics and integral cost. Such problems satisfy the turnpike property: the optimal trajectory remains most of the time very close to the solution to the associated static optimization problem. Specific terminal cost functions, derived from the Lagrange multiplier associated with the static optimization problem, are employed in the implementation of the RHC method.},

We confirm the optimality of the regime-modulated refraction-reflection strategy when the underlying risk model follows a general spectrally negative Markov additive process. To verify the conjecture of a barrier-type optimal control, we first introduce and study an auxiliary problem with the final payoff at an exponential terminal time and characterize the optimal threshold explicitly using fluctuation identities of the refracted-reflected Lévy process. Second, we transform the problem with regime switching into an equivalent local optimization problem with a final payoff up to the first regime-switching time. The refraction-reflection strategy with regime-modulated thresholds can be shown as optimal by using results in the first step and some fixed point arguments for auxiliary recursive iterations.},

In the second part, we provide another sliding mode--inspired feedback which not only stabilizes the pure chain of integrators in prescribed time but also exhibits some robustness in the presence of measurement noise and unmatched uncertainties.},

In a setting with unhedgeable mortality risk and complete financial market, the optimal solution is given explicitly for contracts with mortality risk using a martingale approach for constrained nonconcave optimization problems. We show that regulatory VaR constraints for participating insurance contracts lead to more prudent investment than in the case of no regulation. This result is contrary to the situation where the insurer maximizes the utility of the total wealth of the company (without distinguishing between contributions of equity holders and policyholders), in which case a VaR constraint may induce the insurer to take excessive risks leading to higher losses than in the case of no regulation; see [S. Basak and A. Shapiro, Rev. Financ. Stud., 14 (2001), pp. 371--405]. Compared to the unregulated problem, the VaR-constrained strategy leads to a higher expected utility for the policyholders, highlighting the potential usefulness of a VaR regulation in the context of insurance. The prudent investment behavior is more significant if a VaR-type regulation is replaced by a portfolio insurance (PI)-type regulation. Furthermore, a stricter regulation (a smaller allowed default probability in the VaR problem or a higher minimum guarantee level in the PI problem) enhances the benefit of the policyholder but deteriorates that of the insurer. For both types of regulation, the gains in terms of expected utility are greater for higher participation rates, while being smaller for higher bonus rates. We also extend our analysis to frameworks where dividend and premature death benefit payments are made at an intermediate time date.},

This lack of coercivity gives the problem an impulsive character, meaning that minimizing sequences of trajectories happen to converge towards discontinuous paths. As is known, a distributional approach does not make sense in such a nonlinear setting, where, instead, a suitable embedding in the graph space is needed. We provide higher-order necessary optimality conditions for properly defined impulsive minima in the form of equalities and inequalities involving iterated Lie brackets of the dynamical vector fields. These conditions are derived under very weak regularity assumptions and without any constant rank conditions.},

  abstract     = {We solve an infinite time-horizon bounded-variation stochastic control problem with regime switching between $N$ states. This is motivated by the problem of a government that wants to control the country&#39;s debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratio. In our formulation, the debt-to-GDP ratio evolves stochastically in continuous time, and its drift---given by the interest rate on government debt, net of the growth rate of GDP---is affected by an exogenous macroeconomic risk process modelled by a continuous-time Markov chain with $N$ states. The government can act on the public debt by increasing or decreasing its level, and it aims at minimizing a net expected regime-dependent cost functional. Without relying on a guess-and-verify approach, but performing a direct probabilistic study, we show that it is optimal to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio in an interval, whose boundaries depend on the states of the risk process. These boundaries are given through a zero-sum optimal stopping game with regime switching with $N$ states and are characterized through a system of nonlinear algebraic equations with constraints. To the best of our knowledge, such a result appears here for the first time. Finally, we put in practice our methodology in a case study of a Markov chain with $N=2$ states; we provide a thorough analysis and we complement our theoretical results by a detailed numerical study on the sensitivity of the optimal debt ratio management policy with respect to the problem&#39;s parameters.},

We combine this majorization condition with Lusin&#39;s theorem to prove the existence of a stationary minimum pair, i.e., a stationary policy paired with an invariant probability measure induced on the state space, with the property that the pair attains the minimum long-run average cost over all policies and initial distributions. We also establish other optimality properties of a stationary minimum pair, and for the stationary policy in such a pair, under additional recurrence or regularity conditions, we prove its pathwise optimality and strong optimality. Our results can be applied to a class of countable action space MDPs in which the dynamics and one-stage costs are discontinuous with respect to the state variable.},

In the so-called naïve learning setting, a crowd of individuals holds opinions that are statistically independent estimates of an unknown parameter; the crowd is wise when the average opinion converges to the true parameter in the limit of infinitely many individuals. Unfortunately, even starting from wise initial opinions, a crowd subject to certain influence systems may lose its wisdom. It is of great interest to characterize when an influence system preserves the crowd wisdom effect. In this paper we introduce and characterize numerous wisdom preservation properties of the basic French--DeGroot influence system model. Instead of requiring complete convergence to consensus as in the previous naïve learning model by Golub and Jackson, we study finite-time executions of the French--DeGroot influence process and establish in this novel context the notion of prominent families (as a group of individuals with outsize influence). Surprisingly, finite-time wisdom preservation of the influence system is strictly distinct from its infinite-time version. We provide a comprehensive treatment of various finite-time wisdom preservation notions, counterexamples to meaningful conjectures, and a complete characterization of equal-neighbor influence systems.},

We show that if the threshold of the event-triggering mechanisms is sufficiently small, then the event-triggered control system with a bounded control operator and a compact feedback operator is exponentially stable. For infinite-dimensional systems with unbounded control operators, we employ two event-triggering mechanisms that are based on system decomposition and periodic event-triggering, respectively, and then analyze the exponential stability of the closed-loop system under each event-triggering mechanism.},

One of the key contributions is our analysis of this problem based on “shifted” strategies, thereby proving that the original game can be practically restricted to a sequence of Dynkin&#39;s stopping games without affecting the optimalty of the saddle-point equilibria and hence completely solving some open problems in the existing literature. Under two quite general (weak) assumptions, we show the existence of the value of the game and the form of saddle-point (optimal) equilibria in the set of shifted strategies. Moreover, our methodology is different from the previous techniques used in the existing literature and is based on purely probabilistic arguments. In the process, we establish an interesting property of the underlying Feller--Markov process and the impossibility of infinite number of impulses in finite time under saddle-point strategies which is crucial for the verification result of the corresponding Isaacs--Bellman equations.},

This quantity is of fundamental importance to control theory since it determines the asymptotic convergence rate $e^{\lambda(\mathcal{A}, p)}$ of the stochastic linear dynamical system $x_{k+1} = A_{\sigma_k} x_k$. This paper investigates the following “design problem”: Given $\mathcal{A}$, compute the distribution $p$ minimizing $\lambda(\mathcal{A}, p)$. Our main result is that it is $\textsc{NP}$-hard to decide whether there exists a distribution $p$ for which $\lambda(\mathcal{A}, p) &lt; 0$, i.e., it is $\textsc{NP}$-hard to decide whether this dynamical system can be stabilized. This hardness result holds even in the “simple” case where $\mathcal{A}$ contains only rank-one matrices. Somewhat surprisingly, this is in stark contrast to the Joint Spectral Radius---the deterministic counterpart of the Lyapunov exponent---for which the analogous optimization problem over switching rules is known to be exactly computable in polynomial time for rank-one matrices. To prove this hardness result, we first observe via Birkhoff&#39;s Ergodic Theorem that the Lyapunov exponent of rank-one matrices admits a simple formula and in fact is a quadratic form in $p$. Hardness of the design problem is shown through a reduction from the Independent Set problem. Along the way, simple examples are given illustrating that $p \mapsto \lambda(\mathcal{A}, p)$ is neither convex nor concave in general. We conclude with extensions to continuous distributions, exchangeable processes, Markov processes, and stationary ergodic processes.},

By the dynamic programming principle, Doob--Meyer decomposition, and inverse flow technique, the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the BSREJ are established. The difficulties addressed in this issue not only are brought from the high nonlinearity of the generator of the BSREJ like the case driven only by Brownian motion, but also from that (i) the inverse flow of the controlled linear stochastic differential equation driven by Poisson process may not exist without additional technical conditions, and (ii) showing that the inverse matrix term involving a jump process in the generator is well-defined. Utilizing the structure of the optimal control problem, we overcome these difficulties and establish the existence of the solution. In addition, we show the construction of the optimal feedback control with the help of the Riccati equation and the relation between the solution of the Riccati equation and the value function of the SLQ problem, which also implies the uniqueness of BSREJ.},

Asymptotic flocking dynamics of the thermodynamic Cucker--Smale (TCS) ensemble has been extensively studied using particle, kinetic, and fluid models under several connection topologies that can be realized by the complete network, connected symmetric network, directed graph with a spanning tree, etc. In this paper, we propose sufficient frameworks for the monocluster flocking of the continuous and discrete TCS models on a digraph with a neighbor set determined by q-closest neighbors from the test particle. In our proposed frameworks, there can be a phase-transition-like phenomenon from local (multicluster) flocking to global (monocluster) flocking, depending on the size q of the neighbor set, as we increase q. When q is larger than half of the population, any initial configuration will tend to the monocluster flocking state in a positive coupling regime. In contrast, when q is smaller than half of the population, we need to impose some restrictive conditions on the initial data to guarantee the emergence of monocluster flocking. Thus, our results generalize Cucker and Dong&#39;s result [Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 26 (2016), pp. 2685--2708] for the CS ensemble in a homogeneous constant temperature field. We also provide several numerical examples and compare them with our analytical results.},

In order to estimate the unknown parameters of logistic regression with data streams arriving sequentially and at high speed, we focus our attention on a recursive stochastic algorithm. More precisely, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of a new stochastic Newton algorithm. It enables us to easily update the estimates when the data arrive sequentially and to have research steps in all directions. We establish the almost sure convergence of our stochastic Newton algorithm as well as its asymptotic normality. All our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical experiments.},

We consider the notion of viscosity solutions introduced in [I. Ekren, et al., Ann. Probab., 42 (2014), pp. 204--236], which considers as test functions all those smooth processes which are tangent in mean. When restricted to the Markovian case, this definition induces a larger set of test functions and reduces to the notion of stochastic viscosity solutions analyzed in [E. Bayraktar and M. Sirbu, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 140 (2012), pp. 3645--3654; SIAM J. Control Optim., 51 (2013), pp. 4274--4294]. Our main result takes advantage of this enlargement of the test functions and provides an easier proof of comparison. This is most remarkable in the context of the linear path-dependent heat equation. As a key ingredient for our methodology, we introduce a notion of punctual differentiation, similar to the corresponding concept in the standard viscosity solutions [L. A. Caffarelli and X. Cabre, Amer. Math. Soc. Colloq. Publ., 43, AMS, Providence, RI, 1995], and we prove that semimartingales are almost everywhere punctually differentiable. This smoothness result can be viewed as the counterpart of the Aleksandroff smoothness result for convex functions. A similar comparison result was established earlier in [I. Ekren et al., Ann. Probab., 42 (2014), pp. 204--236]. The result of this paper is more general and, more importantly, the arguments that we develop do not rely on any representation of the solution.},

We show that the solutions of the penalized equations converge monotonically to those of the HJBQVIs. We further establish that the scheme is half-order accurate for HJBQVIs with Lipschitz coefficients and first-order accurate for equations with more regular coefficients. Moreover, we construct the action regions and optimal impulse controls based on the error estimates and the penalized solutions. The penalty schemes and convergence results are then extended to HJBQVIs with possibly negative impulse costs. We also demonstrate the convergence of monotone discretizations of the penalized equations and establish that policy iteration applied to the discrete equation is monotonically convergent with an arbitrary initial guess in an infinite-dimensional setting. Numerical examples for infinite-horizon optimal switching problems are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the penalty schemes over the conventional direct control scheme.},

Using the projection principle in indefinite space, we give a necessary condition of the solvable $H_\infty$ preview control problem by using a pair of variables. The necessary condition is very useful for solving the minimax problem. An inertia condition of matrices, as the necessary and sufficient condition under which the $H_\infty$ control for stochastic linear systems is solvable, is also proposed and tested. This condition generalizes the results for $H_\infty$ control for deterministic systems with disturbance preview. Our results are demonstrated via a quarter vehicle active suspension system.},

Well-posedness and some regularity results in proper spaces are established for such equations. For an associated optimal control problem, by using a Liapunov type theorem and the spike variation technique, we establish a Pontryagin type maximum principle for optimal controls. Different from the existing literature of optimal controls for fractional differential equations, our method enables us to deal with the problem without assuming regularity conditions on the controls, the convexity condition on the control domain, and some additional unnecessary conditions on the nonlinear terms of the integral equation and the cost functional.},

A hierarchical decomposition and decentralized optimality of linear quadruple of strategies, \controller-encoder, decoder, controller\, is shown by construction as follows: (i) the controller-encoder simultaneously controls the output of the G-DM and encodes the state of the G-CS, and operates at the CC capacity of the G-DM; (ii) the decoder is optimal with respect to a mean square error (MSE) criterion; and (iii) the controller of the G-CS which acts on the decoder&#39;s information is optimal.},

  abstract     = {We present a control model for an octopus tentacle based on the dynamics of an inextensible string with curvature constraints and curvature controls. We derive the equations of motion together with an appropriate set of boundary conditions, and we characterize the corresponding equilibria. The model results in a system of fourth-order evolutive nonlinear controlled PDEs, generalizing the classic Euler&#39;s dynamic elastica equation, that we approximate and solve numerically by introducing a finite difference scheme. We proceed by investigating a reachability optimal control problem associated to our tentacle model. We first focus on the stationary case, establishing a relation with the celebrated Dubins car problem. Moreover, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method for its numerical solution. Finally, we address the evolutive case obtaining first order optimality conditions, then we numerically solve the optimality system by means of an adjoint-based gradient descent method.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of distributed state estimation for discrete-time systems over a sensor network through unreliable transmission channels subject to diverse packet dropout probabilities. Each sensor node, equipped with an infinite-time horizon $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Gaussian filter to reach a trade-off between inherently conflicting optimality and robustness, locally constructs an estimate based on its own observation and on those collected from its neighbors over lossy links. A non--zero-sum Nash game is used to deal with such a multiobjective distributed filtering problem. Stabilizing solutions in the mean square (MS) sense are established for a set of cross-coupled modified algebraic Riccati equations associated with each sensor node. Based on the MS stabilizing solutions, causal and bounded Nash equilibrium strategies, consisting of the optimal filter gains and the corresponding worst-case disturbance signals, are further analytically conducted. Moreover, to improve the cohesiveness among different local estimates, an additional consensus objective is taken into consideration by exchanging prior estimates among neighboring nodes. Through a modified algebraic Riccati inequality, an upper bound of the consensus parameter, under which the error dynamics are shown to be MS stable, is derived in terms of the complexity of the stochastic graph associated with the sensor network and the disturbance attenuation level of a stochastic system constructed from the error dynamics. Finally, a numerical example is included to show the validity of the current results.},

  abstract     = {This paper establishes a convergence result for implicit Euler discretizations of optimal control problems with differential-algebraic equations of higher index and mixed control-state constraints. The main difficulty of the analysis is caused by a structural discrepancy between the necessary conditions of the continuous optimal control problem and the necessary conditions of the discretized problems. This discrepancy does not allow one to compare the respective necessary conditions directly. We use an equivalent reformulation of the discretized problems to overcome this discrepancy and to prove first order convergence of the discretized states, algebraic states, controls, and multipliers of the reformulation.},
