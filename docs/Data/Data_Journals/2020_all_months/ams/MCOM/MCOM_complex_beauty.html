We show that as long as forced positions are at a distance at least 19 (resp., 3, resp., 2) from each other, then we can avoid squares over 3 letters (resp., 4 letters, resp., 6 or more letters). We can also deduce exponential lower bounds on the number of solutions. For our main theorem to be applicable, we need to check the existence of some languages and we explain how to verify that they exist with a computer. We hope that this technique could be applied to other avoidability questions where the good approach seems to be nonconstructive (e.g., the Thue-list coloring number of the infinite path).},

  abstract     = {Multidimensional continued fractions (MCFs) were introduced by Jacobi and Perron to obtain periodic representations for algebraic irrationals, analogous to the case of simple continued fractions and quadratic irrationals. Continued fractions have been studied in the field of $p$-adic numbers $\mathbb {Q}_p$. MCFs have also been recently introduced in $\mathbb {Q}_p$, including, in particular, a $p$-adic Jacobi‚ÄìPerron algorithm. In this paper, we address two of the main features of this algorithm, namely its finiteness and periodicity. Regarding the finiteness of the $p$-adic Jacobi‚ÄìPerron algorithm, our results are obtained by exploiting properties of some auxiliary integer sequences. It is known that a finite $p$-adic MCF represents $\mathbb Q$-linearly dependent numbers. However, we see that the converse is not always true and we prove that in this case infinitely many partial quotients of the MCF have $p$-adic valuations equal to $-1$. Finally, we show that a periodic MCF of dimension $m$ converges to an algebraic irrational of degree less than or equal to $m+1$; for the case $m=2$, we are able to give some more detailed results.},

  abstract     = {As a generalization of orthonormal wavelets in $L_2({\mathbb {R}})$, tightframelets (also called tight wavelet frames) are of importance in wavelet analysis and applied sciences due to their many desirable properties in applications such as image processing and numerical algorithms. Tight framelets are often derived from particular refinable functions satisfying certain stringent conditions. Consequently, a large family of refinable functions cannot be used to construct tight framelets. This motivates us to introduce the notion of a quasi-tight framelet, which is a dual framelet but behaves almost like a tight framelet. It turns out that the study of quasi-tight framelets is intrinsically linked to the problem of the generalized matrix spectral factorization for matrices of Laurent polynomials. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation on the generalized matrix spectral factorization problem and compactly supported quasi-tight framelets. As an application of our results on generalized matrix spectral factorization for matrices of Laurent polynomials, we prove in this paper that from any arbitrary compactly supported refinable function in $L_2({\mathbb {R}})$, we can always construct a compactly supported one-dimensional quasi-tight framelet having the minimum number of generators and the highest possible order of vanishing moments. Our proofs are constructive and supplemented by step-by-step algorithms. Several examples of quasi-tight framelets will be provided to illustrate the theoretical results and algorithms developed in this paper.},

For the canonical examples with additive noise (Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process) or multiplicative noise (geometric Brownian motion) we derive these deterministic equations in variational form and discuss their well-posedness in detail. Notably, the second moment equation in the multiplicative case is naturally posed on projective‚Äìinjective tensor product spaces as trial‚Äìtest spaces. We then propose numerical approximations based on Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin discretizations with tensor product piecewise polynomials and analyze their stability and convergence in the natural tensor norms.

We combine the advantages of a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method and the ultraweak discontinuous Galerkin (UWDG) method. First, we rewrite the PDEs with high order spatial derivatives into a lower order system, then apply the UWDG method to the system. We first consider the fourth order and fifth order nonlinear PDEs in one space dimension, and then extend our method to general high order problems and two space dimensions. The main advantage of our method over the LDG method is that we have introduced fewer auxiliary variables, thereby reducing memory and computational costs. The main advantage of our method over the UWDG method is that no internal penalty terms are necessary in order to ensure stability for both even and odd order PDEs. We prove the stability of our method in the general nonlinear case and provide optimal error estimates for linear PDEs for the solution itself as well as for the auxiliary variables approximating its derivatives. A key ingredient in the proof of the error estimates is the construction of the relationship between the derivative and the element interface jump of the numerical solution and the auxiliary variable solution of the solution derivative. With this relationship, we can then use the discrete Sobolev and Poincar√© inequalities to obtain the optimal error estimates. The theoretical findings are confirmed by numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {A wide variety of (fixed-point) iterative methods for the solution of nonlinear equations (in Hilbert spaces) exists. In many cases, such schemes can be interpreted as iterative local linearization methods, which, as will be shown, can be obtained by applying a suitable preconditioning operator to the original (nonlinear) equation. Based on this observation, we will derive a unified abstract framework which recovers some prominent iterative schemes. In particular, for Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone operators, we derive a general convergence analysis. Furthermore, in the context of numerical solution schemes for nonlinear partial differential equations, we propose a combination of the iterative linearization approach and the classical Galerkin discretization method, thereby giving rise to the so-called iterative linearization Galerkin (ILG) methodology. Moreover, still on an abstract level, based on two different elliptic reconstruction techniques, we derive a posteriori error estimates which separately take into account the discretization and linearization errors. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive algorithm, which provides an efficient interplay between these two effects. In addition, the ILG approach will be applied to the specific context of finite element discretizations of quasilinear elliptic equations, and some numerical experiments will be performed.},

  abstract     = {This article considers the computational (acoustic) wave propagation in strongly heterogeneous structures beyond the assumption of periodicity. A high contrast between the constituents of microstructured multiphase materials can lead to unusual wave scattering and absorption, which are interesting and relevant from a physical viewpoint, for instance, in the case of crystals with defects. We present a computational multiscale method in the spirit of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition and provide its rigorous a priori error analysis for two-phase diffusion coefficients that vary between $1$ and very small values. Special attention is paid to the extreme regimes of high frequency, high contrast, and their previously unexplored coexistence. A series of numerical experiments confirms the theoretical results and demonstrates the ability of the multiscale approach to efficiently capture relevant physical phenomena.},

In this way we develop an approach to a class of fourth order elliptic partial differential equations with point constraints using the idea of splitting into coupled second order equations. An approach is formulated using a penalty method to impose the constraints. Our main motivation is to treat certain fourth order equations involving the biharmonic operator and point Dirichlet constraints for example arising in the modelling of biomembranes on curved and flat surfaces but the approach may be applied more generally. The theory for well-posedness and approximation is presented in an abstract setting. Several examples are described together with some numerical experiments.},

Given a cluster of eigenvalues, we estimate the error in the sum of the eigenvalues, as well as the error in the eigenvectors represented through the density matrix, i.e., the orthogonal projector on the associated eigenspace. This allows us to deal with degenerate (multiple) eigenvalues within the framework. All the bounds are valid under the only assumption that the cluster is separated from the surrounding smaller and larger eigenvalues; we show how this assumption can be numerically checked. Our bounds are guaranteed and converge with the same speed as the exact errors. They can be turned into fully computable bounds as soon as an estimate on the dual norm of the residual is available, which is presented in two particular cases: the Laplace eigenvalue problem discretized with conforming finite elements, and a Schr√∂dinger operator with periodic boundary conditions of the form $-\Delta + V$ discretized with planewaves. For these two cases, numerical illustrations are provided on a set of test problems.},

Using this technique, we establish three new instances of a conjecture due to B. Shapiro which states that a binary form of degree $d\cdot e$ is the sum of $d$ $d$th powers of forms of degree $e$. Furthermore, in the case where $X$ is the cone of highest weight vectors in an irreducible representation‚Äîthis includes the well-known cases of tensor rank and symmetric rank‚Äîwe raise the question whether the maximal rank equals the maximal monic rank.

Our main result shows that this algorithm requires at most $O(\max (\deg (\mathbb {C})^{2\omega }, \deg (D_+)^\omega ))$ arithmetic operations in $k$, where $\omega$ is a feasible exponent for matrix multiplication and $D_+$ is the smallest effective divisor such that $D_+\geq D$. This improves the best known upper bounds on the complexity of computing Riemann-Roch spaces. Our algorithm may fail, but we show that provided that a few mild assumptions are satisfied, the failure probability is bounded by $O(\max (\deg (\mathbb {C})^4, \deg (D_+)^2)/\lvert \mathcal E\rvert )$, where $\mathcal E$ is a finite subset of $k$ in which we pick elements uniformly at random. We provide a freely available C++/NTL implementation of the proposed algorithm and we present experimental data. In particular, our implementation enjoys a speedup larger than 6 on many examples (and larger than 200 on some instances over large finite fields) compared to the reference implementation in the Magma computer algebra system. As a by-product, our algorithm also yields a method for computing the group law on the Jacobian of a smooth plane curve of genus $g$ within $O(g^\omega )$ operations in $k$, which equals the best known complexity for this problem.},

Major distinguishing features of our model include (a) topological information of fluids such as Betti numbers can be easily extracted in constant time, (b) topological changes of fluids are captured by nonmanifold points on fluid boundaries, and (c) Boolean operations on fluids correctly handle all degenerate cases and apply to arbitrarily complex topologies, yet they are simple and efficient in that they only involve determining the relative position of a point to a Jordan curve and intersecting a number of curve segments. Finally, utilities of (a) and (c) are demonstrated by combining the Yin space with the recent cubic MARS method to track a complex fluid in a single vortex flow.},

In the case of strong confinement, using a discrete Poincar√© inequality, we prove that the $O(h)$ numeric error under $\ell ^1$ norm is uniform in time, and establish the uniform exponential convergence to the steady states. Compared with the traditional results of exponential convergence of these schemes, our result is in the whole space without boundary.

  abstract     = {The full approximation storage (FAS) scheme is a widely used multigrid method for nonlinear problems. In this paper, a new framework to design and analyze FAS-like schemes for convex optimization problems is developed. The new method, the fast subspace descent (FASD) scheme, which generalizes classical FAS, can be recast as an inexact version of nonlinear multigrid methods based on space decomposition and subspace correction. The local problem in each subspace can be simplified to be linear and one gradient descent iteration (with an appropriate step size) is enough to ensure a global linear (geometric) convergence of FASD for convex optimization problems.},

In this regime, the solution propagates waves with $O(\varepsilon ^2)$ wavelength in time. Surprisingly, we find out that the splitting methods exhibit super-resolution, i.e., the methods can capture the solutions accurately even if the time step size $\tau$ is independent of $\varepsilon$, while the wavelength in time is at $O(\varepsilon ^2)$. $S_1$ shows $1/2$ order convergence uniformly with respect to $\varepsilon$, by establishing that there are two independent error bounds $\tau + \varepsilon$ and $\tau + \tau /\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $\tau$ is nonresonant, i.e., $\tau$ is away from a certain region determined by $\varepsilon$, $S_1$ would yield an improved uniform first order $O(\tau )$ error bound. In addition, we show $S_2$ is uniformly convergent with $1/2$ order rate for general time step size $\tau$ and uniformly convergent with $3/2$ order rate for nonresonant time step size.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we apply semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (SLDG) methods for linear hyperbolic equations in one space dimension and analyze the error between the numerical and exact solutions under the $L^2$-norm. In all the previous works, the theoretical analysis of the SLDG method would suggest a suboptimal convergence rate due to the error accumulation over time steps. However, numerical experiments demonstrate an optimal convergence rate and, if the terminal time is large, a superconvergence rate. In this paper, we will prove optimal convergence and optimal superconvergence rates. There are three main difficulties: 1. The error analysis on overlapping meshes. Due to the nature of the semi-Lagrangian time discretization, we need to introduce the background Eulerian mesh and the shifted mesh. The two meshes are staggered, and it is not easy to construct local projections and to handle the error accumulation during time evolution. 2. The superconvergence of time-dependent terms under the $L^2$-norm. The error of the numerical and exact solutions can be divided into two parts, the projection error and the time-dependent superconvergence term. The projection strongly depends on the superconvergence rates. Therefore, we need to construct a sequence of projections and gradually improve the superconvergence rates. 3. The stopping criterion of the sequence of projections. The sequence of projections are basically of the same form. We need to show that the projections exist up to some certain order since the superconvergence rate cannot be infinity. Hence, we will seek some ‚Äúhidden‚Äù condition for the existence of the projections. In this paper, we will solve all the three difficulties and construct several local projections to prove the optimal convergence and superconvergence rates. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method using generalized numerical fluxes for linearized Korteweg‚Äìde Vries equations. In particular, since the dispersion term dominates, we are able to choose a downwind-biased flux in possession of the anti-dissipation property for the convection term to compensate the numerical dissipation of the dispersion term. This is beneficial to obtain a lower growth of the error and to accurately capture the exact solution without phase errors for long time simulations, when compared with traditional upwind and alternating fluxes. By establishing relations of three different numerical viscosity coefficients, we first show a uniform stability for the auxiliary variables and the prime variable as well as its time derivative. Moreover, the numerical initial condition is suitably chosen, which is the LDG approximation with the same fluxes to a steady‚Äìstate equation. Finally, optimal error estimates are obtained by virtue of generalized Gauss‚ÄìRadau projections. Numerical experiments are given to verify the theoretical results.},

The preconditioner is based on a coarse space and a non-overlapping partition of the computational domain where local solvers are applied in parallel. In particular, the coarse space can potentially be chosen to be non-embedded with respect to the finer space; indeed it can be obtained from the fine grid by employing agglomeration and edge coarsening techniques. We investigate the dependence of the condition number of the preconditioned system with respect to the diffusion coefficient and the discretization parameters, i.e., the mesh size and the polynomial degree of the fine and coarse spaces. Numerical examples are presented which confirm the theoretical bounds.},

In this paper, we show that any finite polynomial set $\mathcal {P}$ can be decomposed algorithmically into finitely many (strong) normal characteristic pairs with associated zero relations, which provide representations for the zero set of $\mathcal {P}$ in terms of those of Gr√∂bner bases and those of triangular sets. The algorithm we propose for the decomposition makes use of the inherent connection between Ritt characteristic sets and lexicographic Gr√∂bner bases and is based essentially on the structural properties and the computation of lexicographic Gr√∂bner bases. Several nice properties about the decomposition and the resulting (strong) normal characteristic pairs, in particular relationships between the Gr√∂bner basis and the triangular set in each pair, are established. Examples are given to illustrate the algorithm and some of the properties.},

The correctness of this algorithm is unconditional, but our analysis of its running time depends on two reasonable but unproven conjectures. We are unaware of any previous complexity results for this problem beyond the use of a prime sieve.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to study a majorized alternating direction method of multipliers with indefinite proximal terms (iPADMM) for convex composite optimization problems. We show that the majorized iPADMM for 2-block convex optimization problems converges globally under weaker conditions than those used in the literature and exhibits a linear convergence rate under a local error bound condition. Based on these, we establish the linear rate convergence results for a symmetric Gauss-Seidel based majorized iPADMM, which is designed for multiblock composite convex optimization problems. Moreover, we apply the majorized iPADMM to solve different types of regularized logistic regression problems. The numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the majorized iPADMM and also illustrate the effectiveness of the introduced indefinite proximal terms.},

In particular, we consider the model problem discretized by Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RK-DG) methods and design LTS algorithms based on the strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) schemes, that allow spatially variable time step sizes to be used for time integration in different regions of the computational domain. The proposed algorithms are of predictor-corrector-type, in which the interface information along the time direction is first predicted based on the SSP-RK approximations and Taylor expansions, and then the fluxes over the region of the interface are corrected to conserve mass exactly at each time step. Following the proposed framework, we detail the corresponding LTS schemes with accuracy up to the fourth order, and prove their conservation property and nonlinear stability for the scalar conservation laws. Numerical experiments are also presented to demonstrate excellent performance of the proposed LTS algorithms.},

By using the projection we recover the error estimates of HDG+ for steady-state and time-harmonic elasticity in a simpler analysis.

We discretize the this problem by the finite element method by constructing a family of polygonal or polyhedral domains $\{ \Omega _h \}_h$ that approximate the original domain $\Omega$. The aim of this study is to derive the smoothing property for the discrete parabolic semigroup and the maximal regularity for the discrete elliptic operator. The main difficulty is the effect of the boundary-skin (symmetric difference) $\Omega \bigtriangleup \Omega _h$.

  abstract     = {We propose a new approach to the numerical solution of radiative transfer equations with certified a posteriori error bounds for the $L_2$ norm. A key role is played by stable Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin -type variational formulations of parametric transport equations and corresponding radiative transfer equations. This allows us to formulate an iteration in a suitable, infinite-dimensional function space that is guaranteed to converge with a fixed error reduction per step. The numerical scheme is then based on approximately realizing this iteration within dynamically updated accuracy tolerances that still ensure convergence to the exact solution. To advance this iteration two operations need to be performed within suitably tightened accuracy tolerances. First, the global scattering operator needs to be approximately applied to the current iterate within a tolerance comparable to the current accuracy level. Second, parameter dependent linear transport equations need to be solved, again at the required accuracy of the iteration. To ensure that the stage dependent error tolerances are met, one has to employ rigorous a posteriori error bounds which, in our case, rest on a Discontinuous Petrov‚ÄìGalerkin (DPG) scheme. These a posteriori bounds are not only crucial for guaranteeing the convergence of the perturbed iteration but are also used to generate adapted parameter dependent spatial meshes. This turns out to significantly reduce overall computational complexity. Since the global operator is only applied, we avoid the need to solve linear systems with densely populated matrices. Moreover, the approximate application of the global scatterer is accelerated through low-rank approximation and matrix compression techniques. The theoretical findings are illustrated and complemented by numerical experiments with non-trivial scattering kernels.},

Relying on the classical backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) representation of PDEs, our algorithms estimate simultaneously the solution and its gradient by deep neural networks. These approximations are performed at each time step from the minimization of loss functions defined recursively by backward induction. The methodology is extended to variational inequalities arising in optimal stopping problems. We analyze the convergence of the deep learning schemes and provide error estimates in terms of the universal approximation of neural networks. Numerical results show that our algorithms give very good results till dimension 50 (and certainly above), for both PDEs and variational inequalities problems. For the PDEs resolution, our results are very similar to those obtained by the recent method in [Commun. Math. Stat. 5 (2017), pp. 349‚Äì380] when the latter converges to the right solution or does not diverge. Numerical tests indicate that the proposed methods are not stuck in poor local minima as it can be the case with the algorithm designed in the work previously mentioned, and no divergence is experienced. The only limitation seems to be due to the inability of the considered deep neural networks to represent a solution with a too complex structure in high dimension.},

  abstract     = {We study how the torsion of elliptic curves over number fields grows upon base change, and in particular prove various necessary conditions for torsion growth. For a number field $F$, we show that for a large set of number fields $L$, whose Galois group of their normal closure over $F$ has certain properties, it will hold that $E(L)_{\operatorname {tors}}=E(F)_{\operatorname {tors}}$ for all elliptic curves $E$ defined over $F$. Our methods turn out to be particularly useful in studying the possible torsion groups $E(K)_{\operatorname {tors}}$, where $K$ is a number field and $E$ is a base change of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb {Q}$. Suppose that $E$ is a base change of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb {Q}$ for the remainder of the abstract. We prove that $E(K)_{\operatorname {tors}}=E(\mathbb {Q})_{\operatorname {tors}}$ for all elliptic curves $E$ defined over $\mathbb {Q}$ and all number fields $K$ of degree $d$, where $d$ is not divisible by a prime $\leq 7$. Using this fact, we determine all the possible torsion groups $E(K)_{\operatorname {tors}}$ over number fields $K$ of prime degree $p\geq 7$. We determine all the possible degrees of $[\mathbb {Q}(P):\mathbb {Q}]$, where $P$ is a point of prime order $p$ for all $p$ such that $p\not \equiv 8 \pmod 9$ or $\left ( \frac {-D}{p}\right )=1$ for any $D\in \{1,2,7,11,19,43,67,163\}$; this is true for a set of density $\frac {1535}{1536}$ of all primes and in particular for all $p&lt;3167$. Using this result, we determine all the possible prime orders of a point $P\in E(K)_{\operatorname {tors}}$, where $[K:\mathbb {Q}]=d$ for all $d\leq 3342296$. Finally, we determine all the possible groups $E(K)_{\operatorname {tors}}$, where $K$ is a quartic number field and $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb {Q}$ and show that no quartic sporadic point on a modular curve $X_1(m,n)$ comes from an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb {Q}$.},

Based on the equivalence, a line-search primal-dual interior-point relaxation method for nonlinear programs is presented. Our method does not require any primal or dual iterates to be interior-points, which has similarity to some warmstarting interior-point methods and is different from most of the globally convergent interior-point methods in the literature. A new logarithmic barrier penalty function dependent on both primal and dual variables is used to prompt the global convergence of the method, where the penalty parameter is adaptively updated. Without assuming any regularity condition, it is proved that our method will either terminate at an approximate KKT point of the original problem, an approximate infeasible stationary point, or an approximate singular stationary point of the original problem. Some preliminary numerical results are reported, including the results for a well-posed problem for which many line-search interior-point methods were demonstrated not to be globally convergent, a feasible problem for which the LICQ and the MFCQ fail to hold at the solution and an infeasible problem, and for some standard test problems of the CUTE collection. Correspondingly, for comparison we also report the numerical results obtained by the interior-point solver IPOPT. These results show that our algorithm is not only efficient for well-posed feasible problems, but is also applicable for some feasible problems without LICQ or MFCQ and some infeasible problems.},

  abstract     = {The standard way to solve polynomial eigenvalue problems is through linearizations. The family of Fiedler linearizations, which includes the classical Frobenius companion forms, presents many interesting properties from both the theoretical and the applied point of view. These properties make the Fiedler pencils a very attractive family of linearizations to be used in the solution of polynomial eigenvalue problems. However, their numerical features for general matrix polynomials had not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, we analyze the backward error of eigenpairs and the condition number of eigenvalues of Fiedler linearizations in the solution of polynomial eigenvalue problems. We get bounds for: (a) the ratio between the backward error of an eigenpair of the matrix polynomial and the backward error of the corresponding (computed) eigenpair of the linearization, and (b) the ratio between the condition number of an eigenvalue in the linearization and the condition number of the same eigenvalue in the matrix polynomial. A key quantity in these bounds is $\rho$, the ratio between the maximum norm of the coefficients of the polynomial and the minimum norm of the leading and trailing coefficient. If the matrix polynomial is well scaled (i. e., all its coefficients have a similar norm, which implies $\rho \approx 1$), then solving the Polynomial Eigenvalue Problem with any Fiedler linearization will give a good performance from the point of view of backward error and conditioning. In the more general case of badly scaled matrix polynomials, dividing the coefficients of the polynomial by the maximum norm of its coefficients allows us to get better bounds. In particular, after this scaling, the ratio between the eigenvalue condition number in any two Fiedler linearizations is bounded by a quantity that depends only on the size and the degree of the polynomial. We also analyze the effect of parameter scaling in these linearizations, which improves significantly the backward error and conditioning in some cases where $\rho$ is large. Several numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical results.},

In this restrictive setting, we propose a simplified version of the Least-Squares Pad√© approximation technique studied in [ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal. 52 (2018), pp. 1261‚Äì1284] following [J. Approx. Theory 95 (1998), pp. 203‚Äì2124]. In particular, the estimation of the poles of the target function reduces to a low-dimensional eigenproblem for a Gramian matrix, allowing for a robust and efficient numerical implementation (hence the ‚Äúfast‚Äù in the name). Moreover, we prove several theoretical results that improve and extend those in [ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal. 52 (2018), pp. 1261‚Äì1284], including the exponential decay of the error in the approximation of the poles, and the convergence in measure of the approximant to the target function. The latter result extends the classical one for scalar Pad√© approximation to our functional framework.

The trapezoidal rule is the chosen integration method for the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, due to its well-known fast convergence properties when applied to analytic functions. Error estimates are provided as well as careful indications about the choice of several involved parameters. The method selects the elliptic arc in the integration contour by an algorithmic strategy based on the computation of pseudospectral level sets of the discretized differential operator. In this sense the method is general and can be applied to any linear convection-diffusion equation without knowing any a priori information about its pseudospectral geometry. Numerical experiments performed on the Black‚ÄìScholes ($1D$) and Heston ($2D$) equations show that the method is competitive with other contour integral methods available in the literature.},

Comp. 84 (2015), 629‚Äì651]. In the current paper, we extend these results to the higher dimensional setting. Our framework with a deterministic scheme provides approximation of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, their spatial derivatives and the backward characteristic curves at the same time, within an arbitrary time interval. The proof is based on stochastic calculus of variations with random walks, a priori boundedness of minimizers of the variational problems that verifies a CFL type stability condition, and the law of large numbers for random walks under the hyperbolic scaling limit. Convergence of approximation and the rate of convergence are obtained in terms of probability theory. The idea is reminiscent of the stochastic and variational approach to the vanishing viscosity method introduced in [Fleming, J. Differ. Eqs 5 (1969) 515‚Äì530].},

Solutions to the fully discrete equations are entropy dissipating, mass conserving, and respect the finite speed of propagation of support. First, we give a proof of $\Gamma$-convergence of the infinite chain of JKO steps in the joint limit of infinitely refined spatial discretization and vanishing entropic regularization. The singularity of the cost function makes the construction of the recovery sequence significantly more difficult than in the $L^p$-Wasserstein case. Second, we define a practical numerical method by combining the JKO time discretization with a ‚Äúlight speed‚Äù solver for the spatially discrete minimization problem using Dykstra‚Äôs algorithm, and demonstrate its efficiency in a series of experiments.},

  abstract     = {We describe an algorithm for the exhaustive generation of non-isomorphic graphs with a given number $k \ge 0$ of hamiltonian cycles, which is especially efficient for small $k$. Our main findings, combining applications of this algorithm and existing algorithms with new theoretical results, revolve around graphs containing exactly one hamiltonian cycle (1H) or exactly three hamiltonian cycles (3H). Motivated by a classic result of Smith and recent work of Royle, we show that there exist nearly cubic 1H graphs of order $n$ iff $n \ge 18$ is even. This gives the strongest form of a theorem of Entringer and Swart, and sheds light on a question of Fleischner originally settled by Seamone. We prove equivalent formulations of the conjecture of Bondy and Jackson that every planar 1H graph contains two vertices of degree 2, verify it up to order 16, and show that its toric analogue does not hold. We treat Thomassen‚Äôs conjecture that every hamiltonian graph of minimum degree at least $3$ contains an edge such that both its removal and its contraction yield hamiltonian graphs. We also verify up to order 21 the conjecture of Sheehan that there is no 4-regular 1H graph. Extending work of Schwenk, we describe all orders for which cubic 3H triangle-free graphs exist. We verify up to order $48$ Cantoni‚Äôs conjecture that every planar cubic 3H graph contains a triangle, and show that there exist infinitely many planar cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with exactly four hamiltonian cycles, thereby answering a question of Chia and Thomassen. Finally, complementing work of Sheehan on 1H graphs of maximum size, we determine the maximum size of graphs containing exactly one hamiltonian path and give, for every order $n$, the exact number of such graphs on $n$ vertices and of maximum size.},

Computing symbolically roots of the original polynomial and applying facial reduction techniques, we can solve the problem algebraically or restrict to a subspace where the problem becomes strictly feasible and a numerical approximation can be rounded to an exact solution. Our motivation for studying this problem is to determine when a rational polynomial that is a sum of squares of polynomials with real coefficients can be written as sum of squares of polynomials with rational coefficients. Applying our new strategy we can answer this question for some previously unknown cases. We first prove that if $f$ is the sum of two squares with coefficients in an algebraic extension of $\mathbb {Q}$ of odd degree, then it can always be decomposed as a rational SOS. For the case of more than two polynomials we provide an example of an irreducible polynomial that is the sum of three squares with coefficients in $\mathbb {Q}(\sqrt [3]{2})$ that cannot be decomposed as a rational SOS.},

First, we show that if the matrix inducing the M√∂bius transformation is well-conditioned, then such transformation approximately preserves the eigenvalue condition numbers and backward errors when they are defined with respect to perturbations of the matrix polynomial which are small relative to the norm of the whole polynomial. However, if the perturbations in each coefficient of the matrix polynomial are small relative to the norm of that coefficient, then the corresponding eigenvalue condition numbers and backward errors are preserved approximately by the M√∂bius transformations induced by well-conditioned matrices only if a penalty factor, depending on the norms of those matrix coefficients, is moderate.

  abstract     = {There is an increasing literature on random non-self-adjoint infinite matrices with motivations ranging from condensed matter physics to neural networks. Many of these operators fall into the class of ‚Äúpseudoergodic‚Äù operators, which allows the elimination of probabilistic arguments when studying spectral properties. Parallel to this is the increased awareness that spectral properties of non-self-adjoint operators, in particular stability, may be better captured via the notion of pseudospectra as opposed to spectra. Although it is well known that the finite section method applied to these matrices does not converge to the spectrum, it is often found in practice that the pseudospectrum behaves better with appropriate boundary conditions. We make this precise by giving a simple proof that the finite section method with periodic boundary conditions converges to the pseudospectrum of the full operator. Our results hold in any dimension (not just for banded bi-infinite matrices) and can be considered as a generalisation of the well-known classical result for banded Laurent operators and their circulant approximations. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate a convergent algorithm for the pseudospectrum, including cases where periodic boundary conditions converge faster than the method of uneven sections. Finally, we show that the result carries over to pseudoergodic operators acting on $l^p$ spaces for $p\in [1,\infty ]$.},

Moreover, we study the sharpness of this estimate in examples.},

Besides the cost of the application of the latter discretized operator, the other cost of the preconditioner scales linearly with the number of mesh cells. Compared to earlier proposals, the preconditioner has the following advantages: It does not require the inverse of a non-diagonal matrix; it applies without any mildly grading assumption on the mesh; and it does not require a barycentric refinement of the mesh underlying the trial space.},

This property has not yet been proven for the standard finite element method (FEM) approximation of natural convection problems with nonhomogeneous partitioned Dirichlet boundary conditions, e.g., the differentially heated vertical wall and Rayleigh‚ÄìB√©nard problems. For these problems, only stability in time, allowing for possible exponential growth of $\| T^{n}_{h} \|$, has been proven using Gronwall‚Äôs inequality. Herein, we prove that the temperature approximation can grow at most linearly in time provided that the first mesh line in the finite element mesh is within $\mathcal {O} (Ra^{-1})$ of the nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and analyze a post-processing for continuous variational space-time discretizations of wave problems. The post-processing lifts the fully discrete approximation in time from a continuous to a continuously differentiable one. Further, it increases the order of convergence. The discretization in time is based on the Gauss‚ÄìLobatto quadrature formula which is essential for ensuring the improved convergence behavior. Error estimates of optimal order in various norms are proved. A bound of superconvergence at the discrete time nodes is included. To show the error estimates, a special approach is developed. First, error estimates for the time derivative of the post-processed solution are proved. In a second step these results are used to show the error estimates for the post-processed solution itself. The need for this approach comes through the structure of the wave equation. Stability properties of its solution preclude us from using absorption arguments for the control of certain error quantities. A further key ingredient of this work is the construction of a time-interpolate of the exact solution that is needed in an essential way. Finally, a conservation of energy property is shown for the post-processed solution which is an important feature for approximation schemes to wave equations. The error estimates are confirmed by numerical experiments.},

We show stability in the sense that the minimizers over piecewise polynomial spaces of the same degree as the data are subordinate in the broken energy norm to the minimizers over the whole broken $H^1$ and $\mathbfit {H}(\mathrm {div})$ spaces. Our proofs are constructive and yield constants independent of the polynomial degree.

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of finding stationary points of the Dirichlet energy for orthogonal matrix-valued fields. Following the Ginzburg-Landau approach, this energy is relaxed by penalizing the matrix-valued field when it does not take orthogonal matrix values. A generalization of the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) diffusion generated method is introduced that effectively finds local minimizers of this energy by iterating two steps until convergence. In the first step, as in the original method, the current matrix-valued field is evolved by the diffusion equation. In the second step, the field is pointwise reassigned to the closest orthogonal matrix, which can be computed via the singular value decomposition. We extend the Lyapunov function of Esedoglu and Otto to show that the method is non-increasing on iterates and hence, unconditionally stable. We also prove that spatially discretized iterates converge to a stationary solution in a finite number of iterations. The algorithm is implemented using the closest point method and non-uniform fast Fourier transform. We conclude with several numerical experiments on flat tori and closed surfaces, which, unsurprisingly, exhibit classical behavior from the Allen-Cahn and complex Ginzburg-Landau equations, but also new phenomena.},

We can also apply our sieve to any subinterval of $\lbrack 1,N\rbrack$ of length $\Omega \left (N^{1/3}\right )$ in time close to linear on the length of the interval. Before, such a thing was possible only for subintervals of $\lbrack 1,N\rbrack$ of length $\Omega (\sqrt {N})$. Just as in (Galway, 2000), the approach here is related to Diophantine approximation, and also has close ties to Vorono√Ø‚Äôs work on the Dirichlet divisor problem. The advantage of the method here resides in the fact that, because the method we will give is based on the sieve of Eratosthenes, we will also be able to use it to factor integers, and not just to produce lists of consecutive primes.},

In this paper, we propose a qd-type method to compute the generalized singular values of BF matrix pairs. A mechanism involving sign regularity of BF generators is provided to guarantee that there is no subtraction of like-signed numbers for the qd-type method. Consequently, all the generalized singular values are computed to high relative accuracy, independent of any conventional condition number. Error analysis and numerical experiments are presented to confirm the high relative accuracy.},

  abstract     = {We consider filtered subspace iteration for approximating a cluster of eigenvalues (and its associated eigenspace) of a (possibly unbounded) selfadjoint operator in a Hilbert space. The algorithm is motivated by a quadrature approximation of an operator-valued contour integral of the resolvent. Resolvents on infinite-dimensional spaces are discretized in computable finite-dimensional spaces before the algorithm is applied. This study focuses on how such discretizations result in errors in the eigenspace approximations computed by the algorithm. The computed eigenspace is then used to obtain approximations of the eigenvalue cluster. Bounds for the Hausdorff distance between the computed and exact eigenvalue clusters are obtained in terms of the discretization parameters within an abstract framework. A realization of the proposed approach for a model second-order elliptic operator using a standard finite element discretization of the resolvent is described. Some numerical experiments are conducted to gauge the sharpness of the theoretical estimates.},

  abstract     = {We discuss the stability theory and numerical analysis of the Helmholtz equation with variable and possibly nonsmooth or oscillatory coefficients. Using the unique continuation principle and the Fredholm alternative, we first give an existence-uniqueness result for this problem, which holds under rather general conditions on the coefficients and on the domain. Under additional assumptions, we derive estimates for the stability constant (i.e., the norm of the solution operator) in terms of the data (i.e., PDE coefficients and frequency), and we apply these estimates to obtain a new finite element error analysis for the Helmholtz equation which is valid at a high frequency and with variable wave speed. The central role played by the stability constant in this theory leads us to investigate its behaviour with respect to coefficient variation in detail. We give, via a 1D analysis, an a priori bound with the stability constant growing exponentially in the variance of the coefficients (wave speed and/or diffusion coefficient). Then, by means of a family of analytic examples (supplemented by numerical experiments), we show that this estimate is sharp.},

The algorithm and its analysis in this paper circumvent the natural norms in a div-LSFEM model problem with lowest-order conforming and mixed finite element functions and allow for a simple collective D√∂rfler marking for the first time. A refined analysis provides discrete reliability and quasi-orthogonality in the weaker norms $L^2\times H^1$ rather than $H(\operatorname {div})\times H^1$ and replaces data approximation terms by data oscillations. The optimal convergence rates then follow for the lowest-order version from the axioms of adaptivity for the newest-vertex bisection without restrictions on the initial mesh-size in any space dimension.},

Our strategy consists in improving the regularity of the associated phase field solution by use of higher-order derivatives in the Cahn-Hilliard functional as in [Burger, Esposito, and Zeppieri, Multiscale Model Simul. 13 (2015), 1354‚Äì1389]. We justify the convergence of this slightly modified version of the functional, together with other techniques that we employ to improve the numerical experiments. In particular, we are able to consider a large number of points in dimension 2. We finally present and justify an approximation method that is efficient in dimension 3, which is one of the major novelties of the paper.},
