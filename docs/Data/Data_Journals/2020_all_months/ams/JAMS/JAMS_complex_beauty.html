  abstract     = {We study Bernoulli bond percolation on nonunimodular quasi-transitive graphs, and more generally graphs whose automorphism group has a nonunimodular quasi-transitive subgroup. We prove that percolation on any such graph has a nonempty phase in which there are infinite light clusters, which implies the existence of a nonempty phase in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters. That is, we show that $p_c&lt;p_h \leq p_u$ for any such graph. This answers a question of Häggström, Peres, and Schonmann (1999), and verifies the nonunimodular case of a well-known conjecture of Benjamini and Schramm (1996). We also prove that the triangle condition holds at criticality on any such graph, which implies that various critical exponents exist and take their mean-field values. All our results apply, for example, to the product $T_k\times \mathbb {Z}^d$ of a $k$-regular tree with $\mathbb {Z}^d$ for $k\geq 3$ and $d \geq 1$, for which these results were previously known only for large $k$. Furthermore, our methods also enable us to establish the basic topological features of the phase diagram for anisotropic percolation on such products, in which tree edges and $\mathbb {Z}^d$ edges are given different retention probabilities. These features had only previously been established for $d=1$, $k$ large.},

  abstract     = {We give new examples of compact, negatively curved Einstein manifolds of dimension $4$. These are seemingly the first such examples which are not locally homogeneous. Our metrics are carried by a sequence of four-manifolds $(X_k)$ previously considered by Gromov and Thurston (Pinching constants for hyperbolic manifolds, Invent. Math. 89 (1987), no. 1, 1–12). The construction begins with a certain sequence $(M_k)$ of hyperbolic four-manifolds, each containing a totally geodesic surface $\Sigma _k$ which is nullhomologous and whose normal injectivity radius tends to infinity with $k$. For a fixed choice of natural number $l$, we consider the $l$-fold cover $X_k \to M_k$ branched along $\Sigma _k$. We prove that for any choice of $l$ and all large enough $k$ (depending on $l$), $X_k$ carries an Einstein metric of negative sectional curvature. The first step in the proof is to find an approximate Einstein metric on $X_k$, which is done by interpolating between a model Einstein metric near the branch locus and the pull-back of the hyperbolic metric from $M_k$. The second step in the proof is to perturb this to a genuine solution to Einstein’s equations, by a parameter dependent version of the inverse function theorem. The analysis relies on a delicate bootstrap procedure based on $L^2$ coercivity estimates.},

This confirms a prediction of Eskin-Zorich and generalizes some of the recent results of Chen-Möller-Zagier and Sauvaget, who established these limiting statements in the special cases $m = 1^{2g - 2}$ and $m = (2g - 2)$, respectively. We also include an appendix by Anton Zorich that uses our main result to deduce the large genus asymptotics for Siegel-Veech constants that count certain types of saddle connections.},

Our proof avoids the decomposition and support theorem, instead the argument is based on results for $p$-adic integration on coarse moduli spaces of Deligne-Mumford stacks. Along the way we establish a description of the inertia stack of the (anisotropic) moduli stack of $G$-Higgs bundles in terms of endoscopic data, and extend duality for generic Hitchin fibres of Langlands dual group schemes to the quasi-split case.},

These variations of GIT quotient are examples of more complicated wall crossings than the balanced wall crossings studied in recent work on derived categories and variation of GIT quotients. Our construction is algorithmic and quite explicit, allowing us to: 1) describe a tilting vector bundle which generates the derived category of such a GIT quotient, 2) provide a combinatorial basis for the $K$-theory of the GIT quotient in terms of the representation theory of $G$, and 3) show that our derived equivalences satisfy certain relations, leading to a representation of the fundamental groupoid of a “Kähler moduli space” on the derived category of such a GIT quotient. Finally, we use graded categories of singularities to construct derived equivalences between all Deligne–Mumford hyperkähler quotients of a symplectic linear representation of a reductive group (at the zero fiber of the algebraic moment map and subject to a certain genericity hypothesis on the representation), and we likewise construct actions of the fundamental groupoid of the corresponding Kähler moduli space.},

We exhibit in this paper a new scenario corresponding to the first example of a strongly anisotropic blow-up bubble: the solution displays a completely different behaviour depending on the considered direction in space. A fundamental step of the analysis is to solve the reconnection problem in order to produce finite energy solutions which is the heart of the matter. The corresponding anistropic mechanism is expected to be of fundamental importance in other settings in particular in fluid mechanics. The proof relies on a new functional framework for the construction and stabilisation of type II bubbles in the parabolic setting using energy estimates only, and allows us to exhibit new unexpected blow-up speeds.},

  abstract     = {How many operations do we need on average to compute an approximate root of a random Gaussian polynomial system? Beyond Smale’s 17th problem that asked whether a polynomial bound is possible, we prove a quasi-optimal bound $\text {(input size)}^{1+o(1)}$. This improves upon the previously known $\text {(input size)}^{\frac 32 +o(1)}$ bound. The new algorithm relies on numerical continuation along rigid continuation paths . The central idea is to consider rigid motions of the equations rather than line segments in the linear space of all polynomial systems. This leads to a better average condition number and allows for bigger steps. We show that on average, we can compute one approximate root of a random Gaussian polynomial system of $n$ equations of degree at most $D$ in $n+1$ homogeneous variables with $O(n^4 D^2)$ continuation steps. This is a decisive improvement over previous bounds that prove no better than $\sqrt {2}^{\min (n, D)}$ continuation steps on average.},

  abstract     = {The Sinai billiard map $T$ on the two-torus, i.e., the periodic Lorentz gas, is a discontinuous map. Assuming finite horizon, we propose a definition $h_*$ for the topological entropy of $T$. We prove that $h_*$ is not smaller than the value given by the variational principle, and that it is equal to the definitions of Bowen using spanning or separating sets. Under a mild condition of sparse recurrence to the singularities, we get more: First, using a transfer operator acting on a space of anisotropic distributions, we construct an invariant probability measure $\mu _*$ of maximal entropy for $T$ (i.e., $h_{\mu _*}(T)=h_*$), we show that $\mu _*$ has full support and is Bernoulli, and we prove that $\mu _*$ is the unique measure of maximal entropy and that it is different from the smooth invariant measure except if all nongrazing periodic orbits have multiplier equal to $h_*$. Second, $h_*$ is equal to the Bowen–Pesin–Pitskel topological entropy of the restriction of $T$ to a noncompact domain of continuity. Last, applying results of Lima and Matheus, as upgraded by Buzzi, the map $T$ has at least $C e^{nh_*}$ periodic points of period $n$ for all $n \in \mathbb {N}$.},

When $R$ contains a field, this is already known. When $R$ is of mixed characteristic, our strategy of proof is reminiscent of G. Dietz’s refined treatment of weak functoriality of Cohen-Macaulay algebras in characteristic $p$; in fact, developing a “tilting argument” due to K.

We give a negative answer to this question by showing that there are non-local games which have perfect commuting-operator strategies, but do not have perfect tensor-product strategies. The weak Tsirelson problem, which is known to be equivalent to the Connes embedding problem, remains open. The examples we construct are instances of (binary) linear system games. For such games, previous results state that the existence of perfect strategies is controlled by the solution group of the linear system. Our main result is that every finitely-presented group embeds in some solution group. As an additional consequence, we show that the problem of determining whether a linear system game has a perfect commuting-operator strategy is undecidable.},
