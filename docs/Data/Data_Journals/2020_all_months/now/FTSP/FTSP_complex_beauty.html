  abstract     = {Speech enhancement is a core problem in audio signal processing with commercial applications in devices as diverse as mobile phones, conference call systems, smart assistants, and hearing aids. An essential component in the design of speech enhancement algorithms is acoustic source localization. Speaker localization is also directly applicable to many other audio related tasks, e.g., automated camera steering, teleconferencing systems, and robot audition.From a signal processing perspective, speaker localization is the task of mapping multichannel speech signals to 3-D source coordinates. To obtain viable solutions for this mapping, an accurate description of the source wave propagation captured by the respective acoustic channel is required. In fact, the acoustic channels can be considered as the spatial characterizing the positions of each of the sources in a reverberant enclosure. These fingerprints represent complex reflection patterns stemming from the surfaces and objects characterizing the enclosure. Hence, they are usually modelled by a very large number of coefficients, resulting in an intricate high-dimensional representation.We claim that in static acoustic environments, despite the high dimensional representation, the difference between acoustic channels can be attributed mainly to changes in the source position. Thus, the true intrinsic dimensionality of the variations of the acoustic channels are significantly smaller than the number of variables commonly used to represent them; that is, the acoustic channels pertain to a low-dimensional manifold that can be inferred from data using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. A comprehensive experimental study carried out in a real-life acoustic environment demonstrates the validity of the proposed manifold-based paradigm.Motivated by this result, several high-performance localization and tracking methods were developed by harnessing novel mathematical tools for learning over manifolds, including diffusion maps, semi-supervised learning, optimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and Gaussian process inference. We present two localization algorithms that were designed for a single microphone array of two microphones. These algorithms were extended to several distributed arrays by merging the information of the different manifolds associated with each array. Tracking a moving source was also addressed by a data-driven propagation model relating movements on the abstract manifold to the actual source displacements. This data-driven propagation model was combined with a classical localization approach, in a hybrid algorithm that ties together the two worlds of classical and data-driven localization, while gaining the benefits of both. We show that the proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art localization methods, and obtain high accuracy in challenging noisy and reverberant environments.},

  abstract     = {Clock synchronization is a mechanism for providing a standard time to various devices across a network. This monograph provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments for clock synchronization protocols built on two-way message exchanges. Several clock synchronization protocols are available in the literature for distributing time from high-cost, high-stability clocks (termed masters) to low-cost, low-stability clocks (termed slaves) via an interconnecting network. A number of clock synchronization protocols are built on two-way message exchanges. These include the timing protocol for sensor networks (TPSN), lightweight time synchronization (LTS) protocol, tiny-sync and mini-sync, network time protocol (NTP) and the IEEE 1588 precision time protocol (PTP). The messages traveling between the master and slave nodes can encounter several intermediate switches and routers, accumulating delays at each node. The main factors contributing to the overall delay are the fixed propagation and processing delays at the intermediate nodes along the network path between the master and slave, as well as the stochastic queuing delays at each such node. Popular probability density function (pdf) models for modeling the stochastic delays include Gaussian, exponential, gamma, Weibull, and log-normal. Although these pdf models for the stochastic queuing delays apply to several scenarios, they might not be suitable in specific scenarios such as cellular base station synchronization using mobile backhaul networks and IEEE 1588 in 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks. Further, there could be possibly unknown asymmetries between the fixed path delays in the forward master-to-slave path and the reverse slave-to-master path. These unknown asymmetries could arise from various sources, including delay attacks or incorrect modeling. In this monograph, we present recent developments for clock synchronization protocols built on the two-way message exchange. After an introduction to the basic concepts and mathematical models, the optimum estimators are presented for estimating the clock skew and offset that are applicable for any pdf model of the stochastic delays. Robust algorithms that can also handle unknown path asymmetries are presented next. The focus is on techniques that consider practical, relevant measurement models in order to guide the reader from physical observations to the actual synchronization of the clocks at the slave and master.},
