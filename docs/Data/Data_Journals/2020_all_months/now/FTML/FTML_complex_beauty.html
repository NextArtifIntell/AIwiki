  abstract     = {Graph-structured data are an integral part of many application domains, including chemoinformatics, computational biology, neuroimaging, and social network analysis. Over the last two decades, numerous graph kernels, i.e. kernel functions between graphs, have been proposed to solve the problem of assessing the similarity between graphs, thereby making it possible to perform predictions in both classification and regression settings. This manuscript provides a review of existing graph kernels, their applications, software plus data resources, and an empirical comparison of state-of-the-art graph kernels.},

  abstract     = {Modern data analytics applications on graphs often operate on domains where graph topology is not known a priori, and hence its determination becomes part of the problem definition, rather than serving as prior knowledge which aids the problem solution. Part III of this monograph starts by a comprehensive account of ways to learn the pertinent graph topology, ranging from the simplest case where the physics of the problem already suggest a possible graph structure, through to general cases where the graph structure is to be learned from the data observed on a graph. A particular emphasis is placed on the use of standard “relationship measures” in this context, including the correlation and precision matrices, together with the ways to combine these with the available prior knowledge and structural conditions, such as the smoothness of the graph signals or sparsity of graph connections. Next, for learning sparse graphs (that is, graphs with a small number of edges), the utility of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, known as LASSO is addressed, along with its graph specific variant, the graphical LASSO. For completeness, both variants of LASSO are derived in an intuitive way, starting from basic principles. An in-depth elaboration of the graph topology learning paradigm is provided through examples on physically well defined graphs, such as electric circuits, linear heat transfer, social and computer networks, and springmass systems. We also review main trends in graph neural networks (GNN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) from the perspective of graph signal filtering. Particular insight is given to the role of diffusion processes over graphs, to show that GCNs can be understood from the graph diffusion perspective. Given the largely heuristic nature of the existing GCNs, their treatment through graph diffusion processes may also serve as a basis for new designs of GCNs. Tensor representation of lattice-structured graphs is next considered, and it is shown that tensors (multidimensional data arrays) can be treated a special class of graph signals, whereby the graph vertices reside on a high-dimensional regular lattice structure. The concept of graph tensor networks then provides a unifying framework for learning on irregular domains. This part of monograph concludes with an in-dept account of emerging applications in financial data processing and underground transportation network modeling. By means of portfolio cuts of an asset graph, we show how domain knowledge can be meaningfully incorporated into investment analysis. In the underground transportation example, we demonstrate how graph theory can be used to identify those stations in the London underground network which have the greatest influence on the functionality of the traffic, and proceed, in an innovative way, to assess the impact of a station closure on service levels across the city.},

  abstract     = {The area of Data Analytics on graphs deals with information processing of data acquired on irregular but structured graph domains. The focus of Part I of this monograph has been on both the fundamental and higher-order graph properties, graph topologies, and spectral representations of graphs. Part I also establishes rigorous frameworks for vertex clustering and graph segmentation, and illustrates the power of graphs in various data association tasks. Part II embarks on these concepts to address the algorithmic and practical issues related to data/signal processing on graphs, with the focus on the analysis and estimation of both deterministic and random data on graphs. The fundamental ideas related to graph signals are introduced through a simple and intuitive, yet general enough case study of multisensor temperature field estimation. The concept of systems on graph is defined using graph signal shift operators, which generalize the corresponding principles from traditional learning systems. At the core of the spectral domain representation of graph signals and systems is the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT), defined based on the eigendecomposition of both the adjacency matrix and the graph Laplacian. Spectral domain representations are then used as the basis to introduce graph signal filtering concepts and address their design, including Chebyshev series polynomial approximation. Ideas related to the sampling of graph signals, and in particular the challenging topic of data dimensionality reduction through graph subsampling, are presented and further linked with compressive sensing. The principles of time-varying signals on graphs and basic definitions related to random graph signals are next reviewed. Localized graph signal analysis in the joint vertex-spectral domain is referred to as the vertex-frequency analysis, since it can be considered as an extension of classical time-frequency analysis to the graph serving as signal domain. Important aspects of the local graph Fourier transform (LGFT) are covered, together with its various forms including the graph spectral and vertex domain windows and the inversion conditions and relations. A link between the LGFT with a varying spectral window and the spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT) is also established. Realizations of the LGFT and SGWT using polynomial (Chebyshev) approximations of the spectral functions are further considered and supported by examples. Finally, energy versions of the vertex-frequency representations are introduced, along with their relations with classical timefrequency analysis, including a vertex-frequency distribution that can satisfy the marginal properties. The material is supported by illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {The area of Data Analytics on graphs promises a paradigm shift, as we approach information processing of new classes of data which are typically acquired on irregular but structured domains (such as social networks, various ad-hoc sensor networks). Yet, despite the long history of Graph Theory, current approaches tend to focus on aspects of optimisation of graphs themselves rather than on eliciting strategies relevant to the objective application of the graph paradigm, such as detection, estimation, statistical and probabilistic inference, clustering and separation from signals and data acquired on graphs. In order to bridge this gap, we first revisit graph topologies from a Data Analytics point of view, to establish a taxonomy of graph networks through a linear algebraic formalism of graph topology (vertices, connections, directivity). This serves as a basis for spectral analysis of graphs, whereby the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of graph Laplacian and adjacency matrices are shown to convey physical meaning related to both graph topology and higher-order graph properties, such as cuts, walks, paths, and neighborhoods. Through a number of carefully chosen examples, we demonstrate that the isomorphic nature of graphs enables both the basic properties of data observed on graphs and their descriptors (features) to be preserved throughout the data analytics process, even in the case of reordering of graph vertices, where classical approaches fail. Next, to illustrate the richness and flexibility of estimation strategies performed on graph signals, spectral analysis of graphs is introduced through eigenanalysis of mathematical descriptors of graphs and in a generic way. Finally, benefiting from enhanced degrees of freedom associated with graph representations, a framework for vertex clustering and graph segmentation is established based on graph spectral representation (eigenanalysis) which demonstrates the power of graphs in various data association tasks, from image clustering and segmentation trough to low-dimensional manifold representation. The supporting examples demonstrate the promise of Graph Data Analytics in modeling structural and functional/semantic inferences. At the same time, Part I serves as a basis for Part II and Part III which deal with theory, methods and applications of processing Data on Graphs and Graph Topology Learning from data.},
