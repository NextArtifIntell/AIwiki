  abstract     = {Memetic computing is a blooming research area, which treats memes as the fundamental building blocks of information transfer. Evolutionary multitasking is an emerging topic in memetic computation, which applies evolutionary algorithm to optimize multiple tasks at a time. A famous class of algorithms for evolutionary multitasking is the multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA). Nevertheless, current MFEAs only consider problems with small number of tasks, resulting in a lack of effective information transfer strategy. This study proposes a framework for evolutionary multitasking, called the evolution of biocoenosis through symbiosis with fitness approximation (EBSFA). The EBSFA incorporates evolution of biocoenosis through symbiosis (EBS) with fitness approximation to ameliorate the information transfer. The improvement of EBSFA is three-fold, including (1) the adaptive control of information transfer among tasks, (2) the selection of individuals from the universal offspring pool for evaluation based on fitness approximation, and (3) an ensemble method for improving the accuracy of fitness approximation through k nearest neighbors. Experimental analysis verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed EBSFA, by comparison with an advanced single-tasking method, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMAES), an illustrious multitasking optimization method, the MFEA-II, and an evolutionary many-tasking method, the EBS on a set of many-tasking benchmark problems. The results show that EBSFA can gain nice solution quality and fast convergence speed. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of the proposed components on improving the information transfer.},

The main challenge of GWO is that it is easy to fall into local optimum. Owing to the ergodicity of chaos, this paper incorporates the chaos theory into the GWO to strengthen the performance of the algorithm. Three different chaotic strategies with eleven various chaotic map functions are investigated and the most suitable one is regarded as the proposed chaotic GWO. Extensive experiments are made to compare the proposed chaotic GWO against other metaheuristics including adaptive differential evolution (JADE), cellular genetic algorithm, artificial bee colony, evolutionary strategy, biogeography-based optimization, comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization, and GWO. In addition, the proposal is also successfully applied to practical engineering problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the chaotic GWO is better than its compared metaheuristics on most of test problems and engineering optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to simultaneously solve a group of related learning tasks by leveraging the salutary knowledge memes contained in the multiple tasks to improve the generalization performance. Many prevalent approaches focus on designing a sophisticated cost function, which integrates all the learning tasks and explores the task-task relationship in a predefined manner. Different from previous approaches, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-task Gradient Descent (MGD) framework, which improves the generalization performance of multiple tasks through knowledge transfer. The uniqueness of MGD lies in assuming individual task-specific learning objectives at the start, but with the cost functions implicitly changing during the course of parameter optimization based on task-task relationships. Specifically, MGD optimizes the individual cost function of each task using a reformative gradient descent iteration, where relations to other tasks are facilitated through effectively transferring parameter values (serving as the computational representations of memes) from other tasks. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed framework is convergent under any appropriate transfer mechanism. Compared with existing MTL approaches, MGD provides a novel easy-to-implement framework for MTL, which can mitigate negative transfer in the learning procedure by asymmetric transfer. The proposed MGD has been compared with both classical and state-of-the-art approaches on multiple MTL datasets. The competitive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

There has been resurgent interest recently in analyzing relevant methods in terms of singular value gap dependence. Particularly, when the gap vanishes, the convergence of k-SVD is considered to be capped by a gap-free sub-linear rate. We argue in this work both theoretically and empirically that this is not necessarily the case, refreshing our understanding on this significant problem. Specifically, we leverage the recently proposed structured gap in a careful analysis to establish a unified linear convergence of k-SVD to one of the ground-truth solutions, regardless of what target matrix and how large target rank k are given.

To be specific, the proposed algorithm employs particle swarm optimization as the optimizer and creates two cooperative populations focusing on finding compounds and their proportions, respectively. Moreover, a comprehensive cooperative strategy is designed to improve the solution diversity and thus enhance the search performance.

The in silico experiments also showed that the optimal combination therapy is very much dependent on a patient’s molecular profile. In this work, we employ evolutionary algorithms for designing optimal combination therapy tailored to the patient’s tumour microenvironment. Experiments were performed using a state-of-the-art glioma microenvironment model, capable of imitating many characteristics of human glioma development, and many virtual patient profiles.

Despite existing success of GP on symbolic regression, the accuracy and efficiency of GP can still be improved especially on complicated symbolic regression problems, enabling GP to be applied to more fields. This paper proposes a novel memetic GP framework to improve the accuracy and search efficiency of GP on complicated symbolic regression problems. The proposed framework consists of two components: feature construction and feature combination. The first component focuses on constructing diverse features. The second component aims to filter redundant features and linearly combines these independent features. The first component (feature construction) focuses on constructing polynomial features derived from polynomial functions, and evolves features by a GP solver. In addition, a gradient-based nonlinear least squares algorithm named Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) is embedded in the second component (feature combination) to locally adjust the weights of independent features. A filtering mechanism is put forward to discard redundant features in the second component. Hence, the polynomial features and evolved features can work together in the framework to improve the performance of GP. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework offers enhanced performance compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and search efficiency on nine benchmark regression problems and three real-world regression problems. In this study, a novel memetic genetic programming framework is proposed to improve the performance of GP on symbolic regression.

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristics are high-level methods widely used in different fields of applications. To enhance their performance, they are often combined to concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistics in order to improve the quality of solutions and/or reduce the response time. In this paper, we investigate the use of feature selection to speed-up the search process of Bee Swarm Optimisation (BSO) meta-heuristic in solving the MaxSAT problem.The general idea is to extract a subset of the most relevant features that describe an instance of a problem in order to reduce its size. We propose to translate a MaxSAT instance into a dataset following one of several representations proposed in this study, and then apply a FS technique to select the most relevant variables or clauses. Two data organizations are proposed depending on whether we want to remove variables or clauses. In addition, two data encodings can be used: binary encoding if we are only interested by the presence or not of a variable in a clause, and ternary encoding if we consider the information that it appears as a positive or negative literal. Moreover, we experiment two feature evaluation approaches: subset evaluation approach which returns the optimal subset, and individual evaluation which ranks the features and lets the user choose the number of features to remove. All possible combinations of data organization, data encoding and features evaluation approach lead to eight (08) variants of the hybrid algorithm, named FS-BSO. BSO and all the variants of FS-BSO have been applied to several instances of different benchmarks. The analysis of experimental results showed that in terms of solution quality, BSO gives the best results. However, FS-BSO algorithms achieve very good results and are statistically equivalent to BSO for some instances. In terms of execution time, all hybrid variants of FS-BSO are faster. In addition, results showed that removing clauses is slightly more advantageous in terms of solution quality whereas removing variables gives better execution times. Concerning data encoding, the results did not show any difference between the binary and ternary encodings. In this paper, we investigated the possibility to speed-up BSO meta-heuristic in solving an instance of the MaxSAT problem by extracting a priori knowledge. Feature selection has been used as a preprocessing technique in order to reduce the instance size by selecting a subset of the most relevant vaiables/clauses. Results showed that there is a strong link between the reduction rate and solution quality, and that FS-BSO offers a better quality-time trade off.},

More specifically, we enhance PSO with two modern stratified sampling techniques, i.e., Latin hyper cube sampling (LHS) and Latin hyper cube multi dimensional uniformity (LHSMDU). We propose and evaluate two novel swarm-inspired algorithms, LHS-PSO and LHSMDU-PSO, which can be used particularly to learn the model structure and parameters of complex dynamic systems efficiently. The performance of LHS-PSO and LHSMDU-PSO is further compared with the original PSO and genetic algorithm (GA). We chose real-world cancer biological model called Kinetochores to asses the learning performance of LHSMDU-PSO and LHS-PSO in comparison with GA and the original PSO.

The selection mechanism is carried out so that it does not retard the search if agents are exploring in promising areas. Simulation results show that CSO-MA has a better exploration–exploitation balance than CSO and generally outperforms CSO, which is one of the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms for optimization. We show additionally that it also generally outperforms swarm based types of algorithms and an exemplary and popular non-swarm based algorithm called Cuckoo search, without requiring a lot more CPU time. We apply CSO-MA to find a c-optimal approximate design for a high-dimensional optimal design problem when other swarm algorithms were not able to. As applications, we use the CSO-MA to search various optimal designs for a series of high-dimensional statistical models. The proposed CSO-MA algorithm is a general-purpose optimizing tool and can be directly amended to find other types of optimal designs for nonlinear models, including optimal exact designs under a convex or non-convex criterion.},

  abstract     = {The Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has emerged as an effective variant of the evolutionary algorithm. MFEA has been successfully applied to deal with various problems with many different types of solution encodings. Although clustered tree problems play an important role in real life, there haven’t been much research on exploiting the strengths of MFEA to solve these problems. One of the challenges in applying the MFEA is to build specific evolutionary operators of the MFEA algorithm. To exploit the advantages of the Cayley Codes in improving the MFEA’s performance, this paper introduces MFEA with representation scheme based on the Cayley Code to deal with the clustered tree problems. The new evolutionary operators in MFEA have two different levels. The purpose of the first level is to construct a spanning tree which connects to a vertex in each cluster, while the objective of the second one is to determine the spanning tree for each cluster. We focus on evaluating the efficiency of the new MFEA algorithm on known Cayley Codes when solving clustered tree problems. In the aspect of the execution time and the quality of the solutions found, each encoding type of the Cayley Codes is analyzed when performed on both single-task and multi-task to find the solutions of one or two different clustered tree problems respectively. In addition, we also evaluate the effect of those encodings on the convergence speed of the algorithms. Experimental results show the level of effectiveness for each encoding type and prove that the Dandelion Code outperforms the remaining encoding mechanisms when solving clustered tree problems.},

  abstract     = {Although there are many algorithms that can solve the multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) efficiently, each algorithm has its own disadvantages. The emergence of new algorithms is beneficial to make up the deficiencies of existing algorithms. Inspired by the organic matter transport process and the branch update theory of the banyan, this work proposed a new bio-inspired algorithm, named the multi-objective artificial tree (MOAT) algorithm to solve the MOPs. In MOAT, an improved crossover operator and an improved self-evolution operator are introduced to update solutions, a adaptive grid method is applied to manage the non-dominated solutions, and the strategy of variable number of branches in population is adopted to enhance the accuracy of this algorithm. Many typical test functions and seven well-known multi-objective algorithms, including MOEAD, NSGAII, MOPSO, GDE3, εMOEA, IBEA and MPSO/D, are applied to study the accuracy and efficiency of MOAT. Experimental tests show that the results of MOAT are better than those of the seven algorithms, and the performance of MOAT is demonstrated. In addition, this new algorithm is also applied to solve the MOPs of two-dimensional acoustic metamaterials (AMs). The key parameters of AMs are optimized by MOAT to mitigate impact load and reduce structural mass, and the performance of these AMs is significantly improved.},

Different from the general single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), the input weights and biases in hidden layer of ELM are generated randomly, so that it only takes a little computational overhead to train the model. However, the strategy of selecting input weights and biases at random may result in ill-conditioned problems. Aiming to optimize the conditioning of ELM, we propose an effective particle swarm heuristic algorithm called Multitask Beetle Antennae Swarm Algorithm (MBAS), which is inspired by the structures of artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm. Then, the proposed MBAS is applied for optimizing the input weights and biases of ELM to solve its ill-conditioned problems. Experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of simultaneously reducing the condition number and regression error, and achieving good generalization performance.},

  abstract     = {The factorial hidden Markov modeling framework, has been proposed in the literature as an effective approach for intermittent fault diagnosis applications. Moreover, the dynamic multiple fault diagnosis problem (DMFD) with non-ideal tests is computationally challenging. Several methodologies have been introduced for the solution of the DMFD problem, namely: the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, the deterministic simulated annealing and the block coordinate ascent. However, to the best of our knowledge, no evolutionary algorithm including analysis of DMFD characteristics has ever been attempted. This research paper, presents a probability first memetic algorithm (PFMA) for solving the DMFD combinatorial optimization problem, by considering input probability matrices. PFMA improves the performance of the genetic algorithm, with less computational cost. This is achieved by exploiting input probability information, using a local search strategy and a crossover operator. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm finds the optimal solutions on small-scale stochastic synthesis models. Additionally, high-quality solutions are obtained on medium and large-scale cases. The algorithm has been tested successfully on a real-world application. The experimental results highlight the efficiency of the genetic algorithm, following a reasonable local search strategy, towards the solution of an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem.},

The communities of edges obtained with this method naturally translate to overlapping communities of nodes. The method is based on local expansion and a specialised local search mechanism. Label propagation methods are used for initialising a multi-agent tertiary tree population structure. We use the normalised mutual information to evaluate the similarity between the known community structure in a collection of benchmark networks and the community structure detected by M-Link.

An explorative mutation “DE/seeds-to-seeds” and an exploitative mutation “DE/seeds-to-rand” are employed simultaneously in DSM-DE in the evolutionary process. A Dynamic Speciation Technique is designed to assist the two mutations in order to utilize the potential of selective portioning of critical individuals in the population. It dynamically divides the population into numbers of species whilst taking species seeds as centers. The best individuals for each species are used as base vectors in each species in the proposed mutation strategies. “DE/seeds-to-seeds” selects individuals from species seeds and current species to constitute difference vectors whereas “DE/seeds-to-rand” selects from the whole population. Thus the two mutation strategies can accelerate the convergence process without decreasing diversity of the population. Comparison results with four classic DE variants, one state-of-art DE variant and two improved non-DE variants on CEC2014, CEC2015 benchmark, and Lennard-Jones potential problem reveal that the overall performance of DSM-DE is better than that of the other seven DE algorithms. In addition, experiments also substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of two seeds-guided mutation strategies in DSM-DE.},

This paper studies how to utilize NMs for solving the 0–1 knapsack problem (0–1 KP). Two noising strategies, noising variation of objective function and noising data, are used to help NMs escape from local optima. When noising variation of objective function is used, probabilistic acceptance or deterministic acceptance is used to decide whether to accept neighbor solutions. Two decreasing strategies, arithmetical decreasing and geometrical decreasing, are used to control the change of parameter noise-rate. In total, six variants of NMs including two TAs are designed to solve the 0–1 KP. In those variants, a hybrid greedy repair operator, which combines density-based and value-based greedy drop and add operators, is designed to get better balance between intensification and diversification. Extensive experiments were performed to compare the performances of the six variants of NMs. The performances of the six variants of NMs were also compared with some state-of-the-art metaheuristics on a wide range of small size, medium size, and large size 0–1 KP instances.

  abstract     = {Memetic algorithms are techniques that orchestrate the interplay between population-based and trajectory-based algorithmic components. In particular, some memetic models can be regarded under this broad interpretation as a group of autonomous basic optimization algorithms that interact among them in a cooperative way in order to deal with a specific optimization problem, aiming to obtain better results than the algorithms that constitute it separately. Going one step beyond this traditional view of cooperative optimization algorithms, this work tackles deep meta-cooperation, namely the use of cooperative optimization algorithms in which some components can in turn be cooperative methods themselves, thus exhibiting a deep algorithmic architecture. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that such models can be considered as an efficient alternative to other traditional forms of cooperative algorithms. To validate this claim, different structural parameters, such as the communication topology between the agents, or the parameter that influences the depth of the cooperative effort (the depth of meta-cooperation), have been analyzed. To do this, a comparison with the state-of-the-art cooperative methods to solve a specific combinatorial problem, the Tool Switching Problem, has been performed. Results show that deep models are effective to solve this problem, outperforming metaheuristics proposed in the literature.},
