  abstract     = {Nowadays, children have access to Internet on a regular basis. Just like the real world, the Internet has many unsafe locations where kids may be exposed to inappropriate content in the form of obscene, aggressive, erotic or rude comments. In this work, we address the problem of detecting erotic/sexual content on text documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Following an approach based on Machine Learning techniques, we have assessed twelve models resulting from the combination of three text encoders (Bag of Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Word2vec) together with four classifiers (Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests). We evaluated these alternatives on a new created dataset extracted from public data on the Reddit Website. The best performance result was achieved by the combination of the text encoder TF-IDF and the SVM classifier with linear kernel with an accuracy of 0.97 and F-score 0.96 (precision 0.96/recall 0.95). This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect erotic content on text documents and therefore, develop filters for minors or according to user’s preferences.},

However, the ambiguity effect or cognitive ambiguity of users during the product customization process will affect the effects of the final customized product. Here, we first deconstructed the ambiguity effect into cognitive ambiguity during early decision-making and that during the decision-making process. A spatial mapping strategy that involves “text-image-symbol” and a clustering strategy were then proposed to mitigate cognitive ambiguity in the two different stages, respectively. Then, a specific application example—“Chinese vase design” was studied. Based on the proposed strategy and interactive genetic algorithm, a prototype of computer-aided design system for product modeling was developed by MATLAB software. Then, 10 users were invited to experiment at three different cases (not using the proposed strategy, using spatial mapping strategy, using spatial mapping strategy and scheme clustering strategy). The experiment results have verified that the spatial mapping strategy was efficient to solve cognitive ambiguity during early decision-making, and clustering strategy was efficient to solve cognitive ambiguity during the decision-making process.},

Improve the generalization ability of the model by expanding the scale of the training data set. Using VGG-M-BN network to train different number of vegetable image data sets, the experimental results show that the recognition accuracy decreases as the number of data sets decreases. By contrasting the activation functions, it is verified that the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is better than the traditional Sigmoid and Tanh functions in VGG-M-BN networks. The paper also verifies that the classification accuracy of VGG-M-BN network is improved due to the increase of batch_size.},

This paper presents a novel approach based on fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making tools for selecting those criteria that best represent the handball player’s performance in a match and for setting their relevance weights. Our approach consists of a fuzzy model to aggregate expert judgments. This methodology overcomes some drawbacks of classical systems, including the definition of the relevance of each criteria using linguistic labels. A preliminary evaluation analyzes handball players’ performance indicators and their application to a short tournament. Considering the obtained results, we can conclude that the proposal is relevant and provides useful insights regarding player performance in different matches. The proposed methodology has also been compared with a basic plus-minus rating methodology. This comparison illustrates the feasibility of our approach. Results suggest that plus-minus rating is not the best solution to represent the performance of specialized players who only play when their team attack or defense. Our approach demonstrates being more appropriate for sports such as handball because it includes the valuation of a full set of positive actions in defense and attack.},

Recent researches show great interest in modeling Chinese sentiment classification. However, the complexity of Chinese grammar makes the performance of the existing Chinese sentiment classification model not perform well. In order to address the above problem, we propose a sentiment classification method based on grammar rules and bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT). We first preprocess data through BERT model. Then we combine the Chinese grammar rules with Bi-gated recurrent neural network (GRU) in the form of constraints, and simulate the linguistic functions at the sentence by standardizing the output of adjacent positions. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and our findings in the experiment provide new insights for the future development of Chinese sentiment classification.},

The chemical reaction optimization (CRO) algorithm is a novel evolutionary algorithm which mimics the phenomenon of interactions among molecules in a container. The one characteristic of CRO is that the size of the population is changing. In this paper, we redefined the operator of CRO, and using the method of multiobjective decomposition decomposed the community detection problem into a scalar of sub-problems and using the proposed a discrete variant of CRO (MODCRO) to optimization. In the proposed method, neighbor-based turbulence of on-wall ineffective collision operator and decomposition operator are redefined which is responsible for searching local exploitation ability of algorithm, and the intermolecular ineffective collisions operator and synthesis operator is also redesigned which is responsible for searching global exploration ability of algorithm. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a number of state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on modularity.},

We show as fuzzy logic plays an important role in this area due to these variables can be affected for multifactorial elements impregnated with uncertainty.

In this work, a supervised machine learning method for coronary artery vesselness diffusion with high accuracy and minimal user interaction is designed. The fully discriminative filter learning method jointly learning a classifier the weak learners rely on and the features of the classifier is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that this scheme achieves good isotropic filtering performances on both synthetic and real patient Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) datasets. Furthermore, region growing-based segmentation approach is performed over filtered images obtained by using different schemes. The proposed diffusion scheme is able to achieve higher average performance measures (87.8% ± 1.5% for Dice, 86.5% ± 1.3% for Precision and 88.5% ± 2.6% for Sensitivity). In conclusion, the developed diffusion method is capable of filtering coronary artery structures and suppressing nonvessel tissues, and can be further used in clinical practice as a real-time CCTA images preprocessing tool.},

Traditional feature selection algorithms are based on static feature spaces that are difficult to apply in dynamic streaming data environments. Existing works, such as Alpha-investing and Online Streaming Feature Selection (OSFS), and Scalable and Accurate OnLine Approach (SAOLA), have been proposed to serve the feature selection with streaming feature, but they have drawbacks, including low prediction accuracy and a large number of selected features if the streaming features exhibit characteristics such as low redundancy and high relevance. To address the limitations of the abovementioned works, we propose the algorithm of Online Streaming Feature Selection via Conditional dependence and Mutual information (OSFSCM) for streaming feature, which is found to be superior to Alpha-investing and OSFS for datasets with low redundancy and high relevance. The efficiency of the proposed OSFSCM algorithm is validated through a performance test on widely used datasets, e.g., NIPS 2003 and Causality Workbench. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that OSFSCM significantly improves the prediction accuracy and requires fewer selected features compared with Alpha-investing and OSFS.},

By adopting the method of variable transformation, the addressed model, which includes the so-called inertial term, is transformed into first-order differential equations. On the basis of the well-known invariant principle of functional differential equations, a novel and analytic scheme which ensures the adaptive synchronization between the drive-response system is proposed in component form. It is worth mentioning that we only need to impose one controller to the spilt systems to realize the adaptive synchronization, which is of less conservatism. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is provided to verify the feasibility of the derived theoretical results. The established figures validate that the numerical simulations coincide well with the developed theoretical results.},

The degree of f-inclusion is one generalization of such a notion that differs from others existing in the literature because the degree of inclusion is considered as a mapping instead of a value in the unit interval. On the other hand, the degree of f-weak-contradiction was introduced to represent the contradiction between two fuzzy sets via a mapping and its definition has many similarities with the f-degree of inclusion. This suggests the existence of relations between both f-degrees. Specifically, following this line, we analyze the relationship between the f-degree of inclusion and the f-degree of contradiction via the complement of fuzzy sets and Galois connections.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new compromising approach to multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) for the treatment of uncertainty which is based on Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets. The present work intends to propose a novel linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) by way of some useful concepts related to PF dominance relations, individual consistency and inconsistency levels, and individual fit measurements. The concept of PF scalar function-based dominance measures is defined to conduct intracriterion comparisons concerning uncertain evaluation information based on Pythagorean fuzziness; moreover, several valuable properties are also investigated to demonstrate its effectiveness. For the assessment of overall dominance of alternatives, this paper provides a synthetic index, named a comprehensive dominance measure, which is the aggregation of the weighted dominance measures by combining unknown weight information and PF dominance measures of various criteria. For each decision-maker, this paper employs the proposed measures to evaluate the individual levels of rank consistency and rank inconsistency regarding the obtained overall dominance relations and the decision-maker’s preference comparisons over paired alternatives. In the framework of individual fit measurements, this paper constructs bi-objective mathematical programming models and then provides their corresponding parametric linear programming models for generating the best compromise alternative. Realistic applications with some comparative analyses concerning railway project investment are implemented to demonstrate the appropriateness and usefulness of the proposed methodology in addressing actual MCGDM problems.},

  abstract     = {Randomness is a common uncertainty encountered in practical multi-objectives decision-making. But it is always a challenge for decision-makers to process randomness in multi-objective programming problems. This paper takes the decision-making objectives as fuzzy events and aims to solve numerical multi-objective programming problems under random environment. We first analyze the effects of randomness on multi-objective decision-making results. With the expectation value and the probability of fuzzy events as quantitative index of randomness, we then establish a two-stage random multi-objective programming model based on reliability (i.e., TS-MOPM). Specifically, we give several probability calculation methods of fuzzy events with common distributions, and further present the corresponding calculation procedures for solving TS-MOPM. Finally, a case study is implemented to test the proposed model TS-MOPM. Theoretical analysis and case study indicate that our model has better interpretability and operability. The research results enrich the existing random multi-objective programming methods to some extent.},

  abstract     = {Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is a technology used to improve the channel capacity of the wireless communication systems. Rapid increase in the number of users has led to data rate demand increased in growing modern wireless communication systems. To overcome this issue, MIMO is being used with several multicarrier techniques like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA), etc. Multi-user detection (MUD) with artificial intelligence plays a vital role to enhance network capacity to meet the demands of future networks with an increased number of users and multimedia services. Computational intelligence techniques are used in a multicarrier system to boost the process of MUD. Some of the computational intelligence algorithms like Swarm and Evolutionary are stuck in local minima and due to this issue, the overall performance of the network decreases. For the convergence of Swarm intelligence-based solutions, cognitive and social information (CSI) play a vital role. In this research article, the Fuzzy Logic empowered Cognitive and Social Information (FLeCSI) algorithm using a fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed. By using social and cognitive information FLeCSI updated each swarm position. After the simulation, it is observed that FLeCSI provides fast convergence and minimize MMSE and BER as compared to techniques used previously for MUD like Fuzzy Logic empowered Opposite Mutant Particle Swarm Optimization (FLOMPSO), Opposite Learning Mutant Particle Swarm Optimization (OLMPSO), Total Opposite Mutant Particle Swarm Optimization (TOMPSO), Partial Opposite Mutant Particle Swarm Optimization (POMPSO), etc.},

  abstract     = {This paper treats the optimization of the biped walking trajectory that can be used as a reference trajectory for control. The biped robot is modeled as a kinetic chain of 11 links connected by 10 joints. The inverse kinematics of the biped is derived for the specified positions of the hips and feet. The objective is to optimize the biped robot able to stably and naturally walking with preset foot-lift magnitude (or preset hip-shift, or preset step-length). The stability of the biped robot is quantified by the distance between the ZMP and the foot center in the step cycle, which represents the first objective function. Additionally, for the biped robot to follow the preset foot-lift value, the difference between the magnitude of foot-lift value and the foot-lift preset value represents the second objective function. Specifically, we minimize the value of the two objective functions by considering the gait parameters of biped robot as variables. The new Jaya optimization algorithm is innovatively applied to optimize the biped gait parameters as to ensure the biped robot walking robustly and steadily. The efficiency of the proposed Jaya-based identification method is compared with the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), the Central Force Optimization (CFO) and improved Differential Evolution (DE) [Modified Differential Evolution (MDE)] algorithms. The simulation results tested on the real small-sized biped robot system HUBOT-4 demonstrate that the novel proposed algorithm offers an efficient and stable gait for biped robot with precise foot-lift value.},

  abstract     = {Multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems are widespread in real life. However, most existing methods, such as hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) and inter-valued hesitant fuzzy set (IVHFS) only consider the original evaluation data provided by experts but fail to dig the concealed valuable information. The normal wiggly hesitant fuzzy set (NWHFS) is a useful technique to depict experts’ complex evaluation information toward MCGDM issues. In this paper, on the basis of the score function of NWHFS, we propose the linear best-worst method (BWM)-based weight-determining models with normal wiggly hesitant fuzzy (NWHF) information to compute the optimal weights of experts and criteria. In addition, we present some novel distance measures between NWHFSs and discuss their properties. After fusing the individual evaluation matrices, the NWHF-ranking position method is put forward to develop the group MULTIMOORA method, which can be determined by the final decision results. Moreover, we investigate the Spring Festival travel rush phenomenon deeply and apply our methodology to solve the train selection problem during the Spring Festival period. Finally, the applicability and superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing with traditional methods based on two aggregation operators of NWHFSs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we will present a N-Non-Intersecting-Routing (NNIR) algorithm which is used to reduce the cost of resilient routing in telecommunications problems. Resilient Routing is the connections between two locations in a graph through the use of N completely independent routes. Resilient Routing is applicable in a wide variety of domains including telecommunications, logistics and embedded systems design. The proposed NNIR algorithm increase the cost of the primary route by taking a less optimal route, thus freeing a more optimal route for the resilient routes, in turn reducing the total cost of both routes. This is achieved through the use of a Genetic Algorithm, Dijkstra’s Algorithm and the repair operator. The proposed NNIR shows an average improvement of 34.2% when compared to Dijkstra’s Algorithm (one of the most widely used algorithm routing). Similarly, there is an average improvement of 34.2% when compared to A* (another popular shortest path algorithm). Additionally, there is an average improvement of 26.9% when compared to Simulated Annealing (a popular evolutionary technique used within routing problems). In this paper we show how NNIR performs within two different routing domains (telecommunications routing and road routing), and compares it against three other routing techniques to solve the resilient routing problem.},

  abstract     = {Sequence labeling is a common machine-learning task which not only needs the most likely prediction of label for a local input but also seeks the most suitable annotation for the whole input sequence. So it requires the model that is able to handle both the local spatial features and temporal-dependence features effectively. Furthermore, it is common for the length of the label sequence to be much shorter than the input sequence in some tasks such as speech recognition and handwritten text recognition. In this paper, we propose a kind of novel deep neural network architecture which combines convolution, pooling and recurrent in a unified framework to construct the convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for sequence labeling tasks with variable lengths of input and output. Specifically, we design a novel CRNN to achieve the joint extraction of local spatial features and long-distance temporal-dependence features in sequence, introduce pooling along time to achieve a transform of long input to short output which will also reduce he model’s complexity, and adopt Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layer to achieve an end-to-end pattern for sequence labeling. Experiments on phoneme sequence recognition and handwritten character sequence recognition have been conducted and the results show that our method achieves great performance while having a more simplified architecture with more efficient training and labeling procedure.},

Additionally, the persona method is introduced to cluster DMs and achieve personalized decision-making. Further, we present a numerical example and comparison to demonstrate the efficiency of the framework in coping with non-socially shared preferences in SN-GDM.

The second stage used the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to schedule the medical staff within a reasonable time. Based on the numerical results, HRA3 was superior to HRA1 and HRA2. Furthermore, the analysis of two scenarios—varying the sizes of hospital branches (Scenario 1) and varying the total number of medical staff (Scenario 2)—showed that, when the sizes of hospital branches varied (Scenario 1), HRA3 was superior to HRA1 and HRA2 whereas, when the sizes were given (Scenario 2), the lowest number of medical staff possible was approximately 60.

  abstract     = {An autoregressive moving average (ARMA) is a time series model that is applied in everyday life for pattern recognition and forecasting. The ARMA model contains a noise which is assumed to have a specific distribution. The noise is often considered to have a Gaussian distribution. However in applications, the noise is sometimes found that does not have a Gaussian distribution. The first objective is to develop the ARMA model in which noise has a Laplacian distribution. The second objective is to estimate the parameters of the ARMA model. The ARMA model parameters include ARMA model orders, ARMA model coefficients, and noise variance. The parameter estimation of the ARMA model is carried out in the Bayesian framework. In the Bayesian framework, the ARMA model parameters are treated as a variable that has a prior distribution. The prior distribution for the ARMA model parameters is combined with the likelihood function for the data to get the posterior distribution for the parameter. The posterior distribution for parameters has a complex form so that the Bayes estimator cannot be determined analytically. The reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was adopted to determine the Bayes estimator. The first result, the ARMA model can be developed by assuming Laplacian distribution noise. The second result, the performance of the algorithm was tested using simulation studies. The simulation shows that the reversible jump MCMC algorithm can estimate the parameters of the ARMA model correctly.},

  abstract     = {Considering the low degree of abstraction of traditional shape grammar in national pattern reuse design, this paper proposes a method based on the combination of improved shape grammar and an optimization algorithm to reuse national patterns design. As an application example, we carried out research on the batik pattern elements of the Miao nationality in the “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Guizhou Province” system. Firstly, an improved shape grammar based on synthetic predicate grammar coding is developed to represent the transformation process of design pattern reuse in batik patterns. Then, the number of patterns arranged in a specific position is taken as the optimization variable; the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the variables, so as to obtain the optimized predicate shape grammar parameters; and the pattern is reused according to the parameters. A batik design pattern reuse system is also constructed to realize rapid design. The results show that the proposed method can enrich the reuse results of batik pattern elements and realize the rapid design of complex batik patterns.},

This model takes into account factors such as the minimum constraint set, the route length, and the cost. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is then designed based on the fitness function of the multi-objective MCR problem, and an iteration formula based on the personal best (pbest) and global best (gbest) of the algorithm is constructed to update the particle velocity and position. Finally, compared with ant colony optimization (ACO) A and the crow search algorithm (CSA) A, the experimental results show that the MOPSO-based path planning algorithm can find a shorter path that traverses fewer obstacle areas and can thus perform MCR path planning more effectively.},

First, the domain knowledge is expressed with predicate expressions based on the ontology structure; then the vocabulary is presented distributedly with word embedding enhanced with the domain knowledge; queries from the user are then converted into the intent (general) and slot elements (specific) with the help of trained recurrent neural network (RNN).

Using the transaction records from the core operations (CO) of the members, financers can provide a higher level of cash flow to the ecosystem. Moreover, financial sectors can upgrade their operations through SCF activities. However, while SCF services can help financial sectors improve their operations, there are many risks implied in SCF activities from CO to relative members. Therefore, this paper presents a novel model that applies a combination of triangular fuzzy numbers and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to the decision-making process to evaluate the decision behaviors regarding the preference the CO in the smartphone industry supply chain for financers in the SCF service. Academically, the FAHP-based decision-making framework can provide the decision makers and administrators of financial institutions with valuable guidance for measuring the optimal CO of the smartphone industry in the SCF ecosystem. Commercially, the proposed model could provide administrators with a useful tool to assess the optimal CO of the smartphone industry within the SCF ecosystem for financers.},

However, TGA cannot be directly applied to feature selection problems. Also, we find that its efficiency still leave room for improvement. To tackle this problem, in this study, a novel improved TGA (iTGA) is proposed, which can resolve the feature selection problem efficiently. The main contribution includes, (1) a binary TGA is proposed to tackle the feature selection problems, (2) a linearly increasing parameter tuning mechanism is proposed to tune the parameter in TGA, (3) the evolutionary population dynamics (EPD) strategy is applied to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of TGA, (4) the efficiency of iTGA is evaluated on fifteen UCI benchmark datasets, the comprehensive results indicate that iTGA can resolve feature selection problems efficiently. Furthermore, the results of comparative experiments also verify the superiority of iTGA compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

In conventional models, most scholars have used the historical gold price or economic indicators to forecast gold prices. The gold prices depend mainly on confidence in the current market. To reduce the time delay of economic indicators in this study, the daily online global gold news undergoes a text mining approach. An opinion score is generated by ascertaining the opinion polarity and words in the daily gold news. The opinion score represents the current market trends and used as an input predictor in the forecasting model. Subsequently, the least square support vector regression (LSSVR) that is optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to train and predict the future gold price. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is adopted to evaluate the model performance. This study is the first to use the opinion score through text mining as an input predictor to GA-LSSVR in forecasting gold prices. The experiment results demonstrate that the input predictor, opinion score, can improve the predicting ability of GA-LSSVR model in terms of MAPE.},

  abstract     = {The digital transformation revolution has been crawling toward almost all aspects of our lives. One form of the digital transformation revolution appears in the transformation of our routine everyday tasks into computer executable programs in the form of web, desktop and mobile applications. The vast field of software engineering that has witnessed a significant progress in the past years is responsible for this form of digital transformation. Software development as well as other branches of software engineering has been affected by this progress. Developing applications that run on top of mobile devices requires the software developer to consider the limited resources of these devices, which on one side give them their mobile advantages, however, on the other side, if an application is developed without the consideration of these limited resources then the mobile application will neither work properly nor allow the device to run smoothly. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach for program optimization. It succeeded in optimizing the search process for the optimal program transformation sequence that targets a specific optimization goal. In this research we targeted the program size, to reach the lowest possible decline rate of the number of Lines of Code (LoC) of a targeted program. The experimental results from applying the hybrid approach on synthetic program transformation problems show a significant improve in the optimized output on which the hybrid approach achieved an LoC decline rate of 50.51% over the application of basic genetic algorithm only where 17.34% LoC decline rate was reached.},

Recently, more general kinds of conjunctors have also been considered, like semi-copulas, copulas, and conjunctive uninorms. A common feature of all these kinds of conjunctors is the fact that they have a neutral element e ∈ ]0,1]. This paper is devoted to the study of Modus Ponens for conjunctors with a neutral element with no additional conditions. Many properties are proved to be necessary for a fuzzy implication function I to satisfy the Modus Ponens with respect to a conjunctor with neutral element e ∈ ]0,1]. Although the most usual families of fuzzy implication functions do not satisfy all these properties, other possibilities for I are presented showing many new examples and generalizing some already known results on this topic. Moreover, all fuzzy implication functions satisfying the Modus Ponens with respect to the least (and with respect to the greatest) conjunctor with neutral element e ∈ ]0,1[ are characterized. The particular case of e = 1, that provides semi-copulas, is studied separately, retrieving many known results that can be easily derived from the current study.},

  abstract     = {An incomplete uncertain preference relation (UPR) is typical in group decision making (GDM) for decision makers (DMs) to express preference over alternatives because of the information interaction barrier between people and decision making environment. Completing missing values can guarantee individual consistency and consensus level effectively. The operation of traditional interval preference relations (IPRs) is based only on the end point transformation, which may cause interval discretisation and information distortion easily. To overcome these limitations, pairwise comparison of alternatives in an IPR is treated as an uncertain distribution function of the subjective preference of the DM which avoids discretisation operation and handles interval numbers collectively. A belief degree is used to maintain the original information as much as possible. It guarantees the extent how people believe the estimated value is close to the incomplete original value. An uncertain chance constrained programming model is proposed herein to estimate incomplete values based on a belief degree when the preference relation obeys a linear uncertain distribution. A distance measure is defined to compute the consistency index and consensus degree. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is presented for GDM with linear UPRs, which adjusts inconsistent preference relations and uses an operator to aggregate all individual preference relations. Furthermore, it is proven that the operation of UPRs is an extension of that of traditional IPRs under a certain belief degree.},

  abstract     = {While particle swarm optimization (PSO) shows good performance for many optimization problems, the weakness in premature convergence and easy trapping into local optimum, due to the ignorance of the diversity information, has been gradually recognized. To improve the optimization performance of PSO, an enhanced PSO based on reference direction and inverse model is proposed, RDIM-PSO for short reference. In RDIM-PSO, the reference particles which are used as reference directions are selected by non-dominated sorting method according to the fitness and diversity contribution of the population. Dynamic neighborhood strategy is introduced to divide the population into several sub-swarms based on the reference directions. For each sub-swarm, the particles focus on exploitation under the guidance of local best particle with a good guarantee of population diversity. Moreover, Gaussian process-based inverse model is introduced to generate equilibrium particles by sampling the objective space to further achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on CEC2014 test problems show that RDIM-PSO has overall better performance compared with other well-known optimization algorithms. Finally, the proposed RDIM-PSO is also applied to artificial neural networks and the promising results on the chaotic time series prediction show the effectiveness of RDIM-PSO.},

In this work, we propose a hybrid multimodal deep learning method for short-term traffic flow forecasting, which can jointly and adaptively learn the spatial–temporal correlation features and long temporal interdependence of multi-modality traffic data by an attention auxiliary multimodal deep learning architecture. According to the highly nonlinear characteristics of multi-modality traffic data, the base module of our method consists of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU) with the attention mechanism. The former is to capture the local trend features and the latter is to capture the long temporal dependencies. Then, we design a hybrid multimodal deep learning framework for fusing share representation features of different modality traffic data by multiple CNN-GRU-Attention modules. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multimodal deep learning model is capable of dealing with complex nonlinear urban traffic flow forecasting with satisfying accuracy and effectiveness.},

Suitable automated diagnosis of skin lesions and Melanoma classification can extraordinarily enhance early identification of Melanomas. However, classification models based on deterministic skin lesion can influence multi-dimensional nonlinear problem which leads to inaccurate and inefficient classification. This paper presents a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) classification approach for segmented skin lesions in dermoscopy images. As an initial step, the skin lesion is preprocessed by an automatic preprocessing algorithm together with a fusion hair detection and removal strategy. Also a new probability map based region growing and optimal thresholding algorithm is integrated in our system which yields tremendous accuracy. For obtaining more prominent results a set of features containing ABCD features as well as geometric features are calculated in the feature extraction step to describe the malignancy of the lesion. The experimental result shows that the system is efficient and works well on dermoscopy images, achieving considerable accuracy.},

However, it is not easy to determine the best pooling method in a different case study. For instance, experts can implement the best types of pooling in image processing cases, which might not be optimal for various tasks. Thus, it is required to keep in line with the philosophy of DL. In dynamic neural network architecture, it is not practically possible to find a proper pooling technique for the layers. It is the primary reason why various pooling cannot be applied in the dynamic and multidimensional dataset. To deal with the limitations, it needs to construct an optimal pooling method as a better option than max pooling and average pooling. Therefore, we introduce a dynamic pooling layer called RunPool to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. RunPool pooling is proposed to regularize the neural network that replaces the deterministic pooling functions. In the final section, we test the proposed pooling layer to address classification problems with online social network (OSN) dataset.},

The proposed model does not use any syntactic and dependency parser. Mentions were extracted from the text with an unhand engineered mention detector and features were extracted from a deep neural network. Next, the problem is modeled in the form of effective parameters of the performance such as error rate reduction and enhances the F1 by Kohonen MCDM neural network. The weights assigned to the features represent their importance and suggests the best reference for a mention where such weights are computed using a fuzzy weighting method. Comparing to state-of-the-art coreference resolution models, the simulation results show significant improvements for the proposed approach on different datasets in terms of precision and recall and achieving marginal improvements on the following datasets: English CoNLL-2012 shared task (+3.1 F1), Yahoo’s news site (+6.6 F1), and English Gigaword (+7.04).},

However, traditional ACO has many shortcomings, including slow convergence and low efficiency. By enlarging the ants’ search space and diversifying the potential solutions, a new ACO algorithm is proposed. In this new algorithm, to diversify the solution space, a strategy of combining pairs of searching ants is used. Additionally, to reduce the influence of having a limited number of meeting ants, a threshold constant is introduced. Based on applying the algorithm to 20 typical TSPs, the performance of the new algorithm is verified to be good. Moreover, by comparison with 16 state-of-the-art algorithms, the results show that the proposed new algorithm is a highly suitable method to solve the TSP, and its performance is better than those of most algorithms. Finally, by solving eight TSPs, the good performance of the new algorithm has been analyzed more comprehensively by comparison with that of the typical traditional ACO. The results show that the new algorithm can attain a better solution with higher accuracy and less effort.},

To design more secured data security algorithm, a light weight proactive padding based crypto security system (LPP-CS) is presented in this paper. The method generates keys to support the crypto systems based on the prime values. The keys are generated from the set of prime numbers which have been used to pad the cipher text generated. The end user will be given with the key which is generated and distributed at the assignment. The encryption is performed in block level and for each block of data different keys has been used which challenges the adversary highly. The selection of prime factors and keys are suitable for any specific time window and has been iterated frequently.

With the rapid development of the image-sharing community, such as Flickr, the image resources of the social network with rich metadata information demonstrate explosive growth. How to provide semantic tagging words (also known as tag recommendation) to social images through image metadata information analysis and mining is still a question, which brings new challenges and opportunities to the semantic understanding of images. Making full use of metadata for semantic analysis of images can help to bridge the semantic gap. Thus, we propose a novel personalized tag recommendation algorithm based on the convolution feature and weighted random walk. Particularly, for a given target image, we select its visual neighbors and determine the weight of each neighbor by mining the influence of user group metadata in Flickr on image correlation, and combining group information and visual features extracted by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Afterwards, the weighted random walk algorithm is implemented on the neighbor-tag bipartite graph. Experimental results show that tags recommended by our proposed method can accurately describe the semantic information of images and satisfy the personalized requirements of users.},
