  abstract     = {Enzymes are central to both metabolism and information processing in cells. In both cases, an enzyme’s ability to accelerate a reaction without being consumed in the reaction is crucial. Nevertheless, enzymes are transiently sequestered when they bind to their substrates; this sequestration limits activity and potentially compromises information processing and signal transduction. In this article, we analyse the mechanism of enzyme–substrate catalysis from the perspective of minimizing the load on the enzymes through sequestration, while maintaining at least a minimum reaction flux. In particular, we ask: which binding free energies of the enzyme–substrate and enzyme–product reaction intermediates minimize the fraction of enzymes sequestered in complexes, while sustaining a certain minimal flux? Under reasonable biophysical assumptions, we find that the optimal design will saturate the bound on the minimal flux and reflects a basic trade-off in catalytic operation. If both binding free energies are too high, there is low sequestration, but the effective progress of the reaction is hampered. If both binding free energies are too low, there is high sequestration, and the reaction flux may also be suppressed in extreme cases. The optimal binding free energies are therefore neither too high nor too low, but in fact moderate. Moreover, the optimal difference in substrate and product binding free energies, which contributes to the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction, is in general strongly constrained by the intrinsic free-energy difference between products and reactants. Both the strategies of using a negative binding free-energy difference to drive the catalyst-bound reaction forward and of using a positive binding free-energy difference to enhance detachment of the product are limited in their efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Spectral analysis and neural field theory are used to investigate the role of local connections in brain connectivity matrices (CMs) that quantify connectivity between pairs of discretized brain regions. This work investigates how the common procedure of omitting such self-connections (i.e., the diagonal elements of CMs) in published studies of brain connectivity affects the properties of functional CMs (fCMs) and the mutually consistent effective CMs (eCMs) that correspond to them. It is shown that retention of self-connections in the fCM calculated from two-point activity covariances is essential for the fCM to be a true covariance matrix, to enable correct inference of the direct total eCMs from the fCM, and to ensure their compatibility with it; the deCM and teCM represent the strengths of direct connections and all connections between points, respectively. When self-connections are retained, inferred eCMs are found to have net inhibitory self-connections that represent the local inhibition needed to balance excitation via white matter fibers at longer ranges. This inference of spatially unresolved connectivity exemplifies the power of spectral connectivity methods, which also enable transformation of CMs to compact diagonal forms that allow accurate approximation of the fCM and total eCM in terms of just a few modes, rather than the full $$N^2$$ CM entries for connections between N brain regions. It is found that omission of fCM self-connections affects both local and long-range connections in eCMs, so they cannot be omitted even when studying the large-scale. Moreover, retention of local connections enables inference of subgrid short-range inhibitory connectivity. The results are verified and illustrated using the NKI-Rockland dataset from the University of Southern California Multimodal Connectivity Database. Deletion of self-connections is common in the field; this does not affect case-control studies but the present results imply that such fCMs must have self-connections restored before eCMs can be inferred from them.},

  abstract     = {Trajectories in human aimed movements are inherently variable. Using the concept of positional variance profiles, such trajectories are shown to be decomposable into two phases: In a first phase, the variance of the limb position over many trajectories increases rapidly; in a second phase, it then decreases steadily. A new theoretical model, where the aiming task is seen as a Shannon-like communication problem, is developed to describe the second phase: Information is transmitted from a “source” (determined by the position at the end of the first phase) to a “destination” (the movement’s end-point) over a “channel” perturbed by Gaussian noise, with the presence of a noiseless feedback link. Information-theoretic considerations show that the positional variance decreases exponentially with a rate equal to the channel capacity C. Two existing datasets for simple pointing tasks are re-analyzed and observations on real data confirm our model. The first phase has constant duration, and C is found constant across instructions and task parameters, which thus characterizes the participant’s performance. Our model provides a clear understanding of the speed-accuracy tradeoff in aimed movements: Since the participant’s capacity is fixed, a higher prescribed accuracy necessarily requires a longer second phase resulting in an increased overall movement time. The well-known Fitts’ law is also recovered using this approach.},

While the precise mechanisms which underly the effectiveness of DBS are not fully understood, several theoretical studies of populations of neural oscillators stimulated by periodic pulses have suggested that this may be related to clustering, in which subpopulations of the neurons are synchronized, but the subpopulations are desynchronized with respect to each other. The details of the clustering behavior depend on the frequency and amplitude of the stimulation in a complicated way. In the present study, we investigate how the number of clusters and their stability properties, bifurcations, and basins of attraction can be understood in terms of one-dimensional maps defined on the circle. Moreover, we generalize this analysis to stimuli that consist of pulses with alternating properties, which provide additional degrees of freedom in the design of DBS stimuli. Our results illustrate how the complicated properties of clustering behavior for periodically forced neural oscillator populations can be understood in terms of a much simpler dynamical system.},

  abstract     = {Animals exhibit remarkable feats of behavioral flexibility and multifunctional control that remain challenging for robotic systems. The neural and morphological basis of multifunctionality in animals can provide a source of bioinspiration for robotic controllers. However, many existing approaches to modeling biological neural networks rely on computationally expensive models and tend to focus solely on the nervous system, often neglecting the biomechanics of the periphery. As a consequence, while these models are excellent tools for neuroscience, they fail to predict functional behavior in real time, which is a critical capability for robotic control. To meet the need for real-time multifunctional control, we have developed a hybrid Boolean model framework capable of modeling neural bursting activity and simple biomechanics at speeds faster than real time. Using this approach, we present a multifunctional model of Aplysia californica feeding that qualitatively reproduces three key feeding behaviors (biting, swallowing, and rejection), demonstrates behavioral switching in response to external sensory cues, and incorporates both known neural connectivity and a simple bioinspired mechanical model of the feeding apparatus. We demonstrate that the model can be used for formulating testable hypotheses and discuss the implications of this approach for robotic control and neuroscience.},

  abstract     = {Previous authors have proposed two basic hypotheses about the factors that form the basis of locomotor rhythms in walking insects: sensory feedback only or sensory feedback together with rhythmic activity of small neural circuits called central pattern generators (CPGs). Here we focus on the latter. Following this concept, to generate functional outputs, locomotor control must feature both rhythm generation by CPGs at the level of individual joints and coordination of their rhythmic activities, so that all muscles are activated in an appropriate pattern. This work provides an in-depth analysis of an aspect of this coordination process based on an existing network model of stick insect locomotion. Specifically, we consider how the control system for a single joint in the stick insect leg may produce rhythmic output when subjected to ascending sensory signals from other joints in the leg. In this work, the core rhythm generating CPG component of the joint under study is represented by a classical half-center oscillator constrained by a basic set of experimental observations. While the dynamical features of this CPG, including phase transitions by escape and release, are well understood, we provide novel insights about how these transition mechanisms yield entrainment to the incoming sensory signal, how entrainment can be lost under variation of signal strength and period or other perturbations, how entrainment can be restored by modulation of tonic top-down drive levels, and how these factors impact the duty cycle of the motor output.},

The behaviour of saccades matches that of the slow–fast model of actions originally proposed by Zeeman. Here, we extend Zeeman’s model by incorporating an accumulator that represents the increase in certainty of the presence of a target, together with an integrator that converts a velocity command to a position command. The saccadic behaviour of several foveate species, including human, rhesus monkey and mouse, is replicated by the augmented model. Predictions of the linear stability of the saccadic system close to equilibrium are made, and it is shown that these could be tested by applying state-space reconstruction techniques to neurophysiological recordings. Moreover, each model equation describes behaviour that can be matched to specific classes of neurons found throughout the oculomotor system, and the implication of the model is that build-up, burst and omnipause neurons are found throughout the oculomotor pathway because they constitute the simplest circuit that can produce the motor commands required to specify the trajectories of motor actions.},

  abstract     = {Maintaining balance during quiet standing is a challenging task for the neural control mechanisms due to the inherent instabilities involved in the task. The feedback latencies and the lowpass characteristics of skeletal muscle add to the difficulty of regulating postural dynamics in real-time. Inverted-pendulum (IP) type robotic models have served as a popular paradigm to investigate control of postural balance. In this study, an in-depth neuromechanical postural control model is developed from physiological principles. The model comprises a single-segment IP robotic model, Hill-type muscle model, and proprioceptive feedback from the muscle spindle (MS) and golgi tendon organ (GTO). An optimal proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed to realize effective postural control amid latencies in sensory feedback. The neural commands for postural stabilization are generated by a time-varying PID controller, tuned using linear quadratic regulator (LQR) principles. Computer simulations are used to assess the efficacy of the tuned PID-LQR controller. Sensitivity analysis of the controlled system shows a delay tolerance of 300ms. Preliminary empirical data in support of the mathematical model were obtained from perturbation experiments. The model response to perturbation torque, measured in terms of the center of mass (COM) excursion in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction, displays a high degree of correlation with the empirical data ( $$\rho =0.91$$ ).},

  abstract     = {Ethorobotics, a new fascinating field of biorobotics, proposes the use of robotic replicas as an advanced method for investigating animal behaviour. This novel research approach can also encourage the development of advanced bioinspired robots. In the present study, we investigated the pushing behaviour, a particular display occurring in several beetle species, such as the larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus, during both male–female and male–male contexts. We developed a robotic apparatus actuating female and male-mimicking dummies to study if sex, mating experience and asymmetries of robotic cues can modulate the escalation of pushing behaviour. Results showed that the time needed by P. truncatus to react to female-smelling biomimetic dummies was chiefly affected by their mating experience and the dummy odour. This was likely due to reduce waste of costly sperm in mated males during the subsequent sexual interactions. The pushing behaviour was performed longer and with a higher number of acts when virgin females were approached from their right side. More and longer pushing acts were noted when virgin males were approached from their left side. Dedicated neural circuits would likely act in opposite direction in females and males producing population-level lateralized sensory-motor displays, which may be evolved to promote male approaches from the left side of females, thus improving short-distance sex recognition. Overall, this study provides new insights on the behavioural ecology of stored-product beetles, as well as on self-organization and decentralized decision making that can be exploited to develop bioinspired algorithms for task optimization, involving real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The amount of power in different frequency bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG) carries information about the behavioral state of a subject. Hence, neurologists treating epileptic patients monitor the temporal evolution of the different bands. We propose a covariance-based method to detect and characterize epileptic seizures operating on the band-filtered EEG signal. The algorithm is unsupervised and performs a principal component analysis of intra-cranial EEG recordings, detecting transient fluctuations of the power in each frequency band. Its simplicity makes it suitable for online implementation. Good sampling of the non-ictal periods is required, while no demands are imposed on the amount of data during ictal activity. We tested the method with 32 seizures registered in 5 patients. The area below the resulting receiver-operating characteristic curves was 87% for the detection of seizures and 91% for the detection of recruited electrodes. To identify the behaviorally relevant correlates of the physiological signal, we identified transient changes in the variance of each band that were correlated with the degree of loss of consciousness, the latter assessed by the so-called Consciousness Seizure Scale, summarizing the performance of the subject in a number of behavioral tests requested during seizures. We concluded that those crisis with maximal impairment of consciousness tended to exhibit an increase in variance approximately 40 s after seizure onset, with predominant power in the theta and alpha bands and reduced delta and beta activity.},

  abstract     = {Decoding the direction of translating objects in front of cluttered moving backgrounds, accurately and efficiently, is still a challenging problem. In nature, lightweight and low-powered flying insects apply motion vision to detect a moving target in highly variable environments during flight, which are excellent paradigms to learn motion perception strategies. This paper investigates the fruit fly Drosophila motion vision pathways and presents computational modelling based on cutting-edge physiological researches. The proposed visual system model features bio-plausible ON and OFF pathways, wide-field horizontal-sensitive (HS) and vertical-sensitive (VS) systems. The main contributions of this research are on two aspects: (1) the proposed model articulates the forming of both direction-selective and direction-opponent responses, revealed as principal features of motion perception neural circuits, in a feed-forward manner; (2) it also shows robust direction selectivity to translating objects in front of cluttered moving backgrounds, via the modelling of spatiotemporal dynamics including combination of motion pre-filtering mechanisms and ensembles of local correlators inside both the ON and OFF pathways, which works effectively to suppress irrelevant background motion or distractors, and to improve the dynamic response. Accordingly, the direction of translating objects is decoded as global responses of both the HS and VS systems with positive or negative output indicating preferred-direction or null-direction translation. The experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed neural system model, and demonstrated its responsive preference to faster-moving, higher-contrast and larger-size targets embedded in cluttered moving backgrounds.},

  abstract     = {The semicircular ducts (SCDs) of the vestibular system play an instrumental role in equilibration and rotation perception of vertebrates. The present paper is a review of quantitative approaches and shows how SCDs function. It consists of three parts. First, the biophysical mechanisms of an SCD system composed of three mutually connected ducts, allowing endolymph to flow from one duct into another one, are analysed. The flow is quantified by solving the continuity equations in conjunction with the equations of motion of the SCD hydrodynamics. This leads to mathematical expressions that are suitable for further analytical and numerical analysis. Second, analytical solutions are derived through four simplifying steps while keeping the essentials of the coupled system intact. Some examples of flow distributions for different rotations are given. Third, the focus is on the transducer function of the SCDs. The complex structure of the mechano-electrical transduction apparatus inside the ampullae is described, and the consequences for sensitivity and frequency response are evaluated. Furthermore, both the contributions of the different terms of the equations of motion and the influence of Brownian motion are analysed. Finally, size limitations, allometry and evolutionary aspects are taken into account.},

  abstract     = {Information about time-dependent sensory stimuli is encoded in the activity of neural populations; distinct aspects of the stimulus are read out by different types of neurons: while overall information is perceived by integrator cells, so-called coincidence detector cells are driven mainly by the synchronous activity in the population that encodes predominantly high-frequency content of the input signal (high-pass information filtering). Previously, an analytically accessible statistic called the partial synchronous output was introduced as a proxy for the coincidence detector cell’s output in order to approximate its information transmission. In the first part of the current paper, we compare the information filtering properties (specifically, the coherence function) of this proxy to those of a simple coincidence detector neuron. We show that the latter’s coherence function can indeed be well-approximated by the partial synchronous output with a time scale and threshold criterion that are related approximately linearly to the membrane time constant and firing threshold of the coincidence detector cell. In the second part of the paper, we propose an alternative theory for the spectral measures (including the coherence) of the coincidence detector cell that combines linear-response theory for shot-noise driven integrate-and-fire neurons with a novel perturbation ansatz for the spectra of spike-trains driven by colored noise. We demonstrate how the variability of the synaptic weights for connections from the population to the coincidence detector can shape the information transmission of the entire two-stage system.},

First, the ADL movements recorded from three human participants were broken down into logical phases, and each phase was decomposed into submovement components. Three separate artificial neural networks were trained to learn the submovement parameters and were then incorporated into a closed-loop model with error correction ability. The model was able to predict angular trajectories of human ADL movements with target access rate = 100%, VAF = 98.9%, and NRMSE = 4.7% relative to the actual trajectories. In addition, the model can be used to provide the desired target for practical trajectory planning in rehabilitation systems such as functional electrical stimulation, robot therapy, brain-computer interface, and prosthetic devices.},

  abstract     = {For spatiotemporal learning with neural networks, hyperparameters are often set manually by a human expert. This is especially the case with multiple timescale networks that require a careful setting of the values of timescales in order to learn spatiotemporal data. However, this implies a cumbersome trial-and-error process until suitable parameters are found and it reduces the long-term autonomy of artificial agents, such as robots that are controlled by multiple timescale networks. To solve the problem, we propose the evolutionary optimized multiple timescale recurrent neural network (EO-MTRNN) that is inspired by the neural plasticity of the human cortex. Our proposed network uses a method of evolutionary optimization to adjust its timescales and to rewire itself in terms of number of neurons and synapses. Moreover, it does not require additional neural networks for pre- and postprocessing input–output data. We validate our EO-MTRNN by applying it to a proposed benchmark training dataset with single and multiple sequence training cases, as well as by applying it to sensory-motor data from a robot. We compare different configuration modes of the network, and we compare the learning performance between a network configuration with manually set hyperparameters and a configuration with automatically estimated hyperparameters. The results show that automatically estimated hyperparameters yield approximately 43% better performance than manually estimated ones, without overfitting the given teaching data. We also validate the generalization ability by successfully learning data that were not included in the hyperparameter estimation process.},

  abstract     = {Simulations of neural activity are commonly based on differential equations. We address the question what can be achieved with a simplified discrete model. The proposed model resembles artificial neural networks enriched with additional biologically inspired features. A neuron has several states, and the state transitions follow endogenous patterns which roughly correspond to firing behavior observed in biological neurons: oscillatory, tonic, plateauing, etc. Neural interactions consist of two components: synaptic connections and extrasynaptic emission of neurotransmitters. The dynamics is asynchronous and event-based; the events correspond to the changes in neurons activity. This model is innovative in introducing discrete framework for modeling neurotransmitter interactions which play the important role in neuromodulation. We simulate rhythmic activity of small neural ensembles like central pattern generators (CPG). The modeled examples include: the biphasic rhythm generated by the half-center mechanism with the post-inhibitory rebound (like the leech heartbeat CPG), the triphasic rhythm (like in pond snail feeding CPG) and the pattern switch in the system of several neurons (like the switch between ingestion and egestion in Aplysia feeding CPG). The asynchronous dynamics allows to obtain multi-phasic rhythms with phase durations close to their biological prototypes. The perspectives of discrete modeling in biological research are discussed in the conclusion.},

For excitatory coupling, we find that inducing positive correlations has a similar effect to increasing the coupling strength between neurons, while for inhibitory coupling it has the opposite effect.

Control methods are also developed for the new model which increase its transient response speed, control the initial swing order of the forelimbs, and generate different walking turning gait and turning on the spot (turning without moving forward). The simulation results show that the biomechanical model controlled by the new spinal locomotor network model can generate different walking turning and turning on the spot, and can control posture and the initial swing order of the forelimbs. Moreover, the transient response speed of the proposed model is very rapid. This paper thus provides a useful tool for exploring the operational mechanism of the spinal circuitry of the salamander.

The connection between the hippocampus, RSC and the entorhinal cortex is revealed through a novel perspective. We suppose that the path integration is performed by the information coming from RSC. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex then can be built as the result of a modulo projection of RSC activity. In our model, PI is performed by a 1D field of neurons acting as a simple low-pass filter of head direction (HD) cells modulated by the linear velocity of the animal. Our paper focuses on the constraints on the HD cells shape for a good approximation of PI. Recording of neurons on our 1D PI field shows these neurons would not be intuitively interpreted as performing PI. Using inputs coming from a narrow neighbouring projection of our PI field creates place cell-like activities in the RSC when the mouse runs on the treadmill. This can be the result of local self-organizing maps representing blobs of neurons in the RSC (e.g. cortical columns). Other simulations show that accessing the whole PI field would induce place cells whatever the environment is. Since this property is not observed, we conclude that the categorization neurons in the RSC should have access to only a small fraction of the PI field.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous motivated spatial navigation in animals or robots requires the association between spatial location and value. Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179–193, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells’ spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and “hybrid cells” that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.},

  abstract     = {Neurobiological theories of spatial cognition developed with respect to recording data from relatively small and/or simplistic environments compared to animals’ natural habitats. It has been unclear how to extend theoretical models to large or complex spaces. Complementarily, in autonomous systems technology, applications have been growing for distributed control methods that scale to large numbers of low-footprint mobile platforms. Animals and many-robot groups must solve common problems of navigating complex and uncertain environments. Here, we introduce the NeuroSwarms control framework to investigate whether adaptive, autonomous swarm control of minimal artificial agents can be achieved by direct analogy to neural circuits of rodent spatial cognition. NeuroSwarms analogizes agents to neurons and swarming groups to recurrent networks. We implemented neuron-like agent interactions in which mutually visible agents operate as if they were reciprocally connected place cells in an attractor network. We attributed a phase state to agents to enable patterns of oscillatory synchronization similar to hippocampal models of theta-rhythmic (5–12 Hz) sequence generation. We demonstrate that multi-agent swarming and reward-approach dynamics can be expressed as a mobile form of Hebbian learning and that NeuroSwarms supports a single-entity paradigm that directly informs theoretical models of animal cognition. We present emergent behaviors including phase-organized rings and trajectory sequences that interact with environmental cues and geometry in large, fragmented mazes. Thus, NeuroSwarms is a model artificial spatial system that integrates autonomous control and theoretical neuroscience to potentially uncover common principles to advance both domains.},

  abstract     = {An open problem in the cognitive dimensions of navigation concerns how previous exploratory experience is reorganized in order to allow the creation of novel efficient navigation trajectories. This behavior is revealed in the “traveling salesrat problem” (TSP) when rats discover the shortest path linking baited food wells after a few exploratory traversals. We have recently published a model of navigation sequence learning, where sharp wave ripple replay of hippocampal place cells transmit “snippets” of the recent trajectories that the animal has explored to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Cazin et al. in PLoS Comput Biol 15:e1006624, 2019). PFC is modeled as a recurrent reservoir network that is able to assemble these snippets into the efficient sequence (trajectory of spatial locations coded by place cell activation). The model of hippocampal replay generates a distribution of snippets as a function of their proximity to a reward, thus implementing a form of spatial credit assignment that solves the TSP task. The integrative PFC reservoir reconstructs the efficient TSP sequence based on exposure to this distribution of snippets that favors paths that are most proximal to rewards. While this demonstrates the theoretical feasibility of the PFC–HIPP interaction, the integration of such a dynamic system into a real-time sensory–motor system remains a challenge. In the current research, we test the hypothesis that the PFC reservoir model can operate in a real-time sensory–motor loop. Thus, the main goal of the paper is to validate the model in simulated and real robot scenarios. Place cell activation encoding the current position of the simulated and physical rat robot feeds the PFC reservoir which generates the successor place cell activation that represents the next step in the reproduced sequence in the readout. This is input to the robot, which advances to the coded location and then generates de novo the current place cell activation. This allows demonstration of the crucial role of embodiment. If the spatial code readout from PFC is played back directly into PFC, error can accumulate, and the system can diverge from desired trajectories. This required a spatial filter to decode the PFC code to a location and then recode a new place cell code for that location. In the robot, the place cell vector output of PFC is used to physically displace the robot and then generate a new place cell coded input to the PFC, replacing part of the software recoding procedure that was required otherwise. We demonstrate how this integrated sensory–motor system can learn simple navigation sequences and then, importantly, how it can synthesize novel efficient sequences based on prior experience, as previously demonstrated (Cazin et al. 2019). This contributes to the understanding of hippocampal replay in novel navigation sequence formation and the important role of embodiment.},

  abstract     = {Hippocampal offline reactivations during reward-based learning, usually categorized as replay events, have been found to be important for performance improvement over time and for memory consolidation. Recent computational work has linked these phenomena to the need to transform reward information into state-action values for decision making and to propagate it to all relevant states of the environment. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether an integrated reinforcement learning mechanism could account for the variety of awake hippocampal reactivations, including variety in order (forward and reverse reactivated trajectories) and variety in the location where they occur (reward site or decision-point). Here, we present a model-based bidirectional search model which accounts for a variety of hippocampal reactivations. The model combines forward trajectory sampling from current position and backward sampling through prioritized sweeping from states associated with large reward prediction errors until the two trajectories connect. This is repeated until stabilization of state-action values (convergence), which could explain why hippocampal reactivations drastically diminish when the animal’s performance stabilizes. Simulations in a multiple T-maze task show that forward reactivations are prominently found at decision-points while backward reactivations are exclusively generated at reward sites. Finally, the model can generate imaginary trajectories that are not allowed to the agent during task performance. We raise some experimental predictions and implications for future studies of the role of the hippocampo–prefronto–striatal network in learning.},

  abstract     = {We reveal how implementing the homogeneous, multi-scale mapping frameworks observed in the mammalian brain’s mapping systems radically improves the performance of a range of current robotic localization techniques. Roboticists have developed a range of predominantly single- or dual-scale heterogeneous mapping approaches (typically locally metric and globally topological) that starkly contrast with neural encoding of space in mammalian brains: a multi-scale map underpinned by spatially responsive cells like the grid cells found in the rodent entorhinal cortex. Yet the full benefits of a homogeneous multi-scale mapping framework remain unknown in both robotics and biology: in robotics because of the focus on single- or two-scale systems and limits in the scalability and open-field nature of current test environments and benchmark datasets; in biology because of technical limitations when recording from rodents during movement over large areas. New global spatial databases with visual information varying over several orders of magnitude in scale enable us to investigate this question for the first time in real-world environments. In particular, we investigate and answer the following questions: why have multi-scale representations, how many scales should there be, what should the size ratio between consecutive scales be and how does the absolute scale size affect performance? We answer these questions by developing and evaluating a homogeneous, multi-scale mapping framework mimicking aspects of the rodent multi-scale map, but using current robotic place recognition techniques at each scale. Results in large-scale real-world environments demonstrate multi-faceted and significant benefits for mapping and localization performance and identify the key factors that determine performance.},

Studies have also suggested that dorsal place cells are primarily involved in spatial navigation, while ventral place cells are primarily involved in context and emotional encoding. Additionally, recent work has shown that the entire longitudinal axis of the hippocampus may be involved in navigation. Based on the latter, in this paper we present a spatial cognition reinforcement learning model inspired by the multiscale organization of the dorsal–ventral axis of the hippocampus. The model analyzes possible benefits of a multiscale architecture in terms of the learning speed, the path optimality, and the number of cells in the context of spatial navigation. The model is evaluated in a goal-oriented task where simulated rats need to learn a path to the goal from multiple starting locations in various open-field maze configurations. The results show that smaller scales of representation are useful for improving path optimality, whereas larger scales are useful for reducing learning time and the number of cells required. The results also show that combining scales can enhance the performance of the multiscale model, with a trade-off between path optimality and learning time.},

This requires experiences to be encoded alongside the contextual schemas in which they occur. Tse et al. (Science 316(5821):76–82, 2007) showed that new information matching a preexisting schema is learned rapidly. To better understand the neurobiological mechanisms for creating and maintaining schemas, we constructed a biologically plausible neural network to learn context in a spatial memory task. Our model suggests that this occurs through two processing streams of indexing and representation, in which the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus work together to index cortical activity. Additionally, our study shows how neuromodulation contributes to rapid encoding within consistent schemas. The level of abstraction of our model further provides a basis for creating context-dependent memories while preventing catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks.},

  abstract     = {This hybrid of review and personal essay argues that models of visual construction are essential to extend spatial navigation models to models that link episodic memory and imagination. The starting point is the TAM–WG model, combining the Taxon Affordance Model and the World Graph model of spatial navigation. The key here is to reject approaches in which memory is restricted to unanalyzed views from familiar places, and their later recall. Instead, we will seek mechanisms for imagining truly novel scenes and episodes. We thus introduce a specific variant of schema theory and VISIONS, a cooperative computation model of visual scene understanding in which a scene is represented by an assemblage of schema instances with links to lower-level “patches” of relevant visual data. We sketch a new conceptual framework for future modeling, Visual Integration of Diverse Multi-Modal Aspects, by extending VISIONS from static scenes to episodes combining agents, actions and objects and assess its relevance to both navigation and episodic memory. We can then analyze imagination as a constructive process that combines aspects of memories of prior episodes along with other schemas and adjusts them into a coherent whole which, through expectations associated with diverse episodes and schemas, may yield the linkage of episodes that constitutes a dream or a narrative. The result is IBSEN, a conceptual model of Imagination in Brain Systems for Episodes and Navigation. The essay closes by analyzing other papers in this Special Issue to assess to what extent their results relate to the research proposed here.},

We simulated minimal models of unstructured spiking networks in silico, asking whether and how gentle external stimulation might be subsequently reflected in spontaneous activity fluctuations. Consistent with earlier findings in silico and in vitro, we observe a privileged subpopulation of ‘pioneer neurons’ that, by their firing order, reliably encode previous external stimulation. We also confirm that pioneer neurons are ‘sensitive’ in that they are recruited by small fluctuations of population activity. We show that order-based representations rely on a ‘chain’ of pioneer neurons with different degrees of sensitivity and thus constitute an emergent property of collective dynamics. The forming of such representations is greatly favoured by a broadly heterogeneous connection topology—a broad ‘middle class’ in degree of connectedness. In conclusion, we offer a minimal model for the representational role of pioneer neurons, as observed experimentally in vitro. In addition, we show that broadly heterogeneous connectivity enhances the representational capacity of unstructured networks.},

  abstract     = {The 1/f-like gait cycle variability, characterized by temporal changes in stride-time intervals during steady-state human walking, is a well-documented gait characteristic. Such gait fractality is apparent in healthy young adults, but tends to disappear in the elderly and patients with neurological diseases. However, mechanisms that give rise to gait fractality have yet to be fully clarified. We aimed to provide novel insights into neuro-mechanical mechanisms of gait fractality, based on a numerical simulation model of biped walking. A previously developed heel-toe footed, seven-rigid-link biped model with human-like body parameters in the sagittal plane was implemented and expanded. It has been shown that the gait model, stabilized rigidly by means of impedance control with large values of proportional (P) and derivative (D) gains for a linear feedback controller, is destabilized only in a low-dimensional eigenspace, as P and D decrease below and even far below critical values. Such low-dimensional linear instability can be compensated by impulsive, phase-dependent actions of nonlinear controllers (phase resetting and intermittent controllers), leading to the flexible walking with joint impedance in the model being as small as that in humans. Here, we added white noise to the model to examine P-value-dependent stochastic dynamics of the model for small D-values. The simulation results demonstrated that introduction of the nonlinear controllers in the model determined the fractal features of gait for a wide range of the P-values, provided that the model operates near the edge of stability. In other words, neither the model stabilized only by pure impedance control even at the edge of linear stability, nor the model stabilized by specific nonlinear controllers, but with P-values far inside the stability region, could induce gait fractality. Although only limited types of controllers were examined, we suggest that the impulsive nonlinear controllers and criticality could be major mechanisms for the genesis of gait fractality.},

Here we investigate a ball and beam implementation of a dexterity puzzle in which subjects stabilize a ball at the mid-point of a beam by manipulating the angular position of the beam. Stabilizability analysis of different biomechanical models for the ball and beam task with time-delayed proportional-derivative feedback identified the angular position of the beam as the manipulated variable. Consequently, we monitored the changes in the dynamics with learning by measuring changes in the control parameters. Two types of stable motion are possible: node type (nonoscillatory) and spiral type (oscillatory). Both types of motion are observed experimentally and correspond to well-defined regions in the parameter space of the control gains. With practice the control gains for each subject move close to or on the portion of the boundary which separates the node-type and spiral-type solutions and which is associated with the rightmost characteristic exponent of smallest real part. These observations suggest that with learning the control gains for ball and beam balancing change in such a way that minimizes overshoot and the settling time. This study provides an example of how mathematical analysis together with careful experimental observations can shed light onto the early stages of skill acquisition. Since the difficulty of this task depends on the length of the beam, ball and beam balancing tasks may be useful for the rehabilitation of children with dyspraxia and those recovering from a stroke.},

We studied the acquisition of bimanual fine manipulation skills in watchmaking tasks, which require assembly of pieces at millimeter scale. It demands years of training. We contrasted motion kinematics performed by novice apprentices to those of professionals. Fifteen subjects, ten novices and five experts, participated in the study. We recorded force applied on the watch face and kinematics of fingers and arms. Results indicate that expert subjects wisely place their fingers on the tools to achieve higher dexterity. Compared to novices, experts also tend to align task-demanded force application with the optimal force transmission direction of the dominant arm. To understand the cognitive processes underpinning the different coordination patterns across experts and novice subjects, we followed the optimal control theoretical framework and hypothesize that the difference in task performances is caused by changes in the central nervous system’s optimal criteria. We formulated kinematic metrics to evaluate the coordination patterns and exploit inverse optimization approach to infer the optimal criteria. We interpret the human acquisition of novel coordination patterns as an alteration in the composition structure of the central nervous system’s optimal criteria accompanied by the learning process.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we analyze a simplified, dynamical, closed-loop, neuromechanical simulation of insect joint control. We are specifically interested in two elements: (1) how slow muscle fibers may serve as temporal integrators of sensory feedback and (2) the role of common inhibitory (CI) motor neurons in resetting this integration when the commanded position changes, particularly during steady-state walking. Despite the simplicity of the model, we show that slow muscle fibers increase the accuracy of limb positioning, even for motions much shorter than the relaxation time of the fiber; this increase in accuracy is due to the slow dynamics of the fibers; the CI motor neuron plays a critical role in accelerating muscle relaxation when the limb moves to a new position; as in the animal, this architecture enables the control of the stance phase speed, independent of swing phase amplitude or duration, by changing the gain of sensory feedback to the stance phase muscles. We discuss how this relates to other models, and how it could be applied to robotic control.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to integrate different bodies of research including brain traveling waves, brain neuromodulation, neural field modeling and post-stroke language disorders in order to explore the opportunity of implementing model-guided, cortical neuromodulation for the treatment of post-stroke aphasia. Worldwide according to WHO, strokes are the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability. In ischemic stroke, there is not enough blood supply to provide enough oxygen and nutrients to parts of the brain, while in hemorrhagic stroke, there is bleeding within the enclosed cranial cavity. The present paper focuses on ischemic stroke. We first review accumulating observations of traveling waves occurring spontaneously or triggered by external stimuli in healthy subjects as well as in patients with brain disorders. We examine the putative functions of these waves and focus on post-stroke aphasia observed when brain language networks become fragmented and/or partly silent, thus perturbing the progression of traveling waves across perilesional areas. Secondly, we focus on a simplified model based on the current literature in the field and describe cortical traveling wave dynamics and their modulation. This model uses a biophysically realistic integro-differential equation describing spatially distributed and synaptically coupled neural networks producing traveling wave solutions. The model is used to calculate wave parameters (speed, amplitude and/or frequency) and to guide the reconstruction of the perturbed wave. A stimulation term is included in the model to restore wave propagation to a reasonably good level. Thirdly, we examine various issues related to the implementation model-guided neuromodulation in the treatment of post-stroke aphasia given that closed-loop invasive brain stimulation studies have recently produced encouraging results. Finally, we suggest that modulating traveling waves by acting selectively and dynamically across space and time to facilitate wave propagation is a promising therapeutic strategy especially at a time when a new generation of closed-loop cortical stimulation systems is about to arrive on the market.},
