  abstract     = {In this paper we consider complete noncompact Riemannian manifolds (M, g) with nonnegative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, of dimension $$n \ge 3$$ . For every bounded open subset $$\Omega \subset M$$ with smooth boundary, we prove that $$\begin{aligned} \int \limits _{\partial \Omega } \left| \frac{\mathrm{H}}{n-1}\right| ^{n-1} \!\!\!\!\!{\mathrm{d}}\sigma \,\,\ge \,\,{\mathrm{AVR}}(g)\,\big |\mathbb {S}^{n-1}\big |, \end{aligned}$$ where $${\mathrm{H}}$$ is the mean curvature of $$\partial \Omega $$ and $${\mathrm{AVR}}(g)$$ is the asymptotic volume ratio of (M, g). Moreover, the equality holds true if and only if $$(M{{\setminus }}\Omega , g)$$ is isometric to a truncated cone over $$\partial \Omega $$ . An optimal version of Huisken’s Isoperimetric Inequality for 3-manifolds is obtained using this result. Finally, exploiting a natural extension of our techniques to the case of parabolic manifolds, we also deduce an enhanced version of Kasue’s non existence result for closed minimal hypersurfaces in manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature.},

In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the weak- $$A_\infty $$ property, of harmonic measure, and hence of solvability of the $$L^p$$ Dirichlet problem for some finite p. This characterization is obtained under background hypotheses (an interior corkscrew condition, along with Ahlfors–David regularity of the boundary) that are natural, and in a certain sense optimal: we provide counter-examples in the absence of either of them (or even one of the two, upper or lower, Ahlfors–David bounds); moreover, the examples show that the upper and lower Ahlfors–David bounds are each quantitatively sharp.},

As a byproduct, we obtain an example of a homotopically finitely presented DG category (over a field of characteristic zero) that does not have a smooth categorical compactification, giving a negative answer to a question of Toën. This can be interpreted as a lack of resolution of singularities in the noncommutative setup. We also obtain an example of a proper DG category which does not admit a categorical resolution of singularities in the terminology of Kuznetsov and Lunts (Int Math Res Not 2015(13):4536–4625, 2015) (that is, it cannot be embedded into a smooth and proper DG category).},

The purpose of the present paper is to conduct a thorough study on secant varieties of curves by settling several conjectures and revealing interaction between singularities and syzygies. The main results assert that if the degree of the embedding line bundle of a nonsingular curve of genus g is greater than $$2g+2k+p$$ for nonnegative integers k and p, then the k-th secant variety of the curve has normal Du Bois singularities, is arithmetically Cohen–Macaulay, and satisfies the property $$N_{k+2, p}$$ . In addition, the singularities of the secant varieties are further classified according to the genus of the curve, and the Castelnuovo–Mumford regularities are also obtained as well. As one of the main technical ingredients, we establish a vanishing theorem on the Cartesian products of the curve, which may have independent interests and may find applications elsewhere.},

It is well known that $$X:={{\,\mathrm{{\mathrm {Hilb}}}\,}}^{[n]}(S)$$ is a projective, crepant resolution of the symplectic singularity $$\mathbb {C}^{2n}/\Gamma _n$$ , where $$\Gamma _n=\Gamma \wr \mathfrak {S}_n$$ is the wreath product. We prove that every projective, crepant resolution of $$\mathbb {C}^{2n}/\Gamma _n$$ can be realised as the fine moduli space of $$\theta $$ -stable $$\Pi $$ -modules for a fixed dimension vector, where $$\Pi $$ is the framed preprojective algebra of $$\Gamma $$ and $$\theta $$ is a choice of generic stability condition. Our approach uses the linearisation map from GIT to relate wall crossing in the space of $$\theta $$ -stability conditions to birational transformations of X over $$\mathbb {C}^{2n}/\Gamma _n$$ . As a corollary, we describe completely the ample and movable cones of X over $$\mathbb {C}^{2n}/\Gamma _n$$ , and show that the Mori chamber decomposition of the movable cone is determined by an extended Catalan hyperplane arrangement of the ADE root system associated to $$\Gamma $$ by the McKay correspondence. In the appendix, we show that morphisms of quiver varieties induced by variation of GIT quotient are semismall, generalising a result of Nakajima in the case where the quiver variety is smooth.},

  abstract     = {Given a point $$\xi $$ on a complex abelian variety A, its abelian logarithm can be expressed as a linear combination of the periods of A with real coefficients, the Betti coordinates of $$\xi $$ . When $$(A, \xi )$$ varies in an algebraic family, these coordinates define a system of multivalued real-analytic functions. Computing its rank (in the sense of differential geometry) becomes important when one is interested about how often $$\xi $$ takes a torsion value (for instance, Manin’s theorem of the kernel implies that this coordinate system is constant in a family without fixed part only when $$\xi $$ is a torsion section). We compute this rank in terms of the rank of a certain contracted form of the Kodaira–Spencer map associated to $$(A, \xi )$$ (assuming A without fixed part, and $${\mathbb {Z}}\xi $$ Zariski-dense in A), and deduce some explicit lower bounds in special situations. For instance, we determine this rank in relative dimension $$\le 3$$ , and study in detail the case of jacobians of families of hyperelliptic curves. Our main application, obtained in collaboration with Z. Gao, states that if $$A\rightarrow S$$ is a principally polarized abelian scheme of relative dimension g which has no non-trivial endomorphism (on any finite covering), and if the image of S in the moduli space $${{\mathcal {A}}}_g$$ has dimension at least g, then the Betti map of any non-torsion section $$\xi $$ is generically a submersion, so that $$\,\xi ^{-1}A_{\mathrm{tors}}$$ is dense in $$S({\mathbb {C}})$$ .},

The method utilizes many ingredients from our earlier proof of the conjecture for actions by cocompact lattices in $$\mathrm {SL}(m,{\mathbb {R}})$$ (Brown et al. in Zimmer’s conjecture: subexponential growth, measure rigidity, and strong property (T), 2016. arXiv:1608.04995 ) but new ideas are needed to overcome the lack of compactness of the space $$(G \times M)/\Gamma $$ (admitting the induced G-action). Non-compactness allows both measures and Lyapunov exponents to escape to infinity under averaging and a number of algebraic, geometric, and dynamical tools are used control this escape. New ideas are provided by the work of Lubotzky, Mozes, and Raghunathan on the structure of nonuniform lattices and, in particular, of $$\mathrm {SL}(m,{\mathbb {Z}})$$ providing a geometric decomposition of the cusp into rank one directions, whose geometry is more easily controlled. The proof also makes use of a precise quantitative form of non-divergence of unipotent orbits by Kleinbock and Margulis, and an extension by de la Salle of strong property (T) to representations of nonuniform lattices.},

Our argument utilizes the set-up of Faltings’s original proof, but is in spirit closer to the methods of Chabauty and Kim: we replace the use of abelian varieties by a more detailed analysis of the variation of p-adic Galois representations in a family of algebraic varieties. The key inputs into this analysis are the comparison theorems of p-adic Hodge theory, and explicit topological computations of monodromy. By the same methods we show that, in sufficiently large dimension and degree, the set of hypersurfaces in projective space, with good reduction away from a fixed set of primes, is contained in a proper Zariski-closed subset of the moduli space of all hypersurfaces. This uses in an essential way the Ax–Schanuel property for period mappings, recently established by Bakker and Tsimerman.},

We prove the Hodge-theoretic categorification of the integrality conjecture and the wall crossing formula, and furthermore realise the isomorphism in both of these theorems as Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt isomorphisms for the associated cohomological Hall algebra. We do this by defining a perverse filtration on the cohomological Hall algebra, a result of the “hidden properness” of the semisimplification map from the moduli stack of semistable representations of the Jacobi algebra to the coarse moduli space of polystable representations. This enables us to construct a degeneration of the cohomological Hall algebra, for generic stability condition and fixed slope, to a free supercommutative algebra generated by a mixed Hodge structure categorifying the BPS invariants. As a corollary of this construction we furthermore obtain a Lie algebra structure on this mixed Hodge structure—the Lie algebra of BPS invariants—for which the entire cohomological Hall algebra can be seen as the positive part of a Yangian-type quantum group.},

We prove that, for every triangle-free graph G without isolated vertices, the weighted number of graph homomorphisms $$\hom (G, H)$$ satisfies the inequality $$\begin{aligned} \hom (G, H ) \le \prod _{uv \in E(G)} \hom (K_{d_u,d_v}, H )^{1/(d_ud_v)}, \end{aligned}$$ where $$d_u$$ denotes the degree of vertex u in G. In particular, one has $$\begin{aligned} \hom (G, H )^{1/|E(G)|} \le \hom (K_{d,d}, H )^{1/d^2} \end{aligned}$$ for every d-regular triangle-free G. The triangle-free hypothesis on G is best possible. More generally, we prove a graphical Brascamp–Lieb type inequality, where every edge of G is assigned some two-variable function. These inequalities imply tight upper bounds on the partition function of various statistical models such as the Ising and Potts models, which includes independent sets and graph colorings. For graph colorings, corresponding to $$H = K_q$$ , we show that the triangle-free hypothesis on G may be dropped; this is also valid if some of the vertices of $$K_q$$ are looped. A corollary is that among d-regular graphs, $$G = K_{d,d}$$ maximizes the quantity $$c_q(G)^{1/|V(G)|}$$ for every q and d, where $$c_q(G)$$ counts proper q-colorings of G.Finally, we show that if the edge-weight matrix of H is positive semidefinite, then $$\begin{aligned} \hom (G, H) \le \prod _{v \in V(G)} \hom (K_{d_v+1}, H )^{1/(d_v+1)}. \end{aligned}$$ This implies that among d-regular graphs, $$G = K_{d+1}$$ maximizes $$\hom (G, H)^{1/|V(G)|}$$ . For 2-spin Ising models, our results give a complete characterization of extremal graphs: complete bipartite graphs maximize the partition function of 2-spin antiferromagnetic models and cliques maximize the partition function of ferromagnetic models. These results settle a number of conjectures by Galvin–Tetali, Galvin, and Cohen–Csikvári–Perkins–Tetali, and provide an alternate proof to a conjecture by Kahn.},

Solving an asymptotic Plateau problem and producing unique tangent cones at infinity for such cycles, we show in particular that every quasi-isometry between two proper $${\text {CAT}}(0)$$ spaces of asymptotic rank n extends to a class of $$(n-1)$$ -cycles in the Tits boundaries.},

Up to projective transformations, there are three such surfaces: the sphere, the hyperboloid, and the cylinder. Our main result is that a planar graph $$\Gamma $$ is realized as the 1-skeleton of a polyhedron inscribed in the hyperboloid or cylinder if and only if $$\Gamma $$ is realized as the 1-skeleton of a polyhedron inscribed in the sphere and $$\Gamma $$ admits a Hamiltonian cycle. This answers a question asked by Steiner in 1832. Rivin characterized convex polyhedra inscribed in the sphere by studying the geometry of ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic space. We study the case of the hyperboloid and the cylinder by parameterizing the space of convex ideal polyhedra in anti-de Sitter geometry and in half-pipe geometry. Just as the cylinder can be seen as a degeneration of the sphere and the hyperboloid, half-pipe geometry is naturally a limit of both hyperbolic and anti-de Sitter geometry. We promote a unified point of view to the study of the three cases throughout.},

Lindenstrauss proved that minimal systems of mean dimension less than cN for $$c=1/36$$ can be embedded in $$\left( [0,1]^N\right) ^{\mathbb {Z}}$$, and asked what is the optimal value for c. We solve this problem by showing embedding is possible when $$c=1/2$$. The value $$c=1/2$$ is optimal.

In this paper, exploiting a recent variation of the Ratner property, we prove new disjointness phenomena for smooth parabolic flows beyond the homogeneous world. In particular, we establish a general disjointness criterion based on the switchable Ratner property. We then apply this new criterion to study disjointness properties of smooth time changes of horocycle flows and smooth Arnol’d flows on $${\mathbb {T}}^2$$, focusing in particular on disjointness of distinct flow rescalings. As a consequence, we answer a question by Marina Ratner on the Möbius orthogonality of time-changes of horocycle flows. In fact, we prove Möbius orthogonality for all smooth time-changes of horocycle flows and uniquely ergodic realizations of Arnol’d flows considered.},

We demonstrate that f has shadowing if and only if the system $$(f,X)$$ is (conjugate to) the inverse limit of a directed system satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition and consisting of shifts of finite type. In particular, this implies that, in the case that X is the Cantor set, f has shadowing if and only if (f, X) is the inverse limit of a sequence satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition and consisting of shifts of finite type. Moreover, in the general compact metric case, where X is not necessarily totally disconnected, we prove that f has shadowing if $$(f,X)$$ is a factor of the inverse limit of a sequence satisfying the Mittag-Leffler condition and consisting of shifts of finite type by a quotient that almost lifts pseudo-orbits.},

The proof is based on two ingredients: (1) we derive from Franks’ Lemma on free discs that a pseudo-rotation with small rotation number compared to its $$C^1$$ norm must be close to the identity map; (2) using Pesin theory, we obtain an effective finite information version of the Katok closing lemma for an area preserving surface diffeomorphism f, that provides a controlled gap in the possible growth of the derivatives of f between exponential and sub-exponential. Our result on rigidity, together with a KAM theorem by Rüssmann, allow to conclude that analytic pseudo-rotations of the disc or the sphere are never topologically mixing. Due to a structure theorem by Franks and Handel of zero entropy surface diffeomorphisms, it follows that an analytic conservative diffeomorphism of the disc or the sphere that is topologically mixing must have positive topological entropy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the six-vertex model at ice point on an arbitrary three-bundle domain, which is a generalization of the domain-wall ice model on the square (or, equivalently, of a uniformly random alternating sign matrix). We show that this model exhibits the arctic boundary phenomenon, whose boundary is given by a union of explicit algebraic curves. This was originally predicted by Colomo and Sportiello (J Stat Phys 164:1488–1523, 2016) as one of the initial applications of a general heuristic that they introduced for locating arctic boundaries, called the (geometric) tangent method. Our proof uses a probabilistic analysis of non-crossing directed path ensembles to provide a mathematical justification of their tangent method heuristic in this case, which might be of independent interest.},

This covering graph is a skeleton for a space of suitably framed quadratic differentials on the surface, which in turn models the space of Bridgeland stability conditions for the 3-Calabi–Yau category associated to the marked surface. By showing that the relations in the covering groupoid are homotopically trivial when interpreted as loops in the space of stability conditions, we show that this space is simply connected.},

  abstract     = {We study the Newton polytopes of determinants of square matrices defined over rings of twisted Laurent polynomials. We prove that such Newton polytopes are single polytopes (rather than formal differences of two polytopes); this result can be seen as analogous to the fact that determinants of matrices over commutative Laurent polynomial rings are themselves polynomials, rather than rational functions. We also exhibit a relationship between the Newton polytopes and invertibility of the matrices over Novikov rings, thus establishing a connection with the invariants of Bieri–Neumann–Strebel (BNS) via a theorem of Sikorav. We offer several applications: we reprove Thurston’s theorem on the existence of a polytope controlling the BNS invariants of a 3-manifold group; we extend this result to free-by-cyclic groups, and the more general descending HNN extensions of free groups. We also show that the BNS invariants of Poincaré duality groups of type $$\mathtt {F}_{}$$ in dimension 3 and groups of deficiency one are determined by a polytope, when the groups are assumed to be agrarian, that is their integral group rings embed in skew-fields. The latter result partially confirms a conjecture of Friedl. We also deduce the vanishing of the Newton polytopes associated to elements of the Whitehead groups of many groups satisfying the Atiyah conjecture. We use this to show that the $$L^2$$-torsion polytope of Friedl–Lück is invariant under homotopy. We prove the vanishing of this polytope in the presence of amenability, thus proving a conjecture of Friedl–Lück–Tillmann.},

The second of these results is proved by showing that for any finite forest the associated right-angled Artin group embeds into a one-relator group. Combining this with a result of Lohrey and Steinberg (J Algebra 320(2):728–755, 2008), we use this to prove that there is a one-relator group containing a fixed finitely generated submonoid in which the membership problem is undecidable. To prove (1) a new construction is introduced which uses the one-relator group and submonoid in which membership is undecidable from (2) to construct a one-relator inverse monoid $$\mathrm {Inv}\langle A\,|\,w=1 \rangle $$ with undecidable word problem. Furthermore, this method allows the construction of an E-unitary one-relator inverse monoid of this form with undecidable word problem. The results in this paper answer a problem originally posed by Margolis et al. (in: Semigroups and their applications, Reidel, Dordrecht, pp. 99–110, 1987).},

  abstract     = {We prove a new effective Chebotarev density theorem for Galois extensions $$L/\mathbb {Q}$$ that allows one to count small primes (even as small as an arbitrarily small power of the discriminant of L); this theorem holds for the Galois closures of “almost all” number fields that lie in an appropriate family of field extensions. Previously, applying Chebotarev in such small ranges required assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. The error term in this new Chebotarev density theorem also avoids the effect of an exceptional zero of the Dedekind zeta function of L, without assuming GRH. We give many different “appropriate families,” including families of arbitrarily large degree. To do this, we first prove a new effective Chebotarev density theorem that requires a zero-free region of the Dedekind zeta function. Then we prove that almost all number fields in our families yield such a zero-free region. The innovation that allows us to achieve this is a delicate new method for controlling zeroes of certain families of non-cuspidalL-functions. This builds on, and greatly generalizes the applicability of, work of Kowalski and Michel on the average density of zeroes of a family of cuspidalL-functions. A surprising feature of this new method, which we expect will have independent interest, is that we control the number of zeroes in the family of L-functions by bounding the number of certain associated fields with fixed discriminant. As an application of the new Chebotarev density theorem, we prove the first nontrivial upper bounds for $$\ell $$-torsion in class groups, for all integers $$\ell \ge 1$$, applicable to infinite families of fields of arbitrarily large degree.},

  abstract     = {The present paper presents a counterexample to the sequential weak density of smooth maps between two manifolds $$\mathcal {M}$$ and $$\mathcal {N}$$ in the Sobolev space $$W^{1, p} (\mathcal {M}, \mathcal {N})$$, in the case p is an integer. It has been shown (see e.g. Bethuel in Acta Math 167:153–206, 1991) that, if $$p&lt;\dim \mathcal {M}$$ is not an integer and the [p]-th homotopy group $$\pi _{[p]}(\mathcal {N})$$ of $$\mathcal {N}$$ is not trivial, [p] denoting the largest integer less then p, then smooth maps are not sequentially weakly dense in $$W^{1, p} (\mathcal {M}, \mathcal {N})$$. On the other hand, in the case $$p&lt; \dim \mathcal {M}$$ is an integer, examples of specific manifolds $$\mathcal {M}$$ and $$\mathcal {N}$$ have been provided where smooth maps are actually sequentially weakly dense in $$W^{1, p} (\mathcal {M}, \mathcal {N})$$ with $$\pi _{p}(\mathcal {N})\not = 0$$, although they are not dense for the strong convergence. This is the case for instance for $$\mathcal {M}=\mathbb {B}^m$$, the standard ball in $$\mathbb {R}^m$$, and $$\mathcal {N}=\mathbb {S}^p$$ the standard sphere of dimension p, for which $$\pi _{p}(\mathcal {N}) =\mathbb {Z}$$. The main result of this paper shows however that such a property does not holds for arbitrary manifolds $$\mathcal {N}$$ and integers p. Our counterexample deals with the case $$p=3$$, $$\dim \mathcal {M}\ge 4$$ and $$\mathcal {N}=\mathbb {S}^2$$, for which the homotopy group $$\pi _3(\mathbb {S}^2)=\mathbb {Z}$$ is related to the Hopf fibration. We explicitly construct a map which is not weakly approximable in $$W^{1,3}(\mathcal {M}, \mathbb {S}^2)$$ by maps in $$C^\infty (\mathcal {M}, \mathbb {S}^2)$$. One of the central ingredients in our argument is related to issues in branched transportation and irrigation theory in the critical exponent case, which are possibly of independent interest. As a byproduct of our method, we also address some questions concerning the $$\mathbb {S}^3$$-lifting problem for $$\mathbb {S}^2$$-valued Sobolev maps.},

This solves an open problem proposed by van Strien (Discrete Contin Dyn Syst 27(2):557–588, 2010) and Lyubich and Martens (Invent Math 186(1):115–189, 2011). We partition the phase space of a Hénon-like map into two regions: the good region and the bad region. The good region is where the method of proof for unimodal maps applies to Hénon-like maps, while the bad region is where serious difficulties occur. These difficulties are resolved by the Two-Row Lemma, an inequality that relates the contraction of areas to the contraction of bad regions. After analyzing the competition of the two types of contraction, we show that the case of bad regions happens at most finitely many times and complete the proof. As an application, the theorem enriches our understanding of the topological structure of the heteroclinic web: the union of the stable manifolds of periodic orbits forms a dense set in the domain.},

  abstract     = {We prove that every bounded stable solution of $$\begin{aligned} (-\Delta )^{1/2} u + f(u) =0 \qquad \text{ in } \mathbb {R}^3 \end{aligned}$$is a 1D profile, i.e., $$u(x)= \phi (e\cdot x)$$ for some $$e\in {\mathbb {S}}^2$$, where $$\phi :\mathbb {R}\rightarrow \mathbb {R}$$ is a nondecreasing bounded stable solution in dimension one. Equivalently, stable critical points of boundary reaction problems in $$\mathbb {R}^{d+1}_+=\mathbb {R}^{d+1}\cap \{x_{d+1}\ge 0\}$$ of the form $$\begin{aligned} \int _{\{x_{d+1\ge 0}\}} \frac{1}{2} |\nabla U|^2 \,dx\, dx_{d+1} + \int _{\{x_{d+1}=0\}} F(U) \,dx \end{aligned}$$are 1D when $$d=3.$$ These equations have been studied since the 1940’s in crystal dislocations. Also, as it happens for the Allen–Cahn equation, the associated energies enjoy a $$\Gamma $$-convergence result to the perimeter functional. In particular, when $$f(u)=u^3-u$$ (or equivalently when $$F(U)=\frac{1}{4} (1-U^2)^2 $$), our result implies the analogue of the De Giorgi conjecture for the half-Laplacian in dimension 4, namely that monotone solutions are 1D. Note that our result is a PDE version of the fact that stable embedded minimal surfaces in $$\mathbb {R}^3$$ are planes. It is interesting to observe that the corresponding statement about stable solutions to the Allen–Cahn equation (namely, when the half-Laplacian is replaced by the classical Laplacian) is still unknown for $$d=3$$.},

  abstract     = {Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and the Brownian map (TBM) are two distinct models of measure-endowed random surfaces. LQG is defined in terms of a real parameter $$\gamma $$, and it has long been believed that when $$\gamma = \sqrt{8/3}$$, the LQG sphere should be equivalent (in some sense) to TBM. However, the LQG sphere comes equipped with a conformal structure, and TBM comes equipped with a metric space structure, and endowing either one with the other’s structure has been an open problem for some time. This paper is the first in a three-part series that unifies LQG and TBM by endowing each object with the other’s structure and showing that the resulting laws agree. The present work considers a growth process called quantum Loewner evolution (QLE) on a $$\sqrt{8/3}$$-LQG surface $${\mathcal {S}}$$ and defines $$d_{{\mathcal {Q}}}(x,y)$$ to be the amount of time it takes QLE to grow from $$x \in {\mathcal {S}}$$ to $$y \in {\mathcal {S}}$$. We show that $$d_{{\mathcal {Q}}}(x,y)$$ is a.s. determined by the triple $$({\mathcal {S}},x,y)$$ (which is far from clear from the definition of QLE) and that $$d_{{\mathcal {Q}}}$$ a.s. satisfies symmetry (i.e., $$d_{{\mathcal {Q}}}(x,y) = d_{{\mathcal {Q}}}(y,x)$$) for a.a. (x, y) pairs and the triangle inequality for a.a. triples. This implies that $$d_{{\mathcal {Q}}}$$ is a.s. a metric on any countable sequence sampled i.i.d. from the area measure on $${\mathcal {S}}$$. We establish several facts about the law of this metric, which are in agreement with similar facts known for TBM. The subsequent papers will show that this metric a.s. extends uniquely and continuously to the entire $$\sqrt{8/3}$$-LQG surface and that the resulting measure-endowed metric space is TBM.},
