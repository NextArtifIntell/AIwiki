  abstract     = {Predictive algorithms are powerful tools to support infection surveillance plans based on the monitoring of vector abundance. In this article, we explore the use of genetic programming (GP) to build a predictive model of mosquito abundance based on environmental and climatic variables. We claim, in fact, that the heterogeneity and complexity of this kind of dataset demands algorithms capable of discovering complex relationships among variables. For this reason, we benchmarked GP performance with state of the art machine learning predictive algorithms. In order to provide a real exploitable model of mosquito abundance, we trained GP and the other algorithms on mosquito collections from 2002 to 2005 and we tested the predictive ability in 2006 collections. Results reveal that, among the studied methods, GP has the best performance in terms of accuracy and generalization ability. Moreover, the intrinsic feature selection and readability of the solution provided by GP offer the possibility of a biological interpretation of the model which highlights known or new behaviours responsible for mosquito abundance. GP, therefore, reveals to be a promising tool in the field of ecological modelling, opening the way to the use of a vector based GP approach (VE-GP) which may be more appropriate and beneficial for the problems in analysis.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning (TL) is the process by which some aspects of a machine learning model generated on a source task is transferred to a target task, to simplify the learning required to solve the target. TL in Genetic Programming (GP) has not received much attention, since it is normally assumed that an evolved symbolic expression is specifically tailored to a problem’s data and thus cannot be used in other problems. The goal of this work is to present a broad and diverse study of TL in GP, considering a varied set of source and target tasks, and dealing with questions that have received little, or no attention, in previous GP literature. In particular, this work studies the performance of transferred solutions when the source and target tasks are from different domains, and when they do not share a similar input feature space. Additionally, the relationship between the success and failure of transferred solutions is studied, considering different source and target tasks. Finally, the predictability of TL performance is analyzed for the first time in GP literature. GP-based constructive induction of features is used to carry out the study, a wrapper-based approach where GP is used to construct feature transformations and an additional learning algorithm is used to fit the final model. The experimental work presents several notable results and contributions. First, TL is capable of generating solutions that outperform, in many cases, baseline methods in classification and regression tasks. Second, it is shown that some problems are good source problems while others are good targets in a TL system. Third, the transferability of solutions is not necessarily symmetric between two problems. Finally, results show that it is possible to predict the success of TL in some cases, particularly in classification tasks.},

Although it was designed to be a multimodal optimization method, recent tests have revealed its suitability for unimodal optimization. The definition of Niching MG-PMA is provided in a detailed fashion, along with an in-depth explanation of two novelties in our implementation: the feedback of initial parameters and the domain constraints using periodic boundary conditions. These ideas can be potentially useful for other optimization techniques. The method is tested on the basis of the CEC’2015 benchmark functions. Statistical analysis shows that Niching MG-PMA performs similarly to the winners of the competition even without any parametrization towards the benchmark, indicating that the method is robust and applicable to a wide range of problems.},

Multidimensional genetic programming is a useful variant of genetic programming for this task because it represents candidate solutions as sets of programs. These sets of programs expose additional information that can be exploited for building block identification. In this work, we discuss this architecture and others in terms of their propensity for allowing heuristic search to utilize information during the evolutionary process. We investigate methods for biasing the components of programs that are promoted in order to guide search towards useful and complementary feature spaces. We study two main approaches: (1) the introduction of new objectives and (2) the use of specialized semantic variation operators. We find that a semantic crossover operator based on stagewise regression leads to significant improvements on a set of regression problems. The inclusion of semantic crossover produces state-of-the-art results in a large benchmark study of open-source regression problems in comparison to several state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and other genetic programming frameworks. Finally, we look at the collinearity and complexity of the data representations produced by different methods, in order to assess whether relevant, concise, and independent factors of variation can be produced in application.},

  abstract     = {Manifold learning techniques have become increasingly valuable as data continues to grow in size. By discovering a lower-dimensional representation (embedding) of the structure of a dataset, manifold learning algorithms can substantially reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. However, state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms are opaque in how they perform this transformation. Understanding the way in which the embedding relates to the original high-dimensional space is critical in exploratory data analysis. We previously proposed a Genetic Programming method that performed manifold learning by evolving mappings that are transparent and interpretable. This method required the dimensionality of the embedding to be known a priori, which makes it hard to use when little is known about a dataset. In this paper, we substantially extend our previous work, by introducing a multi-objective approach that automatically balances the competing objectives of manifold quality and dimensionality. Our proposed approach is competitive with a range of baseline and state-of-the-art manifold learning methods, while also providing a range (front) of solutions that give different trade-offs between quality and dimensionality. Furthermore, the learned models are shown to often be simple and efficient, utilising only a small number of features in an interpretable manner.},

Variation occurs at the genotypic level but fitness is evaluated at the phenotypic level, therefore, this mapping determines if and how variations are effectively translated into quality improvements. In evolutionary algorithms, this mapping has often been observed as highly redundant, i.e., multiple genotypes can map to the same phenotype, as well as heterogeneous, i.e., some phenotypes are represented by a large number of genotypes while some phenotypes only have few. We numerically study the redundant genotype–phenotype mapping of a simple Boolean linear genetic programming system and quantify the mutational connections among phenotypes using tools of complex network analysis. The analysis yields several interesting statistics of the phenotype network. We show the evidence and provide explanations for the observation that some phenotypes are much more difficult to find as the target of a search than others. Our study provides a quantitative analysis framework to better understand the genotype–phenotype map, and the results may be utilized to inspire algorithm design that allows the search of a difficult target to be more effective.},

  abstract     = {Lexicase parent selection filters the population by considering one random training case at a time, eliminating any individual with an error for the current case that is worse than the best error of any individual in the selection pool, until a single individual remains. This process often stops before considering all training cases, meaning that it will ignore the error values on any cases that were not yet considered. Lexicase selection can therefore select specialist individuals that have high errors on some training cases, if they have low errors on others and those errors come near the start of the random list of cases used for the parent selection event in question. We hypothesize here that selecting such specialists, which may have high total error, plays an important role in lexicase selection’s observed performance advantages over error-aggregating parent selection methods such as tournament selection, which select specialists less frequently. We conduct experiments examining this hypothesis, and find that lexicase selection’s performance and diversity maintenance degrade when we deprive it of the ability to select specialists. We also conduct experiments with a form of tournament selection that has been modified to allow for the selection of specialists, and find that it performs better than ordinary tournament selection, but not as well as lexicase selection. These findings, and other data that we present here, help explain the improved performance of lexicase selection compared to tournament selection, and suggest that specialists help drive evolution with lexicase selection toward global solutions.},

Experimental results from symbolic regression problems show that the introduction of the $$\mu \times \lambda$$ EA and HGT events improve the performance of EGGP. Comparisons with genetic programming and Cartesian genetic programming strongly favour our proposed approach. We also investigate the effect of using HGT events in neuroevolution tasks.

  abstract     = {Since the early nineties the lack of scalability of fitness evaluation has been the main bottleneck preventing the adoption of evolutionary algorithms for logic circuits synthesis. Recently, various formal approaches such as SAT and BDD solvers have been introduced to this field to overcome this issue. This made it possible to optimise complex circuits consisting of hundreds of inputs and thousands of gates. Unfortunately, we are facing another problem—scalability of representation. The efficiency of the evolutionary optimization applied at the global level deteriorates with the increasing complexity. To overcome this issue, we propose to apply the concept of local resynthesis in this work. Local resynthesis is an iterative process based on the extraction of smaller sub-circuits from a complex circuit that are optimized locally and implanted back to the original circuit. When applied appropriately, this approach can mitigate the problem of scalability of representation. Two complementary approaches to the extraction of the sub-circuits are presented and evaluated in this work. The evaluation is done on a set of highly optimized complex benchmark problems representing various real-world controllers, logic and arithmetic circuits. The experimental results show that the evolutionary resynthesis provides better results compared to globally operating evolutionary optimization. In more than 85\% cases, a substantially higher number of redundant gates was removed while keeping the computational effort at the same level. A huge improvement was achieved especially for the arithmetic circuits. On average, the proposed method was able to remove 25.1\% more gates.},

As the general solution to a computational problem is to write a computer program, and given that genetic programming can automatically generate a computer program, researchers in the field of genetic programming refer to its ability to automatically solve problems. Genetic programming has also been described as an “invention machine” that is capable of generating human-competitive solutions. We argue that the majority of success and focus of our field has not actually been as a result of automatic programming. We set out to challenge the genetic programming community to refocus our research towards the objective of automatic programming, and to do so in a manner that embraces a wider perspective encompassing the related fields of, for example, artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, optimisation and software engineering.},

Additionally, it prompts research questions around evolving complex behavior by expressing different abstractions with GP and opportunities to reconnect to the machine learning, artificial life, agent-based modeling and cyber security communities.

Throughout the development of EC methods, since the early 1990s, a small number of researchers have considered aesthetic problems such as the act of composing music alongside other more traditional problem domains. Over the years, interest in these aesthetic or artistic domains has grown significantly. We review the implementation of GP and EC for music composition in terms of the compositional task undertaken, the algorithm used, the representation of the individuals and the fitness measure employed. In these aesthetic studies we note that there are more variations or generalisations in the algorithmic implementation in comparison to traditional GP experiments; even if GP is not explicitly stated, many studies use representations that are distinctly GP-like. We determine that there is no single compositional challenge and no single best evolutionary method with which to approach the act of music composition. We consider autonomous composition as a computationally creative act and investigate the suitability of EC methods to the search for creativity. We conclude that the exploratory nature of evolutionary methods are highly appropriate for a wide variety of compositional tasks and propose that the development and study of GP and EC methods on creative tasks such as music composition should be encouraged.},

A particular feature of the GP literature since then has been a strong interest in the application of GP to real-world problem domains. One application domain which has attracted significant attention is that of finance and economics, with several hundred papers from this subfield being listed in the GP bibliography. In this article we outline why finance and economics has been a popular application area for GP and briefly indicate the wide span of this work. However, despite this research effort there is relatively scant evidence of the usage of GP by the mainstream finance community in academia or industry. We speculate why this may be the case, describe what is needed to make this research more relevant from a finance perspective, and suggest some future directions for the application of GP in finance and economics.},

The purpose of natural language processing is to allow us to communicate with computers in natural language. Among the problems addressed in the area is, for example, the extraction of information, which draws relevant data from unstructured texts written in natural language. There are also domains of application of particular relevance because of the difficulty in dealing with the corresponding documents, such as opinion mining in social networks, or because of the need for high precision in the information extracted, such as the biomedical domain. There have been proposals to apply genetic programming techniques in several of these areas. This tour allows us to observe the potential—not yet fully exploited—of such applications. We also review some cases in which genetic programming can provide information that is absent from other approaches, revealing its ability to provide easy to interpret results, in form of programs or functions. Finally, we identify some important challenges in the area.},
