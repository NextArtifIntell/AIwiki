In the previous work, the local and global stability of the unique positive equilibrium point of this model were established under some sufficient conditions. Our objective is to re-establish the stability of this equilibrium point without these sufficient conditions. For this purpose, we propose a novel approach to show that the sufficient conditions proposed in the previous work are completely freed. More clearly, we use a well-known stability theorem of continuous-time nonlinear cascade systems and Lyapunov stability theorem to prove that the unique positive equilibrium point is asymptotically stable if it exists. Furthermore, the global stability of the boundary equilibrium point is also established based on the approach. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed to confirm the validity of the constructed theoretical results. The results indicate that there is a good agreement between the numerical simulations and theoretical results.},

The convergence analysis of the proposed scheme is established under certain necessary conditions, which indicates that the methods possess at least fourth-order convergence. The theoretical discussions show that the convergence order improves from 4 to 5 for a particular parameter choice. We prove that the sequence of approximations generated by the family satisfies the commutative property of matrices, provided the initial matrix commutes with the matrix under consideration. Some real-world and academic problems are chosen to validate our methods for solving the linear systems arising from statically determinate truss problems, steady-state analysis of a system of reactors, and elliptic partial differential equations. Moreover, we include a wide variety of large sparse test matrices obtained from the matrix market library. The performance measures used are the number of iterations, computational order of convergence, residual norm, efficiency index, and the computational time. The numerical results obtained are compared with some of the existing robust methods. It is demonstrated that our method gives improved results in terms of computational speed and efficiency.},

The main presumption is to consider the existence of two prey types with different behaviors. The first, has a social behavior and takes the advantage of living in group for the purpose of defending each others, and the second one has a solitary behavior. A mathematical approach is used to study this effect, where the local stability and bifurcation analysis are examined. Indeed, we establish that the system under consideration has a rich dynamics such as Hopf bifurcation in both the absence and the presence of time lags. Further the stability of the periodic solution generated by the presence of the time lags are discussed using the normal form.

The positivity and boundedness of solutions along with existence criterion of the non-negative equilibrium points and their local stability analysis have been performed. Hopf-bifurcation analysis with direction around the co-existence equilibrium point is also performed and it is found that the interference competition rate leads the system to Hopf bifurcation and increases the stable co-existence of all the populations. Furthermore, the predator’s induced fear and infection rate among prey species importantly determine the dynamical complexity of the system. Analytical outcomes of the model system suggest that density of infected prey is directly proportional to the level of fear induced by the predator. Extensive numerical simulations have been carried out to validate all the analytical findings. Finally, Hopf-bifurcation curves of co-dimension two are drawn (with special empathises on interference competition rate) to detect various generalised Hopf-bifurcation and zero Hopf-bifurcation points and stability region of the system.},

During the modeling process, it is expected that the disease spreads only due to get in touch with the susceptible and infected class only. It is also assumed that due to the effect of vaccination, the total human population forms a separate class and avoids contact with the infection. The dynamical behaviors of the system have been explored by using the stability theory of differential equations and numerical simulations. The local and global stability of the system for both equilibrium states under certain conditions has been studied. We have set up a threshold condition in the language of the vaccine-induced reproduction number $$R(\alpha _{1})$$ , which is fewer than unity, the disease dies in the absence of the infected population, otherwise, the infection remains in the population. Furthermore, it is found that vaccine coverage has a substantial effect on the basic reproduction number. Also, by continuous efforts and effectiveness of vaccine coverage, the disease can be eradicated. It is also found a more sensitive parameter for the transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus by using sensitivity analysis. In addition, numerical results are used to investigate the effect of some parameters happening the control of JE infection, for justification of analytical results.},

The aim is to maximize the number of individuals subjected to quarantine and trying to reduce the number of the infected individuals and the infected animals. Pontryagin’s maximum principle in discrete time is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method. The numerical simulation is carried out using Matlab. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was calculated to investigate the cost-effectiveness of all possible combinations of the four control measures. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we show that control of protecting susceptible individuals, preventing their contact with the infected individuals and encouraging the exposed individuals to join quarantine centers provides the most cost-effective strategy to control the disease.},

By choosing different and appropriate step sizes for these two directions, the iterates stop in the Ai–Zhang’s wide neighborhood.

Secondly, the activation functions adopted in CNNs are Gaussian-wavelet-type activation functions for the first time, which have great preponderance in network optimization and storage capacity. Furthermore, the settling time with upper bound of the system to achieve fixed-time synchronization can be explicitly evaluated, which is irrelevant to the initial value of the system.

The weight of a RDF is the sum $$f(V) = \sum _{v \in V}f(v)$$ . The minimum weight of a RDF is called the Roman domination number and is denoted by $$\gamma _{R}(G)$$ . Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the Roman domination problem (RDP) is to check whether G has a RDF of weight at most k. The RDP is known to be NP-complete for bipartite graphs. We strengthen this result by showing that this problem remains NP-complete for two subclasses of bipartite graphs namely, star convex bipartite graphs and comb convex bipartite graphs. We show that $$\gamma _{R}(G)$$ is linear time solvable for bounded tree-width graphs, chain graphs and threshold graphs, a subclass of split graphs. The minimum Roman domination problem (MRDP) is to find a RDF of minimum weight in the input graph. We show that the MRDP for star convex bipartite graphs and comb convex bipartite graphs cannot be approximated within $$(1 - \epsilon ) \ln |V|$$ for any $$\epsilon &gt; 0$$ unless $$NP \subseteq DTIME(|V|^{O(\log \log |V|)})$$ and also propose a $$2(1+\ln (\varDelta +1))$$ -approximation algorithm for the MRDP, where $$\varDelta $$ is the maximum degree of G. Finally, we show that the MRDP is APX-complete for graphs with maximum degree 5.},

In the absence of diffusion, existence conditions of biologically feasible equilibrium points with their stability properties and bifurcations have been discussed. We observe that the non-diffusive system exhibits a variety of bifurcations such as saddle-node, transcritical and undergoes for a supercritical Hopf-bifurcation. In the spatio-temporal system, all possible conditions for Turing instability are derived. The complex behaviour of the system is shown through some interesting numerical examples. Phase portraits, time evolution diagrams, and numerical bifurcation diagrams show the ecological complexity of the degraded lake ecosystem. Diffusion driven spatio-temporal complexity is investigated with the help of pattern formulation. Various spatial patterns reveal that degradation has the potential to alter fish spatial distributions in the lake.},

Spatial derivatives are discretized by finite differences and Petrov–Galerkin approximations. The work-precision and error—CPU time plots, as the dependence of CPU time on space grid resolution, are considered. Also, the optimized method compared with other two-derivative methods.

We have also investigated the model in the absence of Allee effect and corresponding bifurcation diagram has been presented to show the dynamical changes in the system. Then we compare the properties of the ratio dependent prey-predator model with and without the Allee effect and show that Allee effect has a significant role in the dynamics. Allee effect can preserve local extinction of populations and suppress the stability of interior equilibrium point. Finally, all the analytical results are validated with the help of numerical simulations.},

How to update the reducts based on the original information is an important problem since it can help to improve the efficiency of knowledge discovery. This paper provides the definitions of the coarsening and refinement of a covering element in the dynamic fuzzy $$\beta $$ -covering approximation space. Then approaches for updating the reducts by the relation character matrix are discussed when coarsening and refining a covering element. And the corresponding algorithms for computing new reducts are derived. Finally, several examples were given to illustrate the validity of the proposed approaches.},

We establish a superconvergence result of the NIPG method, that is, the proposed method is parameter-uniformly convergent with the order almost $$(k+1)$$ on the Shishkin mesh and $$(k+1)$$ on the Bakhvalov mesh and on the exponentially graded mesh in the energy norm, where k is the order of the polynomials. Numerical results comparing the three different types of meshes are presented at the end of the article supporting the theoretical error estimates.},

We consider here an asymptotic limit for the Green–Naghdi equations in KdV scale, that is the Boussinesq system. The derivation of the KdV equation with uneven bottom under the influence of surface tension has been established. Indeed, this derivation is obtained in a formal way by using the Whitham technique, then the analytic solution to this equation has been obtained in case of flat bottom. However, in case of uneven bottom an $$H^s$$ -consistent solution has been obtained. Also, an $$H^s$$ -consistent solution for the Boussinesq system has been established, taking into consideration the influence of surface tension and uneven bottom. Finally, we confirmed the obtained theoretical results of this paper numerically, by devoting the last section to make a numerical validation. Moreover, analytic solutions to the KdV $$\sigma $$ and Boussinesq system were established in case of several bottom parametrization including the linear one.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to present novel algorithms for solving the multiple attribute decision-making problems under the neutrosophic set environment. Single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets are the important mechanisms for directing the decision-making queries with unknown and indeterminant data by employing a degree of “acceptance”, “indeterminacy”, and “non-acceptance” in quantitative terms. Also, to describe the behavior of the decision-maker objectively (in terms of probability) and subjectively (in terms of weights), a concept of probabilistic information plays a dominant role in the investigation. Keeping these features in mind, this paper presents several probabilistic and immediate probability-based averaging and geometric aggregation operators for the collection of the single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets. The advantage of these proposed operators is that it simultaneously combines the objective and subjective behavior of the decision-maker during the process. The various salient features of the proposed operators are studied. Later, we develop two new algorithms based on the aggregation operators to solve multiple attribute decision-making problems with single-valued and interval neutrosophic sets features. A numerical example related to the demonetization is given to demonstrate the presented approaches, and the advantages, as well as comparative analysis, are given to shows its influence over existing approaches.},

The complexity of the pathogenesis of dengue virus and the limitations of biological knowledge have been barriers to completely understanding the progress of this disease. To address this concern, we developed a mathematical model of the immune response to eliminate dengue virus. The model considered both cellular and humoral immune responses, and we evaluated their contributions to the clearance of dengue virus.We also performed global sensitivity analysis and parameters estimation using clinical data. We found the global stability for virus-free equilibrium and for the virus-presence equilibrium, we concluded that to avoid oscillations in the model and to control the viral load, a strong proliferation of cytotoxic cells must prevail. However, if there exists a weak proliferation of cytotoxic cells, the way to avoid instabilities is to either inhibit the differentiation of T-CD4+ helper cells in Th1 cells or increase the proliferation of B cells.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a method of so-called q-Newton’s type descent direction for solving unconstrained multiobjective optimization problems. The algorithm presented in this paper is implemented by applying an independent parameter q (quantum) in an Armijo-like rule to compute the step length which guarantees that the value of the objective function decreases at every iteration. The search processes gradually shift from global in the beginning to local as the algorithm converges due to q-gradient. The algorithm is experimented on 41 benchmark/test functions which are unimodal and multi-modal with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 50 different dimensions. The performance of the proposed method is confirmed by comparing with three existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a singular phytoplankton–zooplankton model with fuzzy parameters, refuge, fishery protection and harvesting is studied by regarding the imprecise biological parameters as one form of triangular fuzzy number. By using the utility function method, the transformed differential equation is reduced to a differential equation. In absence of economic profit, the existence of positive equilibria, local stability and global stability for the interior equilibrium of the present differential system are discussed, the conditions of Hopf bifurcation occurring at the positive equilibrium are given, and the corresponding nonlinear feedback controller is designed to eliminate Hopf bifurcation. In presence of economic profit, the corresponding differential algebraic model is proposed and some conditions of the existence of the interior equilibrium are derived. By regarding economic profit as bifurcation parameter, singular induced bifurcation occurring is investigated, and a linear controller is designed to remove such bifurcation. Furthermore, Pontryagin’s maximum principle has been used to obtain optimal harvesting policy to maximize the benefit as well as conservation of the ecosystem. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to demonstrate our theoretical results after each part. Results show that imprecise parameters not only affect the interior equilibrium and the bionomic equilibrium of system, but also affect the critical value of bifurcation and branch range.},

Mathematical results like positivity and boundedness of the solutions of fractional-order predator–prey model is presented. Conditions for local and global stability of different equilibrium points are proved. It is shown that there may exist fractional-order-dependent instability through Hopf bifurcation. We have determined an extra stability region in the lower range of habitat complexity where all populations coexist in stable state for some fractional-order values but unstable for integer-order value. Dynamics of the discrete fractional-order model is shown to be more complex and depends on both the step-size and fractional-order. It shows Hopf bifurcation, flip bifurcation and chaos with respect to the step-size. Several examples are presented to substantiate the analytical results.},

  abstract     = {Worldwide, agricultural crops are vulnerable to insects. During the crop season, insects target plants especially leaves for food and thus harm the agricultural crops. This reduces agricultural production and therefore effects the economy of farmers. To overcome this problem, nowadays farmers spray insecticides on crops to reduce the density of insects. In this paper, a nonlinear mathematical model is formulated to assess the impacts of insecticides on insects and crop production. In the modeling process, it is presumed that the agricultural crops grow logistically and the growth rate of the insect population wholly depends on the agricultural crops. As the excess use of insecticides on crops is harmful to agricultural farms and human health, therefore we have made an assumption that the spray rate of insecticides to kill insects is proportional to the density of insects. The feasibility of all the possible equilibria is shown and their stability properties are discussed. Keeping in mind the nonlinearity of the formulated model and different time scales of the participating variables, we have constructed a non-standard finite difference scheme by discretizing the system. It is shown that the proposed numerical scheme is convergent with second-order accuracy. Numerical simulation by using our computational scheme has been also presented to support the analytical findings. Using the approach of global sensitivity analysis, we have identified the key parameters for the formulation of effective control strategies necessary to combat the insect population and increase the crop production. Our findings suggest that to gain the desired crop production, the rate of spraying and the quality of insecticides are much important.},

In the model, the growth rate of the aquatic population is taken as a function of two water quality indicators: temperature and dissolved oxygen. It is considered in the model that greenhouse gases increase the water temperature due to which the level of dissolved oxygen decreases and also consumption rate of dissolved oxygen by the species increases, causing a reduction in the aquatic population density. Stability analysis of the mathematical model is carried out and also numerical simulation is performed with hypothetical data. From the analysis of the model, it is shown that if the emission rate of greenhouse gases increases then the equilibrium density of the aquatic population decreases. Further, it is noted that as the dissolved oxygen requirement necessary for the survival of the aquatic population increases because of elevated water temperature then the equilibrium density of the aquatic population decreases.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic system of a structure utilized with visco-elastic dampers can be modeled by fractional differential equations. All the resulted systems of fractional differential equations can be represented in a state space and can be transformed into a system of multi-term fractional differential equations of order 1. Considering the presence of indeterministic exogenous force like earthquake we need powerful, convergent and reliable numerical methods to simulate the response of this dynamical systems. Therefore, spline collocations method has been proposed and studied for solving system of multi-term fractional differential equations of order 1. A rigorous mathematical analysis is provided to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the method. To this end, we apply a functional analysis framework to obtain convergence and superconvergence properties of the proposed methods on the graded mesh. Some numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical results. Finally, this method is used for simulating the response of a 4-story building under El Centro earthquake excitation.},

  abstract     = {Resistance distance is a novel distance function, also a new intrinsic graph metric, which makes some extensions of ordinary distance. Let $$O_n$$ be a linear crossed octagonal graph. Recently, Pan and Li (Int J Quantum Chem 118(24):e25787, 2018) derived the closed formulas for the Kirchhoff index, multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index and the number of spanning trees of $$H_n$$. They pointed that it is interesting to give the explicit formulas for the Kirchhoff and multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff indices of $$O_n$$. Inspired by these, in this paper, two resistance distance-based graph invariants, namely, Kirchhoff and multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff indices are studied. We firstly determine formulas for the Laplacian (normalized Laplacian, resp.) spectrum of $$O_n$$. Further, the formulas for those two resistance distance-based graph invariants and spanning trees are given. More surprising, we find that the Kirchhoff (multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff, resp.) index is almost one quarter to Wiener (Gutman, resp.) index of a linear crossed octagonal graph.},

  abstract     = {Non-interior-point smoothing Newton method (SNM) for optimization have been widely studied for over three decades. SNM is a popular approach for solving small- and medium-scale complementarity problem (CP) and many optimization problems. The main purpose of this paper is to revisit the SNM and show that the Hessian matrix in SNM becomes increasingly ill-conditioned while smoothing parameter approaches to zero, which leads to their practical use remains limited due to computational difficulties in solving large-scale CP. To tackle this, we redesign a new smoothing method, called accelerated preconditioned smoothing method (APSM) for the efficient solution of regularized support vector machines in machine learning. With the help of suitable preconditioner, we can correct the ill-conditioning of associated smoothing Hessian matrix and thereby the associated smoothing Hessian equation can be solved in a few of iterations by using iterative methods in linear algebra. Two accelerated techniques are designed in the paper to reduce our computation time. Finally we present numerical experiments to support our theoretical guarantees and test accelerated convergence obtained by APSM. The result showed that APSM computes faster than state of art algorithm without reducing classification accuracy.},

The corresponding sufficient criteria for the asymptotic stabilities of equilibria and the existence of stable periodic oscillations of tumor levels are obtained. Theoretical results indicate that the system orderly undergoes different states with the flow rate of mature immune cells increasing, from the unlimited expansion of tumor, to the stable large tumor-present equilibrium, to the periodic oscillation, to the stable small tumor-present equilibrium, and finally to the stable tumor-free equilibrium, which exhibits a variety of dynamic behaviors. In addition, these dynamic behaviors are in accordance with some phenomena observed clinically, such as tumor dormant, tumor periodic oscillation, immune escape of tumor and so on.

  abstract     = {A spatial discretization of the Riesz fractional nonlinear reaction–diffusion equation by the fractional centered difference scheme leads to a system of ordinary differential equations, in which the resulting coefficient matrix possesses the symmetric block Toeplitz structure. An exponential Runge–Kutta method is employed to solve such a system of ordinary differential equations. In the practical implementation, the product of a block Toeplitz matrix exponential and a vector is calculated by the shift-invert Lanczos method. Meanwhile, the symmetric positive definiteness of the coefficient matrix guarantees the fast approximation by the shift-invert Lanczos method. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The Klein–Gordon–Schrödinger (KGS) equations are classical models to describe the interaction between conservative scalar nucleons and neutral scalar mesons through Yukawa coupling. In this paper, we propose local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods to solve the KGS equations. The methods involve a Crank–Nicholson time discretization for the Schrödinger equation part, a Crank–Nicholson leap frog method in time for the Klein–Gordon equation part, and local discontinuous Galerkin methods in space. Our designed numerical methods have high-order convergence rate, and energy- and Hamiltonian-preserving properties. We present the proofs of such conservation properties for both semi-discrete and fully-discrete schemes. We also establish optimal error estimates of the semi-discrete methods for the linearized KGS equations and the fully discrete methods for the KGS equations. The analysis can be extended to LDG methods for the nonlinear Klein–Gordon or Schrödinger equation, and the KGS equations in higher spatial dimensions. Several numerical tests are presented to verify some of our theoretical findings.},

We present two main equilibrium points (disease-free and endemic) with the analysis of their stability. The basic reproduction number is calculated and we find that when it is less than unity, the disease-free equilibrium point is both locally and globally stable which means the disease can be eradicated under such condition. When it is greater than one, the infection is uniformly persistent and the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. The sensitivity index of basic reproduction number to the parameters within the model is also determined. Further, by using Pontryagin’s minimum principle, the optimal control problem is constructed with three controls i.e. vaccination, treatment of exposed individuals and treatment of infected individuals. Finally, the numerical simulations are established and our results show that a combination of all three controls gives the best result in reducing the number of measles infected individuals. These results indicate that being vaccinated followed by some treatments for both exposed and infected individuals would make measles eradication more efficient.},

  abstract     = {In ecology, the interactions between prey and predator can be direct or indirect. Predators can affect prey population by means of direct consumption and by inducing a non-consumptive fear effect in the prey population. In our present study, we investigate the impact of an indirect prey–predator interaction by considering the effect of fear of predation coupled with predation-driven Allee effect on the prey population. We propose and analyze two-species prey–predator models where the growth rate of prey is affected by a combined non-consumptive Allee-cum–fear effect induced by the predator and due to two different foraging behaviour of the predator. We investigate and compare the dynamical behaviour of the systems with Holling type-I and Holling type-II foraging rates of the predator. We observe that the system with type-II foraging rate of the predator has a wider basin of attraction of the stable coexistence equilibrium compared to the system with type-I foraging rate. We also observe that due to the gradual increase of fear level, the systems exhibit oscillatory dynamics followed by multiple stability switching.},

The equations contain a non-differentiable part. Although the convergence conditions are very general, they are weaker than the corresponding ones in earlier works leading to a finer convergence analysis in both the local as well as the semi-local convergence analysis. Therefore, the applicability of these iterative schemes is extended.},

This proposed method is based on Traub’s iterative scheme (Iterative methods for the solution of equations, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1964) which is extended to n-variable. The presented two-step algorithm is a modification of Newton method for solving unconstrained optimization problems. The convergence analysis for this iterative algorithm is established under suitable conditions. Various numerical examples are given to illustrate the efficiency and performance of the newly suggested method.},

By using a penalty approach, the PIDCP results in a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation (PIDE). To numerically solve this nonlinear penalized PIDE, a fitted finite volume method is introduced for the spatial discretization and the Backward Euler and Crank–Nicolson schemes for the time discretization. We show that these schemes are consistent, stable and monotone, hence convergence to the solution of continuous problem. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of this new method.},
