  abstract     = {Pan-sharpening aims to obtain high-resolution multi-spectral images by fusing panchromatic images and low-resolution multi-spectral images though reasonable rules. This paper proposed a novel generative adversarial network for pan-sharpening, which utilizes the supplemented spectral information from low-resolution multi-spectral images and the enhanced structural information from panchromatic images to generate high-resolution multi-spectral images. Firstly, the forward differential operator is used to extract the spatial structural information of the panchromatic image both in the horizontal and vertical directions. Secondly, an architecture of generative adversarial network is designed. The enhanced structural information generated by the accumulation of the structural information of the two directions is added to the image fusion process in generator and the discriminating process in discriminator, and a new optimization objective is designed accordingly. What is more, the low-resolution multi-spectral image is added to the convolution process in the generator as a supplement to the spectral information. Finally, in order to obtain better image generation effect, a special objective function of the generator is designed, which adds a unique relationship to reduce the loss of spatial structural information and spectral information of fused images. Experiments on QuickBird and WorldView-3 satellites datasets show that the proposed method can generate high quality fused images and is better than most advanced methods in both objective indicators and intuitive observations.},

  abstract     = {Applying deep neural networks (DNNs) in mobile and safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, demands a reliable and efficient execution on hardware. The design of the neural architecture has a large influence on the achievable efficiency and bit error resilience of the network on hardware. Since there are numerous design choices for the architecture of DNNs, with partially opposing effects on the preferred characteristics (such as small error rates at low latency), multi-objective optimization strategies are necessary. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary optimization technique for the automated design of hardware-optimized DNN architectures. For this purpose, we derive a set of inexpensively computable objective functions, which enable the fast evaluation of DNN architectures with respect to their hardware efficiency and error resilience. We observe a strong correlation between predicted error resilience and actual measurements obtained from fault injection simulations. Furthermore, we analyze two different quantization schemes for efficient DNN computation and find one providing a significantly higher error resilience compared to the other. Finally, a comparison of the architectures provided by our algorithm with the popular MobileNetV2 and NASNet-A models reveals an up to seven times improved bit error resilience of our models. We are the first to combine error resilience, efficiency, and performance optimization in a neural architecture search framework.},

To overcome these issues, we need an efficient meta-heuristic technique that allocates applications among the virtual machines fairly and optimizes the quality of services (QoS) parameters to meet the end user objectives. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is used to solve real-world discrete optimization problems but simple BPSO does not provide optimal solution due to improper behavior of transfer function. To overcome this problem, we have modified transfer function of binary PSO that provides exploration and exploitation capability in better way and optimize various QoS parameters such as makespan time, energy consumption, and execution cost. The computational results demonstrate that modified transfer function-based BPSO algorithm is more efficient and outperform in comparison with other baseline algorithm over various synthetic datasets.},

Lipschitz constraint is essential in guaranteeing training stability for GANs. Although heuristic methods such as weight clipping, gradient penalty and spectral normalization have been proposed to enforce Lipschitz constraint, it is still difficult to achieve a solution that is both practically effective and theoretically provably satisfying a Lipschitz constraint. In this paper, we introduce the boundedness and continuity (BC) conditions to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator functions of GANs. We prove theoretically that GANs with discriminators meeting the BC conditions satisfy the Lipschitz constraint. We present a practically very effective implementation of a GAN based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) by forcing the CNN to satisfy the BC conditions (BC–GAN). We show that as compared to recent techniques including gradient penalty and spectral normalization, BC–GANs have not only better performances but also lower computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Electrooculographical (EOG) artifacts are problematic to electroencephalographical (EEG) signal analysis and degrade performance of brain–computer interfaces. A novel, robust deep wavelet sparse autoencoder (DWSAE) method is presented and validated for fully automated EOG artifact removal. DWSAE takes advantage of wavelet transform and sparse autoencoder to become a universal EOG artifact corrector. After being trained without supervision, the sparse autoencoder performs EOG correction on time–frequency coefficients collected after brain wave signal wavelet decomposition. Corrected coefficients are then used for wavelet reconstruction of uncontaminated EEG signals. DWSAE is compared with five other methods: second-order blind identification, information maximization, joint approximation diagonalization of eigen-matrices, wavelet neural network (WNN) and wavelet thresholding (WT). Experimental results on a visual attention task dataset, a mental state recognition dataset and a semi-simulated contaminated EEG dataset show that DWSAE is capable of suppressing EOG artifacts effectively, while preserving the nature of background EEG signals. The mean square error of signals before and after correction by DWSAE on a semi-simulated contaminated EEG segment of 30 s is the lowest (65.62) when compared to the results produced by WNN and WT. DWSAE addresses limitations posed by these methods in three ways. First, DWSAE can be performed automatically and online in a single channel of EEG data; this has advantages over independent component analysis-based methods. Second, its results are robust and stable in comparison with those of other wavelet-based methods. Third, as an unsupervised learning scheme, DWSAE does not require the off-line training that is necessary for WNN and other supervised learning machine learning-based methods.},

  abstract     = {An approach to find the best patient-specific seizure detection system for nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) is proposed. Data of several patients affected by NFLE, extracted from the European Epilepsy Database, have been used for this study. As every patient possesses different physiological characteristics, several simulations were performed in order to find the best features to be extracted from the best number of electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and to be inputted to two-dimensional self-organizing maps (SOM). The proposed method allows the definition of maps capable of presenting meaningful information on the actual brain state, revealing the mapping potential of clustering the data coming from seizure and non-seizure patterns; moreover, it also suggests to use SOM for early seizure detection. In fact, the temporal sequence of the patterns in an EEG recording can be projected on the SOM, obtaining a trajectory that describes the dynamics of the brain state as captured by the EEG. The analysis of this trajectory allows one to detect the seizure event, highlighting the possibility to promote therapies aimed at rapid and targeted disarming the seizures. A further contribution of the paper is to propose a methodology to be followed to customize the prediction model to a new patient. The performances of the proposed approach, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, have been compared with those of other well-established detection models proving it is a good alternative to early and accurately detect nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy seizures.},

The planning problem is formulated as the Close Enough Dubins Orienteering Problem which combines combinatorial optimization with continuous optimization to determine the most rewarding data collection path that does not exceed the given travel budget and satisfies the motion constraints of the vehicle. The combinatorial optimization consists of selecting a subset of the most rewarding data to be collected and the schedule of data collection. On the other hand, the continuous optimization stands to determine the most suitable waypoint locations from which selected data can be collected together with the determination of the headings at the waypoints for the used Dubins vehicle model. The existing purely combinatorial approaches need to discretize the possible waypoint locations and headings into some finite sets, and the solution is computationally very demanding because the problem size is quickly increased. On the contrary, the employed GSOA performs online sampling of the waypoints and headings during the adaptation of the growing structure that represents the requested curvature-constrained data collection path. Regarding the presented results, the proposed approach provides solutions to orienteering problems with competitive quality, but it is significantly less computationally demanding.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional, large, and noisy data with complex structure challenge the limits of many clustering algorithms including modern graph segmentation methods. SOM-based clustering has been shown capable of capturing many clusters of widely varying statistical properties in such data. However, to date the best discovery results are produced by interactive extraction of clusters from informative SOM visualizations. This does not scale for Big Data, large archives, or near-real-time analyses. We approach this challenge by infusing SOM knowledge into leading automatic graph segmentation algorithms, which produce extremely poor results when segmenting the SOM prototypes without this information, and which would take a prohibitively long time to segment the input data sets. The knowledge translation occurs by casting the SOM prototypes as vertices and the CONN similarity measure as edge weightings of a graph which is then presented to graph segmentation algorithms. The resulting performance closely approximates the precision of the interactive SOM segmentation for complicated data and, at the same time, is extremely fast and memory-efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness on a simple synthetic data set and on a very realistic fully labeled synthetic hyperspectral image. We also examine performance dependence on available parametrizations of the graph segmentation algorithms, in combination with parametrizations of the CONN similarity measure.},

  abstract     = {During the last decade, a significant research progress has been drawn in both the theoretical aspects and the applications of Deep Learning Neural Networks. Besides their spectacular applications, optimal architectures of these neural networks may speed up the learning process and exhibit better generalization results. So far, many growing and pruning algorithms have been proposed by many researchers to deal with the optimization of standard Feedforward Neural Network architectures. However, applying both the growing and the pruning on the same net may lead a good model for a big data set and hence good selection results. This work is devoted to propose a new Growing and pruning Learning algorithm for Deep Neural Networks. This new algorithm is presented and applied on diverse medical data sets. It is shown that this algorithm outperforms various other artificial intelligent techniques in terms of accuracy and simplicity of the resulting architecture.},

The application of a neural gas network that is trained with a supervised batch version of the algorithm can produce identification models in a robust way. In this paper, the neural model identifies each local transfer function, demonstrating that the local linear approximation can be done. Moreover, other parameters are analyzed in order to obtain a correct modeling. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied to control a nonlinear multi-input multi-output system composed of tanks. In addition, this plant is a coupled system where the manipulated input variables are influencing all the output variables. The aim of the work is to demonstrate that the supervised neural gas algorithm is able to obtain linear models to be used in a state space design scenario to control nonlinear coupled systems and guarantee a robust control method. The results are compared with the common approach of using a recurrent neural controller trained with a dynamic backpropagation algorithm. Regarding the steady-state errors in disturbance rejection, reference tracking and sensitivity to simple process changes, the proposed approach shows an interesting application to control nonlinear plants.},

The principal message of this article is that self-organized models in general are, due to their localized learning rule that updates only those units close to the best-matching unit, ideal representation learners for incremental learning architectures. We present such an architecture that uses ReST layers as a building block, benchmark its performance w.r.t. incremental learning in three real-world visual classification problems, and justify the mechanisms implemented in the architecture by dedicated experiments.},

  abstract     = {In a short period of time, many areas of science have made a sharp transition towards data-dependent methods. In some cases, this process has been enabled by simultaneous advances in data acquisition and the development of networked system technologies. This new situation is particularly clear in the life sciences, where data overabundance has sparked a flurry of new methodologies for data management and analysis. This can be seen as a perfect scenario for the use of machine learning and computational intelligence techniques to address problems in which more traditional data analysis approaches might struggle. But, this scenario also poses some serious challenges. One of them is model interpretability and explainability, especially for complex nonlinear models. In some areas such as medicine and health care, not addressing such challenge might seriously limit the chances of adoption, in real practice, of computer-based systems that rely on machine learning and computational intelligence methods for data analysis. In this paper, we reflect on recent investigations about the interpretability and explainability of machine learning methods and discuss their impact on medicine and health care. We pay specific attention to one of the ways in which interpretability and explainability in this context can be addressed, which is through data and model visualization. We argue that, beyond improving model interpretability as a goal in itself, we need to integrate the medical experts in the design of data analysis interpretation strategies. Otherwise, machine learning is unlikely to become a part of routine clinical and health care practice.},

ReST extends older work on energy-based self-organizing models (IEEE international conference on neural networks, IEEE, pp 1219–1223, 1993) in several ways. First of all, it converts input–prototype distances into neural activities that are constrained to follow a log-normal distribution. This allows a problem-independent interpretation of neural activities which facilitates, e.g. outlier detection and visualization. And secondly, since all neural activities are constrained in particular to exhibit a predetermined temporal mean, the convolution that is contained in the energy function can be performed using the so-called zero-padding with correction (ZPC) instead of periodic boundary conditions. Since periodic boundary conditions impose much stronger constraints on prototypes, using ReST with ZPC leads to markedly lower quantization errors, especially for small map sizes. Additional experiments are conducted showing the worth of a $$C^\infty$$ energy function, namely for novelty detection and automatic control of SOM parameters.},

  abstract     = {Social networks are known to be assortative with respect to many attributes, such as age, weight, wealth, level of education, ethnicity and gender: Similar people according to these attributes tend to be more connected. This can be explained by influences and homophily. Independently of its origin, this assortativity gives us information about each node given its neighbors. Assortativity can thus be used to improve individual predictions in a broad range of situations, when data are missing or inaccurate. This paper presents a general framework based on probabilistic graphical models to exploit social network structures for improving individual predictions of node attributes. Using this framework, we quantify the assortativity range leading to an accuracy gain in several situations, with various individual prediction profiles. We finally show how specific characteristics of the network can enhance performances further. For instance, the gender assortativity in real-world mobile phone data drastically changes according to some communication attributes. In this case, using the network topology indeed improves local predictions of node labels and moreover enables inferring missing node labels based on a subset of known vertices. In both cases, the performances of the proposed method are statistically significantly superior to the ones achieved by state-of-the-art label propagation and feature extraction schemes in most settings.},

Albeit probabilistic LVQ variants exist, its deterministic counterparts are often preferred due to their better efficiency. The latter do not allow an immediate probabilistic interpretation of its output; hence, a rejection of classification based on confidence values is not possible. In this contribution, we investigate different schemes how to extend and integrate pairwise LVQ schemes to an overall probabilistic output, in comparison with a recent heuristic surrogate measure for the security of the classification, which is directly based on LVQ’s multi-class classification scheme. Furthermore, we propose a canonic way how to fuse these values over a given time window in case a possibly disrupted measurement is taken over a longer time interval to counter the uncertainty of a single point in time. Experimental results indicate that an explicit probabilistic treatment often yields superior results as compared to a standard deterministic LVQ method, but metric learning is able to annul this difference. Fusion over a short time period is beneficial in case of an unclear classification.},

  abstract     = {Bio-inspired computing principles are considered as a source of promising paradigms for fault-tolerant computation. Among bio-inspired approaches, neural networks are potentially capable of absorbing some degrees of vulnerability based on their natural properties. This calls for attention, since beyond energy, the growing number of defects in physical substrates is now a major constraint that affects the design of computing devices. However, studies have shown that most neural networks cannot be considered intrinsically fault tolerant without a proper design. In this paper, the fault tolerance of self-organizing maps (SOMs) is investigated, considering implementations targeted onto field programmable gate arrays, where the bit-flip fault model is employed to inject faults in registers. Quantization and distortion measures are used to evaluate performance on synthetic datasets under different fault ratios. Three passive techniques intended to enhance fault tolerance of SOMs during training/learning are also considered in the evaluation. We also evaluate the influence of technological choices on fault tolerance: sequential or parallel implementation, weight storage policies. Experimental results are analyzed through the evolution of neural prototypes during learning and fault injection. We show that SOMs benefit from an already desirable property: graceful degradation. Moreover, depending on some technological choices, SOMs may become very fault tolerant, and their fault tolerance even improves when weights are stored in an individualized way in the implementation.},

In this paper, we propose a new layer for CNNs that increases their robustness to several types of corruptions of the input images. We call it a ‘push–pull’ layer and compute its response as the combination of two half-wave rectified convolutions, with kernels of different size and opposite polarity. Its implementation is based on a biologically motivated model of certain neurons in the visual system that exhibit response suppression, known as push–pull inhibition. We validate our method by replacing the first convolutional layer of the LeNet, ResNet and DenseNet architectures with our push–pull layer. We train the networks on original training images from the MNIST and CIFAR data sets and test them on images with several corruptions, of different types and severities, that are unseen by the training process. We experiment with various configurations of the ResNet and DenseNet models on a benchmark test set with typical image corruptions constructed on the CIFAR test images. We demonstrate that our push–pull layer contributes to a considerable improvement in robustness of classification of corrupted images, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on the original image classification task.

While recent needs for more secure authentication schemes have considerably increased the interest in competing ocular modalities, progress in these areas is still held back by the lack of publicly available datasets that would allow for more targeted research into specific ocular characteristics next to the iris. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap for the case of sclera biometrics and introduce a novel dataset designed for research into ocular biometrics and most importantly for research into the vasculature of the sclera. Our dataset, called Sclera Blood Vessels, Periocular and Iris (SBVPI), is, to the best of our knowledge, the first publicly available dataset designed specifically with research in sclera biometrics in mind. The dataset contains high-quality RGB ocular images, captured in the visible spectrum, belonging to 55 subjects. Unlike competing datasets, it comes with manual markups of various eye regions, such as the iris, pupil, canthus or eyelashes and a detailed pixel-wise annotation of the complete sclera vasculature for a subset of the images. Additionally, the datasets ship with gender and age labels. The unique characteristics of the dataset allow us to study aspects of sclera biometrics technology that have not been studied before in the literature (e.g. vasculature segmentation techniques) as well as issues that are of key importance for practical recognition systems. Thus, next to the SBVPI dataset we also present in this paper a comprehensive investigation into sclera biometrics and the main covariates that affect the performance of sclera segmentation and recognition techniques, such as gender, age, gaze direction or image resolution. Our experiments not only demonstrate the usefulness of the newly introduced dataset, but also contribute to a better understanding of sclera biometrics in general.},

  abstract     = {Xylem is a vascular tissue that conducts sap (water and dissolved minerals) from the roots to the rest of the plant while providing physical support and resources. Sap is conducted within dead hollow cells (called vessels in flowering plants) arranged to form long pipes. Once formed, vessels do not change their structure and last from years to millennia. Vessels’ configuration (size, abundance, and spatial pattern) constitutes a record of the plant–environment relationship, and therefore, a tool for monitoring responses at the plant and ecosystem level. This information can be extracted through quantitative anatomy; however, the effort to identify and measure hundreds of thousands of conductive cells is an inconvenience to the progress needed to have solid assessments of the anatomical–environment relationship. In this paper, we propose an automatic methodology based on convolutional neural networks to segment xylem vessels. It includes a post-processing stage based on the use of redundant information to improve the performance of the outcome and make it useful in different sample configurations. Three different neural networks were tested obtaining similar results (pixel accuracy about 90\%), which indicates that the methodology can be effectively used for segmentation of xylem vessels into images with non-homogeneous variations of illumination. The development of accurate automatic tools using CNNs would reduce the entry barriers associated with quantitative xylem anatomy expanding the use of this technique by the scientific community.},

  abstract     = {Face alignment (or facial landmarking) is an important task in many face-related applications, ranging from registration, tracking, and animation to higher-level classification problems such as face, expression, or attribute recognition. While several solutions have been presented in the literature for this task so far, reliably locating salient facial features across a wide range of posses still remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel method for automatic facial landmark localization in 3D face data designed specifically to address appearance variability caused by significant pose variations. Our method builds on recent cascaded regression-based methods to facial landmarking and uses a gating mechanism to incorporate multiple linear cascaded regression models each trained for a limited range of poses into a single powerful landmarking model capable of processing arbitrary-posed input data. We develop two distinct approaches around the proposed gating mechanism: (1) the first uses a gated multiple ridge descent mechanism in conjunction with established (hand-crafted) histogram of gradients features for face alignment and achieves state-of-the-art landmarking performance across a wide range of facial poses and (2) the second simultaneously learns multiple-descent directions as well as binary features that are optimal for the alignment tasks and in addition to competitive landmarking results also ensures extremely rapid processing. We evaluate both approaches in rigorous experiments on several popular datasets of 3D face images, i.e., the FRGCv2 and Bosphorus 3D face datasets and image collections F and G from the University of Notre Dame. The results of our evaluation show that both approaches compare favorably to the state-of-the-art, while exhibiting considerable robustness to pose variations.},

  abstract     = {The automatic narration of a natural scene is an important trait in artificial intelligence that unites computer vision and natural language processing. Caption generation is a challenging task in scene understanding. Most of the state-of-the-art methods are using deep convolutional neural network models to extract visual features of the entire image, based on which the parallel structures between images and sentences are exploited using recurrent neural networks for image captioning. However, in such models, only visual features are exploited for caption generation. This work investigated that fusion of text available in an image can give more fined-grained captioning of a scene. In this paper, we have proposed a model which incorporates a deep convolutional neural network and long short-term memory to boost the accuracy of image captioning by fusing text feature available in an image with the visual features extracted in state-of-the-art methods. We have validated the effectiveness of the proposed model on the benchmark datasets (Flickr8k and Flickr30k). The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for image captioning.},

Besides, there is the added problem of accurate dataset production. Most of the emotional speech databases and associated documentation are either privative or not publicly available. Therefore, in this work, two stress-elicited databases containing speech from male and female speakers were recruited, and four classification methods are compared in order to detect and classify speech under stress.

In addition to this, the system is also constrained by the requirements of the local multilingual industrial sector. We present the first evolutionary system based on a scalable architecture that is able to fulfill these specifications with automatic adaptation based on automatic semantic speech recognition, folksonomies, automatic configuration selection, machine learning, neural computing methodologies, and collaborative networks.

The PD patients carried out the standardized time up and go test, and the healthy persons a daily life activities test (walking, sitting, standing, ascending and descending stairs). As an automatically stride detection process for daily life use, we propose a first stride detection using automatic framing, and after normalization and resampling data a CNN is used. A F1-score of 0.938 (recall 0.968, precision 0.910) for time up and go test and of 0.944 (recall 0.992, precision 0.901) for daily life activities test were obtained for CNN.

This paper presents a machine learning-based automatic classification system based on heart sounds to diagnose cardiac disorders. The proposed framework involves strategic processing and framing of heart sound to extract discriminatory features for machine learning. The most prominent features are selected and used to train a supervised classifier for automatic detection of cardiac diseases. The biological abnormalities disturbing the physical functioning of the heart cause variations in the auscultations, which is strategically used in terms of some discriminatory features for machine learning-based automatic classification. The proposed method achieved 97.78\% accuracy with the equal error rate of 2.22\% for abnormal and normal heart sound classification. The experimental results exhibit that the performance of the proposed method in proper diagnosis of the cardiac diseases is high in terms of accuracy and has low error rate which makes the proposed algorithm suitable for real-time applications.},

However, the gold standard for the diagnosis, polysomnography, is an expensive and complicated process that is commonly unavailable to a large group of the population. Alternatively, automatic approaches have been developed to address this issue. One of the goals of this research is to perform the classification of the apnea events with the lowest possible number of sensors. Therefore, the blood oxygen saturation signal was employed in this work since it is correlated with the occurrence of apnea events and it can be measured from a single noninvasive sensor. The events detection was performed by a combination of classifiers. However, choosing the type of classifier to combine and select the most relevant features for each classifier is considered to be a well-known problem in the field of machine learning. A self-configuring classifier combination technique based on genetic algorithms was developed for multiple classifiers and features selection which was tested along with different databases and input sizes. The best performance for obstructive sleep apnea detection was achieved using maximum voting independent feature selection with 1 min time window having the best sensitivity of 82.48\% similar database in the literature. This model was later tested on another database for cross-database accuracy. With an average accuracy of 91.33\%, the system proved its capabilities for clinical diagnosis since the model was developed and validated with both subject and database independence.},

More recently, reservoir-based recurrent neural net systems, most notably echo state networks (ESN), have made substantial improvements for time series modeling. Their shallow nature lends themselves to an efficient training method, but has limitations on nonstationary, nonlinear chaotic time series, particularly large, multidimensional time series. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for forecasting time series data based on an additive decomposition (AD) applied to the time series as a preprocessor to a deep echo state network. We compare the performance of our method, AD-DeepESN, on popular neural net architectures used for time series prediction. Stationary and nonstationary data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the methods. Our results are compelling, demonstrating that AD-DeepESN has superior performance, particularly on the most challenging time series that exhibit non-stationarity and chaotic behavior compared to existing methods.},

Furthermore, we do an empirical comparison with two state-of-the-art algorithms to illustrate the performance of OSLOG relying on three aspects: normality, sparsity and multicollinearity showing an excellent achievement of trade-off between these properties.},

However, regarding the decision making of massive data characterized by redundancy and uncertainty, more means including attribute selection and uncertainty processing should be considered to solve these problems. Based on the traditional framework of LMADM, this paper deduces a new framework to adapt to the decision making of massive data. With respect to the uncertainty generated from data and decision process, a fuzzy neighborhood three-way decision model (FN3WD) is proposed, in which the fuzzy neighborhood relationship can address the uncertainty of data and the three-way decision theory can deal with the uncertainty of decision process. Finally, the experimental results illustrate the superiority of FN3WD and verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework of the extended LMADM by using some benchmarked datasets and the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset.},

  abstract     = {Text clustering has been widely utilized with the aim of partitioning specific document collection into different subsets using homogeneity/heterogeneity criteria. It has also become a very complicated area of research, including pattern recognition, information retrieval, and text mining. Metaheuristics are typically used as efficient approaches for the text clustering problem. The multi-verse optimizer algorithm (MVO) involves a stochastic population-based algorithm. It has been recently proposed and successfully utilized to tackle many hard optimization problems. However, a recently applied research trend involves hybridizing two or more algorithms with the aim of obtaining a superior solution regarding the problems of optimization. In this paper, a new hybrid of MVO algorithm with the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed, i.e., the H-MVO algorithm with the aims of enhancing the quality of initial candidate solutions, as well as the best solution, which is produced by MVO at each iteration. This hybrid algorithm aims at improving the global (diversification) ability of the search and finding a better cluster partition. The proposed H-MVO effectiveness was tested on five standard datasets, which are used in the domain of data clustering, as well as six standard text datasets, which are utilized in the domain of text document clustering, in addition to two scientific articles’ datasets. The experiments showed that K-means hybridized MVO improves the results in terms of high convergence rate, accuracy, error rate, purity, entropy, recall, precision, and F-measure criteria. In general, H-MVO has outperformed or at least proven to be highly competitive compared to the original MVO algorithm and with well-known optimization algorithms like KHA, HS, PSO, GA, H-PSO, and H-GA and the clustering techniques like K-mean, K-mean++, DBSCAN, agglomerative, and spectral clustering techniques.},

The camera calibration problem is too complex, nonlinear and multimodal. Traditional camera calibration methods using gradient-based optimization often trap to one of the many local solutions available. Accurate computation ability of traditional camera calibration methods is limited since they use gradient-based optimization methods. Since evolutionary computing algorithms can avoid local solutions of numerical problems, they have the potential to accurately compute the required camera calibration parameters for high-precision computational vision applications. In this paper, the camera calibration parameters are computed by using 11 evolutionary computing algorithms, i.e., WDE, ABC, PSO, COBIDE, DE, CS, GWO, TLBO, MVMO, FOA and LSHADE. In order to make unbiased evaluation of the camera calibration results provided by the related evolutionary computing algorithms, two gradient-based traditional camera calibration methods, i.e., Zhang and Bouguet, have been used in the conducted experiments in this paper. The camera calibration results of the related methods were used to model a 3D physical test scene by using Structure from Motion photogrammetry method. The reference data set of the related 3D physical scene has been captured by using a 3D terrestrial laser scanner. Statistical comparison of the camera calibration results exposed that WDE supplies statistically better results than other comparison algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Accurate classification of self-care problems in children who suffer from physical and motor affliction is an important problem in the healthcare industry. This is a difficult and a time-consuming process, and it needs the expertise of occupational therapists. In recent years, healthcare professionals have opened up to the idea of using expert systems and artificial intelligence in the diagnosis and classification of self-care problems. In this study, we propose a new deep learning-based approach named Care2Vec for solving the self-care classification problem. We use a real-world self-care activities dataset that is based on a conceptual framework designed by the World Health Organization. The conceptual framework is known as the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth (ICF-CY), which is a widely used standard framework for analyzing self-care activity records. Deep learning is a form of representation learning, and in recent years, it has been very successful in various fields such as computer vision, speech processing and more. We propose a hybrid autoencoder-based method Care2Vec, where we use autoencoders and deep neural networks as a two-step modeling process. We also propose a variation of the Care2Vec method. We then compare Care2Vec with traditional methods reported in the literature for solving the self-care classification problem (such as deep neural networks and decision trees) in both multi-class classification and binary classification settings. We use k-fold cross-validation while applying the different methodologies. The evaluation metrics used were the mean accuracy and the mean area under the curve (AUC). We found that the Care2Vec method has a better prediction accuracy than the prevalent methods and so a recommended approach for the self-care classification problem. The adoption of Care2Vec can help expert therapists in making better diagnostic decisions and will thus lead to better treatment.},

The recent success of machine learning in speech and image recognition has prompted researchers to apply these methods to asset price prediction. The majority of literature has been devoted to predicting either the actual asset price or the direction of price movement. In this paper, we study a hitherto little explored question of predicting significant changes in stock price based on previous changes using machine learning algorithms. We are particularly interested in the performance of neural network classifiers in the given context. To this end, we construct and test three neural network models including multilayer perceptron, convolutional net, and long short-term memory net. As benchmark models, we use random forest and relative strength index methods. The models are tested using 10-year daily stock price data of four major US public companies. Test results show that predicting significant changes in stock price can be accomplished with a high degree of accuracy. In particular, we obtain substantially better results than similar studies that forecast the direction of price change.},

In the KGE model training process, both positive and negative triples are necessarily provided. Thus, negative sampling methods are meaningful in generating negative samples based on the representations of entities and relations. This paper proposes an innovative neighborhood knowledge selective adversarial network (NKSGAN), which leverages the representation of aggregating neighborhood information to generate high-quality negative samples for enhancing the performances of the discriminator. Experiments are conducted on widely used standard datasets such as FB15k, FB15k-237, WN18 and WN18RR to evaluate our model for link prediction task.

However, existing studies mainly aim to improve overall translation quality, which only reduces post-editing time. In this work, we firstly identify testing sentences which are highly similar to training set (high-potential sentences) to reduce reviewing time, then we focus on improving corresponding translation quality greatly to reduce post-editing time. From this point, we firstly propose two novel translation memory methods to characterize similarity between sentences on syntactic and template dimensions separately. Based on that, we propose a similarity-aware neural machine translation (similarity-NMT) which consists of two independent modules: (1) Identification Module, which can identify high-potential sentences of testing set according to multi-dimensional similarity information; (2) Translation Module, which can integrate multi-dimensional similarity information of parallel training sentence pairs into an attention-based NMT model by leveraging posterior regularization. Experiments on two Chinese $$\Rightarrow $$ English domains have well-validated the effectiveness and universality of the proposed method of reducing human translator efforts.},

  abstract     = {While existing studies have established the relationship between electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) and studio performance, limited research has been conducted to demonstrate how the attention-based model applies to the motion picture industry. In this study, examining a review corpus of seven Hollywood studios, we proved that deep learning with the attention mechanism has the best accuracy in both eWOM and stock price movement. We present both a hierarchical two-layer attention network and hierarchical convoluted attention network (HCAN), which quantify the importance of crucial eWOM features in capturing valuable information from audience members’ reviews. Further, comparing the two case studies, we determined that the HCAN model is superior to both machine learning and attention-based models. Our work helps to highlight the business value of the attention-based model and has implications for studio business decisions.},

  abstract     = {During the past decades, applying deep learning technologies on fashion industry are increasingly the mainstream. Due to the different gesture, illumination or self-occasion, it is hard to directly utilize the clothes images in real-world applications. In this paper, to handle this problem, we present a novel multi-stage, category-supervised attention-based conditional generative adversarial network by generating clear and detailed tiled clothing images from certain model images. This newly proposed method consists of two stages: in the first stage, we generate the coarse image which contains general appearance information (such as color and shape) and category of the garment, where a spatial transformation module is utilized to handle the shape changes during image synthesis and an additional classifier is employed to guide coarse image generated in a category-supervised manner; in the second stage, we propose a dual path attention-based model to generate the fine-tuned image, which combines the appearance information of the coarse result with the high-frequency information of the model image. In detail, we introduce the channel attention mechanism to assign weights to the information of different channels instead of connecting directly. Then, a self-attention module is employed to model long-range correlation making the generated image close to the target. In additional to the framework, we also create a person-to-clothing data set containing 10 categories of clothing, which includes more than 34 thousand pairs of images with category attribute. Extensive simulations are conducted, and experimental result on the data set demonstrates the feasibility and superiority of the proposed networks.},

Moreover, the nonlinearity of the buildings thermal dynamics makes the IAT prediction more difficult since it is affected by complex factors such as controlled and uncontrolled points, outside weather conditions and occupancy schedule. This paper presents a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict IAT for multi-zone building based on direct multi-step prediction with sequence-to-sequence approach. Two strategies, LSTM-MISO and LSTM-MIMO, are built for multi-input single-output and multi-input multi-output, respectively. The performance of these two strategies has been evaluated based on two case studies on real smart buildings using variable air volume (VAV) and constant air volume (CAV) systems. For both buildings, experimental results showed that the LSTM models outperform multilayer perceptron models by reducing the prediction error by 50\%.},

  abstract     = {Most existing regression-based classification methods cope with pixelwise noise via $$\ell _1$$ -norm or $$\ell _2$$ -norm, but neglect the structural information between pixels. To the best of our knowledge, nuclear norm-based matrix regression approaches have achieved great success for addressing imagewise noise, but may result in unreasonable regression and incorrect classification, especially when test images are extremely corrupted by larger occlusions and severe illumination variations, since they apply the corrupted test images to reconstruction process directly, and the influence of noise will be unavoidable. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a robust mixed-norm constrained regression model to deal with the structural noise corruption. To be more specific, nuclear norm of the error between corrupted test image and its corresponding recovered image is exploited as a regular term for characterizing the low rank noise structure, and Frobenius norm is utilized to depict the difference between the recovered image and restructured image on account of the less noise of recovered image. Then, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to settle our proposed approaches efficiently. Furthermore, the theoretical convergence proof and detailed analysis of computational complexity are provided to assess our algorithms. Eventually, extensive experiments on five well-known face databases have manifested that the proposed methods outperform some state-of-the-art regression-based approaches for primarily addressing noise caused by occlusion and illumination changes.},

In graph embedding, its keys are the different kinds of graph constructions that determine the performance of dimensionality reduction. Inspired by this fact, in this article we propose a novel graph embedding method named the double graphs-based discriminant projections (DGDP) by integrating two designed discriminative global graph constructions. The proposed DGDP can well discover the discriminant and geometrical structures of the high-dimensional data through the informative graph constructions. In two global graph constructions, we consider the geometrical distribution of each point on each edge of the graphs to define the adjacent weights with class information. Moreover, in the weight definition of one graph construction, we further strengthen pattern discrimination among all the classes to design the weights of the corresponding adjacent graph. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DGDP, we experimentally compare it with the state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on several data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed graph embedding method outperforms the competing methods with more power of data representation and pattern discrimination in the embedded subspace.},

  abstract     = {Many medical image processing applications rely on targeted regions of interest within a larger volumetric image. Whole-body scans represent an extreme case in which large volumes must be broken into smaller sub-volumes for regional analysis. In this work, we sought automatic solutions to divide medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) images into six main anatomical regions: head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and legs. We implemented and compared three methods: (1) an analytical approach which does not require training and solely relies on utilizing critical points in image intensity profiles to derive cut-planes that divide the scan into the mentioned regions, (2) a classical convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, which classifies each transaxial 2D plane independently and then concatenates classification results, and (3) CNN followed by a context-based correction algorithm (CBCA) which improves the CNN classification using positional relationships between all CT slices. The analytical approach achieved acceptable accuracy for anatomical region segmentation without the need for explicit data labeling and was effective for batch labeling whole-body CTs, greatly reducing manual labeling efforts. CNNs achieved superior accuracy and allowed for rapid development and training, but required labeled data and were susceptible to produce discontinuous anatomical regions and therefore ambiguous anatomical boundaries. Post hoc correction of CNN results using CBCA overcame these limitations, achieving nearly perfect CT slice labeling and anatomical region segmentation.},

This paper proposes an online self-organizing algorithm for feedforward neural network (OSNN) with a single hidden layer. The proposed OSNN optimizes the structure of FNN for time-varying system including structure design and parameter learning. In structure design, this paper measures the contribution ratios of hidden nodes by local sensitivity analysis based on differentiation method. OSNN merges hidden nodes with the others that have the highest correlation when their contribution ratios are almost zero and adds new hidden nodes by error reparation. For parameter learning, an improved online gradient method (OGM), called online gradient method with fixed memory (FMOGM), is proposed to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of OGM. In addition, this paper calculates the contribution ratios and the network error and estimates the local minima by using the fixed-sized training set of FMOGM instead of one sample at the current time, which can obtain more effective local information and a compact network structure. Finally, the proposed OSNN is verified using a number of benchmark problems and a practical problem for biochemical oxygen demand prediction in wastewater treatment. The experimental results show that OSNN has better convergence speed and accuracy than other algorithms.},

However, these methods ignored the complementary information from different scales, which is a crucial factor in computer vision tasks. Attention mechanism, a commonly used technique in recognition and detection tasks, can selectively focus on discriminative local cues of the image. In this work, we propose a multi-scale attention framework which jointly considers multi-scale mechanism and attention technique for vehicle Re-ID. Specifically, we exploit multi-scale mechanism in feature maps, which can acquire more comprehensive representations for fusing global and local cues. Meanwhile, we exploit attention blocks on each scale subnetwork, which aims to mine complementary and discriminative information. We conduct extensive experiments on three vehicle datasets, VeRi-776, VehicleID and PKU-VD. The promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and yield to a new state of the art for vehicle Re-ID.},

Therefore, this mapping study aimed to provide an organised view of the current state of the field and comprehensive awareness of the meta-heuristic approaches, by conducting meta-heuristic for solving university timetabling problems. In addition, the mapping study tried to highlight the intensity of publications over the last years, spotting the current trends and directions in the field of solving university timetabling problems, as well as having the work to provide guidance for future research by indicating the gaps and open questions to be fulfilled. Primary studies on mapping study that have been published in the last decade from 2009 until the first quarter of 2020, which consist of 131 publications, were selected as a benchmark for future research to solve university timetabling problems using meta-heuristic algorithms. The majority of the articles based on the publication type are hybrid methods (32\%), in which the distribution of meta-heuristic algorithms the hybrid algorithms represent the higher application (31\%). Likewise, the majority of the research is solution proposals (66\%). The result of this study confirmed the efficiency and intensive application of the meta-heuristic algorithms in solving university timetabling problems, specifically the hybrid algorithms. A new trend of meta-heuristic algorithms such as grey wolf optimiser, cat swarm optimisation algorithm, Elitist self-adaptive step-size search and others with high expectations for reliable and satisfying results can be proposed to fill this gap.},

In these cases, due to variable environmental conditions, making decisions regarding setting the proper commanded outputs to is extraordinarily difficult. To support such decisions, we have developed a decision support system. Its main elements are the ANN models enabling ship fuel consumption and speed prediction. To collect data needed for building ANN models, sea trials were conducted. In this paper, the decision support system concept, input and variables of the ship driveline system models, and data acquisition methods are presented. Based on them, we developed appropriate ANN models.

Blockchain is an encrypted, distributed archiving system designed to allow for the creation of real-time log files that are unequivocally linked. This ensures the security and transparency of transactions. This research presents, for the first time in the literature, an innovative Blockchain Security Architecture that aims to ensure network communication between traded Industrial Internet of Things devices, following the Industry 4.0 standard and based on Deep Learning Smart Contracts. The proposed smart contracts are implementing (via computer programming) a bilateral traffic control agreement to detect anomalies based on a trained Deep Autoencoder Neural Network. This architecture enables the creation of a secure distributed platform that can control and complete associated transactions in critical infrastructure networks, without the intervention of a single central authority.

  abstract     = {Gold price volatilities have a significant impact on many financial activities of the world. The development of a reliable prediction model could offer insights in gold price fluctuations, behavior and dynamics and ultimately could provide the opportunity of gaining significant profits. In this work, we propose a new deep learning forecasting model for the accurate prediction of gold price and movement. The proposed model exploits the ability of convolutional layers for extracting useful knowledge and learning the internal representation of time-series data as well as the effectiveness of long short-term memory (LSTM) layers for identifying short-term and long-term dependencies. We conducted a series of experiments and evaluated the proposed model against state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models. The preliminary experimental analysis illustrated that the utilization of LSTM layers along with additional convolutional layers could provide a significant boost in increasing the forecasting performance.},

  abstract     = {Learnae is a system aiming to achieve a fully distributed way of neural network training. It follows a “Vires in Numeris” approach, combining the resources of commodity personal computers. It has a full peer-to-peer model of operation; all participating nodes share the exact same privileges and obligations. Another significant feature of Learnae is its high degree of fault tolerance. All training data and metadata are propagated through the network using resilient gossip protocols. This robust approach is essential in environments with unreliable connections and frequently changing set of nodes. It is based on a versatile working scheme and supports different roles, depending on processing power and training data availability of each peer. In this way, it allows an expanded application scope, ranging from powerful workstations to online sensors. To maintain a decentralized architecture, all underlying tech should be fully distributed too. Learnae’s coordinating algorithm is platform agnostic, but for the purpose of this research two novel projects have been used: (1) IPFS, a decentralized filesystem, as a means to distribute data in a permissionless environment and (2) IOTA, a decentralized network targeting the world of low energy “Internet of Things” devices. In our previous work, a first approach was attempted on the feasibility of using distributed ledger technology to collaboratively train a neural network. Now, our research is extended by applying Learnae to a fully deployed computer network and drawing the first experimental results. This article focuses on use cases that require data privacy; thus, there is only exchanging of model weights and not training data.},

  abstract     = {As neural architecture search becomes an increasingly studied field, it has become apparent that it demands a great number of computational resources. These are usually devoted to computations and utilized to train and evaluate intermediate solutions during the search phase. Although most researchers focus on developing more efficient search methods, the main computational cost in terms of execution time percentage concerns the evaluation of candidate architectures. As such, many works utilize a smaller number of training epochs during search phase evaluations. In this work, we study the effect of reduced training in neural architecture search. We focus on the retention of relative rankings between architectures when they are trained with different optimizers and for various epochs. We discover relatively high rank correlations between various fully and partially trained, arbitrarily connected architectures (Kendall’s tau-b &gt; 0.7). These are generated by mutating a simple convolutional architecture for the CIFAR-10 image recognition dataset. Furthermore, we observe similar behaviors in networks sampled from the NASBench neural architecture dataset, consisting of a fixed outer skeleton and variable cell module composition. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of genetic algorithms to find optimal solutions in noisy environments, by simulating the previous findings with perturbed n-dimensional Rastrigin functions.},

Identification of FL schemas in short texts remains largely an unresolved issue in the broader field of natural language processing, mainly due to their contradictory and metaphorical meaning content. The main FL expression forms are sarcasm, irony and metaphor. In the present paper, we employ advanced deep learning methodologies to tackle the problem of identifying the aforementioned FL forms. Significantly extending our previous work (Potamias et al., in: International conference on engineering applications of neural networks, Springer, Berlin, pp 164–175, 2019), we propose a neural network methodology that builds on a recently proposed pre-trained transformer-based network architecture which is further enhanced with the employment and devise of a recurrent convolutional neural network. With this setup, data preprocessing is kept in minimum. The performance of the devised hybrid neural architecture is tested on four benchmark datasets, and contrasted with other relevant state-of-the-art methodologies and systems.

  abstract     = {Intensive use of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems in buildings entails monitoring their efficiency. Moreover, cooling systems are key facilities in large buildings and can account up to 44\% of the energy consumption. Therefore, monitoring efficiency in chillers is crucial and, for that reason, a sensor to measure the cooling production is required. However, manufacturers rarely install it in the chiller due to its cost. In this paper, we propose a methodology to build a soft sensor that provides an estimation of cooling production and enables monitoring the chiller efficiency. The proposed soft sensor uses independent variables (internal states of the chiller and electric power) and can take advantage of current or past observations of those independent variables. Six methods (from linear approaches to deep learning ones) are proposed to develop the model for the soft sensor, capturing relevant features on the structure of data (involving time, thermodynamic and electric variables and the number of refrigeration circuits). Our approach has been tested on two different chillers (large water-cooled and smaller air-cooled chillers) installed at the Hospital of León. The methods to implement the soft sensor are assessed according to three metrics (MAE, MAPE and $$R^2$$ ). In addition to the comparison of methods, the results also include the estimation of cooling production (and the comparison of the true and estimated values) and monitoring the COP indicator for a period of several days and for both chillers.},

Existing approaches to detect fake consumer reviews use the review content, product and reviewer information and other features to detect fake reviews. However, as shown in recent studies, the semantic meaning of reviews might be particularly important for text classification. In addition, the emotions hidden in the reviews may represent another potential indicator of fake content. To improve the performance of fake review detection, here we propose two neural network models that integrate traditional bag-of-words as well as the word context and consumer emotions. Specifically, the models learn document-level representation by using three sets of features: (1) n-grams, (2) word embeddings and (3) various lexicon-based emotion indicators. Such a high-dimensional feature representation is used to classify fake reviews into four domains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented detection systems, we compare their classification performance with several state-of-the-art methods for fake review detection. The proposed systems perform well on all datasets, irrespective of their sentiment polarity and product category.},

Toward this direction, accelerometer devices are widely used for the assessment of fall risk. Although there exist a plethora of studies under this perspective, several challenges still remain, such as dealing simultaneously with extremely demanding data management, power consumption and prediction accuracy. In this work, we propose a complete methodology based on the cooperation of deep learning for signal classification along with a lightweight control chart method for change detection.

  abstract     = {As the number of digitized historical documents has increased rapidly during the last a few decades, it is necessary to provide efficient methods of information retrieval and knowledge extraction to make the data accessible. Such methods are dependent on optical character recognition (OCR) which converts the document images into textual representations. Nowadays, OCR methods are often not adapted to the historical domain; moreover, they usually need a significant amount of annotated documents. Therefore, this paper introduces a set of methods that allows performing an OCR on historical document images using only a small amount of real, manually annotated training data. The presented complete OCR system includes two main tasks: page layout analysis including text block and line segmentation and OCR. Our segmentation methods are based on fully convolutional networks, and the OCR approach utilizes recurrent neural networks. Both approaches are state of the art in the relevant fields. We have created a novel real dataset for OCR from Porta fontium portal. This corpus is freely available for research, and all proposed methods are evaluated on these data. We show that both the segmentation and OCR tasks are feasible with only a few annotated real data samples. The experiments aim at determining the best way how to achieve good performance with the given small set of data. We also demonstrate that obtained scores are comparable or even better than the scores of several state-of-the-art systems. To sum up, this paper shows a way how to create an efficient OCR system for historical documents with a need for only a little annotated training data.},

  abstract     = {Critical infrastructures are related to systems which are essential for sustaining the important functions of a society. Their potential failures can cause serious problems not only to the population and economy but also to national security as well. The importance of these infrastructures calls for measures toward their security and protection. The aim was the reduction of risk related to natural disasters, terrorist acts, and cyberthreats. Traditional security systems, even those that employ intelligent algorithms, fail to prevent advanced zero-day attacks as they require constant training. This research proposes a novel meta-learning architecture that considers the neural turing machines as the approach upon which the model is founded. The introduced model allows for the memorization of useful data from past processes, by integrating external storage memory. Moreover, it facilitates the rapid integration of new information without the need for retraining. In particular, the proposed novel architecture is called memory-augmented neural network (M-ANN) whose core is a sophisticated, very fast, and highly efficient extreme learning machine. The M-ANN is assisted by a series of original modifications, related to fine-tuning of training, to memory retrieval mechanisms, to addressing techniques, and to ways of attention-weight allocation to memory vectors. The efficiency of the proposed system has been successfully tested using an extremely complex scenario for the protection of critical infrastructures. According to the testing scenario, memory could quickly encode and record information about new types of attacks, while any stored representation from previous experience was easily and consistently accessible, to maximize the detection efficiency.},

Inevitably, training a classifier that can successfully generalize to new data becomes a very hard problem, since it is impossible to gather general enough training sets. Recent approaches in the literature attempt to solve this problem by augmenting a given training set, with synthetic data, so as to better represent the global distribution of the covariates. However, these approaches are limited because they essentially involve hand-crafted data synthesizers, which are typically hard to implement and problem specific. In this work, we propose a different approach to tackling the above issues, which relies on the combination of two techniques: pose extraction, and domain adaptation as a means to improve the generalization capabilities of classifiers. We show that adapted skeletal representations can be retrieved automatically in a semi-supervised setting and these help to generalize classifiers to new forms of measurement bias. We empirically validate our approach for generalizing across different camera angles.},

Such approaches can provide optimal countermeasures, reliable credentials extraction and self-adjusting potential. Given the widespread scale of modern networks and the complexity of cyber-attacks, the problem of self-adaptation goes far beyond the capabilities of network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The main weakness of IDS is the fact that they cannot adapt to new network conditions (“zero day” attacks). This research tries to overcome the above limitation, by introducing a Semi-supervised Discriminant Autoencoder (AUE) which combines Denoising AUEs with a heuristic method of class separation. In essence, the proposed algorithm learns to remodel the displaced specimens instead of the original ones in the super-sphere defined by their closest neighbors. The purpose is to understand the nature of an attack, based on generalized transformed features derived directly from unknown web environments and data.},

  abstract     = {Time-series analysis and forecasting is generally considered as one of the most challenging problems in data mining. During the last decade, powerful deep learning methodologies have been efficiently applied for time-series forecasting; however, they cannot guarantee the development of reliable prediction models. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for supporting deep learning in enhancing accurate, efficient and reliable time-series models. The major novelty of our proposed methodology is that it ensures a time-series to be “suitable” for fitting a deep learning model by performing a series of transformations in order to satisfy the stationarity property. The enforcement of stationarity is performed by the application of Augmented Dickey–Fuller test and transformations based on first differences or returns, without the loss of any embedded information. The reliability of the deep learning model’s predictions is guaranteed by rejecting the hypothesis of autocorrelation in the model’s errors, which is demonstrated by autocorrelation function plots and Ljung–Box Q test. Our numerical experiments were performed utilizing time-series from three real-world application domains (financial market, energy sector, cryptocurrency area), which incorporate most of global research interest. The performance of all forecasting models was compared on both problems of forecasting time-series price (regression) and time-series directional movements (classification). Additionally, the reliability of the models’ forecasts was evaluated by examining the existence of autocorrelation in the errors. Our numerical experiments indicate that our proposed methodology considerably improves the forecasting performance of a deep learning model, in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability.},

This is done by misusing the inadequate protection provided by electronic tools, and by exploiting the ignorance of the user-object, in order to illegally obtain personal data, such as sensitive private information and passwords. This research proposes the online meta-learning firewall to prevent phishing attacks. It is a highly innovative and fully automated active safety tool that uses a long short-term memory meta-learner algorithm. This method can learn to efficiently classify using a small number of samples. At the same time, it can converge with a fairly small number of steps. The proposed system is an improvement on the k-nearest neighbor with self-adjusting memory algorithm, which is inspired by the model of short and long-term memory. The purpose of the system is to understand the nature of an unknown situation and to classify it, based on the most relevant characteristics that come directly from the unknown environment.},

Component selection and gain calculation of filters are generally achieved over long periods of time using traditional methods. For 1-dB and 3-dB gains, the component values of the filter were optimized for both continuous and discrete values using four different metaheuristic algorithms. In the first case where continuous values were used, component values were accepted as ideal and unlimited in order to minimize gains. In the second case, industrial E196 series component values were used to transform the design problem into a discrete optimization problem. In this case where the design problem became more complex, the performance of the metaheuristic algorithms was compared. The literature review shows that this study is the first attempt to design a 10th-order MF-C-LPF for E196 series values. The average differential evolution algorithm is proposed to determine the optimal component values of the tenth-order MF-C-LPF. The performance of the proposed method was compared with three commonly used algorithms (PSO, CSS and DE). The optimal filter component values and quality factors (Q) were presented for each stage. We believe that the quality factor values will be a reference for future studies.},

  abstract     = {Travel-time tomography for the velocity structure of a medium is a highly nonlinear and nonunique inverse problem. Monte Carlo methods are becoming increasingly common choices to provide probabilistic solutions to tomographic problems but those methods are computationally expensive. Neural networks can often be used to solve highly nonlinear problems at a much lower computational cost when multiple inversions are needed from similar data types. We present the first method to perform fully nonlinear, rapid and probabilistic Bayesian inversion of travel-time data for 2D velocity maps using a mixture density network. We compare multiple methods to estimate probability density functions that represent the tomographic solution, using different sets of prior information and different training methodologies. We demonstrate the importance of prior information in such high-dimensional inverse problems due to the curse of dimensionality: unrealistically informative prior probability distributions may result in better estimates of the mean velocity structure; however, the uncertainties represented in the posterior probability density functions then contain less information than is obtained when using a less informative prior. This is illustrated by the emergence of uncertainty loops in posterior standard deviation maps when inverting travel-time data using a less informative prior, which are not observed when using networks trained on prior information that includes (unrealistic) a priori smoothness constraints in the velocity models. We show that after an expensive program of network training, repeated high-dimensional, probabilistic tomography is possible on timescales of the order of a second on a standard desktop computer.},

  abstract     = {The similar current–voltage profile during power swing and fault quite often leads to maloperation of distance relays. As compared to symmetrical power swings, discriminating a swing scenario from a fault becomes more challenging during asymmetrical swings arising due to single-pole tripping. Unlike symmetrical power swings, the presence of zero-sequence and negative-sequence current during asymmetrical swing scenarios hinders the application of classical power swing blocking schemes. In this regard, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based protection scheme has been proposed in this paper, which, in addition to detecting, classifying, and locating faults, is also able to discriminate between power swing (both symmetrical and asymmetrical) and faults. The discrimination avoids possible maloperation during the non-faulty stressed conditions, thereby overcoming the limitation of the existing protection scheme. With the convolutional neural network, the raw signals are directly fed to the classifier, thus avoiding the computational cost associated with feature extraction in time and frequency domains. With the aim of achieving improved input–output mapping capability of CNN for larger datasets, an evolutionary optimization technique, i.e., grey wolf optimization, has been utilized for determining the optimal values of CNN tuning parameters. The performance of the proposed scheme has been extensively validated for a wide range of fault and power swing conditions in terms of standard indices, i.e., dependability, security, and accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has also been evaluated for practical setting by performing real-time simulation on OPAL-RT digital simulator.},

Among various collaborative filtering techniques, matrix factorization is widely adopted in diverse applications. This technique has superior characteristics, including applying latent feature vectors to represent users or items and projecting users and items into a shared latent feature space. In the present study, a matrix factorization model with the neural embedding called the neural embedding collaborative filtering (NECF) is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a probabilistic auto-encoder is initially applied to achieve unsupervised learning to generate the neural embedding vector from the user–item data. Secondly, these vectors are combined with a regression model based on single point negative sampling to represent the latent feature vectors of the user with regression coefficients. Moreover, an inner product is applied on latent features of users and items to determine the correlations between them. It should be indicated that the NECF is generic so that it can express and generalize the matrix factorization under its framework. In the present study, a ridge regression learning is applied on latent features of each user. The experimental results on two benchmark data sets show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

To alleviate these deficiencies, we developed a novel robust 2DPCA approach for underwater image analysis, called l2,p-sequential bilateral-2DPCA (l2,p-SB-2DPCA). The outstanding advantages of l2,p-SB-2DPCA are as follows. First, our model uses the l2,p-norm as the metric criterion of the objective function, which not only improves the robustness of the algorithm but also preserves the basic properties of 2DPCA. Second, we establish the relationship between the variance of the projection data and the corresponding input data in both the row and column directions, which makes the model achieve good recognition ability while using fewer coefficients and further improves the interpretability of the model. Finally, to obtain the optimal value of l2,p-SB-2DPCA, we present an iterative algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the best performance on three underwater datasets and one extended face dataset compared with other robust 2DPCA approaches.},

The purpose is to develop a fuzzy logic-based multi-input–multi-output optimal control system to characterize the discharge energy efficiency of the EDM process. Methodology used in this paper is specific experimental design covering final and rough operations. Two controllable parameters were selected, and they were discharge current and pulse duration. The discharge energy and material removal rate were chosen as quality characteristics. The proposed approach uses the concept of fuzzy optimal control which is formulated on the basis of fuzzy logic technology with the use of knowledge-based system control. The finding that resulted in this research is that the effect of the discharge energy developed was observed on the performance of material removal rate. The material removal of the electrical discharge is directly proportional to the amount of the discharge energy applied during the on time of the pulse. The experimental results revealed that the effect of the EDM is increased as electrical discharge input parameters increase, but their interaction is limited and still somewhat unclear. The fuzzy optimal control model provides a highly advantageous option of the EDM input parameters, to achieve the best machining performance: the minimum discharge energy and the maximum material removal rate.},

However, many methods do not best minimize the reconstruction error, which is great significance for underwater image recognition and representation. To alleviate this deficiency, a novel idea for gLPCA—generalized robust graph-Laplacian PCA (GRgLPCA)—was proposed. GRgLPCA not only employs the $$l_{2,p}$$ -norm on regarding the correlation between the reconstruction error and variance in the projection data to suppress the influence of underwater noise, but it also employs it regarding the graph-Laplacian regularization term to better protect the intrinsic geometric information embedded in the data. Moreover, GRgLPCA preserves the rotational invariance well, and the solution of the model is related to image covariance matrix, which are the two desired properties of PCA-based method. Finally, we design a fast and effective non-greedy iterative algorithm to obtain the GRgLPCA solution.

  abstract     = {One of the new optimization techniques proposed in recent years is elephant herding optimization (EHO) algorithm. Despite its short history, EHO has been used to solve many engineering and real-world problems by attracting researcher attention with its advantages such as efficient global search ability, having fewer control parameters and ease of implementation. However, there is no remarkable binary variant of EHO algorithm in the literature. A new binary approach based on EHO algorithm is proposed in this study. The newer binary variant of EHO named as BinEHO is binarized with preserving the search ability of basic EHO. The main purpose of the study is to present a simple, efficient and robust binary variant which copes with different binary problems. Therefore, the proposed method is tested on three important binary optimization problems, 0–1 knapsack, uncapacitated facility location and wind turbine placement, in order to show its performance and accuracy. In addition, the BinEHO is compared with various binary variants on these problems. Experimental results and comparisons show that the BinEHO algorithm is a robust and efficient tool for binary optimization.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a clustering cuckoo search optimization (CCSO) is proposed. Different from the randomly generated step size in CSO, the step size in CCSO is generated by a clustering mechanism, and the value is updated according to the average fitness value difference between each cluster and the whole swarm, thereby improving the searching balance between exploration and exploitation of each solution. The effectiveness of CCSO has been validated by six typical benchmark functions and economic load dispatch problems with 6, 10, 13, 15 and 40 generators. The results of CSO and CCSO are displayed and compared in aspects of convergence rate, objective function value and robustness. Moreover, the influences of parameters as step size $$\delta $$ , solution number P, egg abandon fraction $$p_a$$ and cluster number K are all analyzed comprehensively in this study. The conclusion is that, in all the tested cases, CCSO behaves much more competitive than CSO under the same parameter setting conditions.},

  abstract     = {Data from real-world regression problems are quite often contaminated with outliers. In order to efficiently handle such undesirable samples, robust parameter estimation methods have been incorporated into randomized neural network (RNN) models, usually replacing the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. Despite recent successful applications to outlier-contaminated scenarios, significant issues remain unaddressed in the design of reliable outlier-robust RNN models for regression tasks. For example, the number of hidden neurons impacts directly on the norm of the estimated output weights, since the OLS method will rely on an ill-conditioned hidden-layer output matrix. Another design concern involves the high sensitivity of RNNs to the randomization of the hidden layer weights, an issue that can be suitably handled, e.g., by intrinsic plasticity techniques. Bearing these concerns in mind, we describe several ideas introduced in previous works concerning the design of RNN models that are both robust to outliers and numerically stable. A comprehensive evaluation of their performances is carried out across several benchmarking regression datasets taking into account accuracy, weight norms, and training time as figures of merit.},

Using simple gestures instead of complex operations to interact with the machine, the fusion of smart data feature information and so on has gradually become a research hotspot. Considering that the depth image of the Kinect sensor lacks color information and is susceptible to depth thresholds, this paper proposes a gesture segmentation method based on the fusion of color information and depth information; in order to ensure the complete information of the segmentation image, a gesture feature extraction method based on Hu invariant moment and HOG feature fusion is proposed; and by determining the optimal weight parameters, the global and local features are effectively fused. Finally, the SVM classifier is used to classify and identify gestures. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion features method has a higher gesture recognition rate and better robustness than the traditional method.},

The classification effect is also unsatisfactory which limits its applications severely. Therefore, this paper introduces the artificial-fish-swarm algorithm (AFSA) which has strong global search ability and adds an adaptive mechanism to make it adaptively adjust the scope of visual value, improves its local and global optimization ability, and reduces the number of algorithm iterations. Then it is applied to the improved FCM which is based on the Mahalanobis distance, named as adaptive AFSA-inspired FCM(AAFSA-FCM). The optimal solution obtained by adaptive AFSA (AAFSA) is used for FCM cluster analysis to solve the problems mentioned above and improve clustering performance. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better clustering effect and classification performance with lower computing cost which can be better to apply to every relevant area, such as IoT, network analysis, and abnormal detection.},

Secondly, the control method which includes kinematic controller and dynamic controller was presented based on cascade control strategy. The kinematic controller, which is responsible for generating a series of constrained velocity signals, is designed based on model predictive control. The adaptive radial basis function neural network is used to estimate the model uncertainty caused by hydrodynamic parameters.

Using the data and regression analysis, the univariate nonlinear and multivariate linear regression models are established to predict the corn price, respectively. First, this paper establishes a univariate nonlinear regression model with time as the independent variable, and corn price is used as the dependent variable through the analysis of the trend of big data related to Chinese corn price from 2005 to 2016 by MATLAB, which is the computer-based analysis and processing method. The variation of the maize price with time was fitted. To a certain extent, the price trend of corn is predicted. However, the estimated price of corn in 2017 with this model will deviate from the actual value. According to the changes of related policies in our country, we analyzed the deviation of the original model, and the relationship between supply and demand is the main underlying factor that affects the price of corn. This paper selects maize-related big data from 2005 to 2016, we set its production consumption, import and export volume as independent variables, and we still use maize price as the dependent variable to establish a multiple linear regression model. At this stage, the time series analysis of the independent variable has obtained the forecast value of each independent variable in 2017, and then the model is used to predict the corn in 2017 more accurately.},

The rapid development of artificial intelligence in security field shows that the ideal way to get rid of the dependency is to use machine learning. Hence, we elaborately compare more than 2000 protocol analysis results and select 500 most representative ones of them to build a protocol dataset. Combining the protocol representation method of traditional schemes, these selected protocols are expressed as weight matrixes based on security components. Furthermore, a machine learning-based security analysis model is proposed to automatically find the attacks of the protocol. For now, three types of attacks against authentication and key agreement protocols can be identified based on our model. And experiment results show that it can reach almost 72\% upper-bound performance. From the derivative of the accuracy curves, it can be inferred that the performance of our scheme will definitely get better as the dataset expands.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new evolutionary computing method inspired by the seed transmission process of garden balsam. Garden balsam, a beautiful and attractive flower, randomly ejects the seeds within a certain range by virtue of mechanical force originating from cracking of mature seed pods, which is different from natural expansion of most species of plants. The seeds scattered to suitable growth area will have greater reproductive capacity in the next generation, followed by iteration until the most suitable point for growth in a particular space is eventually found. This phenomenon can more intuitively show the process of searching the problem solution space in the optimization problem. The garden balsam optimization algorithm proposed in this paper incorporates two different types of search processes and has a mechanism to maintain population diversity. Through the optimization experiment on 24 constrained optimization problems, the results obtained by using this algorithm are compared with those of some known meta-heuristic search algorithms. The statistical analysis of the experimental results has been implemented by Friedman rank test and Holm–Sidak test. The comparison results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The underwater sonar image has the characteristics of complex background and heavy noise pollution. By using multi-bit quantum system to encode particles, a new sonar image segmentation algorithm based on quantum-inspired particle swarm and fuzzy clustering is proposed. Based on its own optimal particles and global optimal particles, the rotation angle is determined. By calculating the variance of the particle group fitness, the multi-bit quantum revolving gate is used to update the particle position in real time. The output of improved particle swarm optimization is used to initialize the K-mean clustering center to converge to the global optimal solution. Based on the idea of fuzzy membership matrix in FCM, combined with the isolated spatial information characteristics of the noise, the sonar image segmentation and the denoising are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the global search ability of particle swarm optimization effectively. It is better than the quantum fuzzy clustering and quantum genetic algorithm in image segmentation. The analysis results of multiple real underwater sonar images show that the new optimization algorithm has faster convergence speed, better optimizing capacity and better segmentation results for sonar images.},

In this paper, we divide the utilizing methods of label dependence into two groups from the perspective of different ways of problem transformation: label grouping method and feature space extending method. As to the feature space extending method, we find that the common problem is how to measure the dependencies between labels and to select proper labels to add to the original feature space. Therefore, we propose a ReliefF-based pruning model for multi-label classification (ReliefF-based stacking, RFS). RFS measures the dependencies between labels in a feature selection perspective and then selects the more relative labels into the original feature space. Experimental results of 9 multi-label benchmark datasets shows that RFS is more effective compared to other advanced multi-label classification algorithms.},

The existence of the target signal was judged by observing whether there are two consecutive intermittent chaos in the time domain. Then the envelope of the intermittent chaos was obtained by Hilbert transform. Finally, the exact value of envelope spectrum was obtained by using the one-and-half-dimension spectrum, which can calculate the precise value of the frequency of the signal to be measured. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can achieve a lower SNR than the conventional detection. Compared with the general chaotic detection, this algorithm can realize smart self-adaptation. It is unnecessary to specify different excitation frequencies and chaotic thresholds for different frequencies to be measured.

The open-pit mine is close to a city and has complex hydrogeological conditions. The characteristics of disasters occurring in different areas are quite different, which lead to the diversity of the disaster evolution processes. It makes disaster analysis, prevention and management more difficult. Space fault network is a theory to study the evolution process of system faults. The evolution process can be studied from the perspective of macro-evolution process and micro-event relationship. The area characteristics of the open-pit mining area are studied and the area division is carried out. Based on the existing data, the space fault networks of disaster evolution processes in different areas are established. Space fault network is transformed into space fault tree, and disaster evolution models in different areas are simplified. Three indicators, structure importance, structure complexity and structure accessibility, are proposed to measure the possibility that the edge event will lead to the target event. The characteristics and relationships of these indicators are described. Finally, taking the evolution process of south wall disaster as an example, the above three indicators are calculated, and the edge events are sorted and the significance of sort is explained.

However, the level of degradation in engineering properties of the cement-stabilized soils still needs more scientific attention. In the light of this, a database including a total of 260 unconfined compression and chloride ion penetration tests on cement-stabilized kaolin specimens exposed to sulfate attack was constituted. The data include information about cement type (sulfate resistant—SR; normal portland (N) and pozzolanic—P), and its content (0, 5, 10 and 15\%), sulfate type (sodium or magnesium sulfate) as well as its concentration (0.3, 0.5, 1\%) and curing period (1, 7, 28 and 90 days). Using this database, linear and nonlinear regression analysis (RA), backpropagation neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference techniques were employed to question whether these methods are capable of predicting unconfined compressive strength and chloride ion penetration of cement-stabilized clay exposed to sulfate attack. The results revealed that these methods have a great potential in modeling the strength and penetrability properties of cement-stabilized clays exposed to sulfate attack. While the performance of regression method is at an acceptable level, results show that adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems and backpropagation neural networks are superior in modeling.},

  abstract     = {Segmentation is considered as one of the most significant tasks in image processing. It consists of separating the pixels into different segments based on their intensity level according to threshold values. Selecting the optimal threshold value is the key to best quality segmentation. Multilevel thresholding (MT) is an essential approach for image segmentation, and it has become very popular during the past few years, but while increasing the level of thresholds, computational complexity also increases exponentially. In order to overcome this drawback, several metaheuristics-based algorithms have been used for determining the optimal MT levels. Learning enthusiasm-based teaching–learning-based optimization (LebTLBO) is a recently developed efficient, simple-to-implement and computationally inexpensive algorithm. It simulates the behaviors of the teaching and learning process in a classroom and gives the probability of getting the amount of information by the learner (student) from the educator. In this paper, LebTLBO is applied on ten standard test images having a diverse histogram, which are taken from Berkeley Segmentation Dataset 500 (BSDS500) (Martin et al. in a database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluate segmentation algorithms and measure ecological statistics, 2001) benchmark image set for segmentation. The search capability of the algorithm is combined with Otsu and Kapur’s entropy MT objective functions for image segmentation. The proposed approach is compared with the existing state-of-the-art optimization algorithms such as MTEMO, GA, PSO and BF for both Otsu and Kapur’s entropy methods. Qualitative experimental outcomes demonstrate that LebTLBO is highly efficient in terms of performance metrics such as PSNR, mean, threshold values, number of iterations taken to converge and image segmentation quality.},

Network representation learning aims to learn a project from given network data in the original topological space to low-dimensional vector space, while encoding a variety of structural and semantic information. The vector representation obtained could effectively support extensive tasks such as node classification, node clustering, link prediction and graph classification. In this survey, we comprehensively present an overview of a large number of network representation learning algorithms from two clear points of view of homogeneous network and heterogeneous network. The corresponding algorithms are deeply analyzed. Extensive applications are introduced in an all-round way, and related experiments are conducted to validate the typical algorithms.

As these entities adopt a faster and efficient communication protocol, information security techniques such as steganography and cryptography become powerful and necessary tools for conducting secure and secrecy communications. Currently, several steganography techniques have been developed, and the least significant bit (LSB) is one of these techniques which is a popular type of steganographic algorithms in the spatial domain. Indeed, as any other existing techniques, the selection of positions for data embedding within a cover signal mainly depends on a pseudorandom number generator without considering the relationship between the LSBs of the cover signal and the embedded data. In this paper and for best pixels’ positions adjustment, in which the visual distortion of the stego-image, as well as the embedding changes, becomes optimum, we propose two new position selection scenarios of LSBs-based steganography. Our new works are to improve the embedding efficiency, that is to say, select the suitable cover image pixels’ values that optimize the expected number of modifications per pixel and the visual distortion.},

  abstract     = {A number of full reference and reduced reference methods have been proposed in order to estimate the perceived visual quality of 3D meshes. However, in most practical situations, there is a limited access to the information related to the reference and the distortion type. For these reasons, the development of a no-reference mesh visual quality (MVQ) approach is a critical issue, and more emphasis needs to be devoted to blind methods. In this work, we propose a no-reference convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to estimate the perceived visual quality of 3D meshes. The method is called SCNN-BMQA (3D visual saliency and CNN for blind mesh quality assessment). The main contribution is the usage of a CNN and 3D visual saliency to estimate the perceived visual quality of distorted meshes. To do so, the CNN architecture is fed by small patches selected carefully according to their level of saliency. First, the visual saliency of the 3D mesh is computed. Afterward, we render 2D projections from the 3D mesh and its corresponding 3D saliency map. Then the obtained views are split into 2D small patches that pass through a saliency filter in order to select the most relevant patches. Finally, a CNN is used for the feature learning and the quality score estimation. Extensive experiments are conducted on four prominent MVQ assessment databases, including several tests to study the effect of the CNN parameters, the effect of visual saliency and comparison with existing methods. Results show that the trained CNN achieves good rates in terms of correlation with human judgment and outperforms the most effective state-of-the-art methods.},

The proposed approach involves careful separation of foreground and background superpixel regions from a single image taken from a related group of images in order to train an RCNN to extract the common salient object regions. The one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained using superpixels extracted from several multi-scaled images derived from a single image in every group. The output of the CNN is fed into the recurrent neural network to classify the common object superpixel properties from the remaining images. The superpixel feature training-based RCNN approach addresses two challenges: It requires a small training dataset of about 38 representative images. Further, the use of 1-dimensional superpixel features to train the RCNN results in faster training. The proposed approach delivers accurate identification and segmentation of the common salient object from an image group even under extreme background conditions and object pose variations. The approach has been extensively evaluated using public domain datasets, such as imagepair, iCoseg-sub and iCoseg. The proposed approach delivers higher accuracy, F-measure and lower mean absolute error compared to several state-of-the-art approaches.},

At first, we start with a vector of perceptual points as input seeking a class of basic shape probability as output. In fact, these perceptual points are necessary for the drawing and the recovering of each basic shape where each one is designed with an HMM built and trained with its components. Each path through these possibilities of control points represents an observation that serves as input for the following step. Secondly, the already detected sequences of observations which represent a segment formed an initial HMM and the concatenation of multiple ones leads to a global HMM. To classify a global HMM, we should codify it by searching the best path of initial HMM. The best path is obtained by computing the maximum of likelihood of the different basic shapes. In order to synthesize the handwritten trace, and to recover the best control points sequences, we investigated the progressive iterative approximation. The performance of the proposed model was assessed using samples of scripts extracted from IRONOFF and MAYASTROON databases. In fact, these samples served for the generation of the set of control points used for the HMMs training models. In experiments, good quantitative agreement and approximation were found for the generated trajectories and a more reduced representation of the scripts models was designed.},

  abstract     = {The article deals with the problems of motion detection, object recognition, and scene description using deep learning in the framework of granular computing and Z-numbers. Since deep learning is computationally intensive, whereas granular computing, on the other hand, leads to computation gain, a judicious integration of their merits is made so as to make the learning mechanism computationally efficient. Further, it is shown how the concept of z-numbers can be used to quantify the abstraction of semantic information in interpreting a scene, where subjectivity is of major concern, through recognition of its constituting objects. The system, thus developed, involves recognition of both static objects in the background and moving objects in foreground separately. Rough set theoretic granular computing is adopted where rough lower and upper approximations are used in defining object and background models. During deep learning, instead of scanning the entire image pixel by pixel in the convolution layer, we scan only the representative pixel of each granule. This results in a significant gain in computation time. Arbitrary-shaped and sized granules, as expected, perform better than regular-shaped rectangular granules or fixed-sized granules. The method of tracking is able to deal efficiently with various challenging cases, e.g., tracking partially overlapped objects and suddenly appeared objects. Overall, the granulated system shows a balanced trade-off between speed and accuracy as compared to pixel level learning in tracking and recognition. The concept of using Z-numbers, in providing a granulated linguistic description of a scene, is unique. This gives a more natural interpretation of object recognition in terms of certainty toward scene understanding.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir characterization is one of the most challenging tasks that help in modeling different lithological properties like porosity, permeability and fluid saturation using seismic readings like velocity profile, impedance, etc. Such a model is required for field development, placing new wells and prediction management. Seismic attributes are being progressively utilized for the tasks of model building, exploration and properties estimation from the data. However, these tasks become very complex due to the nonlinear and heterogeneous nature of subsurface properties. In this context, present work proposes a recurrent neural network-based learning framework to classify porosity using seismic attributes as predictor variables. The approach begins by calculating different seismic attributes from the data. From the initially calculated attribute set, features that are to be used for classification are selected by using two different strategies. Firstly, the seismic attributes having good correlation strength with reservoir porosity are extracted. Subsequently, generative topographic map is utilized to select the significant features. The final reduced features set obtained by the integrated result of above two strategies is then fed as an input to the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm. The denoised features resulting from the EMD algorithm are used to train the classification models. Further, a comparison is carried out between the proposed classification framework $$(EMD+RNN)$$ and other supervised classifiers to show the performance of the proposed framework.},

The images in ARDIS dataset are extracted from 15,000 Swedish church records which were written by different priests with various handwriting styles in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The constructed dataset consists of three single-digit datasets and one-digit string dataset. The digit string dataset includes 10,000 samples in red–green–blue color space, whereas the other datasets contain 7600 single-digit images in different color spaces. An extensive analysis of machine learning methods on several digit datasets is carried out. Additionally, correlation between ARDIS and existing digit datasets Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) and US Postal Service (USPS) is investigated. Experimental results show that machine learning algorithms, including deep learning methods, provide low recognition accuracy as they face difficulties when trained on existing datasets and tested on ARDIS dataset. Accordingly, convolutional neural network trained on MNIST and USPS and tested on ARDIS provide the highest accuracies $$58.80\%$$ and $$35.44\%$$ , respectively. Consequently, the results reveal that machine learning methods trained on existing datasets can have difficulties to recognize digits effectively on our dataset which proves that ARDIS dataset has unique characteristics. This dataset is publicly available for the research community to further advance handwritten digit recognition algorithms.},

In this context, the paper introduces a robust method, termed as CanSuR, for automatic recognition of antinuclear autoantibodies by HEp-2 cell indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) image analysis. The proposed method combines the advantages of a new sequential supervised canonical correlation analysis (CCA), introduced in this paper, with the theory of rough hypercuboid approach. While the proposed CCA efficiently combines the local textural information of HEp-2 cells, derived from various scales of rotation-invariant local binary patterns, the relevant and significant features of HEp-2 cell for staining pattern recognition are extracted using rough hypercuboid approach. Finally, the support vector machine, with radial basis function kernel, is used to recognize one of the known staining patterns present in IIF images. The effectiveness of the proposed staining pattern recognition method, along with a comparison with related approaches, is demonstrated on MIVIA, SNP and ICPR HEp-2 cell image databases. An important finding is that the proposed method performs significantly better than state-of-the art methods, on three HEp-2 cell image databases with respect to both classification accuracy and F1 score.},

Various crowd density estimation methods have been proposed by researchers in the past, but there is an utmost need for accurate, robust and efficient crowd density estimation techniques for its practical implementation. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuned and computationally economical, ensemble regression-based machine learning model for crowd density estimation. The WorldExpo’10 dataset has been used for experimental analysis and model performance evaluation. We extract variety of features in texture-based features such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix, local binary pattern and histogram of oriented gradients, structure-based features such as perimeter pixel and the orientation of pixels, and segment-based handcrafted features from each patch of the image and use an optimum combination of these features as input to the regression model. To achieve optimized memory utilization and faster speed, principal component analysis is employed to reduce the dimensions of the lengthy feature vector. Extensive experiments on different fronts ranging from the model hyperparameter optimization, features optimization and features selection were conducted, and at each step, we selected the most favorable results as input to the optimized model. The performance of the model is evaluated based on two popular metrics, i.e., mean absolute error and mean squared error. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed system outperforms the former methods tested on the WorldExpo’10 dataset.},

However, there are lots of challenges for the prediction tasks. The novelty of this research is mainly concentrated on two major aspects: (1) the neural network model is optimized and enhanced. The proposed nerve tree network model is essentially based on a tree-structured code for a multi-layered feed-forward sparse neural network; with the tree-structured code, the nerve tree network model does not require interconversion between its genotype and phenotype in the coding and decoding operations, and also effectively reduces the computing time. (2) The human–computer interaction is integrated to construct a user-friendly system. In interactive technology, the interactive contact surface and the model, interactive methods and social acceptance have also given rise to many questions that must be solved and problems that require further research and technological innovation.

Experimental results performed on the Weizmann and UCF101 databases confirmed the potentials of the proposed approach with attained classification rates of 98.76\% and 70\%, respectively, to distinguish between different human actions. For comparative and performance analysis, different types of classifiers including Knn, decision tree, SVM and deep learning are applied to the proposed descriptors. Further analysis is performed to assess the proposed descriptors under different resolutions and frame rates. The obtained results are in alignment with the early psychological studies reporting that human motion is adequate for the perception of human activities.},

  abstract     = {There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different non-military areas, and human–computer and machine–machine communications, where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources (energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of cooperating in order to achieve a common goal.

  abstract     = {Mining association patterns from a time-stamped temporal database distributed over finite time slots is implicitly associated with task of scanning the input database. Finding supports of itemsets requires scanning the input database. Database scan can be performed in either snapshot or lattice-based approach. Sequential and SPAMINE methods for similarity-profiled association pattern mining originally proposed by Jin Soung Yoo and Sashi Sekhar are based on the snapshot database scan and lattice scan, respectively. Snapshot database scan involves scanning multi-time slot database time slot by time slot. The major limitation of Sequential method is the requirement to retain original temporal database in the disk for finding itemset support computations. In this paper, a novel multi-tree structure called VRKSHA is proposed that eliminates the need to store the original temporal database in the memory and also eliminates the need to retain database in memory. The basic idea is to generate a compressed time-stamped temporal tree and use this multi-tree structure to obtain true supports of temporal itemsets for a given time slot. Discovery of similar temporal itemsets is based on finding distance between temporal itemset and reference w.r.t each time slot and validating whether the computed distance satisfies specified user dissimilarity threshold. A pattern is pruned if the dissimilarity condition fails at any given time slot well before computing true support of itemset w.r.t all time slots. The advantage of proposed Sequential approach is from the fact that it is a single database scan approach excluding the initial database scan performed for computing true supports of singleton items. VRKSHA overcomes the major limitation of retaining database in memory that is required by SPAMINE, G-SPAMINE, MASTER algorithms. Experiment results prove that computational time and memory consumed by VRKSHA are significantly very much better than by approaches such as Naïve, Sequential, SPAMINE, and G-SPAMINE. To the best of our survey and knowledge, VRKSHA is the pioneering work to introduce and propose a compressed tree-based data structure for mining similarity-profiled temporal association patterns in the area of time-profiled temporal association mining.},

Because of the complexity and variation of the plant leaves, many classical plant species identification algorithms using plant leaf images are not enough for practical application. A modified local discriminant projection (MLDP) algorithm is proposed for plant species identification. MLDP aims to extract discriminant features for plant species identification by taking class label information into account based on the property of locality preserving. The MLDP can preserve the local geometrical structure of leaves and extract the strong discriminative ability.

  abstract     = {Meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are the new gate in solving most of the complicated nonlinear systems. So, improving their robustness, reliability, and convergence speed is the main target to meet the requirements of various optimization problems. In the current work, three different fractional-order chaos maps (FC-maps), which have been introduced recently, are incorporated with the fundamental flower pollination algorithm to tune its parameters adaptively. These maps are fractional logistic map, fractional sine map, fractional tent map, and their integer-order versions. As a result, fractional chaotic FPA (FC-FPA) is proposed. The FC-FPA has been mathematically tested over 10-, 30-, 50-, and 100-dimensional CEC 2017 benchmark functions. Moreover, the influence of merging FC-maps with FPA is investigated in case of increasing the number of maximum evaluation functions based on the ten functions of CEC 2020. Additionally, to assess the superiority of the proposed FC-FPA algorithm for more complicated optimization problems, it has been tested to extract the parameters of different chaotic systems with and without added noise. In addition, it is tested on the identification of the corresponding parameters for the chaotic behavior in brush-less DC motor. The results of the fractional version of CFPA are compared with that of integer CFPA and standard FPA via an extensive statistical analysis. Furthermore, a nonparametric statistical test is employed to affirm the superiority of the proposed fractional variants of CFPA. It is evident that the performance of FPA is highly influenced by integrating the fractional-order chaos maps as the introduced FC-FPA variants provide a better accurate and more consistent results as well as a higher speed of convergence especially upon using the fractional sine map.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution and airborne pollen play a key role in respiratory and circulatory disorders and thus have a direct relation to hospital admissions for these causes. Knowing in advance the influx of patients to emergency services allows clinical institutions to optimize resources and to improve their service. Since the variables influencing respiratory and circulatory-related hospital admissions belong to fields such aerobiology or meteorology, we aim for a data-based system which is able to predict admissions without a priori assumptions. Given the number and distribution of observation stations (meteorological, pollen and chemical pollution stations and hospital), previous approaches generate many model-dependent systems that need to be combined in order to obtain the full representation of future environmental conditions. A unified approach able to extract all temporal dynamics as well as all spatial relations would allow a better representation of the aforementioned conditions and consequently a more precise hospital admissions forecast. The proposed system is based on a specific neural network topology of long short-term memories and convolutional neural networks to obtain the spatio-temporal relations between all independent and target variables. It was applied to forecast daily hospital admissions due to respiratory- and circulatory-related disorders. The proposal outperforms the benchmark approaches by reducing as an average the prediction error by 28\% and 20\% for the circulatory and respiratory cases, respectively. Consequently, the system extracts all relevant information without specific field knowledge and provides accurate hospital admissions forecasts.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this work is to develop efficient named entity recognition from the given text that in turn improves the performance of the systems that use natural language processing (NLP). The performance of IoT-based devices such as Alexa and Cortana significantly depends upon an efficient NLP model. To increase the capability of the smart IoT devices in comprehending the natural language, named entity recognition (NER) tools play an important role in these devices. In general, the NER is a two-step process that initially the proper nouns are identified from text and then classify them into predefined categories of entities such as person, location, measure, organization and time. NER is often performed as a subtask while processing natural languages which increases the accuracy level of a NLP task. In this paper, we propose deep neural network architecture for named entity recognition for the resource-scarce language Hindi, based on convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network and conditional random field (CRF). In the proposed approach, initially, we use skip-gram word2vec model and GloVe model to represent words in semantic vectors which are further used in different deep neural network-based architectures. In the proposed approach, we use character- and word-level embedding to represent the text that includes information at fine-grained level. Due to the use of character-level embeddings, the proposed model is robust for the out-of-vocabulary words. Experimental results show that the combination of Bi-LSTM, CNN and CRF algorithms performs better as compared to the other baseline methods such as recurrent neural network, long short-term memory and Bi-LSTM individually.},

As a result, time-critical and delay-sensitive data experience a higher delay, lower throughput, and quality of service degradation. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we propose a model that is energy efficient and is capable of maximizing the spectrum utilization with optimal Device-to-Gateway configuration. Initially, the network gateways perform spectrum sensing for available channels using an energy detection technique and forward them to a cognitive engine (CE). The CE assigns the best available channels in the licensed band to the network devices for communication. Each channel is divided into equal-length time slots for the timely delivery of critical data. In addition, the CE calculates the load on each gateway and uses particle swarm optimization algorithm for optimal load distribution among the network gateways. Our experimental results show that the proposed model is efficient for the resource-constrained IoT devices in terms of packet drop ratio, delay, and throughput of the network. Moreover, the proposed scheme also achieves optimal Device-to-Gateway configuration with efficient spectrum utilization in the licensed band.},

  abstract     = {Packet size optimization, with the purpose of minimizing the wireless packet transmission energy consumption, is crucial for the energy efficiency of the Internet of Things nodes. Meanwhile, energy scavenging from ambient energy sources has gained a significant attraction to avoid battery issues as the number of nodes increasingly grows. Packet size optimization algorithms have so far been proposed for battery-powered networks that have limited total energy with continuous power availability to prolong their lifetime. On the other hand, batteryless networks based on energy harvesting offer unlimited total energy with the interruption in availability. This is due to changing ambient conditions or the required time for harvesting and storing in small capacitors. Packet size optimization of batteryless networks has not been addressed so far. In this paper, an AI-based packet size optimization algorithm is proposed for batteryless networks that consider the amount of harvested energy at each node. Therefore, packet size is optimized dynamically for each round of data transmission. The proposed method is then evaluated via numerical simulations for a heterogenous wireless body area sensor network as a case study, considering 1-hop, cooperative, and 2-hop communication networks. Cooperative topology yields optimum energy efficiency for highly dynamic sensors, such as ECG, while 2-hop has shown to be optimum for the same type of sensors in battery-powered networks. Also, for sensors with slower dynamics such as body temperature, 1-hop turns out to be optimum in networks solely dependent on energy scavenging while cooperative topology is optimum for battery-powered networks. The algorithm applies to any heterogeneous fully batteryless networks to dynamically optimize packet size at each transmission instance.},

The more intelligent and efficient communication approach poses greater challenges to the semantic understanding module in the system. Facing with the complex and diverse interactive scenarios in practical applications, the academia and the industry urgently need more powerful Natural Language Understanding (NLU) methods as support. Intent Detection and Slot Filling joint task, as one of the core sub-tasks in NLU, has been widely used in different human–computer interaction scenarios. In the current era of deep learning, the joint task of Intent Detection and Slot Filling has also changed from previous rule-based methods to deep learning-based methods. It is an important problem to explore how to realize the models of these tasks to be refined and targeted designed, and to make the Intent Detection task better serve the improvement of precision of Slot Filling task by connecting the before and after tasks. It has great significance for building a more humanized IoT voice interaction system. In this study, we designed two joint models to realize Intent Detection and Slot Filling joint task. For the Intent Detection type task, one is based on BiGRU-Att-CapsuleNet (hybrid-based model) and the other is based on the RCNN model. Both methods use the BiGRU-CRF model for the Slot Filling type task. The hybrid-based model can enhance the semantic capture capability of a single model. And by combining specialized models built independently for each task to achieve a complete joint task, it can be better to achieve optimal performance on each task. This study also carried out detailed comparative experiments of tasks and joint tasks on multiple datasets. Experiments show that the joint models have achieved competitive results in 7 typical datasets included in multiple scenarios in English and Chinese compared with other models.},

The information from the subject’s brain is collected in form of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this paper, we analyze the use of EEG signals for applications related to home automation. We present a hybrid model which makes use of Long Short-Term Memory which is considered as a robust temporal classification model in AI and classical Random Forest Classifier for EEG classification. We also discuss how our proposed hybrid model overcomes the limitation presented by the individual models. To arrive at the best model, we have analyzed various parameters such as sampling rate and combination of different brain rhythms which we finally use in our hybrid model. Based on experiments conducted on a custom-built dataset, we also discuss the spatial significance of different electrodes of the EEG device and get insight in signals generated from different areas of the brain.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing use of the Internet of things (IoT) in diverse domains, security concerns and IoT threats are constantly rising. The computational and memory limitations of IoT devices have resulted in emerging vulnerabilities in most IoT-run environments. Due to the low processing ability, IoT devices are often not capable of running complex defensive mechanisms. Lack of an architecture for a safer IoT environment is referred to as the most important barrier in developing a secure IoT system. In this paper, we propose a secure architecture for IoT edge layer infrastructure, called AI4SAFE-IoT. This architecture is built upon AI-powered security modules at the edge layer for protecting IoT infrastructure. Cyber threat attribution, intelligent web application firewall, cyber threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence are the main modules proposed in our architecture. The proposed modules detect, attribute, and further identify the stage of an attack life cycle based on the Cyber Kill Chain model. In the proposed architecture, we define each security module and show its functionality against different threats in real-world applications. Moreover, due to the integration of AI security modules in a different layer of AI4SAFE-IoT, each threat in the edge layer will be handled by its corresponding security module delivered by a service. We compared the proposed architecture with the existing models and discussed our architecture independence of the underlying IoT layer and its comparatively low overhead according to delivering security as service for the edge layer of IoT architecture instead of embed implementation. Overall, we evaluated our proposed architecture based on the IoT service management score. The proposed architecture obtained 84.7 out of 100 which is the highest score among peer IoT edge layer security architectures.},

  abstract     = {The advent of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has determined the proliferation of smart devices connected to the Internet and injected a vast amount of data into it, which may undergo many computational stages at several clusters. On the one hand, the benefits brought by these technologies are well known; however, in the envisaged scenario, the exposure of data, services and infrastructures to malicious attacks has definitely grown. Even a single breach on any of the links of the data–service–infrastructure chain may seriously compromise the security of the end-user application. Therefore, the logical and smart clustering while satisfying security and reliability is a key issue for IIoT networks. A novel clustering method proposed based on power demand assures security of data information in IIoT-based applications. First, security capacity of the system is calculated from mutual information of primary channel and eavesdropping channel. Then, under the maximum transmit power constraint, an optimal transmit power is found based on deep learning technique, which maximizes security capacity of the system. Finally, the network is clustered according to the calculated power demand. Experimental results accredit the proposed method has higher security and reliability, as well as lower network time overhead and power consumption.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, classifier ensemble techniques have drawn the attention of many researchers in the machine learning research community. The ultimate goal of these researches is to improve the accuracy of the ensemble compared to the individual classifiers. In this paper, a novel algorithm for building ensembles called dynamic programming-based ensemble design algorithm (DPED) is introduced and studied in detail. The underlying theory behind DPED is based on cooperative game theory in the first phase and applying a dynamic programming approach in the second phase. The main objective of DPED is to reduce the size of the ensemble while encouraging extra diversity in order to improve the accuracy. The performance of the DPED algorithm is compared empirically with the classical ensemble model and with a well-known algorithm called “the most diverse.” The experiments were carried out with 13 datasets from UCI and three ensemble models. Each ensemble model is constructed from 15 different base classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate that DPED outperforms the classical ensembles on all datasets in terms of both accuracy and size of the ensemble. Regarding the comparison with the most diverse algorithm, the number of selected classifiers by DPED across all datasets and all domains is less than or equal to the number selected by the most diverse algorithm. Experiment on blog spam dataset, for instance, shows that DPED provides an accuracy of 96.47 compared to 93.87 obtained by the most diverse using 40\% training size. Finally, the experimental results verify the reliability, stability, and effectiveness of the proposed DPED algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Gesture recognition is a kind of biometric which has assumed great significance in the field of computer vision for communicating information through human activities. To recognize the various gestures and achieve efficient classification, an efficient computational machine learning technique is required. The Shift Invariant Convolutional Deep Structured Neural Learning with Long Short-Term Memory (SICDSNL–LSTM) and Bivariate Fully Recurrent Deep Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (BFRDNN–LSTM) have been introduced for classifying human activities with efficient accuracy and minimal time complexity. The SICDSNL–LSTM technique collects gesture data (a kind of biometric) from the dataset and gives it to the input layers of Shift Invariant Convolutional Deep Structured Neural Learning. The SICDSNL–LSTM technique uses two hidden layers for performing regression and classification. In the regression process, dice similarity is used for measuring the relationship between data and output classes. In the second process, the input data are classified into dissimilar classes for each time step using LSTM unit with soft-step activation function. The soft-step activation function uses ‘forget gate’ for removing the less significant data from the cell state. This is also used to make a decision to display the output at a particular time step and to remove other class results. Then, LSTM output is given to the output layers, and convolutional deep neural learning is performed to classify the gesture. Based on the classification results, human activity and gesture are recognized with high accuracy. The BFRDNN–LSTM technique also performs regression in the first hidden layers using bivariate correlation to find relationship between data and classes. The LSTM unit in BFRDNN–LSTM technique uses Gaussian activation function in the second hidden layers for categorizing incoming data into various classes at each time step. In this proposed BFRDNN–LSTM method, fully recurrent deep neural network utilizes gradient descent function to minimize the error rate at the output layers and to increase the accuracy of the gesture recognition. Both SICDSNL–LSTM and BFRDNN–LSTM techniques automatically learn the features and the data to minimize time complexity in gesture recognition. Experimental evaluation is carried out using factors such as gesture recognition accuracy, false-positive rate and time complexity with a number of data.},

  abstract     = {Road traffic environments are highly dynamic and volatile with a multitude of roadside and external environmental factors contributing to its dynamicity. Apart from infrastructure-related means such as traffic lights, planned and unplanned road events and different road networks, a core component which contributes towards the traffic environment is the human factor which is heavily overlooked in the current studies. Due to diverse travel patterns of day-to-day activities, the commuter behaviour is directly depicted in traffic patterns providing an opportunity to further explore human behaviours using road traffic. Conducting such analysis would reveal different commuter behavioural patterns that can be used for optimization and timely management of operations. However, to conduct such real-time behaviour analysis, large volumes of high-frequency data are required with high granularity, as well as, a suitable technology to manage such data. Addressing these needs, we propose an environment-driven commuter behavioural model that can be used to elucidate diverse behaviours in road traffic environments. We conceptualized, designed and developed an artificial intelligence based commuter behaviour profiling framework to detect diverse commuter behavioural profiles, fluctuating and routine patterns among commuters using traffic flow profiling and travel trajectory analysis. We evaluated the framework using 190 million data points captured from the Bluetooth sensor network of the Melbourne arterial road network, in the state of Victoria in Australia. The results demonstrate that traffic flow profiling of the proposed framework can provide insights on recurrent commuter behaviours that are distinct to a selected area with a high granularity. Moreover, traffic trajectory analysis provides insights on non-recurrent behaviours such as accidents with regard to how such incidents impact the dynamics of the network and how the impact is propagated through the network. Besides road traffic management, the proposed framework will enable real-time decision-making when planning road infrastructure and support decision-making of government and business entities to optimize operations.},

The IoT is one such framework, where the self-organization of the connected devices is a momentous aspect. The devices involved in these networks inherently relate to the collection of several consolidated devices like the sensory devices, consumer appliances, wearables, and other associated applications, which facilitate a ubiquitous connectivity among the devices. This is one of the most significant prerequisites of IoT systems as several interconnected devices need to be included in the convolution for the uninterrupted execution of the services. Thus, in order to understand the scalability and the heterogeneity of these interconnected devices, the exponent of power-law plays a significant role. In this paper, an analytical framework to illustrate the ubiquitous power-law behavior of the IoT devices is derived. An emphasis regarding the mathematical insights for the characterization of the dynamic behavior of these devices is conceptualized. The observations made in this direction are illustrated through simulation results. Further, the traits of the wireless sensor networks, in context with the contemporary scale-free architecture, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Wireless communications play an important role in the mobile Internet of Things (IoT). For practical mobile communication systems, N-Nakagami fading channels are a better characterization than N-Rayleigh and 2-Rayleigh fading channels. The average bit error probability (ABEP) is an important factor in the performance evaluation of mobile IoT systems. In this paper, cooperative communications is used to enhance the ABEP performance of mobile IoT systems using selection combining. To compute the ABEP, the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the direct link and end-to-end link are considered. The probability density function (PDF) of these SNRs is derived, and this is used to derive the cumulative distribution function, which is used to derive closed-form ABEP expressions. The theoretical results are confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulation. The impact of fading and other parameters on the ABEP performance is examined. These results can be used to evaluate the performance of complex environments such as mobile IoT and other communication systems. To support active complex event processing in mobile IoT, it is important to predict the ABEP performance. Thus, a back-propagation (BP) neural network-based ABEP performance prediction algorithm is proposed. We use the theoretical results to generate training data. We test the extreme learning machine (ELM), linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and BP neural network methods. Compared to LR, SVM, and ELM methods, the simulation results verify that our method can consistently achieve higher ABEP performance prediction results.},

  abstract     = {The exponential increase in the number of the Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates dynamic and shared spectrum access at the edge of network. In cognitive radio (CR)-based IoT communications, spectrum sensing (SS) plays a pivotal role, if designed carefully, to enable a coexistence between licensed users (LUs) and unlicensed IoT devices for efficient and dynamic spectrum utilization. Though several SS techniques have been proposed in the literature, energy detection (ED) is renowned for its time and resource efficiency. Despite its suitability for IoT devices owing to its low hardware complexity and absence of a priori LU information, the detection performance of ED is poor at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) channel conditions. While cooperative sensing can alleviate the performance problem of ED sensing in IoT network, significant detection cannot be achieved under adverse channel environments using non-cooperative IoT applications. Recently, stochastic resonance (SR) has been employed in CRs to boost the performance of SS in weak signal detection. In this paper, we propose a metaheuristic firefly algorithm (FFA) to determine the SR parameters through an objective function defined by the output SNR of a dynamic IoT system. In particular, we use an optimization scheme to optimally compute a noise level to achieve the best SR effect. Hence, the proposed FFA-based optimization problem significantly improves the sensing time and utilization of IoT communication channels in the weak heterogeneous IoT application introductions into the market. Our proposed system achieves a better detection probability of 80\% compared to the 50\% obtained through previous SR-based ED research works taking into account of SNR value of − 20 dB and a 10\% false alarm probability ( $$Q_{\rm FA}$$ ). Moreover, for SNR value of − 20 dB, the sensing error probability of our proposed technique (20\%) is 30\% less than the previous SR-based ED considering $$Q_{\rm FA}$$ = 5\%.},

The study aims to automatically extract the self-learned features using an end-to-end learning CNN and compares the results with the conventional state-of-art and traditional computer-aided diagnosis system’s performance. The architecture consists of eight layers: one input layer, three convolutional layers and three sub-sampling layers intercepted with batch normalization, ReLu and max-pooling for salient feature extraction, and one fully connected layer that uses softmax function connected to 3 neurons as output layer, classifying an input image into one of three classes categorized as nodules $$\ge$$ 3 mm as benign (low malignancy nodules), malignant (high malignancy nodules), and nodules &lt; 3 mm and non-nodules $$\ge$$ 3 mm combined as non-cancerous. For the input layer, lung nodule CT images are acquired from the Lung Image Database Consortium public repository having 1018 cases. Images are pre-processed to uniquely segment the nodule region of interest (NROI) in correspondence to four radiologists’ annotations and markings describing the coordinates and ground-truth values. A two-dimensional set of re-sampled images of size 52 $$\times$$ 52 pixels with random translation, rotation, and scaling corresponding to the NROI are generated as input samples. In addition, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are employed to generate additional images with similar characteristics as pulmonary nodules. CNNs are trained using images generated by GAN and are fine-tuned with actual input samples to differentiate and classify the lung nodules based on the classification strategy. The pre-trained and fine-tuned process upon the trained network’s architecture results in aggregate probability scores for nodule detection reducing false positives. A total of 5188 images with an augmented image data store are used to enhance the performance of the network in the study generating high sensitivity scores with good true positives. Our proposed CNN achieved the classification accuracy of 93.9\%, an average specificity of 93\%, and an average sensitivity of 93.4\% with reduced false positives and evaluated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with the highest observed value of 0.934 using the GAN generated images.},

  abstract     = {To overcome the problems of automated brain tumor classification, a novel approach is proposed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model using magnetic resonance images (MRI). First, N4ITK and Gaussian filters having size 5 × 5 are used to boost the of multi-sequence MRI quality. The presented deep LSTM model having four layers is utilized for classification. In each layer, optimal hidden units (HU) are selected such as 200 HU, 225 HU, 200 HU and 225 HU, respectively. These hidden or concealed units are chosen after performing extensive experiments to acquire better results. The results are validated on different versions of BRATS datasets (BRATS 2012–15, 2018) and SISS-ISLES 2015 dataset. The presented method attained dice similarity coefficient (DSC) 1.00 on 2012 synthetic, 0.95 on 2013, 0.99 on 2013 Leader board, 0.99 on 2014, 0.98 on 2015, 0.99 on 2018 and 0.95 on SISS-ISLES 2015. The methodology is also checked on real patient’s cases of brain tumor collected from Pakistan ordinance factory and achieved 0.97 DSC. The results confirm that the presented method provides more help for radiologists to classify brain tumor precisely.},

  abstract     = {Chest X-ray images (CXRs) are the most common radiological examination tool for screening and diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary diseases. The automatic segmentation of anatomical structures in CXRs is critical for many clinical applications. However, existing deep models work on severely down-sampled images (commonly $$256\times 256$$ pixels), reducing the quality of the contours of the resulting segmentation and negatively affecting the possibilities of such methods to be effectively used in a real environment. In this paper, we study multi-organ (clavicles, lungs, and hearts) segmentation, one of the most important problems in semantic understanding of CXRs. We completely avoid down-sampling in images up to $$1024\times 1024$$ (as in the JSRT dataset), and we diminish its impact in higher resolutions via network architecture simplification without a significant loss in the accuracy. To do so, we propose four different convolutional models by introducing structural changes to the baselines employed (U-Net and InvertedNet) as well as by integrating several techniques barely used by CXRs segmentation algorithms, such as instance normalization and atrous convolution. We also compare single-class and multi-class strategies to elucidate which approach is the most convenient for this problem. Our best proposal, X-Net+, outperforms nine state-of-the-art methods on clavicles and lungs obtaining a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.938 and 0.978, respectively, employing a tenfold cross-validation protocol. The same architecture yields comparable results to the state of the art in heart segmentation with a Dice value of 0.938. Finally, its reduced version, RX-Net+, obtains similar results but with a significant reduction in memory usage and training time.},

  abstract     = {Malignant melanoma, not belongs to a common type of skin cancers but most serious because of its growth—affecting large number of people worldwide. Recent studies proclaimed that risk factors can be substantially reduced by making it almost treatable, if detected at its early stages. This timely detection and classification demand an automated system, though procedure is quite complex. In this article, a novel strategy is adopted, which not only diagnoses the skin cancer but also assigns a proper class label. The proposed technique is principally built on saliency valuation and the selection of most discriminant deep features selection. The lesion contrast is being enhanced using proposed Gaussian method, followed by color space transformation from RGB to HSV. The new color space facilitates the saliency map construction process, utilizing inner and outer disjoint windows, by making the foreground and background maximally differentiable. From the segmented images, deep features are extracted by utilizing inception CNN model on two basic output layers. These extracted set of features are later fused using proposed decision-controlled parallel fusion method, prior to feature selection using proposed window distance-controlled entropy features selection method. The most discriminant features are later subjected to classification step. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods, three freely available datasets are utilized such as PH2, ISBI 2016, and ISBI 2017 with achieve accuracy is 97.74\%, 96.1\%, and 97\%, respectively. Simulation results clearly reveal the improved performance of proposed method on all three datasets compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Electrocardiography is the primary diagnostic tool for measuring the malfunction of different heart activities in the form of various cardiac diseases. Some cardiac diseases require special attention due to the urgency and risk factors involved. Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the cardiac diseases that require robust identification. Early prediction in MI cases without prior history remains to be an ongoing challenge. This article delivers a major novel contribution in the context of predictive classification of flattened T-wave MI cases. Therefore, a novel model-driven deep deterministic learning (MDDDL) approach is proposed. In MDDDL, two different data sets are used for the execution of operational activities in terms of flattened T-wave predictive classification. The first data set is the publicly available Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), and the second data set is exclusively obtained from the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Firstly, the systematic behaviour of MDDDL is defined in terms of pattern recognition of extracted features between T-wave alternans and flattened T-wave subjects, and then both data sets are merged considering data fusion approach and pre-defined conditions. Afterwards, the empirical approach is adopted in MDDDL evaluation in relation to global acceptance and state-of-the-art comparison. Finally, some qualitative improvements, such as inclusion of a backtracking factor for rapid prediction of flattened anomalies and increasing the number of features along with enhancement of fusion processes to reduce complexity, are required by the MDDDL and should be covered in future works.},

  abstract     = {The human brain is considered to be the anatomical seat of intelligence, comprehensively supervising conscious and autonomous functions responsible for monitoring and control operations. Although neural homeostasis can be disrupted, early signs of disease should be recognized to save the patient from permanent disability and even a preventable death. The record of World Health Organization (WHO) lists various brain diseases, such as aneurism, stroke and tumor, which affect humans irrespective of their age, sex and province, all of which affect diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options. Since clinically significant diagnosis of brain abnormality is generally performed using dedicated imaging procedures and also under the supervision of an experienced radiologist, more accurate tools can make this process even more precise. The usual protocol involves a radiologist who records the three-dimensional (3D) image which provides initial insight on the type of brain disease, followed by doctor examination of the 3D/2D image that determines the treatment plan. This article proposes a tool and associated procedure to examine a clinical brain image with improved accuracy in order to provide early insight on ideal treatment procedure. In summary, this tool gives the treatment team unprecedented assessment capability before an operation by integrating all the possible image processing procedures to enhance the result in brain image analysis.},

However, while predicting the abnormal pathology, both vessel and osseous details are elementary to patient diagnosis and treatment. In this manuscript, with an aim to parallelize the visualization of enhanced vessel details and osseous information for quick diagnosis, an image fusion algorithm is proposed based on the pre-enhancement of source images which generates highly pleasant visual results free from noise and ghostly artefacts outperforming the ten other image fusion techniques.

  abstract     = {Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is caused by lethal arrhythmia. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) are amenable to defibrillation or electrical shock therapy (“shockable” arrhythmia) that can abolish the VF/VT and restore normal electrical and mechanical heart function. The challenge is to differentiate between shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia during the emergency response to SCD. When it comes to saving the life, accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis and fast delivery of appropriate treatment is imperative. Automated systems to differentiate shockable from non-shockable arrhythmia have been developed to overcome the difficulty, and possible errors due to the manual inspection. In the present work, we have devised an efficient, effective and robust automated system to detect shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia using an optimal wavelet-based features extracted from ECG epochs of 2 s durations. We employed optimal two-channel frequency selective orthogonal wavelet filter bank to diagnose shockable ventricular arrhythmia. The optimization was carried out by minimizing the stop band ripple energy of the wavelet filter. The optimal orthogonal wavelet filter has been designed using a semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation without the use of any parameterization. The SDP solution gave us the desired optimal orthogonal wavelet filter bank with minimum stop band energy and the desired degree of regularity for the given length of filter. Fuzzy entropy and Renyi entropy features were extracted from the 2-s ECG epochs. These extracted features were then fed into the classifiers for discrimination of shockable arrhythmia rhythms and non-shockable arrhythmia rhythms. The best results were obtained from support vector machine. Accuracy of 97.8\%, sensitivity of 93.42\%, and specificity of 98.35\% were obtained using a tenfold cross validation scheme. The developed automated system is accurate and robust; therefore, it can be integrated in automated external defibrillators that can be deployed for hospitals as well as out-of-hospital emergency resuscitation of SCD.},

Automatic lung segmentation is the most common prerequisite to develop a computerized diagnosis system for analyzing chest CT images.

Earlier lung segmentation techniques depend on handcrafted features, and their performance relies on the features considered for segmentation. The proposed model automatically segments the lung from complete CT scan in two laps: (1) learning the required filters to extract hierarchical feature representations at convolutional layers, (2) dense prediction with spatial features through learnable deconvolutional layers. The model has been trained and evaluated with low-dose chest CT scan images on LIDC-IDRI database. The proposed CDWN reaches the average Dice coefficient of 0.95 and accuracy of 98\% in segmenting the lung regions from 20 test images and maintains consistent results for all test images. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach achieves a superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods for lung segmentation.},

Despite the progress of science, the modern prosthesis has the same age-old problem of accurate force estimation. Among different kinds of force, clench force is the most important one. Because of this importance, this paper presents a hardware system that has been designed and implemented to estimate the desired clench force using surface Electromyography signals recorded from lower-arm muscles. The implementation includes a two-layer artificial neural network with a surface electromyography integrator. The neural network was trained with the Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation algorithm and was implemented in a field programmable gate array using an off-chip training method. The results from 10 datasets, recorded from five subjects, show that the hardware model is very accurate, with an average mean square error of 0.003. This suggests that the proposed design can mimic the behavior of clench force that a real limb does, and therefore this intelligent system could be a useful tool for any application related to prostheses.},

  abstract     = {Patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) show specific dysarthria in their speech resulting in specific marks which could be used to detect early symptoms and monitor the evolution of the disease in time. Classically articulation marks have been mainly based on static premises. Articulation kinematics from acoustic correlates may help in producing measurements depending on the dynamic behaviour of speech. Specifically, distribution functions from the absolute kinematic velocity estimated on a simplified articulation model can be used in establishing distances based on information theory concepts between running speech segments from patients and controls. As an example, several cases of ALS were studied longitudinally using this methodology. The study shows that the performance of dynamic articulation quality correlates may be sensitive and robust in tracking illness progress. Conclusions foresee the use of speech as a valuable monitoring methodology for ALS timely neurodegenerative progression.},

  abstract     = {Ear recognition technology has long been dominated by (local) descriptor-based techniques due to their formidable recognition performance and robustness to various sources of image variability. While deep-learning-based techniques have started to appear in this field only recently, they have already shown potential for further boosting the performance of ear recognition technology and dethroning descriptor-based methods as the current state of the art. However, while recognition performance is often the key factor when selecting recognition models for biometric technology, it is equally important that the behavior of the models is understood and their sensitivity to different covariates is known and well explored. Other factors, such as the train- and test-time complexity or resource requirements, are also paramount and need to be consider when designing recognition systems. To explore these issues, we present in this paper a comprehensive analysis of several descriptor- and deep-learning-based techniques for ear recognition. Our goal is to discover weak points of contemporary techniques, study the characteristics of the existing technology and identify open problems worth exploring in the future. We conduct our analysis through identification experiments on the challenging Annotated Web Ears (AWE) dataset and report our findings. The results of our analysis show that the presence of accessories and high degrees of head movement significantly impacts the identification performance of all types of recognition models, whereas mild degrees of the listed factors and other covariates such as gender and ethnicity impact the identification performance only to a limited extent. From a test-time-complexity point of view, the results suggest that lightweight deep models can be equally fast as descriptor-based methods given appropriate computing hardware, but require significantly more resources during training, where descriptor-based methods have a clear advantage. As an additional contribution, we also introduce a novel dataset of ear images, called AWE Extended (AWEx), which we collected from the web for the training of the deep models used in our experiments. AWEx contains 4104 images of 346 subjects and represents one of the largest and most challenging (publicly available) datasets of unconstrained ear images at the disposal of the research community.},

The presented idea in this work proposes a control strategy for autonomous robotic systems, specifically car-like robots. The main objective of this work is the development of a reactive navigation controller by means of obstacles avoidance and position control to reach a desired position in an unknown environment. This research goal was achieved by the integration of potential fields and neuroevolution controllers. The neuro-evolutionary controller was designed using the (NEAT) algorithm “Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies” and trained using a designed training environment. The methodology used allowed the vehicle to reach a certain level of autonomy, obtaining a stable controller that includes kinematic and dynamic considerations. The obtained results showed significant improvements compared to the comparison work.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a progressive and irreversible cognitive deterioration. In a previous stage, the so-called Mild Cognitive Impairment or cognitive loss appears. Nevertheless, this previous stage does not seem sufficiently severe to interfere in independent abilities of daily life, so it is usually diagnosed inappropriately. Thus, its detection is a crucial challenge to be addressed by medical specialists. This paper presents a novel proposal for such early diagnosis based on automatic analysis of speech and disfluencies, and Deep Learning methodologies. The proposed tools could be useful for supporting Mild Cognitive Impairment diagnosis. The Deep Learning approach includes Convolutional Neural Networks and nonlinear multifeature modeling. Additionally, an automatic hybrid methodology is used in order to select the most relevant features by means of nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test and Support Vector Machine Attribute evaluation.},

In search towards such a robust voice pathology detection system, we investigated three distinct classifiers within supervised learning and anomaly detection paradigms. We conducted a set of experiments using a variety of input data such as raw waveforms, spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and conventional acoustic (dysphonic) features (AF). In comparison with previously published works, this article is the first to utilize combination of four different databases comprising normophonic and pathological recordings of sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ unrestricted to a subset of vocal pathologies. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, this article is the first to explore gradient-boosted trees and deep learning for this application. The following best classification performances measured by F1 score on dedicated test set were achieved: XGBoost (0.733) using AF and MFCC, DenseNet (0.621) using MFCC, and Isolation Forest (0.610) using AF. Even though these results are of exploratory character, conducted experiments do show promising potential of gradient boosting and deep learning methods to robustly detect voice pathologies.},

A set of feature-based graphometric information has been extracted from off-line handwritten words to implement an automatic biometric approach. Given the handwritten nature of the information and its great variability, a feature selection based on principal component analysis and neural network classifier has been proposed. A fusion block based on neural networks has been added in order to reduce the effect of the data variability due to an increase and stabilization of the accuracy. A dataset composed of 100 writers have been used for the experiments. A holdout cross-validation was applied and the accuracy reached between 99.80\% and 100\%.},

Due to this disturbance in breathing, there is a decrease in the oxygen saturation (SpO2) level. Thus, SpO2 can be used as a source of information for the automatic detection of apnea. Several solutions exist in the literature where different features are used. To find a better discriminant capacity, a subset of few features that obtains higher accuracy with the proper classifier is needed. To face this challenge, this work compares two different feature selection methods. The first one is a filter method named minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and the other one is called sequential forward search. These methods are tested with different classifiers. Two public datasets with 8 and 25 subjects are used to test and compare the performances of the different feature selection methods. A set of features for each classifier is obtained, and the results are compared with the previous work. The results found in this work show a good performance with respect to the state of the art and present a good option for apnea screening with low resources.},

The bright lesions are highlighted using a normalization process followed by anisotropic diffusion and intensity threshold for detection of lesions which makes the algorithm robust to correctly reject false positives. SVM-based classifier is used to reject false positives using 10 distinct feature types. Red lesions are accurately detected from a shade-corrected green channel image, followed by morphological flood filling and regional minima operations. The rejection of false positives using geometrical features makes the system less complex and computationally efficient. A comprehensive quantitative analysis to grade the severity of the disease has resulted in an average sensitivity of 92.85 and 86.03\% on DIARETDB1 and MESSIDOR databases, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the covering salesman problem (CSP), which is an extension of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP). Given a set of cities and a coverage radius associated with each one of them, the CSP seeks a Hamiltonian cycle over a subset of cities such that each city not in the subset is within the coverage radius of at least one city in the subset and that has minimum length among all Hamiltonian cycles over such subsets. To solve this problem, one has to deal with the aspects of subset selection and permutation. The CSP finds application in emergency and disaster management and rural healthcare. This paper presents two hybrid metaheuristic approaches for the CSP. The first approach is based on the artificial bee colony algorithm, whereas the latter approach is based on the genetic algorithm. Both the approaches make use of several new first improvement or best improvement based local search strategies defined over various neighborhood structures. Computational results on a wide range of benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. We are able to improve the best known solution values on majority of the large instances.},

These sLFOs travel through the entire body and the brain with symmetrical (across the midline of the body) and highly predictable delays, where they can be observed with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Their characteristics may serve as useful biomarkers for detecting and monitoring circulatory dysfunction. Pure sLFOs can be collected in the periphery (e.g., fingers, toes, earlobes). Here we present a 7-channel NIRS oximeter [MNO] for sLFOs detection and analysis in the periphery, which we named concurrent continuous wave fNIRS system (CON-CW fNIRS). Our CON-CW fNIRS is small (10 × 10 × 20 cm3), highly portable, has low-power consumption and is highly cost-effective (below $300).

  abstract     = {Recently, a great variety of image super-resolution (SR) algorithms based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have been proposed and achieved significant improvement. But how to restore more high-frequency details such as edges and textures is still an unsolved issue. The low-frequency information is similar in a pair of low-resolution and high-resolution images. So the SR model is supposed to pay more attention to the high-frequency features to restore more realistic images. But most CNN-based methods don’t consider the different types of features and think the features in different channels and regions contribute equally to the reconstruction performance, which limits the representation capacity of the model. In the meantime, most of these deep networks only simply stack blocks like residual block, which only capture the local features. In this paper, we propose a deep multilevel residual attention network (MRAN) for image SR to focus on the high-frequency features and improve the flow of information. Specially, we propose a channel-wise attention module and a spatial attention module to rescale the channel-wise and spatial weights adaptively, which makes our MRAN focus more on the high-frequency information. Meanwhile, to improve the flow of information and ease the training process, the multilevel residual learning is adopted. Extensive experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our MRAN is superior to those state-of-the-art methods for both accuracy and visual comparisons.},

The prosthetic socket having a free-form surface is considered for reconstruction of an accurate and complete digital model, which is further crucial for subsequent design, analysis and production. The input factors considered for the socket surface reconstruction includes number of points, filtering, triangle counts and smoothing level. The experimental trials are performed using face-centered central composite design, and further experimental data are used to establish Mamdani fuzzy logic model to predict the surface standard deviation and required space in computer memory as the response parameters. The confirmation experiment results reveal that the fuzzy model shows good agreement of 96.53\% with the experimental measured value. Based on the results, it is proved that established fuzzy model can be used for predicting the surface reconstruction parameters to improve the final accuracy of the transtibial prosthetic socket model. The results concluded that the fuzzy logic provides commendable results; in addition, it successfully predicts the effect of different parameters considered for surface reconstruction on surface accuracy and computer file size.},

The ordinary community suffers deficient in diagnosis for higher investigative costs as well as the lack of certified practitioners. This article proposes some AI techniques to eradicate this lacuna by designing a prototype. The proposed prototype here termed as machine intelligent diagnostic system (MIDs), which has the capability of learning, thinking, reasoning and managing uncertainty as a real-world doctor. The model structured according to AI techniques considers the different cases of the disease to implement it. This article analyzes the shortcoming of MIDs, which can perform as a doctor to serve society as regular fashion as well as at the time of crisis as a crisis-manager. The degrees of the acuteness of patients’ symptoms are perceived by a membership function, which is used to tackle the emotion of the patients, and a fuzzy logic membership function is being used to calculate probabilities of diseases. Finally, this work finds smart results of MIDs, which can serve as doctors to some extent to compensate for the crisis of doctor in the universe.},

Both full distributed state asynchronous edge-event triggered adaptive controller and dynamic output feedback asynchronous edge-event triggered adaptive controller are designed, which all can ensure that COR problem is achieved and Zeno behavior will not exist in the MASs. Different from other works about COR problem, one of the highlights of the paper is that agents in the MASs are divided into three groups, that is, exosystem, informed agents directly receive external signal and uninformed agents that cannot directly receive external signal. The communication between the exosystem and the informed agents is not continuous by designing the event-triggered mechanism or asynchronous edge-based mechanism in the link composed of the exosystem and the informed agent. Between the informed agent and the uninformed agent, the asynchronous edge-based mechanism is proposed to reduce communication in the MASs. The methods designed can effectively reduce the waste of system resources. Note that the triggering mechanisms and adaptive controllers are all not required global information of the networks.},

  abstract     = {Accessible chromatin is associated strongly with active gene regulatory regions. Enhancers and promoters commonly occur in accessible chromatin, and systematically discovering functional sites is indispensable at the whole genome level. However, biological experiments are expensive and time-consuming, and currently, computational methods could not completely learn the hidden key regulatory patterns of genomic contexts. Moreover, the feature encoding methods of genetic sequences often ignore position information among sequences, and accurately identifying accessibility regions greatly depends on capturing more informative sequence features. To address the issues, we first encode the DNA sequences by using position embeddings, which are produced by integrating position information of the original sequences into embedding vectors and then propose a novel deep learning framework, called attentive gated neural networks (AGNet), to automatically extract complex patterns for predicting chromatin accessibility from DNA sequences. Specifically, we combine gated neural networks (GNNs) with dual attention to extract multiple patterns and long-term associations merely from DNA sequences. Experimental results on five cell-type datasets show that AGNet obtains the best performance than the published methods for the accessibility prediction. Furthermore, the results not only reveal that AGNet can learn more regulatory patterns that underlie DNA sequences, but also validate the significance of position embeddings for the accessibility prediction.},

To improve the ability to distinguish different subtypes of gene expression data, we devise a hypervolume-based discrete evolutionary optimization algorithm (HYBDEOA) in this paper. Four objectives, namely the number of genes, the accuracy, the relevance, and the redundancy, are optimized simultaneously to guide the evolution. Firstly, binary encoding is used to choose some features, projecting data onto different subspaces. After that, a discrete neighborhood operation is conducted to generate a new binary-mapped population. Combining the new population with the current population, we employ the hypervolume-based mechanism to select the Pareto solutions. Finally, a discrete mutation method is proposed to find promising solutions in the binary search space. To demonstrate the performance of HYBDEOA, we apply HYBDEOA to 55 synthetic datasets and 35 cancer gene expression datasets. Extensive experiments are also conducted to reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of HYBDEOA. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is a parameter-less and robust algorithm, which can group gene expression data with a finer and more informative classification.},

Thus, a novel CNN model is proposed with the characteristics of multi-view feature preprocessing and swarm-based parameter optimization.

Unlike ordinary uniform sampling, the approach asymptotically preserves the performance of the original algorithm. In our experiments with a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, k-means-lite matches the performance of k-means when C is constructed using 30 samples of size 40 + 2k. Although the 30-sample choice proves to be a generally reliable rule, when the proposed approach is used to scale k-means++ (we call this scaled version k-means-lite++), k-means++’ performance is matched in several cases, using only five samples. These two new algorithms are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach, but the approach can be applied to create a constant-time version of any other k-means clustering algorithm, since it does not modify the internal workings of the base algorithm.},

The article is related to the revision of the ant colony optimization algorithm in the e-mail foldering problem and the proposition of a new solution adapted to the data stream. The goal of this work is to allow the classification of messages arriving at the system as data packages; however, due to the large number of decision classes (folders in the inbox), successive packages lead to a large concept drift. To assure the stability of the algorithm, an approach based on the memory being represented as a pheromone trail is introduced. This concept is known from the ant colony optimization methods. At the same time, multiple numbers of classifiers (similar to an ensemble method) are included. The proposed approach was tested on real-world data from the Enron e-mail dataset. An analysis of the two proposed methods related to the data stream was proposed. Both methods were compared with the methods used in the literature. The results achieved, in terms of the accuracy as well as the stability, confirm that (according to a statistical analysis) the proposed solutions are capable of better classifying e-mail messages derived from the system as data packages.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications introduce a set of stringent requirements (e.g., low latency, high bandwidth) to network and computing paradigm. 5G networks are faced with great challenges for supporting IoT services. The centralized cloud computing paradigm also becomes inefficient for those stringent requirements. Only extending spectrum resources cannot solve the problem effectively. Mobile edge computing offers an IT service environment at the Radio Access Network edge and presents great opportunities for the development of IoT applications. With the capability to reduce latency and offer an improved user experience, mobile edge computing becomes a key technology toward 5G. To achieve abundant sharing, complex IoT applications have been implemented as a set of lightweight micro-services that are distributed among containers over the mobile edge network. How to produce the optimal collocation of suitable micro-service for an application in mobile edge computing environment is an important issue that should be addressed. To address this issue, we propose a latency-aware micro-service mashup approach in this paper. Firstly, the problem is formulated into an integer nonlinear programming. Then, we prove the NP-hardness of the problem by reducing it into the delay constrained least cost problem. Finally, we propose an approximation latency-aware micro-service mashup approach to solve the problem. Experiment results show that the proposed approach achieves a substantial reduction in network resource consumption while still ensuring the latency constraint.},

  abstract     = {In existing overflow remote intelligent monitoring system, a huge amount of data uploading and multiple processing brings great challenges to the bandwidth load and real-time feedback of the server. Based on the Multiple Access Edge Computing Architecture (MEC), this paper proposes an Internet of Things overflow intelligent monitoring system based on multi-access edge computing. As the middle layer of the system, edge computing can provide real-time local services for field devices, and it can reduce the data uploading amount by preliminarily analyzing the computing tasks of the cloud computing platform. At the same time, for the current domestic and international artificial intelligence-based overflow warning model, it needs a large amount of prior knowledge or training data before use, and the accuracy, real time, and reliability of overflow monitoring are limited by prior knowledge and training data and other issues. In this paper, the information entropy theory has been adopted to improve fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm to overcome the disadvantage that the user gives the number of clustering actively in FCM clustering. Then, considering the correlation between the occurrence of overflow accident and the changing trend of standpipe pressure and casing pressure, an intelligent early warning model of drilling overflow accident is proposed by using the improved FCM clustering method based on information entropy. The early warning model uses the adaptive determination of the number of clusters for clustering, which not only ensures the quality of the cluster but also improves the accuracy and reliability of the overflow warning. The warning result of the overflow accident is output according to the clustering fitting result and the sensitivity of the overflow accident. Finally, the drilling data of YY oil well in XX oilfield considered as the research object.},

  abstract     = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) utilizes wireless access network to provide powerful computing resources for mobile users to improve the user experience, which mainly includes two aspects: time and energy consumption. Time refers to the latency consumed to process user tasks, while energy consumption refers to the total energy consumed in processing tasks. In this paper, the time and energy consumption in user experience are weighted as a mixed overhead and then optimized jointly. We formulate a mixed overhead of time and energy (MOTE) minimization problem, which is a nonlinear programming problem. In order to solve this problem, the block coordinate descent method to deal with each variable step by step is adopted. We further analyze the minimum value of delay parameters in the model, and examine two special cases: 1-offloading and 0-offloading. In 1-offloading, all the task data is offloaded to MEC server, and no data offloaded in 0-offloading. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of two special cases are also deduced. Besides, the multi-user situation is also discussed. In the performance evaluation, we compare MOTE with other offloading schemes, such as exhaustive strategy and Monte Carlo simulation method-based strategy to evaluate the optimality. The simulation results show that MOTE always achieves the minimal overhead compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Environmental mapping is the key step for mobile robots to perform tasks independently and perfectly. In recent years, visual SLAM, laser-based SLAM and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have aroused the interest of many people. Unfortunately, those technologies are not widely used, limited by the computational complexity, data processing and very low and predictable latency. This paper had mainly completed the following work and edge-enabled computing-based edge computing (Shi and Dustdar in Computer 49(5):78–81, 2016) is used as a solution to accelerate calculation. First of all, this research design works with inertial unit mobile robotic navigation systems, and all sensors are connected in edge layers in the framework of edge computing and explore the accelerometer, electronic compass, and gyroscope data. The accelerometer data are integrated using the Kalman filter data fusion algorithm to filter the random drift error caused by the gyroscope and the electronic compass. The state of the machine is determined by calculation of the corresponding attitude angle and position information. Second, a low-cost distance sensor is used to detect the depth and upload to the other fog node for computation. Next, the 3D point coordinate information is projected onto the two-dimensional coordinate extraction feature point to establish the feature map. Third, the extended Kalman filter SLAM is used to achieve simultaneous positioning and mapping. Finally, the method is validated in the experiment, proving that the method is feasible. The main improvement in this article is as follows: First, the multi-sensor data fusion algorithm is used to reduce the positioning error. Second, we use low-cost distance sensors to measure the depth of the model environment and reduce the cost. Third, we would take advantage of translating the three-dimensional depth information into a flat two-dimensional projection information to reduce the calculation of load and computing time. Fourth, our computation is distributed in different layers and focuses on edge-enabled platform to decrease the latency and redundancy.},

Thus, the main bodies of circulation at various levels need to decide whether adopt the Internet of Things or not according to the cost–benefit situation. The significant boundary value closely related to the revenue decision of cold-chain logistics of fresh agricultural product was figured out by particularly analyzing the impact of the adoption of the Internet of Things on upstream and downstream wholesale prices, retail price, and order quantity decision based on the costs and revenues of the upstream and downstream of the supply chain before and after the adoption of the Internet of Things, and it was found that the overall profit boundary values of wholesaler, retailer, and supply chain are the same; the increment of retail price and retailers’ revenues is larger than that of wholesalers’ revenues, and the ascensional range of retail price is larger than that of wholesale price; the cost boundary value of order quantity in supply chain has little to do with the quality of agricultural products, but is affected by the time of circulation, and transportation and warehouse cost; the lower the cost of the Internet of Things is, the larger the impact on order quantity is. The correctness of the research results was proved by means of illustrative example. This paper provides a scientific basis for investment in the Internet of Things by enterprises engaged in cold-chain operation of fresh agricultural products.},

In order to facilitate this process, rating values, which capture the overall satisfaction, and written reviews, which contain the sentiment of the experience with a product, are fused together. In this manner, each reviewer’s opinion is expressed as an interval rating by means of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. These new expressions of opinion are then aggregated and expressed in terms of a central opinion and degree of consensus representing the agreement among the sentiment of the reviewers for an individual product.

  abstract     = {An accurate diagnosis and prognosis for cancer are specific to patients with particular cancer types and molecular traits, which needs to address carefully. The discovery of important biomarkers is becoming an important step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in which genomics data and clinical outcomes need to be analyzed before making any clinical decision. Copy number variations (CNVs) are found to be associated with the risk of individual cancers and hence can be used to reveal genetic predispositions before cancer develops. In this paper, we collect the CNVs data about 8000 cancer patients covering 14 different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Then, two different sparse representations of CNVs based on 578 oncogenes and 20,308 protein-coding genes, including genomic deletions and duplication across the samples, are prepared. Then, we train Conv-LSTM and convolutional autoencoder (CAE) networks using both representations and create snapshot models. While the Conv-LSTM can capture locally and globally important features, CAE can utilize unsupervised pretraining to initialize the weights in the subsequent convolutional layers against the sparsity. Model averaging ensemble (MAE) is then applied to combine the snapshot models in order to make a single prediction. Finally, we identify most significant CNVs biomarkers using guided-gradient class activation map plus (GradCAM++) and rank top genes for different cancer types. Results covering several experiments show fairly high prediction accuracies for the majority of cancer types. In particular, using protein-coding genes, Conv-LSTM and CAE networks can predict cancer types correctly at least 72.96\% and 76.77\% of the cases, respectively. Contrarily, using oncogenes gives moderately higher accuracies of 74.25\% and 78.32\%, whereas the snapshot model based on MAE shows overall 2.5\% of accuracy improvement.},

  abstract     = {Device-free passive wireless indoor localization is attracting great interest in recent years due to the widespread deployment of Wi-Fi devices and the numerous location-based services requirements. In this paper, we propose DFPhaseFL, the first device-free fingerprinting indoor localization system that purely uses CSI phase information. It utilizes the CSI phase information extracted from simply a single link to estimate the location of the target, neither requiring the target to wear any electronic equipment nor deploying a large number of access points and monitor devices. In DFPhaseFL, the raw CSI phases are extracted from the CSI measurements through the three antennas of the Intel WiFi Link 5300 wireless Network Interface Card (IWL 5300 NIC) firstly. Then, linear transformation and noise filtering are applied to acquire the calibrated CSI phases. Through experimental observations, we find that the calibrated CSI phase owns an unpredictable characteristic over time. Thus, it cannot be directly applied as a fingerprint. To this end, a transfer deep supervised neural network method combining deep neural network and transfer learning is proposed to obtain feature representations with both transferability and discriminability as fingerprints. Then, the DFPhaseFL system uses the SVM algorithm to obtain the estimation of the target location online. Experiment results demonstrate that the DFPhaseFL owns a better estimation precision compared with the other state of art, and maintain a stable localization accuracy for a long time without reacquiring the fingerprint database.},

Despite the environmental danger of TPAH, its laboratory quantification is laborious, which consumes appreciable time and other valuable resources. This research work develops a computational intelligence-based model for the first time, which directly estimates and quantifies the level of TPAH of any environmental solid samples using total petroleum hydrocarbons descriptor that can be easily determined experimentally. The hyperparameters of the developed support vector regression (SVR)-based model are optimized using manual search (MS) approach and genetic algorithm (GA) search approach with Gaussian and polynomial kernel functions. Experimental validation of the developed model was carried out using samples obtained from the marine sediments of Arabian Gulf Sea. The future generalization and predictive strength of the developed models were assessed using correlation coefficient (CC), root-mean-square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD). GA-SVR-Gaussian performs better than MS-SVR and GA-SVR-poly with performance enhancement of 63.89\% and 536.32\%, respectively, on the basis of MAPD as a performance-measuring parameter, while MS-SVR model performs better than GA-SVR-poly with performance improvement of 288.25\% using MAPD to evaluate the model performance. The estimation accuracy and generalization strength of the developed models indicate the potential of the models in measuring the level of environmental pollution of oil-spilled area without experimental stress, while experimental precision is preserved.},

In addition, improved controlling of associative recall of information from the memory of recurrent neural networks is provided to improve the accuracy of forecasting.

Being able to predict attentional performance from a simple and noninvasive measure, such as respiration, could have obvious potential benefit for simplifying measurement and improving task performance in many settings, and could also be employed clinically with attentionally compromised populations for training and rehabilitation. It has been suggested that respiration and attention comprise a neuro-physiologically coupled system, and behavioral data has indicated that attentional performance, including reaction time and reaction time variability (RTV), covary with respiratory dynamics. In the present study, we tested several neural network configurations for the prediction of attentional control state (RTV) from respiratory parameters. We observed significant predictive power derived solely from respiratory input, and conclude that a robust and portable feedback device utilizing soft computation is feasible for this purpose. We suggest specific model and data source improvements to potentially further reduce errors in prediction.},

This is a particular disorder causing luminal narrowing and stricture formation in the inflamed bowel wall of a patient denoting, possibly, need for surgery. Thus, the development of treatments reducing fibrosis is an urgent issue to be addressed in IBD. In this context, we require the finding and development of biomarkers of intestinal fibrosis. Potential candidates such as microRNAs, gene variants or fibrocytes have shown controversial results on heterogeneous sets of IBD patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been already successfully proven in the recognition of fibrosis. Nevertheless, while there are no numerical models capable of systematically reproducing experiments, the usage of MRI could not be considered a standard in the inflammatory domain. Hence, there is an importance of deploying new sequence combinations in MRI methods that enable learning reproducible models. In this work, we provide reproducible deep learning models of intestinal fibrosis severity scores based on MRI novel radiation-induced rat model of colitis that incorporates some unexplored sequences such as the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery or diffusion imaging. The results obtained return an $$87.5\%$$ of success in the prediction of MRI scores with an associated mean-square error of 0.12. This approach offers practitioners a valuable tool to evaluate antifibrotic treatments under development and to extrapolate such noninvasive MRI scores model to patients with the aim of identifying early stages of fibrosis improving patients’ management.},

In this regard, model development to predict the hydrogen storage in metal–organic frameworks is of a vital importance for designing and developing of efficient processes based on these new synthetic material. The objective of the present study is to develop a new model to predict the hydrogen storage capacity in metal–organic frameworks. The group method of data handling-type polynomial neural networks is implemented as a soft computing approach for model building. As an advantage, only 40\% of data points are used for model development and the rest of data (60\%) are designated for testing of the model. The results show that the proposed model has reasonable accuracy in which the root mean square error for the proposed model is 0.28. The model can acceptably predict effects of surface area and pressure on hydrogen storage capacity of MOFs demonstrating good ability of the proposed model for tracing physically expected trend for hydrogen storage. Additionally, the leverage measure demonstrates that the proposed model is statistically acceptable and valid. It should be noted that an artificial neural network is also developed for comparison with GMDH-PNN model, in which the results confirm that both of the models have approximately same performance and accuracy. However, due to simple mathematical structure of GMDH-PNN, it is significantly more appropriate for engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel and comprehensive model development technique to predict the riverbank erosion rate for a natural channel using a Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs and QR factorization parameter estimation, known as the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model was developed based on a 12-month extensive field measurement at Sg. Bernam. This study established the governing factors and derived dependent and independent variables for riverbank erosion using dimensional analysis, based on the Buckingham PI theorem. Two functional relationships were derived from dimensional analysis incorporating the factors governing riverbank erosion. The functional relationships include parameters of hydraulic characteristics of the channel, riverbank geometry and soil characteristics. Parameter estimation was conducted using a linear least squares technique to quantify riverbank erosion rates. The significant independent variables and fourteen models with several numbers of hidden layers were set as the input parameters to the NARX-QR Factorization model. The model performance analysis shows that Models 1 and 9, developed based on the proposed NARX-QR Factorization model, have the highest R2 at 75\% and 91\%, respectively. Model 1 performed the best with accuracies for training and testing datasets of 75\% and 73\%, respectively. Additionally, the scatter plot of Model 1 is uniformly distributed along the line of perfect agreement. Therefore, it is concluded that the NARX-QR Factorization model developed in this study performed well in estimating the riverbank erosion rate, particularly for a natural river similar to Sg. Bernam.},

  abstract     = {With growing demand on resources situated at the cloud datacenters, the need for customers’ resource selection techniques becomes paramount in dealing with the concerns of resource inefficiency. Techniques such as metaheuristics are promising than the heuristics, most especially when handling large scheduling request. However, addressing certain limitations attributed to the metaheuristic such as slow convergence speed and imbalance between its local and global search could enable it become even more promising for customers service selection. In this work, we propose a cloud customers service selection scheme called Dynamic Multi-Objective Orthogonal Taguchi-Cat (DMOOTC). In the proposed scheme, avoidance of local entrapment is achieved by not only increasing its convergence speed, but balancing between its local and global search through the incorporation of Taguchi orthogonal approach. To enable the scheme to meet customers’ expectations, Pareto dominant strategy is incorporated providing better options for customers in selecting their service preferences. The implementation of our proposed scheme with that of the benchmarked schemes is carried out on CloudSim simulator tool. With two scheduling scenarios under consideration, simulation results show for the first scenario, our proposed DMOOTC scheme provides better service choices with minimum total execution time and cost (with up to 42.87\%, 35.47\%, 25.49\% and 38.62\%, 35.32\%, 25.56\% reduction) and achieves 21.64\%, 18.97\% and 13.19\% improvement for the second scenario in terms of execution time compared to that of the benchmarked schemes. Similarly, statistical results based on 95\% confidence interval for the whole scheduling scheme also show that our proposed scheme can be much more reliable than the benchmarked scheme. This is an indication that the proposed DMOOTC can meet customers’ expectations while providing guaranteed performance of the whole cloud computing environment.},

Experimental research showed that for software implementation blind breadth search strategy is in general faster than frequency-based breadth search strategy not only in finding all minimal reducts but also in finding one of them.

These types of attacks represent a serious threat to detection systems in environments having high noise rate or uncertainty, such as complex networks and Internet of Thing (IoT). Recent work in the literature has suggested using the K-nearest neighboring algorithm to defend against such attacks. However, such an approach can suffer from low to miss-classification rate accuracy. In this paper, we design an architecture to tackle the Android malware detection problem in IoT systems. We develop an attack mechanism based on silhouette clustering method, modified for mobile Android platforms. We proposed two convolutional neural network-type deep learning algorithms against this Silhouette Clustering-based Label Flipping Attack. We show the effectiveness of these two defense algorithms—label-based semi-supervised defense and clustering-based semi-supervised defense—in correcting labels being attacked. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by varying the various machine learning parameters on three Android datasets: Drebin, Contagio, and Genome and three types of features: API, intent, and permission. Our evaluation shows that using random forest feature selection and varying ratios of features can result in an improvement of up to 19\% accuracy when compared with the state-of-the-art method in the literature.},

  abstract     = {With the advances in computing powers and increasing volumes of data, deep learning’s emergence has helped revitalize artificial intelligence research. There is a growing trend of applying deep learning techniques to image processing, speech recognition, self-driving cars, and even health-care. Recently, several deep learning models have been employed to detect a cyber threat such as network attack, malware infiltration, or phishing website; nevertheless, they suffer from not being explainable to security experts. Security experts not only do need to detect the incoming threat but also need to know the incorporating features that cause that particular security incident. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a deep embedded neural network expert system (DeNNeS) that extracts refined rules from a trained deep neural network (DNN) architecture to substitute the knowledge base of an expert system. The knowledge base later is used to classify an unseen security incident and inform the final user of the corresponding rule that made that inference. We consider different rule extraction scenarios, and to prove the robustness of DeNNeS, we evaluate it on two cybersecurity datasets including UCI phishing websites dataset and Android malware dataset comprising more than 4000 Android APKs from several sources. The comparison results of DeNNeS with standalone DNN, JRip, and common machine learning algorithms show that DeNNeS with the retraining uncovered samples scenario outperforms other algorithms on both datasets. Furthermore, the extracted rules approximately reproduce the accuracy of the neural network from which they are derived. DeNNeS achieves an outstanding accuracy of $$97.5\%$$ and a negligible false positive rate of $$1.8\%$$ about $$2.4\%$$ higher and $$3.5\%$$ lower than the rule learner JRip on the phishing dataset. Moreover, DeNNeS outperforms random forest (RF), which produces the highest results among decision tree (DT), support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and Gaussian naive Bayes. Despite smaller training data in the malware dataset, DeNNeS achieves an accuracy of $$95.8\%$$ and $${F_{1}\,score}$$ of $$91.1\%$$ , much higher than JRip and RF.},

However, the sentiment polarity and intensity of the word may vary from one domain to another. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to build domain-dependent sentiment dictionary, SentiDomain. We propose a weak supervised neural model that aims at learning a set of sentiment clusters embedding from the sentence global representation of the target domain. The model is trained on unlabeled data with weak supervision by reconstructing the input sentence representation from the resulting representation. Furthermore, we also propose an attention-based LSTM model to address aspect-level sentiment analysis task based on the sentiment score retrieved from the proposed dictionary. The key idea is to weight-down the non-sentiment parts among aspect-related information in a given sentence. Our extensive experiments on both English and Chinese benchmark datasets have shown that compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives, our proposals can effectively improve polarity detection.},

  abstract     = {A recent metaheuristic algorithm, such as Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), was proposed. The idea of proposing this algorithm belongs to the hunting behavior of the humpback whale. However, WOA suffers from poor performance in the exploitation phase and stagnates in the local best solution. Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a very competitive algorithm comparing to other common metaheuristic algorithms as it has a super performance in the exploitation phase, while it is tested on unimodal benchmark functions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to hybridize GWO with WOA to overcome the problems. GWO can perform well in exploiting optimal solutions. In this paper, a hybridized WOA with GWO which is called WOAGWO is presented. The proposed hybridized model consists of two steps. Firstly, the hunting mechanism of GWO is embedded into the WOA exploitation phase with a new condition which is related to GWO. Secondly, a new technique is added to the exploration phase to improve the solution after each iteration. Experimentations are tested on three different standard test functions which are called benchmark functions: 23 common functions, 25 CEC2005 functions, and 10 CEC2019 functions. The proposed WOAGWO is also evaluated against original WOA, GWO, and three other commonly used algorithms. Results show that WOAGWO outperforms other algorithms depending on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, WOAGWO is likewise applied to solve an engineering problem such as pressure vessel design. Then the results prove that WOAGWO achieves optimum solution which is better than WOA and fitness-dependent optimizer (FDO).},

Ground vibration is a side effect of blasting and can result in damage to, or failure of, nearby structures. Therefore, it is imperative to predict ground vibration in the blasting sites. The primary objective of this paper is to propose a new model to predict ground vibration based on itemset mining (IM) and neural networks (NN), called IM–NN. It is worth mentioning that no research has tested the efficiency of IM–NN to predict ground vibration yet. IM–NN is composed of three steps; firstly, frequent and confident patterns (itemsets) were extracted by using IM. Secondly, for each test instance, the most appropriate instances were selected based on the extracted patterns. Thirdly, NN was only trained by the selected instances. To achieve the objective of this research, a dataset including 92 instances was collected from blasting events of two surface mines in Iran, Kerman province. To demonstrate the acceptability of IM–NN, the classical NN as well as several empirical equations were also developed in this study. The results indicated that IM–NN with the correlation squared (R2) of 0.944 has better performance than NN with R2 of 0.898 and may be a promising alternative to the NN for predicting ground vibration. Thus, the use of IM was a good idea to optimize and improve the NN performance.},

This approach aims to address the control problem of the Furuta pendulum in the steady state and also in the presence of external disturbances. The adaptive classical control laws such as e-modification present some limitations in particular when oscillations are presented in the input. To avoid this problem, two ANNs are implemented using filtered tracking error in the control loop. The first one is a single hidden layer network, used to approximate the equivalent control online, and the second is the feed-forward network, used to minimize the oscillations. The goal of the control is to bring the pendulum close to the upright position in the presence of the various uncertainties and being able to compensate oscillations and external disturbances. The main purpose of the second ANN is to minimize the chattering phenomenon and response time by finding the optimal control input signal, which also leads to the reduction of energy consumption. The learning algorithms of the two ANNs are obtained using the direct Lyapunov stability method. The simulation results are given to highlight the performances of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Simile, a special type of metaphor, can help people to express their ideas more clearly. Simile component extraction is to extract tenors and vehicles from sentences. This task has a realistic significance since it is useful for building cognitive knowledge base. With the development of deep neural networks, researchers begin to apply neural models to component extraction. Simile components should be in cross-domain. According to our observations, words in cross-domain always have different concepts. Thus, concept is important when identifying whether two words are simile components or not. However, existing models do not integrate concept into their models. It is difficult for these models to identify the concept of a word. What’s more, corpus about simile component extraction is limited. There are a number of rare words or unseen words, and the representations of these words are always not proper enough. Exiting models can hardly extract simile components accurately when there are low-frequency words in sentences. To solve these problems, we propose a hybrid representation-based component extraction (HRCE) model. Each word in HRCE is represented in three different levels: word level, concept level and character level. Concept representations (representations in concept level) can help HRCE to identify the words in cross-domain more accurately. Moreover, with the help of character representations (representations in character levels), HRCE can represent the meaning of a word more properly since words are consisted of characters and these characters can partly represent the meaning of words. We conduct experiments to compare the performance between HRCE and existing models. The experiment results show that HRCE significantly outperforms current models.},

However, few indexes can be applied to directly quantify the similarity of three or more ICNs for evaluating the retest reproducibility of ICNs. To solve this problem, a multivariable correlation coefficient based on zero-mean normalization and intraclass correlation coefficient (Z-ICC) is proposed. After demonstrating the calculation method and performance analysis on theory, Z-ICC is adopted to evaluate the similarity of three ICNs from three ICN sets, which are inferred from the open retest resting-state fMRI dataset NYU_TRT with dual temporal and spatial sparse representation (DTSSR). The reproducible ICNs and quantization index of retest reproducibility are obtained by the calculated Z-ICC values and the accepted evaluation criterion. The experimental results and visual inspection show that Z-ICC can effectively identify the reproducible ICNs and quantify the retest reproducibility of ICNs. Eighteen (Z-ICC &gt; 0.8) of the inferred twenty ICNs with DTSSR that are found to be reproducible are far more than the seven reproducible ICNs based on temporal concatenation group ICA (TC-GICA). Furthermore, the result of the one-tailed two-sample T test demonstrates that the Z-ICC values of the reproducible ICNs by DTSSR are significantly greater than those of TC-GICA, indicating that more reproducible group-level ICNs with higher retest reproducibility can be achieved with DTSSR.},

Currently, the most effective way to solve this problem is fine-grained classification methods, which utilize machine vision + scene to perform fine feature representations on a target local region, thereby achieving fine-grained classification. Fine-grained classification methods have been widely used for recognizing birds, cars, airplanes, and many others. However, the existing fine-grained classification methods still have some drawbacks. In this paper, we propose an improved fine-grained classification method based on self-attention destruction and construction learning (SADCL) for retail product recognition. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes a self-attention mechanism in the destruction and construction of image information in an end-to-end fashion so that to calculate a precise fine-grained classification prediction and large information areas in the reasoning process. We test the proposed method on the Retail Product Checkout (RPC) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved an accuracy above 80\% in retail commodity recognition reasoning, which is much higher than the results of other fine-grained classification methods.},

  abstract     = {A novel method called GAN-Poser has been explored to predict human motion in less time given an input 3D human skeleton sequence based on a generator–discriminator framework. Specifically, rather than using the conventional Euclidean loss, a frame-wise geodesic loss is used for geometrically meaningful and more precise distance measurement. In this paper, we have used a bidirectional GAN framework along with a recursive prediction strategy to avoid mode-collapse and to further regularize the training. To be able to generate multiple probable human-pose sequences conditioned on a given starting sequence, a random extrinsic factor $$\varTheta$$ has also been introduced. The discriminator is trained in order to regress the extrinsic factor $$\varTheta$$ , which is used alongside with the intrinsic factor (encoded starting pose sequence) to generate a particular pose sequence. In spite of being in a probabilistic framework, the modified discriminator architecture allows predictions of an intermediate part of pose sequence to be used as conditioning for prediction of the latter part of the sequence. This adversarial learning-based model takes into consideration of the stochasticity, and the bidirectional setup provides a new direction to evaluate the prediction quality against a given test sequence. Our resulting novel method, GAN-Poser, achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches when evaluated on the standard NTU-RGB-D and Human3.6 M dataset.},

  abstract     = {Reconstruction of super-resolution CT images using deep learning requires a large number of high-resolution images. However, high-resolution images are often limited to access due to CT performance and operation factors. In this paper, a new semi-supervised generative adversarial network is presented to accurately recover high-resolution CT images from low-resolution counterparts. We use a deep unsupervised network of 16 residual blocks to design the generator and build a discriminator based on a supervised network. We also apply a parallel 1 × 1 convolution operation to reduce the dimensionality of each hidden layer’s output. Four types of loss functions are presented to build a new one for enforcing the mappings between the generator and discriminator. The bulk specification layer in the commonly used residual network is removed to construct a new type of residual network. In terms of experiments, we conduct an objective and subjective comprehensive evaluation with several state-of-the-art methods. The comparison results show that our proposed network has better advantages in super-resolution image reconstruction.},

The proposed method comprehensively takes into account multiple strategies, such as attention mechanism, feature fusion, rotation region proposal as well as super-resolution pre-processing simultaneously to boost the performance in terms of localization and classification under the faster RCNN-like framework. Specifically, a channel attention network is integrated for selectively enhancing useful features and suppressing useless ones. Next, a dense feature fusion network is designed based on multi-scale detection framework, which fuses multiple layers of features to improve the sensitivity to small objects. In addition, considering the objects for detection are often densely arranged and appear in various orientations, we design a rotation anchor strategy to reduce the redundant detection regions. Extensive experiments on two remote sensing public datasets DOTA, NWPU VHR-10 and scene text dataset ICDAR2015 demonstrate that the proposed method can be competitive with or even superior to the state-of-the-art ones, like R2CNN and R2CNN++.},

  abstract     = {With the significant power of deep learning architectures, researchers have made much progress on super-resolution in the past few years. However, due to low representational ability of feature maps extracted from nature scene images, directly applying deep learning architectures for super-resolution could result in poor visual effects. Essentially, unique characteristics like low-frequency information should be emphasized for better shape reconstruction, other than treated equally across different patches and channels. To ease this problem, we propose a lightweight context-aware deep residual network named as CASR network, which appropriately encodes channel and spatial attention information to construct context-aware feature map for single-image super-resolution. We firstly design a task-specified inception block with a novel structure of astrous filters and specially chosen kernel size to extract multi-level information from low-resolution images. Then, a Dual-Attention ResNet module is applied to capture context information by dually connecting spatial and channel attention schemes. With high representational ability of context-aware feature map, CASR can accurately and efficiently generate high-resolution images. Experiments on several popular datasets show the proposed method has achieved better visual improvements and superior efficiencies than most of the existing studies.},

In particular, they are capable to generate realistic images from latent space with a simple and intuitive structure. The main focus of existing models has been improving the performance; however, there is a little attention to make a robust model. In this paper, we investigate solutions to the super-resolution problems—in particular perceptual quality—by proposing a robust GAN. The proposed model unlike the standard GAN employs two generators and two discriminators in which, a discriminator determines that the samples are from real data or generated one, while another discriminator acts as classifier to return the wrong samples to its corresponding generators. Generators learn a mixture of many distributions from prior to the complex distribution. This new methodology is trained with the feature matching loss and allows us to return the wrong samples to the corresponding generators, in order to regenerate the real-look samples. Experimental results in various datasets show the superiority of the proposed model compared to the state of the art methods.},

Although the ELM used in this paper has the same structure as the one in the conventional least-square-based ELM used for pattern classifications, i.e., the input weights are randomly chosen, the ELM adopted in the closed-loop control system is designed to achieve global control purpose. The output weights of the ELM will be adaptively adjusted in Lyapunov sense from the perspective of global stability of the closed-loop system, rather than local optimization in conventional ELM. The proposed control can thus not only realize the finite-time error convergence but also needs no prior knowledge of lumped uncertainty.

Instead of using the max pooling layer, the proposed multi-target corner pooling (MTCP) layer is used to generate the vehicles’ corners. And in order to complete the blocked corners that cannot be generated by MTCP, a novel matching corners method is adopted in the network. Therefore, the proposed network can detect blocked vehicles accurately.

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have been widely applied in real life, such as remote sensing, geological exploration, and so on. Many deep networks have been proposed to raise the resolution of HSIs for their better applications. But training their huge number of model parameters (weights and biases) needs more memory for storage and computation, which may bring some difficulties when they are applied in mobile terminal devices. In order to condense the deep networks and still keep the reconstruction effect, this paper proposes a compact deep network for HSI super-resolution (SR) by fusing the idea of recursion, dense connection, and spatial constraint (SCT) strategy. We name this method as recursive densely convolutional neural network with a spatial constraint strategy (SCT-RDCNN). The proposed method uses a novel designed recursive densely convolutional neural network (RDCNN) to learn the mapping relation between the low-resolution (LR) HSI and the high-resolution (HR) HSI and then adopts the SCT to improve the determined HR HSI. Compared with some existing deep-network-based HSI SR methods, the proposed method can use much less parameters (weight and bias) to attain or exceed the performance of methods with similar convolution layers because of the recursive structure and dense connection. It is significant and meaningful for the practical applications of the network in HSI SR due to the limitations of hardware devices. Some experiments on three HSI databases illustrate that our proposed SCT-RDCNN method outperforms several state-of-the-art HSI SR methods.},

To optimize this coordination, not only the current power demand but also the future one is needed for real-time distribution decision. This paper presents a prediction-based optimal energy management strategy. Extreme learning machine algorithm is exploited to provide the driver torque demand prediction for realizing the receding horizon optimization. With an industrial used traffic-in-the-loop powertrain simulation platform, an urban driving route scenario is built for the source data collection. Both of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead predictions are investigated. The prediction results show that for the three-step-ahead prediction, the 1st step can achieve unbiased estimation and the minimum root-mean-square error can achieve 100, 150 and 160 of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd steps, respectively. Furthermore, integrating with the learning-based prediction, a real-time energy management strategy is designed by solving the receding horizon optimization problem.

  abstract     = {The automotive engine idle speed control problem is a compromise among low engine speed for fuel saving, minimum emissions and disturbance rejection ability to prevent engine stall. However, idle speed regulation is very challenging due to the presence of high nonlinearity and aging-caused uncertainties in the engine dynamics. Therefore, the engine idle speed system is a typical uncertain nonlinear system. To address the problems of inherent nonlinearity and uncertainties in idle speed regulation, an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based adaptive neural control algorithm is proposed for tracking the target idle speed adaptively. The purpose of ELM is to rapidly deal with the uncertain nonlinear engine system. Since the original ELM is not designed for adaptive control, a new adaptation law is designed to update the weights of ELM in the sense of Lyapunov stability. Experiment is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed control method. Experimental result indicates that the ELM-based adaptive neural control outperforms the classical proportional–integral–derivative (PID), fuzzy-PID and back-propagation-neural-network-based controllers in terms of tracking performance under the variation of engine load.},

With the expansion of ELM’s applications in the field of classification and regression, the need for its real-time performance is increasing. Although the use of hardware acceleration is an obvious solution, how to select the appropriate acceleration hardware for ELM-based applications is a topic worthy of further discussion. For this purpose, we designed and evaluated the optimized ELM algorithms on three kinds of state-of-the-art acceleration hardware, i.e., multi-core CPU, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) which are all suitable for matrix multiplication optimization. The experimental results showed that the speedup ratio of these optimized algorithms on acceleration hardware achieved 10–800. Therefore, we suggest that (1) use GPU to accelerate ELM algorithms for large dataset, and (2) use FPGA for small dataset because of its lower power, especially for some embedded applications.

In EBSNs, event recommendation is a typical problem which recommends interested events to users. Different from traditional social networks, both online and off-line factors play an important role in EBSNs. However, the existing methods do not make full use of the online and off-line information, which may lead to a low accuracy, and they are also not efficient enough. In this paper, we propose a novel event recommendation model to solve the above shortcomings. At first, a feature extraction phase is constructed to make full use of the EBSN information, including spatial feature, temporal feature, semantic feature, social feature and historical feature. And then, we transform the recommendation problem to a classification problem and ELM is extended as the classifier in the model. Extensive experiments are conducted on real EBSN datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is efficient and has a better performance than the existing methods.},

The dataset is then used to train a material failure/defect classification model and stress regression models. Finally, the well-trained models are implemented in the continuum model to study the mechanical behaviors of materials at the macroscale.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to improve data-driven prognostics by presenting a novel approach of directly estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of aero-engines without requiring setting any failure threshold information or estimating degradation states. Specifically, based on the sensory data, RUL estimations are directly obtained through the universal function approximation capability of the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. To achieve this, the features related with the RUL are first extracted from the sensory data as the inputs of the ELM model. Besides, to optimize the number of observed sensors, three evaluation metrics of correlation, monotonicity and robustness are defined and combined to automatically select the most relevant sensor values for more effective and efficient remaining useful life predictions. The validity and superiority of the proposed approach is evaluated by the widely used turbofan engine datasets from NASA Ames prognostics data repository. The proposed approach shows improved RUL estimation applicability at any time instant of the degradation process without determining the failure thresholds. This also simplifies the RUL estimation procedure. Moreover, the random properties of hidden nodes in the ELM learning mechanisms ensures the simplification and efficiency for real-time implementation. Therefore, the proposed approach suits to real-world applications in which prognostics estimations are required to be fast.},

  abstract     = {Visual tracking is a fundamental and highly useful component in various tasks of computer vision. Recently, end-to-end off-line training Siamese networks have demonstrated great success in visual tracking with high performance in terms of speed and accuracy. However, Siamese trackers usually employ visual features from the last simple convolutional layers to represent the targets while ignoring the fact that features from different layers characterize different representation capabilities of the targets, and hence this may degrade tracking performance in the presence of severe deformation and occlusion. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical attentive Siamese (HASiam) network for high-performance visual tracking, which exploits different kinds of attention mechanisms to effectively fuse a series of attentional features from different layers. More specifically, we combine a deeper network with a shallow one to take full advantage of the features from different layers and apply spatial and channel-wise attentions on different layers to better capture visual attentions on multi-level semantic abstractions, which is helpful to enhance the discriminative capacity of the model. Furthermore, the top-layer feature maps have low resolution that may affect localization accuracy if each feature is treated independently. To address this issue, a non-local attention module is also adopted on the top layer to force the network to pay more attention to the structural dependency of features at all locations during off-line training. The proposed HASiam is trained off-line in an end-to-end manner and needs no online updating the network parameters during tracking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our HASiam has achieved favorable results with AUC scores of $$64.6\%$$ , $$62.8\%$$ and EAO scores of 0.227 while having a speed of 60 fps on the OTB2013, OTB100 and VOT2017 real-time experiments, respectively. Our tracker with high accuracy and real-time speed can be applied to numerous vision applications like visual surveillance systems, robotics and augmented reality.},

  abstract     = {In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, a big challenge is the limited sample size with a relatively high feature dimension. Therefore, effective feature extraction of data is essential, which is desired to remove the redundancy as well as improve the discrimination. A huge number of methods have been proposed for HSI feature extraction. In recent years, deep learning-based feature extraction algorithms have shown their superiorities in various classification problems. Within them, deep PCA (DPCA) is a simple but efficient algorithm, which runs fast due to the absence of back-propagation. However, DPCA fails to provide satisfactory classification accuracies on HSI datasets. In this paper, we try to combine DPCA with residual-based multi-scale feature extraction and propose a residual deep PCA (RDPCA) feature extraction algorithm for HSI classification. It is a hierarchical approach consisting of multiple layers. Within each layer, PCA is utilized for layer-wise feature extraction, and the reconstruction residual is fed into the next layer. When the feature is passed deeper into the RDPCA network, finer details are mined. The layer-wise features are concatenated to form the final output feature. Furthermore, to enhance the ability of nonlinear feature extraction, we add activation functions between adjacent layers. Experimental results on real-world HSI datasets have shown the superiority of the proposed RDPCA over DPCA and PCA.},

To settle these issues, this paper proposes a simple and efficient algorithm in which the parameters of even hidden nodes are calculated by fitting the residual error vector in the previous phase, and then, all existing output weights are recursively updated based on inverse partitioned matrix. The algorithm can reduce the inefficient hidden nodes and obtain a preferable output weight vector which is always the minimum norm least-squares solution.

The middle-level feature vectors can then be extracted from the statistical information of the correlations between the input data and the ones in each pattern cluster. For accurate classification purpose, the advanced feature vectors are generated with the moments’ information of the middle-level feature vectors. After that, Bayesian inference is implemented to make decisions from the weighted sum of the advanced feature components. In addition, a real-time fine-tuning loop (layer) is designed to adaptively “widen” the border of each pattern clustering region such that the input data can be directly classified once they are located in one of the clustering regions.

  abstract     = {Feature selection and construction are important preprocessing techniques in data mining. They allow not only dimensionality reduction but also classification accuracy and efficiency improvement. While feature selection consists in selecting a subset of relevant feature from the original feature set, feature construction corresponds to the generation of new high-level features, called constructed features, where each one of them is a combination of a subset of original features. Based on these definitions, feature construction could be seen as a bi-level optimization problem where the feature subset should be defined first and then the corresponding (near) optimal combination of the selected features should be found. Motivated by this observation, we propose, in this paper, a bi-level evolutionary approach for feature construction. The basic idea of our algorithm, named bi-level feature construction genetic algorithm (BFC-GA), is to evolve an upper-level population for the task of feature selection, while optimizing the feature combinations at the lower level by evolving a follower population. It is worth noting that for each upper-level individual (feature subset), a whole lower-level population is optimized to find the corresponding (near) optimal feature combination (constructed feature). In this way, BFC-GA would be able to output a set of optimized constructed features that could be very informative to the considered classifier. A detailed experimental study has been conducted on a set of commonly used datasets with varying dimensions. The statistical analysis of the obtained results shows the competitiveness and the outperformance of our bi-level feature construction approach with respect to many state-of-the-art algorithms.},

For improving its performance, a local-weighted nonnegative matrix factorization with rank regularization constraint (LWNMF_RC) is firstly presented, which removes complex background and then obtains motion salient regions. Secondly, a dual-manifold regularized nonnegative matrix factorization with sparsity constraint (DMNMF_SC) is proposed, which not only considers the short-term and middle-term temporal dependencies implied in data manifold, but also mines the geometric structure hidden in feature manifold. In addition, the introduction of sparsity constraint makes features possess better discriminativeness. Thirdly, a deep DMNMF_SC method is constructed, which acquires more hierarchical and discriminative features. Finally, a long-term temporal memory model with probability transfer learning (PTL-LTM) is proposed, which accurately memorizes the long-term temporal dependency among multiple simple action segments and, meanwhile, makes full use of the probability features of rich labeled simple actions and then applies the knowledge learned from simple actions for complex action recognition. Consequently, the performance is effectively improved.},

  abstract     = {Many engineering optimization problems are typically multi-objective in their natures and multidisciplinary with a large number of decision variables. Furthermore, Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness in such situations. Thus, developing a robust optimization algorithm undoubtedly becomes a true challenge. This paper proposes a multi-objective orthogonal opposition-based crow search algorithm (M2O-CSA) for solving large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs). In the M2O-CSA, a multi-orthogonal opposition strategy is employed to mitigate the conflicts among the convergence and distribution of solutions. First, two individuals are randomly chosen to undergo the crossover stage and then orthogonal array is presented to obtain nine individuals. Then individuals are used in the opposition stage to improve the diversity of solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed M2O-CSA is investigated by implementing it on different dimensions of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The Pareto front solutions of these MOPs have various characteristics such as convex, non-convex and discrete. It is also applied to solve multi-objective design applications with distinctive features such as four bar truss (FBT) design, welded beam (WB) deign, disk brake (DB) design, and speed reduced (SR) design, where they involve different characteristics. In this context, a new decision making tool based on multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) technique is employed to help the designer for extracting the operating point as the best compromise or satisfactory solution to execute the candidate engineering design. Simulation results affirm that the proposed M2O-CSA works efficiently and effectively.},

  abstract     = {Distance estimation between sensor nodes is crucial to localization and object tracking in a wireless sensor network. The received signal strength indicator is widely used for wireless distance estimation, because of its advantages, including availability, low cost, flexibility, and so on. As is well known, RSSI measurement values are extremely susceptible to the surroundings, resulting in uncertain distance estimations. Without confidential information, the distance estimation results could not provide valuable priori information for follow-up processing methods and applications, such as localization, navigation, and guidance. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty analysis method for RSSI-based distance estimation (UAM-RDE) to study the uncertainty propagation in RSSI-based distance estimations. In UAM-RDE, we explore the uncertainty propagation mechanism from the input to the output of the RSSI-based distance estimation, including uncertainty factor analysis, sensitivity analysis, propagation, and synthesis of uncertainty. The simulations and experimental results validate and demonstrate the feasibility of UAM-RDE.},

Alumina nanoparticles are included in the water to enhance the heat exchange process. The incidental entropy generation is also studied to evaluate the thermodynamic irreversibility. The nanofluid flow is taken as laminar and incompressible while the advection inertia effect in the porous layer is taken into account by adopting the Darcy–Forchheimer model. The problem is explained in the dimensionless form of the governing equations and solved by the finite element method. The Darcy number (Da), porosity of the porous layer ( $$\varepsilon$$ ), number of undulations (N), and the nanoparticles volume fraction ( $$\phi$$ ) are varied to assess the heat transfer and the incidental entropy generation. It is found that the waviness of the solid wall augments the average Nusselt number and minimizes the generation of entropy. The results show for some circumstances that the Nusselt number is augmented by 43.8\% when N is raised from 0 (flat solid wall) to 4. It is also found that the porosity of the porous layer is a more crucial parameter than its permeability, where a 37.4\% enhancement in the Nusselt number is achieved when the porosity is raised from 0.2 to 0.8.},

Considering the size and temporality of engineering data, we adopted a long short-term memory to form the core part of the deep learning model. To perform this process, 23 variables reflecting a flotation plant were monitored and collected hourly over a half year time span, then wrangled, split, and restructured for deep learning model use. A deep learning model encompassing a stacked long short-term memory architecture was designed, trained, and tested with prepared data. The model’s performance on test data demonstrates the capability of our proposed model to predict real-time concentrate purities for iron and silica. Compared with a traditional machine model typified by a random forest model in this study, the proposed deep learning model is significantly more competent to model a manufacturing froth flotation process.

Some integration problems arise with this structure including production, inventory, location, routing, distribution, collection, recycling, and routing. The integration problems that are facing scientific researchers include inventory routing, location routing, and location inventory. This study considers the integration problem of a closed-loop supply chain for the production, distribution, collection, and recycling quantities, along with the distribution and collection routes for each time period of a finite planning horizon. We refer to this problem as the “Closed-Loop Supply Chain Integrated Production-Inventory-Distribution-Routing Problem” (CLSC-PRP). A mathematical model is proposed that is the first to determine both quantities and routes for the CLSC-PRP simultaneously. As the problem is known to be NP-hard in terms of computational complexity, a simulated annealing-based decomposition heuristic is developed for solving large-scale CLSC-PRP instances. The results of the proposed mathematical model for the CLSC-PRP are compared with the results of the developed heuristic and two separate models that manage forward and backward production routing problems. An extensive comparative study indicated the following: (i) the proposed model was able to reduce the cost required for operating the total supply chain by an average of 12\%, along with providing a positive impact on the environment and (ii) the proposed heuristic is able to generate solutions that are close to optimal in most cases.},

Initially, the tutoring system reactions bases its behavior on rules defined by an expert teacher; after this, a neural network that learns from the student’s behavior when they are studying adjusts these rules. This way, the neural network improves the teacher’s rules and, consequently, defines a learning strategy that is more adaptive and reactive to the student’s profile. Thus, it is possible to offer the student a personalized and individualized education form. The model is able to guide the student throughout the didactic transposition of contents, aiding the consolidation of desired competencies established on educational propositions. This work shows the development process of the ITS, including the expert guidance system and the hybrid system, which improves the expert rules from SOM neural network use. The obtained results indicate that the application of hybrid technology in ITSs is feasible because, for defining the teaching strategies, it incorporates the teacher’s knowledge and by neural network use, it assimilates the students’ learning process behavior. The results show that proposed model has great agreement between the actions of the “ITS” and the students’ actions. The model showed satisfactory performance when compared to other systems proposed in the literature that use connectionist approach in its conception.},

  abstract     = {Here, we communicate the peristalsis of single- and multi-walled CNTs through nonlinear porous, non-uniform propagating channel boundaries. Non-uniform channel boundaries are of asymmetric characteristics. Flow equations are modeled by taking variable viscosity, linear and nonlinear porous medium (i.e., Darcy and Darcy–Forchheimer), nonlinear thermal radiation, mixed convection, heat generation and absorption aspects. Convective heat transfer aspects are at the convectively heated surface. The entropy generation rate is modeled via the second law of thermodynamics. Modeled equations are simplified with the help of long wavelength assumption. Dimensionless system of equations with respective boundary conditions is solved numerically via built-in shooting algorithm in Mathematica 8 software. Further, these numerical results are directly received in the form of curves. Such curves are made for velocity, temperature, pressure gradient, trapping, entropy rate and Bejan number. Heat transfer rate at lower and upper walls is achieved through bar charts.},

  abstract     = {In group decision making, each expert’s background and the level of knowledge and ability differ, which makes the expert’s information inputs to the decision-making process heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity in the information can affect the outcome of the selection of the decision alternatives. This paper therefore attempts to partition the heterogeneous information into homogeneous groups to elicit similar (related) and dissimilar (unrelated) data using a clustering algorithm. We then develop an aggregation approach to gather the collective opinions from the homogeneous clusters to accurately model the decision problem in a group setting. The proposed aggregation approach, labeled as the generalized partitioned Bonferroni mean (GPBM), is studied to investigate the characteristics of the aggregation operator. Further, we extend the GPBM concept to an interval-valued fuzzy set context using the additive generators of the strict t-conorms and we develop two other new aggregation operators: the interval-valued GPBM (IVGPBM) and the weighted IVGPBM (WIVGPBM). We analyze the aggregation of fuzzy numbers by the IVGPBM operator using interval arithmetic involving $$\alpha$$ -cuts and the $$\alpha$$ -cut-based decomposition principle of fuzzy numbers. Two practical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of these operators, and a comparison is conducted to highlight the effects of the confidence level and the sensitivity of the parameters chosen, analyzing the results with the parameterized strict t-conorm. Finally, we compare the experimental results of the proposed method with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) act as a building block of Internet of Things and have been used in various applications to sense environment and transmit data to the Internet. However, WSNs are very vulnerable to congestion problem, resulting in higher packet loss ratio, longer delay and lower throughput. To address this issue, this paper presents a fuzzy sliding mode congestion control algorithm (FSMC) for WSNs. Firstly, by applying the signal-to-noise ratio of wireless channel to TCP model, a new cross-layer congestion control model between transmission layer and MAC layer is proposed. Then, by combining fuzzy control with sliding mode control (SMC), a fuzzy sliding mode controller (FSMC) is designed, which adaptively regulates the queue length of buffer in congested nodes and significantly reduces the impact of external uncertain disturbance. Finally, numerous simulations are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and NS-2.35 by comparing with traditional control strategies such as fuzzy, PID and SMC, which show that the proposed FSMC effectively adapts to the change of queue length and has good performance, such as rapid convergence, lower average delay, less packet loss ratio and higher throughput.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural network (SNN) trained by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a promising computing paradigm for energy-efficient artificial intelligence systems. During the learning procedure of SNN trained by STDP, another two bio-inspired mechanisms of lateral inhibition and homeostasis are usually implemented to achieve competitive learning. However, the previous methods to implement lateral inhibition and homeostasis are not designed with hardware in mind, resulting in solutions that are not efficient for deployment on neuromorphic hardware. For example, the existing lateral inhibition methods induce a great number of connections that are proportional to the square of the number of learning neurons. The classical homeostasis methods depend on the fine-tuned membrane threshold with no hardware solution provided. In this paper, we propose two hardware-friendly and scalable methods to achieve lateral inhibition and homeostasis. Using only one inhibitory neuron for one learning layer, our proposed lateral inhibition method can reduce inhibitory connection number from $$N^2$$ to 2N and hardware overhead by sharing refractory control circuits. Utilizing the adaptive resistance of memristor, we propose a novel homeostasis method through adapting the leaky current of spiking neurons. In addition, the learning efficiency of different homeostasis methods are studied for the first time by simulating on the cognitive task of digital recognition of MNIST dataset. Simulation results show that our proposed homeostasis method can improve the learning efficiency by 30–50\% while maintaining the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Density peak clustering (DPC) is a recently developed density-based clustering algorithm that achieves competitive performance in a non-iterative manner. DPC is capable of effectively handling clusters with single density peak (single center), i.e., based on DPC’s hypothesis, one and only one data point is chosen as the center of any cluster. However, DPC may fail to identify clusters with multiple density peaks (multi-centers) and may not be able to identify natural clusters whose centers have relatively lower local density. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clustering algorithm based on a hierarchical approach, named multi-center density peak clustering (McDPC). Firstly, based on a widely adopted hypothesis that the potential cluster centers are relatively far away from each other. McDPC obtains centers of the initial micro-clusters (named representative data points) whose minimum distance to the other higher-density data points are relatively larger. Secondly, the representative data points are autonomously categorized into different density levels. Finally, McDPC deals with micro-clusters at each level and if necessary, merges the micro-clusters at a specific level into one cluster to identify multi-center clusters. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed McDPC algorithm, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and benchmark the performance of McDPC against other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. We also apply McDPC to perform image segmentation and facial recognition to further demonstrate its capability in dealing with real-world applications. The experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance.},

A soft-computing model can accurately learn the complex interactions between process parameters to provide great insights in the development of this composite. This paper demonstrates and analyses the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and Sugeno-type fuzzy inference systems (FIS) for wear behaviour prediction of calcium carbonate-reinforced aluminium composites. The models were trained with data collected from the experiment. The data consist of filler particle size of 150 μm with weights fractions varied from 0 to 25 wt\%, in step of 5. Wear test data at different time of contacts (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 s) and variable loads of 2.27 N, 4.54 N and 6.80 N were collected, resulting to 120 length vectors. Comparing the experimental results of wear test with those predicted using the ANN and Sugeno-type FIS, the integration of calcium carbonate particulate enhanced the wear characteristics of Al matrix up to 200\%. On the use of back-propagation neural network with 4–3–1 architecture for wear prediction, the Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm performs better. For Sugeno-type FIS, the Gaussian membership function resulted to the best prediction of wear rate. When ANN and Sugeno-type FIS performance on the test set were analysed based on some statistical parameters, the later returned an R2 value of 0.9775 as against ANN’s value of 0.3684. The predicted wear rate using ANFIS with Gaussian membership functions was in good agreement with the experimental values.},

  abstract     = {Solving partial differential equations using neural networks is mostly a proof of concept approach. In the case of direct function approximation, a single neural network is constructed to be the solution of a particular boundary value problem. Independent variables are fed into the input layer, and a single output is considered as the solution’s value. The network is substituted into the equation, and the residual is then minimized with respect to the weights of the network using a gradient-based method. Our previous work showed that by minimizing all derivatives of the residual up to the third order one can obtain a machine precise solution for 2D boundary value problem using very sparse grids. The goal of this paper is to use this grid complexity advantage in order to obtain a solution faster than finite differences. However, the number of all possible high-order derivatives (and therefore the training time) increases with the number of dimensions and it was unclear whether this goal can be achieved. Here, we demonstrate that this increase can be compensated by using random directional derivatives instead. In 2D case neural networks are slower than finite differences, but for each additional dimension the complexity increases approximately 4 times for neural networks and 125 times for finite differences. This allows neural networks to catch up in 3D case for memory complexity and in 5D case for time complexity. For the first time a machine precise solution was obtained with neural network faster than with finite differences method.},

An automatic fault mode detection is presented based on a SOM network and the kernel density estimation with as less as possible prior knowledge. The different SOM development steps are presented and the suitable solutions proposed to structure the approach are accompanied by mathematical methods. The generated maps are then used with kernel density analysis to isolate fault modes on them. Finally, a methodology is presented to identify the different fault modes.

This tradeoff is formalized by Fitts’ law, which states a linear relationship between the duration and the difficulty of the movement. The bigger is the required accuracy in reaching a target or farther is the target, the slower has to be the movement. A variety of computational models of neuromusculoskeletal systems have been proposed to pinpoint the neurobiological mechanisms that are involved in human movement. We introduce a neurocomputational model of spinal cord to unveil how the tradeoff between speed and accuracy elicits from the interaction between neural and musculoskeletal systems. Model simulations showed that the speed–accuracy tradeoff is not an intrinsic property of the neuromuscular system, but it is a behavioral trait that emerges from the strategy adopted by the central nervous system for executing faster movements. In particular, results suggest that the velocity of a previous learned movement is regulated by the monosynaptic connection between cortical cells and alpha motoneurons.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective low-rank representation (LRR) and subspace recovery model called mutual-manifold regularized robust fast latent LRR. Our model improves the representation ability and robustness from twofold. Specifically, our model is built on the Frobenius norm-based fast latent LRR decomposing given data into a principal feature part, a salient feature part and a sparse error, but improves it clearly by designing mutual-manifold regularization to encode, preserve and propagate local information between coefficients and salient features. The mutual-manifold regularization is defined by using the coefficients as the adaptive reconstruction weights for salient features and constructing a Laplacian matrix over salient features for the coefficients. Thus, some important local topology structure information can be propagated between them, which can make the discovered subspace structures and features potentially more accurate for the data representations. Besides, our approach also considers to improve the robust properties of subspace recovery against noise and sparse errors in coefficients, which is realized by decomposing original coefficients matrix into an error-corrected part and a sparse error part fitting noise in coefficients, and the recovered coefficients are then used for robust subspace recovery. Experimental results on several public databases demonstrate that our method can outperform other related algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Dual supervision for text classification and information retrieval, which involves training the machine with class labels augmented with text annotations that are indicative of the class, has been shown to provide significant improvements, both in and beyond active learning (AL) settings. Annotations in the simplest form are highlighted portions of the text that are indicative of the class. In this work, we aim to identify and realize the full potential of unsupervised pretrained word embeddings for text-related tasks in AL settings by training neural nets—specifically, convolutional and recurrent neural nets—through dual supervision. We propose an architecture-independent algorithm for training neural networks with human rationales for class assignments and show how unsupervised embeddings can be better leveraged in active learning settings using the said algorithm. The proposed solution involves the use of gradient-based feature attributions for constraining the machine to follow the user annotations; further, we discuss methods for overcoming the architecture-specific challenges in the optimization. Our results on the sentiment classification task show that one annotated and labeled document can be worth up to seven labeled documents, giving accuracies of up to 70\% for as few as ten labeled and annotated documents, and shows promise in significantly reducing user effort for total-recall information retrieval task in systematic literature reviews.},

  abstract     = {Effective filter design plays an important role in signal processing applications. Multiple parameters must be considered to control the over-frequency response of the designed filter. In this study, a novel multi-objective approach is proposed for windowing finite impulse response (FIR) filter design. The windowing FIR filters are commonly used due to its linear phase property, frequency stability and easier implementation. However, windowing method can only control the cutting frequency of filter, and it suffers from the problem of insufficient control of the transition bandwidth, pass and stop band cutoff frequencies. Therefore, the window function was optimized using a novel multi-objective artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to eliminate these disadvantages of the windowing method. The proposed method was compared to three other multi-objective ABC variants. Novel SSA-based multi-objective approach yielded the best performance among four approaches. The proposed multi-objective approach that uses the SSA method has a significant advantage since it does not require user experience, it is not dependent on parameters, and there is no weight determination problem. Also, it does not have sorting and pooling stages that increase the cost of calculation. The obtained results were compared with the published literature studies. The SSA-based multi-objective approach offered better alternative to other literature techniques in terms of calculating the fitness function that deals with finding the most reasonable solution considering all error terms. Finally, the performance of the designed filter was tested on electroencephalography (EEG) signal. The EEG signal was decomposed successfully into subbands using proposed filter design approach. Based on numerical results of this study, the proposed filter provided the low-pass band and stop band ripple, and high stop band attenuation value of all, while having well enough performance.},

  abstract     = {Prediction of fluid pattern inside chemical mixing tanks and reactors is very challenging, mainly when scale-up and optimization of devices are essential due to enormous computational time and experimental efforts. This work recommends a new prediction tool to understand fluid behavior on the smart neural nodes. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to learn the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) data and predict fluid patterns based on its understanding. The anticipated results with the integration of LBM and ANFIS method indicated a good agreement with existing computational fluid dynamics results. The results show that almost similar fluid pattern occurs on neural nodes in the ANFIS method compared by LBM on lattice unit when shear flow applies on the top and bottom of fluid structure. This finding is very promising to avoid substantial computational time or experimental efforts in the optimization of different chemical devices. Prediction of the shear flow and optimization of boundary conditions to get proper droplet size distribution or bubble size distribution requires heavy computational time. Therefore in this work, ANFIS approach besides the LB method was used to replicate the flow between two parallel plates (vortex structure) in a short computational time. The current overview also shows the ability of the ANFIS method as a machine learning tool to learn how the fluid is disturbed by shear flow. The input data are used as big data during the learning process, and the intelligence of the algorithm is examined based on the total percentage of training data.},

The proposed network imbibes biological similarities with respect to connectivity, weight updation, and activation function. Dentate Gyrus uses pre-integration lateral inhibition form of learning, and the autoassociative network is implemented using Hopfield network. The performance of the autoassociative network in the presence and absence of Dentate Gyrus is observed across multiple parameters.

To find practical solutions, the hubs and transportation fleet have constrained capacity, in which every node can be serviced by multiple allocations with the hard time window and limited tour length. First, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed to balance travel costs among different routes and to minimize the total sum of fixed costs of locating hubs, the costs of handling, traveling, assigning, and transportation costs. The problem is then solved using an augmented ε-constraint technique for small to medium size instances of the problem. Due to the NP-hardness nature of the problem, the proposed multi-objective optimization model is solved by a multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA). To show the superior performance of the MOICA, the solutions are compared with those obtained by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). For the large-scale problem instances, the comparative results indicate that the MOICA can indeed provide better Pareto optimal solutions compared to NSGA-II for the large-scale problem instances.},

  abstract     = {Obtaining anhydrous ethanol by extractive distillation has already been the object of several studies in the control literature. However, despite the presence of varying degrees of purity of anhydrous ethanol owing to its applications in industrial and commercial sectors, little attention has been given to dynamic and control for changing the operating conditions to provide anhydrous ethanol with different specifications. Using a soft sensor based on artificial neural network, this work aimed to develop an intelligent control system to contemplate the changes in the specification of anhydrous ethanol, considering the whole process (extractive and recovery columns), and keeping the process operating at an optimal point. Using the developed intelligent control system, the only necessary modification is the new specification and all new set-points values for controllers (temperature and solvent to azeotropic feed ratio) are updated automatically, without human interference, while with a conventional control system, all the new set-points values must be modified manually. The results showed that for the studied anhydrous ethanol specification range (99.1–99.9\% mole), the new optimum operating conditions (new steady-state) were reached in a short time (between 1 and 2 h), with no evidence of overflow or emptying of sumps and reflux vessels of the columns. In addition to the easy implementation of the intelligent control system, the existing control structure remains unchanged, not requiring the investment for new instrumentation.},

This method improves imputation performance by artificially deleting values in the input features and using them as targets in the training process. Nevertheless, although the deletion of samples is demonstrated to be really efficient, it may cause an imbalance between the distributions of the training and the test sets. In order to solve this issue, a compensation mechanism is proposed based on a slight modification of the error function to be optimized. Experiments over several datasets show that the deletion and compensation not only involve improvements in imputation but also in classification in comparison with other classical techniques.},

  abstract     = {Negative stress, also named distress, is nowadays one of the most studied emotional states due to its high impact on advanced societies. Its automatic identification from physiological recordings can be extremely useful to prevent concomitant physical health problems as well as other mental disorders. However, this task is still an unresolved challenge. Recently, quadratic sample entropy (QSE) applied to the electroencephalogram signal has proven to be the most promising single metric to discern between emotional states of calm and negative stress. This index estimates repetitive patterns in a time series without considering time data order within each one, thus ignoring some relevant dynamics. Hence, in this work conditional entropy (CEn) and its correction (CCEn) are studied to complement and improve QSE ability in detection of distress. Both CEn and CCEn symbolize original time series to consider ordinal patterns and, thus, quantify accurately data predictability. Results obtained from 279 samples (146 associated with calm and 133 to distress) provide a similar discriminant power, about 65\%, both for conditional entropies and QSE. More interestingly, these metrics also reveal the presence of complementary brain dynamics under a emotional state of distress. Thus, CCEn and QSE suggest a synchronization between opposite frontal and parietal brain regions from both hemispheres, such that when the level of negative stress increases, a more irregular activity is found in left frontal and right parietal areas. Simultaneously, more predictable activity is noticed in right frontal and left parietal regions. These findings agree with previous neurophysiological studies and allow to improve the identification of distress. Precisely, a very simple discriminant model based on CCEn and QSE is able to discern more than 80\% of samples, thus overcoming slightly the results reported by previous works, where dozens or hundreds of variables have to be combined with advanced classifiers.},

This first classifier is then improved with a semi-supervised learning based on retraining for two more rounds, each one increasing the number of labeled images but without human supervision. We compare our approach against both to a baseline case, with no incremental retraining, and the best case, assuming we had a fully labeled data set. We use a data set of 27,624 labeled images of dumpsters provided by Ecoembes, a Spanish nonprofit organization that cares for the environment through recycling and the eco-design of packaging in Spain. Such a data set presents a number of challenges. As in other outdoor visual tasks, there are occluding objects such as vehicles, pedestrians and street furniture, as well as other dumpsters whenever they are placed in groups. In addition, dumpsters have different degrees of deterioration which may affect their shape and color. Finally, 35\% of the images are classified according to the capacity of the container, which contains a feature which is hard to assess in a snapshot. Since the data set is fully labeled, we can compare our approach both against a baseline case, doing only the transfer learning using a minimal set of labeled images, and against the best case, using all the labels. The experiments show that the proposed system provides an accuracy of 88\%, whereas in the best case it is 93\%. In other words, the method proposed attains 94\% of the best performance.},

This paper focuses on the application of artificial metaplasticity learning in business intelligence systems as an alternative paradigm of achieving a deeper information extraction and learning from arbitrary size data sets. As a case study, artificial metaplasticity multilayer perceptron applied to the automation of credit approval decision based on collected client data is analyzed, showing its potential and improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques. This paper successfully introduces the relevant novelty that the artificial neural network itself estimates the pdf of the input data to be used in the metaplasticity learning, so it is much closer to the biologic reality than previous implementations of artificial metaplasticity.},

This speed increase is due to a simpler architecture, the random fixing of the input weights without being trained and the analytical calculation of the output weights instead of the slowly classical iterative gradient methods as Backpropagation. However, the random fixing of the input weights increases the sensibility to input perturbations like noise. Recently, No-Propagation (No-Prop) algorithm has been introduced as another linear algorithm, which shares with ELM the architecture and the random input weights (hidden weights) initialization. In this paper, an exhaustive comparison of both algorithms and its regularized versions are presented. The simulations results suggest that No-Prop is a competitive alternative to the ELM algorithm.},

One of the fundamental components when designing a warehouse robot is path finding algorithm. In the past, many path finding algorithms had been proposed to identify the optimal path and improve the efficiency in different conditions. For example, A* path finding algorithm is developed to obtain the shortest path, while D* obtains a complete coverage path from source to destination. Although these algorithms improved the efficiency in path finding, dynamic obstacle that may exist in warehouse environment was not considered. This paper presents AD* algorithm, a path finding algorithm that works in dynamic environment for warehouse robot. AD* algorithm is able to detect not only static obstacle but also dynamic obstacles while operating in warehouse environment. In dynamic obstacle path prediction, image of the warehouse environment is processed to identify and track obstacles in the path. The image is pre-processed using perspective transformation, dilation and erosion. Once obstacle has been identified using background subtraction, the server will track and predict future path of the dynamic object to avoid the obstacle.},

These IoT streaming data are one of Big Data sources, and they require careful consideration for efficient data processing and analysis. Deep learning is emerging as a solution to IoT streaming data analytics. However, there is a persistent problem in deep learning that it takes a long time to learn neural networks. In this paper, we propose a high-performance IoT streaming data prediction system to improve the learning speed and to predict in real time. We showed the efficacy of the system through a case study of air pollution. The experimental results show that the modified LSTM autoencoder model shows the best performance compared to a generic LSTM model. We noticed that achieving the best performance requires optimizing many parameters, including learning rate, epoch, memory cell size, input timestep size, and the number of features/predictors. In that regard, we show that the high-performance data learning/prediction frameworks (e.g., Spark, Dist-Keras, and Hadoop) are essential to rapidly fine-tune a model for training and testing before real deployment of the model as data accumulate.},

Sometimes, an image needs to be authenticated by verifying its source camera model or device. Recently, deep networks have become very successful at visual pattern recognition. With this motivation, several investigators have explored the possibility of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for camera source identification. In this paper, we use selective preprocessing, instead of a indiscriminate one, in order not to hinder the CNN’s strong ability to learn useful features for this kind of forensic task. To generate a consistent and balanced dataset, we limit the maximum number of original images to 200 per camera model, and we discard vertically taken images. Using a relatively simple deep network structure, the proposed method achieved a better prediction accuracy—95.0\%—than GoogleNet and other existing methods. Also, challenging camera models such as the Sony DSC H50 and W170 can be classified with the quite high prediction accuracies of 87.9\% and 83.1\%, respectively.},

We propose a novel generative adversarial network with two discriminators to remove rain called rain removal generative adversarial network, where a combination of reconstruction, feature and adversarial losses is used for low level, structural and natural recovery, respectively. We have found that exploiting low-level $${l_1}$$ loss with high-level structural similarity loss as a reconstruction loss is quite effective in attaining visually plausible and consistent texture.

An issue raised in this process is that personal information can be exploited by multiple unwanted entities without the data owner’s knowledge. To solve this problem, functional encryption was proposed. It is suitable for data protection because even if a third-party uses the owner’s secret key for a function f, it cannot retrieve the original message x from the ciphertext. This means that information about x cannot be published, but is exposed only as f(x), the result of the function f. However, previous pairing-based public key functional encryption schemes for inner product evaluations (FE-IPE) cannot be practical solutions yet because they require too much computation, communication and storage overheads. In this paper, we propose an efficient pairing-based public key FE-IPE that requires only n (i.e., the dimension of vectors for function and message) exponentiation plus two pairing computations for decryption with smaller sized public parameters, secret keys and ciphertexts. And this scheme supports fully collusion resistance. The proposed scheme is proven selectively secure against chosen-plaintext attacks in the standard model under the external Diffie–Hellman assumption.},

  abstract     = {Quality of service (QoS) implementation in a wireless local area network (WLAN) enables the prediction of network performance and utilization of effective bandwidth for multimedia applications. In QoS-supported WLAN, enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) adjusts back-off parameters to implement priority-based channel access at the medium access control (MAC) layer. Although conventional QoS-supported EDCA in WLANs can provide a certain degree of QoS guarantee, the performance of best effort data (low-priority) traffic is sacrificed owing to the blind use of a binary exponential back-off (BEB) mechanism for collision avoidance among WLAN stations (STAs). In EDCA, the BEB mechanism exponentially increases the contention window (CW[AC]) for any specific priority access category (AC) when collision occurs and resets it to its initial size after successful data transmission. This increase and reset of CW[AC] is performed regardless of the network density inference, i.e., a scarce WLAN does not require an unnecessary exponential increase in CW[AC]. Similarly, a dense WLAN causes more collisions if CW[AC] is reset to its initial minimum size. Machine-learning algorithms can scrutinize an STA’s experience for WLAN inference. Therefore, in this study, we propose a machine-learning-enabled EDCA (MEDCA) mechanism for QoS-supported MAC layer channel access in dense WLANs. This mechanism utilizes a Q-learning algorithm, which is one of the prevailing models of machine learning, to infer the network density and adjust its back-off CW[AC] accordingly. Simulation results show that MEDCA performs better as compared to the conventional EDCA mechanism in QoS-supported dense WLANs.},

  abstract     = {The patients with diabetes have a chance to develop diabetic retinopathy (DR) which affects to the eyes. DR can cause blindness if the patients do not control diabetes. The patients with DR will have an impairment of metabolism of glucose causing a high glucose level in blood vessel called hyperglycemia. It leads to abnormal blood vessel and ultimately results in leakage of blood or fluid like lipoproteins, which are deposited under macular edema called hard exudates. They are normally white or yellowish-white with margins. Hard exudates are often arranged in clumps or circinate rings and located in the outer layer of the retina. The aim of this research was to detect hard exudates by applying several image processing techniques and classify them by using supervised learning methods including support vector machines and some neural network approaches, i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP) network, hierarchical adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (hierarchical ANFIS), and convolutional neuron networks. DIARETDB1 which contains 89 fundus images is exploited as a dataset for evaluation. Hard exudate candidates are extracted by morphological techniques and classified by the classifiers trained by extracted patches with the corresponding ground truths. The tenfold cross-validation is applied to assure the generalization of the results. The proposed method achieves the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.998 when the MLP network is applied. The AUCs for all four classifiers are more than 0.95. This shows that the combination of image processing techniques and suitable classifiers can perform very well in hard exudate detection problem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, by using the adaptive control method, the global matrix-projective synchronization of delayed fractional-order competitive neural network with different time scales is researched for the first time. Firstly, the fractional-order global matrix-projective synchronization is defined. Then, in order to achieve the matrix-projective synchronization, the sufficient condition is obtained under an adaptive controller and its effectiveness is proved by combining the fractional-order Barbalat theory with a suitable Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional as well as some fractional-order differential inequalities. And all unknown parameters are identified and estimated to the fixed constants successfully. Finally, as applications, a numerical example with simulations is employed to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the new synchronization analysis.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the concept of Virtual Weather Stations (VWS) is introduced. A VWS is an integration of algorithms to download meteorological data, process and use them with the main objective of estimate data in nearby locations with no meteorological stations. To develop the VWS, the performances of different interpolation methods were evaluated to test the accuracy. Daily data from an automatic weather station network, such as precipitation (Precip), air temperature (Temp), air relative humidity, mean wind speed, total solar irradiation, and reference evapotranspiration were interpolated using artificial neural networks (ANNs) with the hardlim, sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), softsign, and rectified linear unit (relu) activations functions were employed. To contrast the ANNs interpolations, alternatives methods such as inverse distance weighting, inverse-squared distance weighting, multilinear regression, and random forest regression were used. To validate the models, a randomly selected weather station was removed from the daily datasets, and the interpolated values were compared with the actual station records. Additionally, interpolations in the summer and winter months were performed to check the capability of the models during periods with more extreme phenomena. The results showed that the interpolation methods have an R2 up to 0.98 for variables such as temperatures for the period of 1 year. Meanwhile, during the summer and winter, the models presented lower accuracy. From a practical perspective, the methods here described could be useful to produce meteorological data with the VWS to record temperatures and dose the irrigation in crops.},

Additionally, the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database is used to test the PF-GD method by implementing a logistic regression learning algorithm. The experimental results obtained with the four functions illustrate that the PF-GD method performs much better than the conventional gradient descent optimizer, although it has some parameters that must be set before modeling. The results of implementing the MNIST dataset demonstrate that the cross-entropy of the PF-GD method exhibits a smaller decrease than that of the conventional gradient descent optimizer, resulting in higher accuracy of the PF-GD method. The PF-GD method provides the best accuracy for the training model, 97.00\%, and the accuracy of evaluating the model with the test dataset is 90.37\%, which is higher than the accuracy of 90.08\% obtained with the conventional gradient descent optimizer.},

  abstract     = {An advanced image encryption scheme should equip the capability against malicious attacks, reduce the losses under attacks, and improve the compression rate tremendously due to the unsafe network environment and the limited bandwidth resources. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) has been introduced into image encryption schemes because of the merit of low sampling rate. However, these schemes still cannot address the above requirements well. In order to improve compression rate while providing higher security level, a novel subdata image cryptosystem is proposed by introducing vector quantization (VQ) into CS-based encryption scheme. The plaintext image is first divided into VQ index blocks and the error compensations that are sparse enough to be compressed by CS. Then, the index information and CS measurements are further scrambled and diffused by chaotic sequences to achieve enhanced security. It can be ensured that the primary index information is informative and occupies smaller proportion of cipher image such that it cannot be easily tampered if only a part of the image is attacked. In contrast, the secondary error information is a good supplement to the former and occupies larger proportion. Simulation results verify that our proposed scheme has overwhelming compression rate and security effect to resist malicious attacks when compared with the state-of-art schemes. In addition, even if the important information is damaged, the destroyed pixels can be located and the plaintext image can be reconstructed with VQ neighbor indexes.},

  abstract     = {Handling both intermittent actuator faults and coupled interconnections in uncertain multiple-input–multiple-output nonlinear system is still a challenge in the control community. In this paper, to address this issue, an adaptive neural fault-tolerant control scheme is developed. Firstly, neural networks with random hidden nodes are used to approximate unknown functions, and an inequality is introduced to construct controllers such that the singularity problem of the controllers can be circumvented. Secondly, a projection algorithm is adopted to update online the estimated parameters in the controllers such that the boundedness of estimated parameters is ensured. In particular, the boundedness of estimate of unknown fault parameters with intermittent jumps can be definitely guaranteed. Due to the effects of intermittency jumps of unknown parameters on the system stability during operation, a modified Lyapunov function is developed to prove the system stability. It is proved that the system stability only depends on the jumping amplitude of Lyapunov function and the minimum fault time interval and is not affected by the total number of faults. Thirdly, a root mean square type of bound for the tracking error is established by using iterative calculation to illustrate that the system transient performance in the sense of the tracking error is adjustable by proper choice of design parameters. Finally, simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Advances in the artificial intelligence-based models can act as robust tools for modeling hydrological processes. Neural network architectures coupled with learning algorithms are considered as useful modeling tools for groundwater-level fluctuations. Emotional artificial neural network coupled with genetic algorithm (EANN-GA) is one such novel hybrid neural network which has been used in the present study for the forecasting of groundwater levels at three sites (Site H3, Site H4.5, and Site H9) in a coastal aquifer system. This study was conceived to address and investigate the efficiency of the ensemble model (EANN-GA) for forecasting one-month ahead groundwater level and to compare its performance with emotional artificial neural network (EANN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and the conventional feedforward neural network (FFNN). Variations in the rainfall, tidal levels, and groundwater levels are selected as inputs for the development of EANN-GA, EANN, GRNN, and FFNN models. Suitable goodness-of-fit criteria such as Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), bias, root mean squared error (RMSE), and graphical indicators are used for assessing the efficiency of the developed models. The improvement in the performance of the EANN-GA model over the developed EANN, GRNN, and FFNN models in terms of NSE is 0.81, 6.02, and 9.56\% at Site H3; 4.35, 5.50, and 22.68\% at Site H4.5; and 1.05, 7.18, and 21.75\% at Site H9. Thus, it can be inferred that the EANN-GA model outperforms the developed EANN model, GRNN model, and FFNN model. Further, this paper examines the predictive capability of extreme events by the EANN-GA, EANN, GRNN, and FFNN models. The RMSE values of the EANN-GA model at all peak points are found as 0.27, 0.23, and 0.10 m at sites H3, H4.5, and H9, respectively, and the results indicate superior performance of EANN-GA model. To check the generalization ability of the developed EANN-GA models, they are validated with the data of another site (Site I2) located in the same coastal aquifer. Superior prediction capability and generalization ability make the EANN-GA model a better alternative for predicting groundwater levels. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of EANN-GA in modeling spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater levels. It is also concluded that the EANN-GA model yields remarkably better predictions of extreme events, and hence, it could be a promising technique for developing alarm systems for real-world water problems.},

Balancing of disassembly line is a hot and challenging problem in recent years. Given the uncertainty factors including corrosion and deformation of parts and components of waste products, this paper introduces the destructive mode and uncertainty disassembly time into the disassembly line and establishes a multi-objective disassembly line balancing model, considering partial destructive mode and U-shaped layout. The model aims to reduce the number of stations, balance the workload and reduce energy consumption while increasing the disassembly profit. A new multi-objective discrete flower pollination algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Both task assignment and disassembly modes are considered in the encoding and decoding strategies of the flowers. Combining the discrete characteristics of the problem, the cross-pollination and self-pollination behaviors of the algorithm are redefined. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by solving two classical examples and by comparing with seven meta-heuristic algorithms. Then the proposed model and method are applied to a television disassembly line of a disassembly enterprise in China. The disassembly schemes of the proposed algorithm are superior to that of the five classical multi-objective algorithms. The results show that the proposed method can improve the performance of the disassembly line.},

  abstract     = {Random feature mapping (RFM) is the core operation in the random weight neural network (RWNN). Its quality has a significant impact on the performance of a RWNN model. However, there has been no good way to evaluate the quality of RFM. In this paper, we introduce a new concept called dispersion degree of matrix information distribution (DDMID), which can be used to measure the quality of RFM. We used DDMID in our experiments to explain the relationship between the rank of input data and the performance of the RWNN model and got some interesting results. We found that: (1) when the rank of input data reaches a certain threshold, the model’s performance increases with the increase in the rank; (2) the impact of the rank on the model performance is insensitive to the type of activation functions and the number of hidden nodes; (3) if the DDMID of an RFM matrix is very small, it implies that the first $$\mathbf{k}$$ singular values in the singular value matrix of the RFM matrix contain too much information, which usually has a negative impact on the final closed-form solution of the RWNN model. Besides, we verified the improvement effect of intrinsic plasticity (IP) algorithm on RFM by using DDMID. The experimental results showed that DDMID allows researchers evaluate the mapping quality of data features before model training, so as to predict the effect of data preprocessing or network initialization without model training. We believe that our findings could provide useful guidance when constructing and analyzing a RWNN model.},

This work addresses the asset acquisition planning for the LPG cylinder business of a company from the energy sector which has recently started this activity. In order to make the acquisition plan, it was necessary to forecast the sales and the LPG cylinder return rate. For that purpose, an ensemble method using time series techniques, multiple linear regression models and artificial neural networks was employed. Sales forecast was obtained using time series techniques, in particular, moving averages and exponential smoothing. Then, forecast of bottled propane gas sales and return rate was also addressed through multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks. A probability density function was defined for each of the different approaches. Afterward, using Monte Carlo simulation, the forecast values are obtained by a linear combination of the probability density functions, thus producing the final forecast. Results show that the company’s expectation of growth is larger than that predicted by the proposed methodology, which means the company should reflect on its current asset acquisition strategy. By combining different approaches, the proposed multi-model methodology allowed to obtain an accurate forecasting, without requiring a lot of historical data.},

  abstract     = {Picture fuzzy set (PFS) is an important tool for handling uncertainty and vagueness, particularly in situations that require more answers of the type “yes,” “no,” “abstain” and “refusal.” Correlation coefficient of picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) is an essential measure in picture fuzzy set theory and has a lot of applications in many areas, such as “decision-making,” “medical diagnosis,” “pattern recognition” and “clustering analysis”. In this article, two correlation coefficients of PFSs are introduced along with some of their properties. These correlation coefficients of PFSs are better than existing ones and effective in expressing the nature of correlation (positive or negative correlation). We also show the applications and advantages of the proposed picture fuzzy correlation coefficients over some existing methods in pattern recognition, medical diagnosis and clustering with the help of illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the correlation filter (CF)-based method has significantly advanced in the tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). As the core component of most trackers, CF is a discriminative classifier to distinguish the object from the surrounding environment. However, the poor representation of the object and lack of contextual information have restricted the tracker to gain better performance. In this work, a robust framework with multi-kernelized correlators is proposed to improve robustness and accuracy simultaneously. Both convolutional features extracted from the neural network and hand-crafted features are employed to enhance expressions for object appearances. Then, the adaptive context analysis strategy helps filters to effectively learn the surrounding information by introducing context patches with the GMSD index. In the training stage, multiple dynamic filters with time-attenuated factors are introduced to avoid tracking failure caused by dramatic appearance changes. The response maps corresponding to different features are finally fused before the novel resolution enhancement operation to increase distinguishing capability. As a result, the optimization problem is reformulated, and a closed-form solution for the proposed framework can be obtained in the kernel space. Extensive experiments on 100 challenging UAV tracking sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker outperforms other 23 state-of-the-art trackers and can effectively handle unexpected appearance variations under the complex and constantly changing working conditions.},

Generally, the low-rank constraint integrated with the nonlocal self-similarity prior is enforced for image recovery. However, it is still unsatisfactory to recover complex image structures due to the lack of joint modeling based on local and global information, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-constrained low-rank approximation method using complementary local and global information, as, respectively, modeled by kernel Wiener filtering and low-rank regularization. The proposed method solves the ill-posed inverse problem associated with image denoising by the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only removes noise effectively, but also is highly competitive against the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {Human action recognition has received significant attention because of its wide applications in human–machine interaction, visual surveillance, and video indexing. Recent progress in deep learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) significantly affects the performance of many action recognition systems. However, CNNs are designed to learn features from 2D spatial images, while action videos are considered as 3D spatiotemporal signals. In addition, the complex structure of most deep networks and their dependency on backpropagation learning algorithm have a negative impact on the efficiency of real-time human action recognition systems. To avoid these limitations, we propose a new human action recognition method based on principal component analysis network (PCANet) which is a simple architecture of CNN exploiting unsupervised learning instead of the commonly used supervised algorithms. However, PCANet is originally designed to solve 2D image classification problems. In order to make it suitable for solving action recognition problem in videos, the temporal information of the input video is appropriately represented using motion energy templates. Multiple short-time motion energy image (ST-MEI) templates are computed to capture human motion information. The deep structure of PCANet helps to learn hierarchical local motion features from the input ST-MEI templates. The dimension of the feature vector learned from PCANet is reduced using whitening principal component analysis algorithm and finally fed to linear support vector machines classifier for classification. The proposed method is evaluated using three different benchmark datasets, namely KTH, Weizmann, and UCF sports action. Experimental results using leave-one-out strategy demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

However, it mainly concentrates on one-to-one verification and is not efficient for one-to-many identification. Especially, when there is a large number of samples in the database, obtaining both the accuracy and speed of recognition has been the major challenge. To handle these problems, we propose an improved sparse representation-based 3D palmprint identification scheme. The novelty of this investigation focuses on: (1) The histogram of blocked surface type and local phase of palmprint are integrated as one feature to reduce the dimensionality of 3D information and the complexity of the subsequent computations; and (2) by adding intermediate terms to the calculation of sparse coefficient, an improved sparse representation-based classifier is proposed to refine the classification results and enhance the accuracy of identification. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Compared with other methods, the proposed solution can reduce the computational complexity and elevate the accuracy, speed, and robustness of identification. Moreover, the proposed 3D feature occupies small data volume, which makes the scheme more suitable for large-scale specimen identification applications.},

  abstract     = {Automatic and accurate pancreas segmentation from 3D computed tomography volumes is a crucial prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis, intraoperative planning and guidance. However, this is a challenging task because of the high inter-subject variability in the shape and location of the pancreas, as well as the existence of the surrounding organs. In order to address the above challenges, we propose a novel iterative 3D feature enhancement network to segment pancreas accurately. Specifically, the multi-level integrated features and the individual features at different levels can be progressively enhanced in an iterative manner by leveraging the complementary information encoded in different features. Therefore, the non-pancreas information at lower layers can be suppressed, and the fine details of pancreas at higher layers can be increased. In addition, because the pancreas region occupies only a small part of the scan, in order to prevent the final predictions from being biased toward the background class, we design the Dice similarity coefficients loss function in the training phase to mitigate this issue. Meanwhile, deep supervision with auxiliary classifier is incorporated in the intermediate layers at each iteration to guide the back-propagation of gradient flows and boost the discriminative capability at lower layers. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available NIH pancreas segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms, and it can be easily applied to other volumetric image segmentation tasks.},

  abstract     = {From recent studies, it is observed that convolutional neural networks are proved to be extremely successful in classification problems. Accurate and fast classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats is a crucial step in the implementation of real-time arrhythmia diagnosis systems. In this study, convolutional neural networks are employed to classify eleven different ECG beat types in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. We aimed to implement a computer-aided mobile diagnosis system equipped with artificial intelligence that detects the classes of heartbeats by visual inspection of the ECG records in the manner as the cardiologists do. Since doctors make their decisions basing heavily on the 2D visual appearances of the ECG signals without doing numerical calculations on 1D time samples, 2D images of 1D ECG records were given to the classifier as the input data. It would not be surprising that the structure of the network classifying 2D ECG data has to be larger than the one used to classify 1D ECG signals. The small size of a neural network is an important property for real-time use of the system. In this study, smaller network structures that provide high performances using the Walsh functions (WF), and drawbacks of converting 1D signals to 2D images have been investigated. The network structures using the WF during the training stage have been applied to different databases and successful results have been obtained. Classification results and sizes of the network structures are compared for the ECG beats in one dimension and in the form of 2D visuals. The training of ECG signals in the form of 2D visuals takes much longer time than that of the 1D signals. However, it is observed that training and testing times of both networks were quite fast. Moreover, average success rates of 99\% were achieved for all beat types by using small-size networks.},

  abstract     = {Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a sight threatening disorder that primarily affects preterm infants. It is the major reason for lifelong vision impairment and childhood blindness. Digital fundus images of preterm infants obtained from a Retcam Ophthalmic Imaging Device are typically used for ROP screening. ROP is often accompanied by Plus disease that is characterized by high levels of arteriolar tortuosity and venous dilation. The recent diagnostic procedures view the prevalence of Plus disease as a factor of prognostic significance in determining its stage, progress and severity. Our aim is to develop a diagnostic method, which can distinguish images of retinas with ROP from healthy ones and that can be interpreted by medical experts. We investigate the quantification of retinal blood vessel tortuosity via a novel U-COSFIRE (Combination Of Shifted Filter Responses) filter and propose a computer-aided diagnosis tool for automated ROP detection. The proposed methodology involves segmentation of retinal blood vessels using a set of B-COSFIRE filters with different scales followed by the detection of tortuous vessels in the obtained vessel map by means of U-COSFIRE filters. We also compare our proposed technique with an angle-based diagnostic method that utilizes the magnitude and orientation responses of the multi-scale B-COSFIRE filters. We carried out experiments on a new data set of 289 infant retinal images (89 with ROP and 200 healthy) that we collected from the programme in India called KIDROP (Karnataka Internet Assisted Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity). We used 10 images (5 with ROP and 5 healthy) for learning the parameters of our methodology and the remaining 279 images (84 with ROP and 195 healthy) for performance evaluation. We achieved sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, computed on the 279 test images. The obtained results and its explainable character demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to assist medical experts.},

  abstract     = {The image quality degradation due to the loss of high-frequency components of images is often seen in real scenarios, such as artifacts caused by image compression and image blur caused by camera shake or out of focus. Quantifying such degradation is very useful for many tasks that are related to image quality. In this paper, an effective approach is proposed for the image quality assessment on images with blur as well as images with compression artifacts. Based on the relation between the dictionaries of the degraded image and the reference image, we build up a hybrid dictionary learning model to characterize the space of patches of the reference image as well as that of the degraded image. The image quality is then measured by the difference between the two resulting dictionaries. Combined with a simple sparse-coding-based metric, the proposed method shows competitive performance on five benchmark datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the utility of unsupervised machine learning and data visualisation for tracking changes in user activity over time. This is done through analysing unlabelled data generated from passive and ambient smart home sensors, such as motion sensors, which are considered less intrusive than video cameras or wearables. The challenge in using unlabelled passive and ambient sensors data for activity recognition is to find practical methods that can provide meaningful information to support timely interventions based on changing user needs, without the overhead of having to label the data over long periods of time. The paper addresses this challenge to discover patterns in unlabelled sensor data using kernel density estimation (KDE) for pre-processing the data, together with t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection for visualising changes. The methodology is developed and tested on the Aruba CASAS smart home dataset and focusses on discovering and tracking changes in kitchen-based activities. The traditional approach of using sliding windows to segment the data requires a priori knowledge of the temporal characteristics of activities being identified. In this paper, we show how an adaptive approach for segmentation, KDE, is a suitable alternative for identifying temporal clusters of sensor events from unlabelled data that can represent an activity. The ability to visualise different recurring patterns of activity and changes to these over time is illustrated by mapping the data for separate days of the week. The paper then demonstrates how this can be used to track patterns over longer time-frames which could be used to help highlight differences in the user’s day-to-day behaviour. By presenting the data in a format that can be visually reviewed for temporal changes in activity over varying periods of time from unlabelled sensor data, opens up the opportunity for carers to then initiate further enquiry if variations to previous patterns are noted. This is seen as an accessible first step to enable carers to initiate informed discussions with the service user to understand what may be causing these changes and suggest appropriate interventions if the change is found to be detrimental to their well-being.},

An empirical analysis of performance of ML techniques is presented, considering both single learning and ensemble models. These are trained using data sets populated with numerical simulation results of two sheet metal forming processes: U-Channel and Square Cup. Data sets were built for three distinct steel sheets. A total of eleven input features, related to the mechanical properties, sheet thickness and process parameters, were considered; also, two types of defects (outputs) were analysed for each process. The sampling data were generated, assuming that the variability of each input feature is described by a normal distribution. For a given type of defect, most single classifiers show similar performances, regardless of the material. When comparing single learning and ensemble models, the latter can provide an efficient alternative. The fact that ensemble predictive models present relatively high performances, combined with the possibility of reconciling model bias and variance, offer a promising direction for its application in industrial environment.},

However, regardless of its market penetration, there are still considerable limitations in terms of accuracy in the proposed recommendations stemming from the high-frequency low-relevance user-item bias, data specificities and individual user patterns and needs that may be hidden in data. We propose a novel recommendation approach that improves accuracy and requires significantly less maintenance compared to traditional collaborative filtering. For the experimental evaluation, we use two real data sets and well-known metrics with the results validating our method.

The main points in organising the harmony remain as managing the diversification and intensification actions appropriately, where the efficiency of collective behaviours depends on blending these two actions appropriately. In this paper, a hybrid bee algorithm is presented, which harmonises bee operators of two mainstream well-known swarm intelligence algorithms inspired of natural honeybee colonies. The parent algorithms have been overviewed with many respects, strengths and weaknesses are identified, first, and the hybrid version has been proposed, next. The efficiency of the hybrid algorithm is demonstrated in comparison with the parent algorithms in solving two types of numerical optimisation problems; (1) a set of well-known functional optimisation benchmark problems and (2) optimising the weights of a set of artificial neural network models trained for medical classification benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate the outperforming success of the proposed hybrid algorithm in comparison with two original/parent bee algorithms in solving both types of numerical optimisation benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Many smart home applications rely on indoor human activity recognition. This challenge is currently primarily tackled by employing video camera sensors. However, the use of such sensors is characterized by fundamental technical deficiencies in an indoor environment, often also resulting in a breach of privacy. In contrast, a radar sensor resolves most of these flaws and maintains privacy in particular. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach toward automatic indoor human activity recognition, feeding high-dimensional radar and video camera sensor data into several deep neural networks. Furthermore, we explore the efficacy of sensor fusion to provide a solution in less than ideal circumstances. We validate our approach on two newly constructed and published data sets that consist of 2347 and 1505 samples distributed over six different types of gestures and events, respectively. From our analysis, we can conclude that, when considering a radar sensor, it is optimal to make use of a three-dimensional convolutional neural network that takes as input sequential range-Doppler maps. This model achieves 12.22\% and 2.97\% error rate on the gestures and the events data set, respectively. A pretrained residual network is employed to deal with the video camera sensor data and obtains 1.67\% and 3.00\% error rate on the same data sets. We show that there exists a clear benefit in combining both sensors to enable activity recognition in the case of less than ideal circumstances.},

  abstract     = {Prony method is an efficient feature extraction technique when applied to signals at noiseless environment. However, space environment is very rich with different sources of noise. Noise has a massive effect on Prony method that is noticeably degrades its performance. The objective of this research is to introduce an efficient and robust technique for fault detection and identification at noisy environment to one of the most vital subsystems in spacecraft, which is electrical power subsystem (EPS). Occurrence of anomaly in spacecraft EPS is mainly related to some parameters that are voltage, current and delivered power. This will directly affect the overall spacecraft operation and may result in partial or total mission loss. It is crucial for spacecraft onboard computer to be provided with a diagnosis task that keeps track of EPS parameters and efficiently detect and identify anomalies at different noise levels. The proposed approach is based on noisy signal energy contents. The signal energy contents are large enough compared with noise energy contents. The algorithm uses the short-time energy for noisy signals to robustly identify photovoltaic (PV) anomalies according to their causes like short circuit, open circuit and shading. The proposed approach is proved to be able to discriminate among different types of PV anomalies, and the results ensure the robustness of the proposed algorithm. This is carried out with different noise levels, with minimal task execution time and with small memory footprint. The proposed algorithm is considered to be a generic approach for noisy signal identification.},

As video manipulation techniques advance, it becomes easier for tamperers to create convincing forgeries that can fool human eyes. Deep learning methods have already shown great promise in discovering effective features from data, particularly in the image domain; however, they are exceptionally data hungry. Labelled datasets of varied, state-of-the-art, tampered video which are large enough to facilitate machine learning do not exist and, moreover, may never exist while the field of digital video manipulation is advancing at such an unprecedented pace. Therefore, it is vital to develop techniques which can be trained on authentic or synthesised video but used to localise the patterns of manipulation within tampered videos. In this paper, we developed a framework for tampering detection which derives features from authentic content and utilises them to localise key frames and tampered regions in three publicly available tampered video datasets. We used convolutional neural networks to estimate quantisation parameter, deblock setting and intra/inter mode of pixel patches from an H.264/AVC sequence. Extensive evaluation suggests that these features can be used to aid localisation of tampered regions within video.},

The contributions of this study are mainly focused on minimizing choices costs through adjusting the original classifications by decision partition order and enhancing the probability of searching domain space using a developed Markov chain model. Furthermore, this study introduces an efficient soft set reduction-based binary particle swarm optimized by biogeography-based optimizer (SSR-BPSO-BBO) algorithm that generates an accurate decision for optimal and sub-optimal choices. The results show that the decision partition order technique is performing better in parameter reduction up to 50\%, while other algorithms could not obtain high reduction rates in some scenarios. In terms of accuracy, the proposed SSR-BPSO-BBO algorithm outperforms the other optimization algorithms in achieving high accuracy percentage of a given soft dataset.

In this process, feature selection (FS) is an essential phase because thousands of possible feature sets may be considered in text classification. This paper proposes an enhanced binary grey wolf optimizer (GWO) within a wrapper FS approach to tackle Arabic text classification problems. The proposed binary GWO is utilized to play the role of a wrapper-based feature selection technique. The performance of the proposed method using different learning models, including decision trees, K-nearest neighbour, Naive Bayes, and SVM classifiers, are investigated. Three Arabic public datasets, namely Alwatan, Akhbar-Alkhaleej, and Al-jazeera-News, are utilized to evaluate the efficacy of different BGWO-based wrapper methods. Results and analysis show that SVM-based feature selection technique with the proposed binary GWO optimizer with elite-based crossover scheme has enhanced efficacy in dealing with Arabic text classification problems compared to other peers.},

This research proposes a multi-objective model for emergency blood supply chain management considering blood compatibility, routing, and location–allocation decisions. The blood supply chain network consists of donors, collection facilities, laboratories, blood centers, and hospitals. The mathematical model aims to minimize total supply chain cost and time while maximizing minimum reliability of established routes by making decisions regarding location–allocation, blood flow, inventory levels, and optimal routes. In order to solve the problem, a novel algorithm called Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer is used and compared to two classical algorithms Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. Performance of the algorithms is evaluated in various test problems using powerful measures. Also, the application of the proposed model is investigated in a case study in Iran’s capital, Tehran. Based on the results, important managerial insights are derived and optimal locations for facilities, inventory levels, routes and blood flow between facilities are determined.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays the ever-increasing energy consumption in buildings has caused supply shortages and adverse environmental impacts. The accurate prediction of energy consumption in smart buildings may help to monitor and control energy usage. As energy consumption is inevitably affected by exogenous factors such as temperature and wind speed, it is fundamentally important to select the informative channels of the factors, to extract the valuable features from the selected channels applied to the optimal-configured model, to improve prediction accuracy. However, existing work considers these parts in an almost disjoint way and lacks a model taking them into account, which may decrease prediction performance. Motivated by this challenge, an end-to-end prediction framework, called evolutionary model construction (EMC), is proposed to focus on performing these parts jointly. To implement EMC, a two-step evolutionary algorithm (EA) is designed, where one EA is firstly used to focus on exploiting the informative channels, while a new algorithm is proposed to concentrate on selecting the suitable feature extraction methods and respective time window sizes applied to the selected channels, and selecting the parameters in the predictor. The implementation of EMC chooses neural network with random weights as the predictor due to its highly recognized efficacy. We evaluate EMC in comparison with the existing approaches on a real-world electricity consumption dataset with various auxiliary factors. The superiority of EMC is further proved by analyzing and discussing the result according to the days in 1 week, time stamps in 1 day and month information on test samples.},

  abstract     = {Economic load dispatch (ELD) is a crucial problem in the power system which is tackled by distributing the required generation power through a set of units to minimize the fuel cost required. This distribution is subject to two main constraints: (1) equality and inequality related to power balance and power output, respectively. In the optimization context, ELD is formulated as a non-convex, nonlinear, constrained optimization problem which cannot be easily solved using calculus-based techniques. Several optimization algorithms have been adapted. Due to the complexity nature of ELD search space, the theoretical concepts of these optimization algorithms have been modified or hybridized. In this paper, the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) which is a swarm intelligence is hybridized with $$\beta$$ -hill climbing optimizer ( $$\beta$$ HC) which is a local search algorithm, to improve convergence properties. GWO is very powerful in a wide search, while $$\beta$$ HC is very powerful in deep search. By combining the wide and deep search ability in a single optimization framework, the balance between the exploration and exploitation is correctly managed. The proposed hybrid algorithm is named $$\beta$$ -GWO which is evaluated using five different test cases of ELD problems: 3 generating units with 850 MW; 13 generating units with 1800 MW; 13 generating units with 2520 MW; 40 generating units with 10,500 MW; and 80 generating units with 21,000 MW. $$\beta$$ -GWO is comparatively measured using 49 comparative methods. The results obtained by $$\beta$$ -GWO outperform others in most test cases. In conclusion, the proposed $$\beta$$ -GWO is proved to be a powerful method for ELD problem or for any other similar problems in the power system domain.},

Objective of cloud users is to select the optimal resource that meets the demand of end users in reasonable cost and time, but sometimes users pay more for short time. Most of the proposed state-of-the-art algorithms try to optimize only one parameter at a time. Therefore, a novel compromise solution is needed to make the balance between conflicting objectives. The main goal of this research paper is to design and develop a task processing framework that has the decision-making capability to select the optimal resource at runtime to process the applications (diverse and complex nature) at virtual machines using modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm within a user-defined deadline. Proposed algorithm gives non-dominance set of optimal solutions and improves various influential parameters (time, cost, throughput, task acceptance ratio) by series of experiments over various synthetic datasets using Cloudsim tool. Computational results show that proposed algorithm well and substantially outperforms the baseline heuristic and meta-heuristic such as PSO, adaptive PSO, artificial bee colony, BAT algorithm, and improved min–min load-balancing algorithm.},

The aim is to explore the efficiency of evolutionary-based algorithms in dealing with MSE optimization problem along with automating the minimum cost design of MSE walls. To this end, three evolutionary algorithms, differential evolution (DE), evolution strategy, and biogeography-based optimization algorithm (BBO), are tackled to solve this problem.

The competitive and cooperative behaviors of NFO variants provide a remarkable ability to accelerate information exchanges and achieve global search. Experimental results show that NFO variants perform better than basic and other state-of-the-art EAs under different benchmark functions. For NFO and other EAs, it is difficult to quantify benefits of local cooperation in the optimization process. For this purpose, the cooperation behaviors are analyzed in a new network approach in this paper. In the proposed NFO variants, population graph shows a scale-free network with power-law distribution. Network characteristics, i.e., degree distribution, cluster coefficient and average degree, are used to quantify the cooperation behaviors. Experimental results show that network characteristics can effectively indicate the optimization performance of NFO variants in terms of convergence rate and population diversity. NFO variants with large cluster coefficients and significant heterogeneous characteristics can achieve a significant performance improvement on numerous problems.},

  abstract     = {The travelling officer problem (TOP) is a graph-based orienteering problem for modelling the patrolling routines of a parking officer monitoring an area. Recently, a spatiotemporal probabilistic model was built for TOP to estimate the leaving probability of parking cars, and relevant algorithms were applied to search for the optimal path for a parking officer to maximize the collection of parking fines from cars in violation. However, there are often multiple parking officers on duty during business hours in the central business district, which provides us with the opportunities to introduce cooperation among officers for efficient car-parking management. The multiple travelling officers problem (MTOP) is a more complex problem than the TOP because multiple officers are involved simultaneously in paths construction. In this study, the MTOP is formulated and new components are established for solving the problem. One essential component called the leader-based random-keys encoding scheme (LERK) is developed for the representation of possible solutions. Then, cuckoo search (CS), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are implemented using the proposed components and compared with other state-of-the-art GA and PSO using other solution encoding schemes to solve MTOP. In addition, two greedy selection algorithms are adopted as baselines. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated with real parking sensors data and different metrics. The experimental results show that the performance of CS and GA using LERK is considerably improved in comparison with that of other implemented algorithms.},

Even though numerous methods have been proposed in literature, it is still a challenge for the existing methods to produce steady satisfactory thresholds at manageable computational cost in segmenting images with various unknown properties. In this paper, a non-revisiting quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (NrQPSO) algorithm is proposed to find the optimal multilevel thresholds for gray-level images. The proposed NrQPSO uses the non-revisiting scheme to avoid the re-evaluation of the evaluated solution candidates. To reduce the unnecessary computation cost, the NrQPSO provides an automatic stopping mechanism which is capable of gauging the progress of exploration and stops the algorithm rationally in a natural manner. For further improving the computation efficiency, the NrQPSO employs a meticulous solution search method to overcome the drawback of the existing QPSO algorithms using the original search methods. Performance of the NrQPSO is tested on the Berkeley segmentation data set. The experimental results have demonstrated that the NrQPSO can outperform the other state-of-the-art population-based thresholding methods in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and robustness; thus, the NrQPSO can be applied in real-time massive image processing.},

The breakthrough started since the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm had been introduced and examined.

It is build on the foundation of the first technique of this kind—known as Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA). In this paper, its simplified and improved version, obtained after extensive performance testing, is presented. It is based on only one natural phenomena—called flower constancy—the natural mechanism allowing pollen carrying insects to remember the positions of the best pollen sources. Modified FPA, named as Biotic Flower Pollination Algorithm (BFPA) and relying solely on biotic pollinators, outperforms original FPA, which itself proved to be very effective approach. The paper first presents a short description of original FPA and the changes leading to Biotic Flower Pollination Algorithm. It also discusses performance of the modified algorithm on a full set of CEC17 benchmark functions. Furthermore, in that aspect, the comparison between BFPA and other optimization algorithms is also given.

Despite its efficiency and wide use, CS suffers from premature convergence and poor balance between exploitation and exploration. To cope with these issues, a new cuckoo search algorithm extension based on self-adaptive knowledge learning (I-PKL-CS) is proposed. In this study, learning model with individual history knowledge and population knowledge is introduced into the CS algorithm. Individuals constantly adjust their position by using historical knowledge and communicate with each other by using their own knowledge in the optimization process. In order to reduce complexity of the I-PKL-CS algorithm, the optimal learning model is selected to exploit the potential of individual knowledge learning and population knowledge learning by adopting threshold statistics learning strategy, which provides a good trade-off between the exploration and exploitation. The accuracy and performance of the proposed approach are evaluated by eighteen classic benchmark functions and CEC 2013 test suite. Statistical comparisons of the experimental results showed that the proposed I-PKL-CS algorithm made an appropriate trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Comparing the proposed I-PKL-CS with various CS algorithms, variants of differential evolution, and improved particle swarm optimization algorithms, the results demonstrate that I-PKL-CS is a competitive new type of algorithm.},

Edge segments of CSR compete with each other for representing consecutively given samples. They dynamically move, grow, shrink or rewire subject to several heuristic rules. Those rules are designed to depress abnormal data, enable lifelong learning, recover salient feature and ensure correct topology. Assembling them together allows online tracking of changing curves. Once CSR converges on one slice, learnt curves are reused as initial estimation for the next. By this practice, shape coherence of successive slices is efficiently utilized, and the ongoing learning output all subsequent slices incrementally. We have verified the feasibility of proposed algorithm both on synthesized data and scanned points.},

Noises are unavoidable in the practical workspace, but the most existing models for time-varying nonlinear optimization problems carry out with one assume that the computing process is free of noises. In this paper, from a control-theoretical framework, noise-suppressing zeroing neural dynamic (NSZND) model is developed, analyzed and investigated by feat of continuous-time zeroing neural network model, which behaves efficiently for hurdling online time-varying nonlinear optimization problems with the presence of different noises. Further, for speeding the rate of convergence, general noise-suppressing zeroing neural network (GNSZNN) model with different activation functions is discussed. Then, theoretical analyses show that the proposed noise-suppressing zeroing neural network model derived from NSZND model has the global convergence property in the presence of different kinds of noises. Besides, how GNSZNN model performs with different activation functions is also proved in detail. In addition, numerical results are provided to substantiate the feasibility and superiority of GNSZNN model for online time-varying nonlinear optimization problems with inherent tolerance to noises.},

  abstract     = {The requirements for automatic document summarization that can be applied to practical applications are increasing rapidly. As a general sentence regression architecture, extractive text summarization captures sentences from a document by leveraging externally related information. However, existing sentence regression approaches have not employed features that mine the contextual information and relations among sentences. To alleviate this problem, we present a neural network model, namely the Contextualized-Representation Hierarchical-Attention Summarization (CRHASum), that uses the contextual information and relations among sentences to improve the sentence regression performance for extractive text summarization. This framework makes the most of their advantages. One advantage is that the contextual representation is allowed to vary across linguistic context information, and the other advantage is that the hierarchical attention mechanism is able to capture the contextual relations from the word-level and sentence-level by using the Bi-GRU. With this design, the CRHASum model is capable of paying attention to the important context in the surrounding context of a given sentence for extractive text summarization. We carry out extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. CRHASum alone can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approach. Meanwhile, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of multiple ROUNG metrics and includes a few basic useful features.},

Determining the number of natural clusters in a dataset has been a challenging problem in Machine Learning. Employing an internal cluster validity index such as Silhouette Index together with a clustering algorithm has been a widely used technique for estimating the number of natural clusters, which has limitations. We propose a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm which automatically estimates the numbers of natural clusters and gives the associated clustering solutions along with dendrograms for visualizing the clustering structure. The algorithm has a Silhouette Index-based criterion for selecting the pair of clusters to merge, in the process of building the clustering hierarchy. The proposed algorithm could find decent estimates for the number of natural clusters, and the associated clustering solutions when applied to a collection of cancer gene expression datasets and general datasets. The proposed method showed better overall performance when compared to that of a set of prominent methods for estimating the number of natural clusters, which are used for cancer subtype discovery from genomic data. The proposed method is deterministic. It can be a better alternative to contemporary approaches for identifying potential novel subtypes of cancers from genomic data.},

In this work, we propose a hybrid video compression approach with the help of foreground motion compensation for the above application. This method works effectively by including the advantages of both block-based and object-based coding techniques as well as reducing the drawbacks of both. The proposed method first segments the foreground moving objects from the background with the help of adaptive thresholding-based optical flow techniques. Next, it determines the contour of the segmented foreground regions with the help of Freeman chain code. Subsequently, block-based motion estimation and compensation using variants of particle swarm optimization are computed. After that, motion failure areas are detected using change detection method, and finally, DCT and Huffman coding-based entropy encoding are done to compactly represent the data. Experimental results and analyses on different surveillance video sequences using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, PSNR and SSID show that our method outperforms other recent and relevant existing techniques.},

Thus, this research aimed to realize the computerized method to recognize the species and detect early disease of the herbs by referring to these characteristics. This research has been developed a system for recognizing the species and detecting the early disease of the herbs using computer vision and electronic nose, which focus on odour, shape, colour and texture extraction of herb leaves, together with a hybrid intelligent system that are involved fuzzy inference system, naïve Bayes (NB), probabilistic neural network (PNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. These techniques were used to perform a convenient and effective herb species recognition and early disease detection on ten different herb species samples. The species recognition accuracy rate among ten different species using computer vision and electronic nose is archived 97\% and 96\%, respectively, in SVM, 98\% and 98\%, respectively, in PNN and both 94\% in NB. In the early disease detection, the detection rate among ten different herb’s species using computer vision and electronic nose are 98\% and 97\%, respectively, in SVM, both 98\% in PNN, 95\% and 94\%, respectively, in NB.

  abstract     = {Support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used and reliable machine learning algorithm. It has been successfully applied to many real-world problems, with remarkable results. However, it has also been observed that SVM computational complexity increases with the increase in data size. Although many SVM speed optimization techniques have been proposed in the literature, there is still need for further improvement on the performance speed and accuracy of this algorithm. In this paper, a boundary detection algorithm for SVM speed optimization called ant colony optimization instance selection algorithm (ACOISA) is proposed. ACOISA is inspired by edge selection in ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, and it performs two primary functions: boundary detection and boundary instance selection. In the algorithm, ACO is used for boundary detection and k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used for boundary instance selection. Different sets of experiments are carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed technique. All the experiments were performed on 35 datasets containing three well-known e-fraud types (credit card fraud, email spam and phishing email) and 31 other datasets available at UCI data repository. The experimental results showed that the proposed technique efficiently improved SVM training speed in 100\% of the datasets used for evaluation, without significantly affecting SVM classification quality. Furthermore, the Freidman’s and Holm’s post hoc tests were conducted to statistically validate the credibility of the results. The statistical test results revealed that the proposed technique is significantly faster, compared to the standard SVM and some existing instance selection techniques, in all cases.},

So, an accurate estimation of discharge capacity to predict the battery’s end of life is of paramount importance and critical for safe and efficient energy utilization, especially for battery management systems. The resistor–capacitor (RC) equivalent circuit model is commonly used in the literature to model battery. However, a battery is a chemical energy storage system, and then the RC model will therefore be extremely sensitive to the presence of vagueness of information due to that some parameters cannot be directly accessed using sensors. In this paper, we propose a new design methodology for estimating simultaneously the model and the discharge capacity of a Nickel–Metal Hydride (Ni–MH) battery. A modified fuzzy c-regression model algorithm is used to construct a prediction model for a small Ni–MH battery pack. Then, the model, so developed, is used to estimate the discharge capacity of the battery and to predict its remaining useful life. The validity of the proposed method is experimentally verified. According to experimental results, the proposed method can achieve satisfactory results with no more than a 2\% error rate for the training and test data sets.},

Recently, remarkable progress has been achieved on matching sequence pairs by deep neural networks. However, most of them focus on learning semantic representations for the contexts of QA pairs while the background information and facts beyond the context are neglected. In this paper, we propose an interactive knowledge-enhanced attention network for answer selection (IKAAS), which interactively learns the sentence representations of query–answer pairs by simultaneously considering the external knowledge from knowledge graphs and textual information of QA pairs. In this way, we can exploit the semantic compositionality of the input sequences and capture more comprehensive knowledge-enriched intra-document features within the question and answer. Specifically, we first propose a context-aware attentive mechanism to learn the knowledge representations guided by the corresponding context. The relations between the question and answer are then captured by computing the question–answer alignment matrix. We further employ self-attention to capture the global features of the input sequences, which are then used to calculate the relevance score of the question and answer. Experimental results on four real-life datasets demonstrate that IKAAS outperforms the compared methods. In addition, a series of analyses shows the robust superiority and the extensive applicability of the proposed method.},

The increasing incidences of birth defects (microcephaly) in newborns due to ZIKV represent a public health problem. The viral infection is characterized by an increase in cell death of human neural progenitors and astrocytes, which can be inhibited by suppressing infection-induced caspase-3 activity. The aim of the present work is to develop classification models for the prediction of highly active and low active caspase-3 antagonists and to seek the important structural features related to the high anti-ZIKV property. Here, machine learning (ML) is applied in quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) study. QSAR study is performed on the dataset by means of ML approaches, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), least square support vector machine (LS-SVM), deep neural net (DNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), naïve Bayes (NB) and random forest (RF). MLR, LDA are used for feature selection process and DNN, LS-SVM, KNN, NB, RF classifier for classification. The obtained results confirmed the discriminative capacity of the calculated descriptors. A good correlation is found by regression analysis between the observed and predicted activities as evident by their R2 (0.895) and R pred 2 (0.716) for the molecular descriptor dataset, R2 (0.892) and R pred 2 (0.736) for fingerprint dataset. The classification model obtained using RF (85.71\%, 97.57\%) and DNN (85.71\%, 91.07\%) classifier gave better accuracy than other approaches in fingerprint dataset and molecular descriptor dataset, respectively. This work provides an effective method to screen caspase-3 antagonists that will help out further in drug design for Zika virus.},

  abstract     = {Construction of robust regression learning models to fit data with noise is an important and challenging problem of data regression. One of the ways to tackle this problem is the selection of a proper loss function showing insensitivity to noise present in the data. Since Huber function has the property that inputs with large deviations of misfit are penalized linearly and small errors are squared, we present novel robust regularized twin support vector machines for data regression based on Huber and ε-insensitive Huber loss functions in this study. The proposed regression models result in solving a pair of strongly convex minimization problems in simple form in primal whose solutions are obtained by functional and Newton–Armijo iterative algorithms. The finite convergence of Newton–Armijo algorithm is proved. Numerical tests are performed on noisy synthetic and benchmark datasets, and their results are compared with few popular regression learning algorithms. The comparative study clearly shows the robustness of the proposed regression methods and further demonstrates their effectiveness and suitability.},

In order to reduce the control cost, an intermittent pinning controller is applied. By using a generalized Halanay-type inequality, a main theorem for ensuring synchronization is established, revealing the interplay between the average of the smallest eigenvalue of certain matrix, node dynamics and the heterogeneous delays. Besides, the largest admissible delay can also be estimated. In specific, some intermittent pinning control strategies are further studied as applications. Unlike existing works on intermittent pinning control, our work removes the common restriction on the control ratio over each single control period, exhibiting good generality and tractability.

  abstract     = {In the unbalanced loading (UL) and phase to ground fault (PGF) cases, zero sequence current (ZC) flows on neutral point of power transformer, and the sheath current (SC) and the sheath voltage (SV) increase due to ZC. Thus, overvoltage (OV) and high harmonic distortion (HD) occur in cable termination (CT). OV causes high and imbalanced electric field, and high HD causes increasing of insulation temperature in CT, so CT faults occur. In the literature, bonding methods are used to prevent SC and SV effects, but these methods are not sufficient to prevent ZC effects, so the modified sectional solid bonding (MSSB) is suggested to prevent ZC effects. The aims of this study are minimizations of SV and HD on CT to prevent CT faults, so MSSB parameters are optimized by optimization method. In optimization algorithms of MSSB, the forecasting methods (FM) and optimization methods (OM) are used to optimize MSSB parameters. The best FM is selected according to training and forecasting errors, and the selected FM is used as an objective function of OM. Training and forecasting errors of hybrid ANN are less than the other methods, so hybrid ANN methods are used as FM. When bonding methods that are in literature are simulated under UL and PGF cases, SV and HD values exceed the limits. When the optimized MSSB method is used, HD and SV do not exceed the limits. Therefore, the optimized MSSB is suggested to prevent CT faults for the unbalanced cases.},

As robots are helping human being in all such cases, robots need to understand human emotion in order to treat human in a more customized manner. Predicting human emotion has been a difficult problem which is being solved over a decade’s time. In this paper, we have built a model which can predict human emotion from an image in real time. The network build is based on convolutional neural network which has reduced parameters by 90× from that of Vanilla CNN and also 50× from the latest state-of-the-art research carried out to the best of our knowledge. The network build is tested robustly on 8 different datasets, namely Fer2013, CK and CK+, Chicago Face Database, JAFFE Dataset, FEI face dataset, IMFDB, TFEID and custom dataset build in our laboratory having different angles, faces, backgrounds and age groups. The network achieves 74\% accuracy which is an improved accuracy from the state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced computation complexity.},

  abstract     = {Automatic defect detection is a challenging task owing to the complex textured background with non-uniform intensity distribution, weak differences between defects and background, diversity of defect types, and high cost of annotated samples. In order to solve these challenges, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end defect classification and segmentation framework based on weakly supervised learning of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention architecture. Firstly, a novel end-to-end CNN architecture integrating the robust classifier and spatial attention module is proposed to enhance defect feature representation ability, which significantly improves the classification accuracy. Secondly, a new spatial attention class activation map (SA-CAM) is proposed to improve segmentation adaptability by generating more accurate heatmap. Moreover, for different surface texture, SA-CAM can significantly suppress the background’s inference and highlight defect area. Finally, the proposed weakly supervised learning framework is trained using only global image labels and devoted to two main visual recognition tasks: defect samples classification and area segmentation. At the same time, it is robust to complex backgrounds. Results of the experiments verify the generalization of the proposed method on three distinct datasets with different kinds of textures and backgrounds. In the classification tasks, the proposed method improves accuracy by 0.66–25.50\%. In the segmentation tasks, the proposed method improves accuracy by 5.49–7.07\%.},

  abstract     = {Extracting dense depth from a single image is an important yet challenging computer vision task. Compared with stereo depth estimation, sensing the depth of a scene from monocular images is much more difficult and ambiguous because the epipolar geometry constraints cannot be exploited. The recent development of deep learning technologies has introduced significant progress in monocular depth estimation. This paper aims to explore the effects of multi-scale structures on the performance of monocular depth estimation and further obtain a more refined 3D reconstruction by using our predicted depth and corresponding uncertainty. First, we explore three multi-scale architectures and compare the qualitative and quantitative results of some state-of-the-art approaches. Second, in order to improve the robustness of the system and provide the reliability of the predicted depth for subsequent 3D reconstruction, we estimate the uncertainty of noisy data by modeling such uncertainty in a new loss function. Last, the predicted depth map and corresponding depth uncertainty are incorporated into a monocular reconstruction system. The experiments of monocular depth estimation are mainly performed on the widely used NYU V2 depth dataset, on which the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. For the 3D reconstruction, the implementation of our proposed framework can reconstruct more smooth and dense models on various scenes.},

  abstract     = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a continuing loss of kidney function, and early detection of this disease is fundamental to halting its progression to end-stage disease. Numerous methods have been proposed to detect CKD, mainly focusing on classification based upon peripheral clinical parameters and quantitative ultrasound parameters that must be manually calculated, or on shear wave elastography. No studies have been found that detect the presence or absence of CKD based solely from one B-mode ultrasound image. In this work, we propose an automated system to detect chronic kidney disease utilizing only the automatic extraction of features from a B-mode ultrasound image of the kidney, with a database of 405 images. Higher-order bispectrum and cumulants, and elongated quinary patterns, are extracted from each image to provide a final total of 24,480 features per image. These features were subjected to a locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA) technique, which provides 30 LSDA coefficients. The coefficients were arranged according to their t value and inserted into various classifiers, to yield the best diagnostic accuracy using the least number of features. The best performance was obtained using a support vector machine and a radial basis function, utilizing only five features, resulting in an accuracy of 99.75\%, a sensitivity of 100\%, and a specificity of 99.57\%. Based upon these findings, it is evident that the technique accurately and automatically identifies subjects with and without CKD from B-mode ultrasound images.},

Our proposed work based on 744 segments of ECG signal is obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database (strongly imbalanced data) for one lead (modified lead II), from 29 people. In this work, we have used long-duration (10 s) ECG signal segments (13 times less classifications/analysis). The spectral power density was estimated based on Welch’s method and discrete Fourier transform to strengthen the characteristic ECG signal features. Our main contribution is the design of a novel three-layer (48 + 4 + 1) deep genetic ensemble of classifiers (DGEC). Developed method is a hybrid which combines the advantages of: (1) ensemble learning, (2) deep learning, and (3) evolutionary computation. Novel system was developed by the fusion of three normalization types, four Hamming window widths, four classifiers types, stratified tenfold cross-validation, genetic feature (frequency components) selection, layered learning, genetic optimization of classifiers parameters, and new genetic layered training (expert votes selection) to connect classifiers. The developed DGEC system achieved a recognition sensitivity of 94.62\% (40 errors/744 classifications), accuracy = 99.37\%, specificity = 99.66\% with classification time of single sample = 0.8736 (s) in detecting 17 arrhythmia ECG classes.

It is highly impossible to identify the more accurate calculations in electricity consumption due to many uncertainties. This paper helps to overcome these uncertainties into probabilities by utilizing probabilistic neural network (PNN). The most complicated, complex and non-defined problems are well tackled by PNN as it is universally accepted as the best alternative technique. The conventional way of programming is not done but it is trained on the basis of behavioral representation of the data using the previous history. Multiple applications have been benefited using this system. Generally, PNN is used to differentiate four kinds of data produced from various grids and simultaneously the data of the grid are classified. 95\% of reliability and accuracy is obtained from calculations produced from PNN as per the data results. The design can be used for appropriate grid development and to classify electricity usage.},

  abstract     = {Human behavior is manly addressed by emotions. One of the most accepted models that represent emotions is known as the circumplex model. This model organizes emotions into points on a bidimensional plane: valence and arousal. Despite the importance of the emotion recognition, there are limited initiatives that seek to classify emotions easily in an uncontrolled environment. In this work, we present the architecture and the design of an extensible software which allows recognizing and classifying emotions by using a low-cost EEG. The proposed software implements an emotion classifier although a support vector machines (SVM) are boosted with an autonomous bio-inspired approach. The contribution was experimentally evaluated by taking a set of well-known validated EEG Databases for Emotion Recognition. Computational experiments show promising results. Using our proposal for EEG emotion classification, we reach an accuracy close to 95\%. The results obtained confirm that our approach is able to overcome to a commonly used SVM classifier and that the proposed software can be useful in real environments.},

  abstract     = {Neuromuscular disorder is a complex progressive health problem which results in muscle weakness and fatigue. In recent years, with emergence and development of machine learning- and sequencing-driven technologies, the prediction of neuromuscular disorders could be made on the basis of gene expression for accurate diagnosis of disease. The intent is to correctly distinguish the patients affected from neuromuscular disorder from the healthy one with the help of various classification methods used in machine learning. In this paper, we proposed a novel feature selection method which applies deep learning method for grouping the outputs generated through various classifiers. The feature selection is performed on the basis of integrated Bhattacharya coefficient and genetic algorithm (GA) where fitness is computed on the basis of ensemble outputs of various classifiers which is performed using deep learning methods. The Bhattacharya coefficient computed the most effective gene subset; then, the most discriminative gene subset will be formulated using GA. The proposed integrated deep learning multi-model ensemble method was applied on two commercially available neuromuscular disorder datasets. The obtained results encouraged that the proposed integrated approach enhances the prediction accuracy of neuromuscular disorders as compared with different datasets and other classifier algorithms. The proposed deep learning-driven ensemble method provides more accurate and effective results for neuromuscular disorder prediction and classification with the help of distinguished classifiers.},

  abstract     = {Lung cancer accounts for more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide, and it corresponded to 26\% of all deaths due to cancer in 2017. However, lung computer-aided diagnosis systems developed to identify lung cancer at early stages are increasing survival rates. This study explores the performance of deep transfer learning from non-medical images on lung nodule malignancy classification tasks in order to improve such systems. Initially, the 1018 chest computed tomography (CT) examinations and medical annotations from the LIDC/IDRI were processed. Then, several convolutional neural networks (VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, Xception, InceptionV3, ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, NASNetMobile and NASNetLarge) were built, trained on the ImageNet dataset, converted into feature extractors and applied on the LIDC/IDRI nodule images. Following this, each set of deep features was submitted to 10-fold cross-validations with naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors KNN and random forest classifiers. Finally, the evaluation metrics accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), true positive rate (TPR), precision (PPV) and F1-score of each cross-validation average result were computed and compared. The results showed that the deep feature extractor based on the ResNet50 and the SVM RBF classifier, achieved an AUC metric of 93.1\% (the highest value not only among the evaluated combinations, but also among the related works in the literature evaluated), a TPR of 85.38\%, an ACC of 88.41\%, a PPV of 73.48\% and an F1-score of 78.83\%. Based on these results, deep transfer learning proves to be a relevant strategy to extract representative features from lung nodule CT images.},

  abstract     = {For intelligent medical systems, clinical information security is one of critical requirements. Recently, random binary sequences (RBSs) based on interpulse intervals (IPIs) were applied as secret keys to secure medical information in medical applications. Most of the existing RBS generation methods acquire a uniform quantity of bits per IPI, thereby requiring more processing time. However, the functional capacity of humans influences their heart rate variability, thereby resulting in the extraction of adaptive entropic bits per IPI across individuals. Therefore, adaptive computing-based RBS generation method is proposed to extract a variable number of bits on the basis of the heart rate (HR) bands of individuals to provide a balance between processing time and security in WBSNs. The proposed method is evaluated by using ECG recordings of 126 subjects with dynamic scenarios. Our experimental results that 128-bit RBSs generated by applying the proposed method can be used as secret keys for entity identifiers or patient’s data encryption for securing intelligent medical applications. In this study, the hamming distance metric is used to measure the uniqueness of the generated RBSs, and randomness of RBSs is computed by means of statistical tests, for different HR bands. Furthermore, the processing time of the proposed method for RBS generation shows improvement compared with the conventional techniques. The proposed approach is approximately three times faster for 55 ≤ HR &lt; 80 and approximately two times faster for 80 ≤ HR &lt; 105 and 80 ≤ HR &lt; 105 than the existing IPI-based RBS generation techniques. Therefore, this study has got real-time significance for smart healthcare applications.},

Decision-makers need support models for professionals’ selective processes when structuring teams, including multiple criteria. This study proposes a novel decision-making support model structured in methods of “verbal decision analysis (VDA)” and “measuring attractiveness by a category-based evaluation technique (MACBETH)” to solve a conflicted dilemma, seeking to assist this process. The model was tested to analyze the desired factors in professionals’ selection process for the composition of geographically distributed teams responsible for developing and implementing IT projects. For the input values, the study used personal and professional qualitative factors, such as interpersonal skills, psychological health, physiological, cultural and intellectual indicators. When tested, the model solved the dilemma through alternatives categorization and prioritization. The test run showed inconsistency’s absence, which would not happen if the methods (VDA and MACBETH) were run individually. The model was executed successfully and had low consumption time and accurate results. Psychological and physiological factors appear to be more defining to the decision making than intellectual level and technical qualifications.

Regardless of their function, smart devices communicate with other devices, monitor, and control everything in the physical world. In this way, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been gaining ramifications. The one that is growing most in the area of health, and that is becoming more and more popular, is IoHT. Several treatments have been employed around the world based around IoHT, including one for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is one of four existing neuromotor diseases without a cure to date. With the progression of the disease, patients lose the strength of the body’s voluntary muscles until total paralysis. Other consequences of the progression of the disease are the loss of autonomy in some aspects of life in addition to the loss of self-esteem. This work aims to develop a BCI system based on IoHT using a personal digital assistant brainwave sensor to assist patients with ALS in performing predefined tasks. To validate this tool as a complement to traditional medical treatment, ten volunteers conducted tests on the proposed solution. Results were very promising.},

  abstract     = {In the field of biometrics, ear recognition is a niche idea of recognition for human authentication, which has several merits compared to the other biometric recognitions like face and finger print. The contour of an ear is distinctive for each person, which is the main reason for choosing this recognition technique. Only in very few studies, the ear recognition algorithms were presented. There still remains a large space for research in the field of ear biometrics. All recent papers have implemented ear recognition algorithms using 2-D ear images. The ear recognition algorithms should be efficient in order to provide accurate results, owing to issues like multiple poses and directional related. This paper proposes a novel method for segmentation based on adaptive approach Runge–Kutta (AARK) to recognize ear images. AARK threshold segmentation technique is used for finding the threshold value to determine the region to be segmented. The utilization of AARK’s numerical methods in computing the threshold value for ear recognition process improves the result accuracy. Firstly, preprocessing has been carried out for the dataset. The following steps are carried out sequentially: ring projection, information normalization, morphological operation, AARK segmentation, feature extraction of DWT and finally ANFIS classifier are used. Among the various steps mentioned, ring projection converts the two dimensions into single dimensions. The self-adaptive discrete wavelet transform is used to extract features from the segmented region. Then the ANFIS classifier is used to recognize the ear region from the image by taking the features form the test image and the training images. The proposed method obtained 72\% improvement in PSNR and accuracy is improved to 63.3\%. Moreover, the speed and space occupation of the self-adaptive DWT technique and the conventional DWT technique are measured by implementing the methods in FPGA Spartan 6 device. Comparing with the implementation of conventional DWT, the area is reduced to 361 from 7021 while implementing the proposed self-adaptive DWT method.},

This paper investigated the security of medical images in IoT by utilizing an innovative cryptographic model with optimization strategies. For the most part, the patient data are stored as a cloud server in the hospital due to which the security is vital. So another framework is required for the secure transmission and effective storage of medical images interleaved with patient information. For increasing the security level of encryption and decryption process, the optimal key will be chosen using hybrid swarm optimization, i.e., grasshopper optimization and particle swarm optimization in elliptic curve cryptography. In view of this method, the medical images are secured in IoT framework. From this execution, the results are compared and contrasted, whereas a diverse encryption algorithm with its optimization methods from the literature is identified with the most extreme peak signal-to-noise ratio values, i.e., 59.45 dB and structural similarity index as 1.},

Side effects are one of the top reasons for failure of a drug to enter the market. There are lots of drugs for a disease. A drug is said to be best, if it cures the disease completely and results in minimal side effects. In this paper we first identify the correct disease for a patient based on symptoms. The symptoms may be both direct physical symptoms and temporal symptoms (which are responsible for a disease only for a time period). Then, we address the problem of recommending the best drug which makes the side effects as minimum as possible. We propose some optimization that reduces time complexity for the recommendation model.

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a name for a group of neurodevelopmental conditions that are characterized by some degree of impairment in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and difficulty in symbolic capacity and repetitive behaviors. The only protocol followed currently for ASD diagnosis is the qualitative behavioral assessment by experts through internationally established descriptive scaling standards. The assessment can, therefore, be affected by the degree of the evaluator experience as well as by the level of the descriptive standard robustness. This paper presents an EEG-based quantitative approach intended for automatic discrimination between children with typical neurodevelopment and children with ASD. The suggested work relies on second-order difference plot (SODP) area as a discriminative feature: First, every EEG channel in a 64 electrode cap—for every volunteer—is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Next, the second-order difference plot for the first ten intrinsic mode functions—of every channel—is sketched. Third, the value of the elliptical area —for every plot—is calculated. The 95\% confidence ellipse area is used as the discriminative feature. Fourth, paired t-student test is applied to the vectors consisting of discriminative feature values for counterpart channels/IMFs (e.g., channel FPz/IMF7 in autistic and neurotypical) for all volunteers. Finally, principal component analysis (PCA) and neural network (NN) are applied to the SODP area feature matrix for two-class classification (ASD and neurotypical). Moreover, the 3D mapping of EEG SODP area values was implemented and analyzed. The obtained results show that the conducted t-student tests yield values of less than 0.05, and that the NN two-class classification based on SODP features leads to a 94.4\% accuracy, which indicates significant differences between SODP area values of children with neurotypical development and those diagnosed with ASD. The obtained results have also been emphasized by the analysis of the findings of the performed 3D mapping.},

  abstract     = {The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 300 million people have asthma and that this disease causes about 250 thousand deaths per year worldwide. The number of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased by 30\% in 2015, and this disease will, according to WHO, be the third major cause of death worldwide in 2030. The identification of diseases using medical image processing techniques is in high demand to assist medical doctors to make more accurate diagnoses. However, although these techniques contribute in making medical diagnoses, most of them still need to have some parameters set and this can be a difficult and tedious process. In this paper, a new automatic approach to identify and classify lung diseases from a structural co-occurrence matrix (SCM) in chest computed tomography images is proposed. The most important novelty of this approach is that only the image is used as the input data and extract the structural information of the disease which, in this case, is related to the lower frequencies. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique, it was compared with other well-known state-of-art feature extractors. In addition, the SCM was evaluated with four filters (Gaussian, Fourier, Laplace and Sobel) using linear discriminant analysis, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machines and minimal learning machine classifiers. The results showed that the SCM, when using low frequencies, is able to adapt to different images and extract the most significant structural data, without the need of any additional parameters, yet maintaining the diagnostic precision.},

  abstract     = {For the purpose of usability feature extraction and prediction, an innovative metaheuristic algorithm is introduced. Generally, the term “usability” is defined by the several researchers with respect to the hierarchical-based software usability model and it has become one of the important methods in terms of software quality. In hierarchically based software, its usability factors, attributes, and its characteristics are combined. The paper presented an algorithm, i.e., modified crow search algorithm (MCSA) mainly for extraction of usability features from hierarchical model with the optimal solution under the search for useful features. MCSA is an extension of original crow search algorithm (CSA), which is a naturally inspired algorithm. The mechanism of this algorithm is based on the process of hiding food and prevents theft and hence introduced this CSA in the field of software engineering practices as an inspiration. The algorithm generates a particular number of selected features/attributes and is applied on software development life cycles models, finding out the best among them. The results of the presented algorithm are compared with the standard binary bat algorithm (BBA), original CSA, and modified whale optimization algorithm (MWOA). The outcomes conclude that the proposed MCSA performs well than the standard BBA and original CSA as the proposed algorithms generate fewer number of feature selection equal to 17 than 18 in BBA, 23 in CSA, and 19 in MWOA.},

  abstract     = {Cloud manufacturing as an emerging service-oriented manufacturing paradigm integrates and manages geographically distributed manufacturing resources such that complex and highly customized manufacturing tasks can be performed cooperatively. The service composition and optimal selection (SCOS) problem, in which manufacturing cloud services are optimally selected for performing subtasks, is one of the key issues for implementing a cloud manufacturing system. In this paper, we propose a new mixed-integer programming model for solving the SCOS problem with sequential composition structure. Unlike the majority of previous research on the problem, in the proposed model, the transportation between distributed resources and its effects on quality of services are considered. Although a wide variety of metaheuristics have been tailored for solving the SCOS problem, no consistent and comprehensive conclusion has been reached so far on the superiority of a specific algorithm. Therefore, for the first time, solution space landscape of the problem was analyzed through several statistical criteria which demonstrated that the landscape is rugged and local optima are clustered in a small region of the search space. Therefore, to find good solutions, a metaheuristic algorithm needs to perform both proper exploitation and exploration of the search space. According to the landscape analysis, the basic imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) was hybridized with a local search (LS) algorithm resulting in the hybrid ICA (HICA). To examine the performance of the proposed HICA, an example of online motorcycle production in the USA as well as four randomly generated large-scale instances, were solved through the LS, ICA, and HICA. Computational results showed that transportation consideration is indispensable for obtaining more realistic solutions in cloud manufacturing. The results also revealed that the HICA outperformed the LS and basic ICA in terms of the value of cost objective function, the stability of solutions and convergence speed. Hence, not only statistically but also analytically, it was proved that algorithms incorporating both exploitation and exploration are able to solve the SCOS problem more efficiently.},

  abstract     = {The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, a Siamese-twin random projection neural network (ST-RPNN) is proposed for unsupervised binary hashing of images and compared with state-of-the-art techniques. Secondly, a comparison between Hamming-distance-based retrieval and a proposed bagging trees retrieval (BT-retrieval) algorithm operating directly on the PCA features is made with respect to performance, storage and search time. The ST-RPNN is made of two identical random projection neural networks and is trained to produce similar binary codes for similar input image pairs and different binary codes otherwise. The learning process is divided into two steps: a fast sparse neurons selection algorithm followed by an unsupervised bagging trees algorithm to extract the compact required-length code. Moreover, a BT-retrieval algorithm is proposed in this paper as a fast retrieval tool that ranks the database with respect to a query without distance calculations. Furthermore, (BT-PCA) is a novel extension where the BT-retrieval is applied directly on the PCA features with a significantly lower time search than Hamming-distance-based approach. The proposed technique is compared with ten unsupervised image binary hashing techniques on the COREL1K dataset and the CIFAR10 dataset. The proposed technique obtained better precision–recall results than all compared techniques on the COREL1K dataset, and better than eight of them on the CIFAR10 dataset.},

The randomness is estimated by probability, and the fuzziness is evaluated by lambda-mean functions and evaluation weights. By mathematical programming approaches, a solution is derived for the risk-minimizing portfolio optimization problem. Numerical examples are given to compare coherent risk measures.

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel connectionist approach for dynamic analysis of structural problem. In general, dynamic analysis of structures leads to eigenvalue problems. Sometimes these eigenvalue problems may be nonlinear eigenvalue problem, which may be difficult to address by traditional methods. As such, we have proposed here an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method to handle nonlinear eigenvalue problems. A four-layer ANN architecture has been constructed for handling the eigenvalue problems, and detailed ANN procedure has been included for clear understanding. Two example problems of overdamped spring mass system have been addressed to show the efficacy of the proposed method. Further, convergence plots and tables for different eigenvalues have also been included to validate the proposed ANN procedure.},

  abstract     = {Many text classification problems in social networks, and other contexts, are also dynamic problems, where concepts drift through time, and meaningful labels are dynamic. In Twitter-based applications in particular, ensembles are often applied to problems that fit this description, for example sentiment analysis or adapting to drifting circumstances. While it can be straightforward to request different classifiers&#39; input on such ensembles, our goal is to boost dynamic ensembles by combining performance metrics as efficiently as possible. We present a twofold performance-based framework to classify incoming tweets based on recent tweets. On the one hand, individual ensemble classifiers&#39; performance is paramount in defining their contribution to the ensemble. On the other hand, examples are actively selected based on their ability to effectively contribute to the performance in classifying drifting concepts. The main step of the algorithm uses different performance metrics to determine both each classifier strength in the ensemble and each example importance, and hence lifetime, in the learning process. We demonstrate, on a drifted benchmark dataset, that our framework drives the classification performance considerably up for it to make a difference in a variety of applications.},

In this paper, we show that this task could be reformulated as a combinatorial optimization concerning the trace of the signed modularity matrix. Keeping the orthogonal and nonnegative constraints in the relaxation, we propose a multiplicative update rule, named the SMON algorithm, which results in a solution that is a close approximation to the genuine community indication matrix. In addition, the rows of the solution can be referred to as the probabilities of corresponding vertex falling into each community, which can help us to discover the overlapping community structure of the network and identify vertices that reside on the watersheds between different communities. Experimental results on real-life social networks as well as synthetic signed networks verify that our method is effective and superior to the existing approaches.},

Based on this target, this paper proposes two novel convolutional kernels, multiple group reused convolutions (MGRCs) and decomposed point-wise convolutions (DPCs), to improve the efficiency of parameters by removing the parameter’s redundancy. The summation of MGRC and DPC is called high-parameter-efficiency convolutions (HPEC) in this paper, and the relevant CNNs can be called HPE-CNNs. Experimental results showed that, compared with the traditional convolutional kernels, HPEC can greatly decrease the model size without affecting the performance. Additionally, since the HPE-CNNs reduce the redundancy of parameters more thoroughly than the other mobile CNNs, they can address the over-fitting problem more effectively on the challenging datasets with less abundant training information.},

For vectorized sample, by converting the vectorized mode into matrixized mode, MatMHKS relieves the curse of dimensionality and extends the expressive modes of sample. Although MatMHKS has been demonstrated to be effective in the classification performance, it consumes a lot of time to alternately update two weight vectors in each iteration. Moreover, MatMHKS is not suitable in dealing with imbalanced problems. Finally, there does not exist effective analysis of generalization risk for matrixized classifiers. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient matrixized Ho–Kashyap classifier (EMatMHKS), which separately updates the two-sided weight vectors to avoid repeatedly calculating the inverse matrix in MatMHKS, thus significantly improving the training speed. Moreover, by introducing a weight matrix, both balanced and imbalanced situations can be tackled. Finally, PAC-Bayes bound is used to reflect the error upper bound of matrixized and vectorized classifiers. Both balanced and imbalanced data sets are used to validate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed EMatMHKS in the experiment.},

  abstract     = {The efficiency and scalability of plagiarism detection systems have become a major challenge due to the vast amount of available textual data in several languages over the Internet. Plagiarism occurs in different levels of obfuscation, ranging from the exact copy of original materials to text summarization. Consequently, designed algorithms to detect plagiarism should be robust to the diverse languages and different types of obfuscation in plagiarism cases. In this paper, we employ text embedding vectors to compare similarity among documents to detect plagiarism. Word vectors are combined by a simple aggregation function to represent a text document. This representation comprises semantic and syntactic information of the text and leads to efficient text alignment among suspicious and original documents. By comparing representations of sentences in source and suspicious documents, pair sentences with the highest similarity are considered as the candidates or seeds of plagiarism cases. To filter and merge these seeds, a set of parameters, including Jaccard similarity and merging threshold, are tuned by two different approaches: offline tuning and online tuning. The offline method, which is used as the benchmark, regulates a unique set of parameters for all types of plagiarism by several trials on the training corpus. Experiments show improvements in performance by considering obfuscation type during threshold tuning. In this regard, our proposed online approach uses two statistical methods to filter outlier candidates automatically by their scale of obfuscation. By employing the online tuning approach, no distinct training dataset is required to train the system. We applied our proposed method on available datasets in English, Persian and Arabic languages on the text alignment task to evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods from the language perspective as well. As our experimental results confirm, our efficient approach can achieve considerable performance on the different datasets in various languages. Our online threshold tuning approach without any training datasets works as well as, or even in some cases better than, the training-base method.},

  abstract     = {Reliability and safety in the process industries like automotive industry are important key success factors for upgrading availability and preventing catastrophic failures. In this context, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique is a proactive diagnostic tool for evaluating all failure modes which reduces the highest risk priority failures. However, it still suffers from subjective uncertainty and ambiguity which are important factors in risk analysis procedures. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive survey to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional FMEA through improved FMEA, incorporating the fuzzy inference system (FIS) environment. For this purpose, the effective attributes, such as; various scales and rules, various membership functions, different defuzzification algorithms and their impacts on fuzzy RPN (FRPN) have been investigated. Moreover, three types of sensitivity analysis were performed to identify the effect and authority control of risk parameters, i.e., severity, occurrence and detection on FRPN. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, as a practical example, the method was implemented in complex equipment in an automotive production line. The result of FIS-FMEA model revealed that the proposed framework could be useful in recognizing the failure modes with critical risk values compared to the traditional FMEA. Given the potential applications of this approach, suitable maintenance actions can be recommended to improve the reliability and safety of process industry, such as automotive production line.},

  abstract     = {Community questions answering sites receive a huge number of questions and answers everyday. It has been observed that a number of questions among them are marked as closed by the site moderators. Such questions increase overhead of the moderators and also create user dissatisfaction. This paper aims to predict whether a newly posted question would be marked as closed in the future or not and also give a tentative reason of being closed. Two models: (1) a baseline model based on traditional machine learning techniques and (2) deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network are used to classify a question into one of the five classes: (1) open, (2) off-topic, (3) not a real question, (4) too constructive and (5) too localized. The baseline model requires the handcrafted features and hence does not preserve semantics. However, CNN and LSTM networks are capable of preserving the semantics of question’s word and extracting the hidden features from the textual content using multiple hidden layers. The LSTM network performs better compared to CNN and traditional machine learning models. The proposed model can be used as an initial filter to screen the closed question at the time of posting, which reduced the overheads of site moderators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that predicts the closed question along with the reason the question will be closed. This helps the questioner to modify the question before posting. The experimental results with the dataset of Stack Overflow prove the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the control problem for continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems with input nonlinearities and unknown disturbances is addressed. To ensure constraints satisfaction on the input and the output of CSTR, we employ a system transformation technique to transform the original constrained model of CSTR into an equivalent unconstrained model, whose stability is sufficient to achieve the tracking control of the original CSTR system with a priori prescribed performance. To deal with two kinds of input nonlinearities, two neural networks (NNs)-based adaptive controllers are proposed. In the first approach, a robust control term is introduced to overcome the effects of the unknown input dead zone; however, in the second approach, an anti-windup compensator is designed to reduce the influence of the actuator saturation. In the proposed control methods, NNs are employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of CSTR and additional adaptive compensators are introduced to cope with NNs approximation errors and external disturbance. The proposed adaptive neural tracking controllers are designed with only one adaptive parameter by using the second Lyapunov stability method. In comparison with the traditional back-stepping-based techniques, usually used in CSTR control, the structures of the proposed controllers are much simpler with few design parameters since the causes for the problem of complexity growing are completely eliminated. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

In the person ReID, the robust feature representation is a key issue because of inconsistent visual appearances of a person. Also, an exhaustive gallery search is required to find the target image against each probe image. To answer such issues, this manuscript presents a framework named features-based clustering and deep features in person ReID. The proposed framework initially extracts three types of handcrafted features on the input images including shape, color, and texture for feature representation. To acquire optimal features, a feature fusion and selection technique is applied to these handcrafted features. Afterward, to optimize the gallery search, features-based clustering is performed for splitting the whole gallery into $$k$$ consensus clusters. For relationship learning of gallery features and related labels of the chosen clusters, radial basis kernel is employed. Later on, cluster-wise, images are selected and provided to the deep convolution neural network model to obtain deep features. Then, a cluster-wise feature vector is obtained by fusing the deep and handcrafted features. It follows the feature matching process where multi-class support vector machine is applied to choose the related cluster. Finally, to find accurate matching pair from the classified cluster(s) instead of the whole gallery search, a cross-bin histogram-based distance similarity measure is used. The recognition rate at rank 1 is attained as 46.82\%, 48.12\%, and 40.67\% on selected datasets VIPeR, CUHK01, and iLIDS-VID, respectively. It confirms the proposed framework outperforms the existing ReID approaches.},

The fitness functions including line loss minimization and voltage deviation (voltage profile index) are constructed to find the optimal reactive power flow for IEEE 30- and 57-bus test systems. The rich heritage of fractional evolutionary computing through variants of FO-DPSO is applied to minimization problem of optimal power flow by determination of control variables in terms of VAR compensators, bus voltages and transformer tap settings.

Correct selection of these parameters is crucial for an efficient and economical cutting operation. The grooving operation required in many cases is one of the most problematic methods in all metal cutting operations, especially in terms of chip control. This paper covers theoretical analysis and mathematical modeling of deformation and stresses of the grooving tool. Cutting forces affecting the service life of the grooving tool were measured by various cutting experiments. Deformation and stresses of grooving tool caused by cutting forces were analyzed by finite element method using Ansys software. In modeling with artificial neural networks (ANN), grooving insert width, cutting speed, feed rate, radial force and primary cutting force are inputs in the model and deformation and stresses of the grooving tool are outputs. An algorithm, which is a Matlab script file, was developed to determine the optimal combination of neural network parameters such as the normalization method, number of hidden neurons, transfer function and training algorithm. The best-fitting set determined by the algorithm developed for the model was achieved with the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation algorithm, logistic sigmoid transfer function, nine hidden neurons and normalization method with a scaling factor. The MSE, R2, MAPE values of the ANN model are 2.0327 × 10−6, 0.999992 and 0.379227, respectively. Performance results have shown that the proposed approach can also be used for ANN modeling of machining parameters in other cutting operations other than grooving.},

  abstract     = {The objective of description models is to generate image captions to elaborate contents. Despite recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision, generating discriminative captions still remains a challenging problem. Traditional approaches imitate frequent language patterns without considering the semantic alignment of words. In this work, an image captioning framework is proposed that generates topic sensitive descriptions. The model captures the semantic relation and polysemous nature of the words that describe the images and resultantly generates superior descriptions for the target images. The efficacy of the proposed model is indicated by the evaluation on the state-of-the-art captioning datasets. The model shows promising performance compared to the existing description models proposed in the recent literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called grey wolf optimization with neural network algorithm (GNNA), for solving global numerical optimization problems. The core idea of GNNA is to make full use of good global search ability of neural network algorithm (NNA) and fast convergence of grey wolf optimizer (GWO). Moreover, both NNA and GWO are improved to boost their own advantages. For NNA, an improved NNA is given to strengthen the exploration ability of NNA by discarding transfer operator and introducing random modification factor. For GWO, an enhanced GWO is presented, which adjusts the exploration rate based on reinforcement learning principles. Then the improved NNA and the enhanced GWO are hybridized by dynamic population mechanism. A comprehensive set of 23 well-known unconstrained benchmark functions are employed to examine the performance of GNNA compared with 13 metaheuristic algorithms. Such comparisons suggest that the combination of the improved NNA and the enhanced GWO is very effective and GNNA is clearly seen to be more successful in both solution quality and computational efficiency.},

In this paper, an improved deep belief network (DBN) is proposed to predict the bus travel time. By using Gaussian–Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines to construct a DBN, we update the classical DBN to model continuous data. In addition, a back-propagation (BP) neural network is further applied to improve the performance. Based on the real traffic data collected in Shenyang, China, several experiments are conducted to validate the technique. Comparison with typical forecasting methods such as k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RFs) shows that the proposed method is applicable to the prediction of bus travel time and works better than traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Two-stream networks have provided an alternate way of exploiting the spatiotemporal information for action recognition problem. Nevertheless, most of the two-stream variants perform the fusion of homogeneous modalities which cannot efficiently capture the action-motion dynamics from the videos. Moreover, the existing studies cannot extend the streams beyond the number of modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid and hierarchical fusion (HHF) networks. The hybrid fusion handles non-homogeneous modalities and introduces a cross-modal learning stream for effective modeling of motion dynamics while extending the networks from existing two-stream variants to three and six streams. On the other hand, the hierarchical fusion makes the modalities consistent by modeling long-term temporal information along with the combination of multiple streams to improve the recognition performance. The proposed network architecture comprises of three fusion tiers: the hybrid fusion itself, the long-term fusion pooling layer which models the long-term dynamics from RGB and optical flow modalities, and the adaptive weighting scheme for combining the classification scores from several streams. We show that the hybrid fusion has different representations from the base modalities for training the cross-modal learning stream. We have conducted extensive experiments and shown that the proposed six-stream HHF network outperforms the existing two- and four-stream networks, achieving the state-of-the-art recognition performance, 97.2\% and 76.7\% accuracies on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, respectively, which are widely used in action recognition studies.},

  abstract     = {Over recent decades have witnessed considerable progress in whether multi-task learning or multi-view learning, but the situation that considers both learning scenes simultaneously has received not too much attention. How to utilize multiple views’ latent representation of each single task to improve each learning task’s performance is a challenge problem. Based on this, we proposed a novel semi-supervised algorithm, termed as multi-task multi-view learning based on common and special features (MTMVCSF). In general, multi-views are the different aspects of an object and every view includes the underlying common or special information of this object. As a consequence, we will mine multiple views’ jointly latent factor of each learning task, jointly latent factor is consisted of each view’s special feature and the common feature of all views. By this way, the original multi-task multi-view data have degenerated into multi-task data, and exploring the correlations among multiple tasks enables to make an improvement on the performance of learning algorithm. Another obvious advantage of this approach is that we get latent representation of the set of unlabeled instances by the constraint of regression task with labeled instances. In classification and semi-supervised clustering tasks, using implicit representation as input peforms much better than using raw data. Furthermore, an anti-noise multi-task multi-view algorithm called AN-MTMVCSF is proposed, which has a strong adaptability to noise labels. The effectiveness of these algorithms is proved by a series of well-designed experiments on both real-world and synthetic data.},

For this particular case, it is extended to more generally nonlinear singular system. For a class of nonlinear singular system that is bounded impulse-free item and separable impulse item with singularity-induced bifurcation, we proved that it can be approximated by T–S fuzzy singular system with arbitrary accuracy.

  abstract     = {Metaheuristic algorithms have received much attention recently for solving different optimization and engineering problems. Most of these methods were inspired by nature or the behavior of certain swarms, such as birds, ants, bees, or even bats, while others were inspired by a specific social behavior such as colonies, or political ideologies. These algorithms faced an important issue, which is the balancing between the global search (exploration) and local search (exploitation) capabilities. In this research, a novel swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm which depends on the behavior of nomadic people was developed, it is called “Nomadic People Optimizer (NPO)”. The proposed algorithm simulates the nature of these people in their movement and searches for sources of life (such as water or grass for grazing), and how they have lived hundreds of years, continuously migrating to the most comfortable and suitable places to live. The algorithm was primarily designed based on the multi-swarm approach, consisting of several clans and each clan looking for the best place, in other words, for the best solution depending on the position of their leader. The algorithm is validated based on 36 unconstrained benchmark functions. For the comparison purpose, six well-established nature-inspired algorithms are performed for evaluating the robustness of NPO algorithm. The proposed and the benchmark algorithms are tested for large-scale optimization problems which are associated with high-dimensional variability. The attained results demonstrated a remarkable solution for the NPO algorithm. In addition, the achieved results evidenced the potential high convergence, lower iterations, and less time-consuming required for finding the current best solution.},

  abstract     = {The recent price volatility in the energy market highlights the importance of financial hedging and the need of its incorporation into an investor’s set of portfolio strategies. Realizing the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, our study empirically examines the use of machine learning models for hedging price risk associated with the holding of energy-based financial product. From a technical perspective, kernel regression and support vector machine are trained to estimate the time-varying optimal hedge ratio given the observed price movement and other factors. The estimated hedge ratio is then employed to guide the price hedging strategy of the crude oil contracts traded in the commodity exchanges. The two machine approaches’ hedging effectiveness against price risk is also compared with those of the un-hedged portfolio as well as a well-studied econometric time series approach. Our results indicate that the two forms of learning machines substantially outperform time series model and no-hedging over the out-of-sample period but neither machine dominates another across all testing scenarios. Given these mixed results between kernel regression and support vector machine, we propose and develop a kernel-supervised support vector machine to take advantage of the complementary nature of the two machine learning approaches and enhance the supervised learning process through hierarchical/sequential infusion of information. Cross-learning empirical testing shows that the proposed cross-learning machine is more effective in hedging than individual kernel regression and support vector machine. Furthermore, our study evaluates the impact of incorporating the coefficient of absolute risk aversion and the transaction costs to machine learning models. In general, cross-learning machine outperforms others in all tested scenarios.},

Many computational methods have been developed to identify DTIs. However, most of them did not integrate multiple information and filter noise or outlier points. In this paper, we develop a fuzzy bipartite local model (FBLM) based on fuzzy least squares support vector machine and multiple kernel learning (MKL) for predicting DTIs. First, multiple kernels are constructed in drug and target spaces, respectively. Then, all corresponding kernels are combined by MKL algorithm in two spaces. Finally, FBLM is employed to identify DTIs. Our proposed approach is tested on four benchmark datasets under three types of cross validation.

Using the strong arc concept a new parameter, domination integrity is defined and lower and upper bounds are found. This paper discusses the domination integrity for standard graphs such as path, cycle and complete graph. The domination integrity for Cartesian product of fuzzy graphs is also discussed.

  abstract     = {Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell system is usually affected negatively by external disturbance, model uncertainties and unmeasured variables. In this paper, a robust composite adaptive neural network controller using high-gain observer is proposed to achieve stable oxygen excess ratio control for PEM fuel cell air management system. First, the derivatives of system output, which are unavailable due to the limited sensors, are estimated via high-gain observer. Then, a neural network is adopted to estimate the unknown system dynamics and the additional robust term is used to attenuate the compound disturbance including unknown external disturbance and neural network approximation error. Finally, a composite adaptive updating laws are constructed by utilizing estimated tracking error and modeling error to improve the tracking performance. In contrast to the existing controllers applied in PEM fuel cell air management system, this controller has a better control performance in the practical application. By means of Lyapunov stability analysis, it is theoretically proved that the system tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed controller are validated by hardware-in-loop experiment.},

The GMU learns to decide how modalities influence the activation of the unit using multiplicative gates. The GMU can be used as a building block for different kinds of neural networks and can be seen as a form of intermediate fusion. The model was evaluated on two multimodal learning tasks in conjunction with fully connected and convolutional neural networks.

Some numerical examples are used to validate this stance. In order to remedy this shortcoming, Zhang and Xu’s distance measure for PFSs is normalised/modified to cater for the limitation by employing the technique used to normalise both Hamming and Euclidean distances between intuitionistic fuzzy sets by Szmidt and Kacprzyk. The modified Zhang and Xu’s distance measure for PFSs satisfies the conditions of the axiomatic definition of distance measure for PFSs; hence, it is an appropriate/reliable distance measure for PFSs.

The proposed meta-heuristic method is the quasi-oppositional chaotic symbiotic organisms search (QOCSOS) algorithm, which is the improved version of the original SOS algorithm. QOCSOS integrates two search strategies including quasi-opposition-based learning and chaotic local search into SOS to achieve better performance. In this study, QOCSOS was implemented to find the optimal number, location, size, and power factor of DG units considering different values of DG power factor (unity and non-unity), with the objective of maximum real power loss reduction. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on the standard IEEE radial distribution networks including 33, 69, and 118-bus test networks. The results obtained by QOCSOS were compared to those from other methods available in the literature and the standard SOS algorithm. Comparative results revealed that QOCSOS obtained better solutions than other compared methods, and performed greater than SOS. Accordingly, QOCSOS can be a very favourable method to cope with the optimal DG placement problem.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain information about the brain activity that can be used to identify areas affected by seizures. For this, however, neurologists have the challenging task to analyze the EEG signal to imply where the source of epilepsy is located. A novel approach to detect regions of focal epilepsy is proposed in this paper. By using an adaptive mixture of independent component analysis as a decomposition algorithm and information about the position of the measuring electrodes, EEG signals are transformed into two-dimensional brain maps that are further altered by a symmetric-weighted scale-invariant local ternary pattern technique. Features from this altered brain map are used as input in a three-layered artificial neural network for classification between epileptic and artifact brain maps. The brain maps classified as artifact are eliminated, and the epileptic components are given as output for doctors to investigate the regions of the brain affected by focal epilepsy. With the proposed methodology, an accuracy of 99.53\% to detect epileptic components in EEG signals is reached.},

  abstract     = {Human motion capture (mocap) data, recording the movement from markers attached to specific joints, has gradually become the most popular solution of animation production. However, the raw motion data are often corrupted due to joint occlusion, marker shedding, and the lack of equipment precision, which severely limits the performance in real-world applications. Since human motion is essentially sequential data, the latest methods resort to variants of long short-time memory network (LSTM) to solve related problems, but most of them tend to obtain visually unreasonable results. This is mainly because these methods hardly capture long-term dependencies and cannot explicitly utilize relevant context. To address these issues, we propose a deep bidirectional attention network which can not only capture the long-term dependencies but also adaptively extract relevant information at each time step. Moreover, the proposed model, embedded attention mechanism in the bidirectional LSTM structure at the encoding and decoding stages, can decide where to borrow information and use it to recover the corrupted frame effectively. Extensive experiments on CMU database demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of recovery accuracy and visualization.},

A word matrix and a document matrix are generated by stacking the information of these subwindows. Our document matrix not only contains more fine-grained semantic and syntactic information than the original representation but also introduces abundant two-dimensional features. Experiments conducted on four document-level classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture can generate higher-quality word and document representations and outperform previous models based on linear operations. We can see that compared to different classifiers, a convolutional-based classifier is more suitable for our document matrix.

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid growth of the number of passengers over the few recent decades, air traffic forecasting has become a crucial tool for digital transportation systems, playing a fundamental role in the planning and development of traffic management and control systems. The main goal of forecasting in air transport is to predict traffic conditions in a network, on the basis of its past behavior, in order to improve safety and reduce airspace congestion. Nevertheless, air traffic time series often present an intricate behavior because of their irregular trends and strong seasonalities. In this paper, the methodology based on time series decomposition and artificial neural networks (ANNs) is thus reviewed and reconsidered within this framework of air traffic management. In this respect, a hybrid approach coupling feedforward neural networks with a nonlinear least squares-based regression curve fitting is developed for the multistep-ahead prediction. Empirical experiments are conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on passenger traffic real datasets. The results show that, despite its simplicity, the base model is capable of generating accurate forecasts, with a performance comparable with that of powerful state-of-the-art forecasting models. In addition, there is evidence that trend pretreatment (wholly or partially) would rather degrade the forecasting accuracy.},

In the current scenario, various methods exist to handle the missing values as it’s an important task to discover meaningful information. However, the most frequently used method to handle the missing values in a large dataset is discarding the instances with missing values. In such situation, deletion of instances with missing values causes loss of crucial information, which affects the performance of algorithms. Hence, an intelligent method needs to handle the missing values. In the recent past, the fuzzy and rough set has been widely employed in many applications. In this research work, a Novel Fuzzy C-Means Rough Parameter-based missing value imputation method is proposed with the hybridization of the fuzzy and rough set to handle missing values. The proposed algorithm is capable of handling the situation of uncertainty and vagueness in datasets through rough and fuzzy sets while maintaining vital information. The experimentation has been carried out on three benchmark datasets such as the Dukes’ B colon cancer dataset, the Mice Protein Expression and Yeast datasets to asses the efficacy of the proposed method. It is observed that the proposed method produces improved results than Fuzzy C-Means Centroid-based missing value imputation and Fuzzy C-Means Parameter-based missing value imputation method.},

It seems that different topologies make PSO a problem-related algorithm, while in this paper a problem-free PSO which integrates a reinforcement learning method has been proposed, referred to as QLPSO. In the new proposed algorithm, each particle acts as an agent independently, selecting the optimal topology under the control of Q-learning (QL) during each iteration. Two variants of QLPSO consider the different dimensions of the communication topology, respectively. In order to investigate the performance of QLPSO, experiments on 28 CEC 2013 benchmark functions are carried out when comparing with static and dynamic topologies. The reported computational results show that the proposed QLPSO is more superior compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {For the original generative adversarial networks (GANs) model, there are three problems that (1) the generator is not robust to the input random noise; (2) the discriminating ability of discriminator gradually reduces in the later stage of training; and (3) it is difficult to reach at the theoretical Nash equilibrium point in the process of training. To solve the above problems, in this paper, a GANs model with denoising penalty and sample augmentation is proposed. In this model, a denoising constraint is firstly designed as the penalty term of the generator, which minimizes the F-norm between the input noise and the encoding of the image generated by the corresponding perturbed noise, respectively. The generator is forced to learn more robust invariant characteristics. Secondly, we put forward a sample augmentation discriminator to improve the ability of discriminator, which is trained by mixing the generated and real images as training samples. Thirdly, in order to achieve the theoretical optimization as far as possible, our model combines denoising penalty and sample augmentation discriminator. Then, denoising penalty and sample augmentation discriminator are applied to five different GANs models whose loss functions include the original GANs, Hinge and least squares loss. Finally, experimental results on the LSUN and CelebA datasets show that our proposed method can help the baseline models improve the quality of generated images.},

  abstract     = {The exclusive-or (XOR) classification task still represents a challenge in the study of cognition since the precise neural circuit sustaining the general ability to learn nonlinear problems remains to be discovered in natural organisms. As such, this paper focuses on a neurorobotic application embedding a specific spiking neural network built to solve these types of tasks. This experiment proposes a 2-bit task (XOR) with visual compound binary images acting as inputs and a left/right action for the output. The robot learns to solve it in both virtual and real environments from an operant conditioning procedure. Furthermore, the robot also adapts its behavior from learning all other simpler associative rules, even when switching them at runtime. Finally, this study explores the impact on the neural architecture, when passing from a 2-bit to a 3-bit task.},

A comprehensive study and an analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithms under consideration has been presented. Adaptive strategy is well-established as an efficient and reliable tool for multidimensional integration of integrands functions with computational peculiarities like peaks. The presented adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm gives reliable results in computing the Wigner kernel by a stochastic approach that has significantly lower computational complexity than the existing deterministic approaches.},

This word recognition module comprises of different modules: preprocessing of the word samples, segmentation of words into basic strokes, recognizing the basic strokes using multilayer perceptron, followed by recognition of words using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) aided by Language Model (LM). For stroke recognition, two different feature extraction techniques (point-based and curvature-based procedures) are used using late fusion technique. Top 5 stroke recognition choices are used to construct HMM for the prediction of word sample. An N-gram LM is applied as a post-processing step to rectify the HMM outcomes if required. A total of 50 different word samples with 110 instances each are used to evaluate the proposed model. The overall stroke-level and word-level recognition accuracies obtained by this model are 95.4\% and 90.3\%, respectively. The proposed model can be extended to recognize online handwritten words written in other script like Devanagari, Assamese, and Gurumukhi, etc. The methodologies described in the manuscript can also be applied for offline word recognition purpose.},

  abstract     = {As a main strategy of backfilling in mining operations, cemented rockfill (CRF) is extensively used because of its high strength and mine waste disposal convenience. The CRF strength has a direct bearing on ground support performance in backfill mining, which necessitates investigating CRF strength determination. This study employed a Gaussian process (GP) machine learning model to reflect the relationship between CRF compressive strength and material components as well as curing age. More than one thousand data from a public database were used to train the GP model with an automatic hyperparameter optimization. A series of laboratory tests prepared eight test samples for our predicting as well as the true values for model validation. The GP model achieved a predicting accuracy with the r2 value 0.90 and the MSE value 7.78 based on CRF true values we obtained in the laboratory. In addition, seven test samples’ true values resided inside the 95\% confidence interval of the GP prediction. We also constructed three other machine learning models to conduct the same work as the GP model did. The results showed that the GP model performed the best of four models, which demonstrated that the GP model was effective and robust in dealing with time series predicting task.},

  abstract     = {Perineural invasion (PNI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and tumor angiogenesis have strong correlation with cancer recurrence, metastasis and poor patient survival. The accurate segmentations of nerves and microvessels can be considered as the preliminary step in objective identification of PNI, LVI and tumor angiogenic analysis in histology images. We proposed a deep network for simultaneous segmentation of microvessel and nerves in routinely used H&amp;E-stained histology images. The network is designed as an encoder–decoder architecture with embedded feature attention blocks and an uncertainty prediction. The proposed network uses Xception residual blocks, followed by atrous spatial pyramid pooling for feature extraction at multiple scales. Feature attention blocks are used in the skip connections from encoder to decoder as well as in the decoder up-sampling, which enables the network in focusing on more salient features while making prediction for segmentation. The method is evaluated using 7780 images of size 512 × 512 pixels, extracted from 20 WSIs of oral squamous cell carcinoma tissue at 20× magnification. The ensemble of network outputs at test time is used to obtain a better segmentation result and simultaneous generation of network prediction uncertainty map. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results compared to currently used deep neural networks for semantic segmentation (FCN-8, U-Net, Segnet and DeepLabV3+). The proposed network also gives robust segmentation performance when applied to the full digital whole slide image.},

The aim of this study is to design an improved FOA, namely evolution FOA (EFOA), which can overcome some shortcomings of basic FOA, including difficulty in local optimization, slow convergence speed, and lack of robustness. EFOA applies a few new strategies which adaptively control the search steps and swarm numbers of the fruit flies. The evolution mechanism used in EFOA can preserve dominant swarms and remove inferior swarms. Comprehensive comparison experiments are performed to compare EFOA with other swarm intelligence algorithms through 14 benchmark functions and a constrained engineering problem. Experimental results suggest that EFOA performs well both in global search ability and in robustness, and it can improve convergence speed.},

This paper introduces the ramp functions into plane-based clustering and proposes a ramp-based twin support vector clustering (RampTWSVC). RampTWSVC is very robust to the samples far from the cluster center, because its within-cluster and between-cluster scatters are measured by the bounded ramp functions. Thus, it is easier to find the intrinsic clusters than other plane-based clustering methods. The nonconvex programming problem in RampTWSVC is solved efficiently through an alternating iteration algorithm, and its local solution can be obtained in a finite number of iterations theoretically. In addition, its nonlinear manifold clustering formation is also proposed via a kernel trick. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show the better performance of our RampTWSVC compared with other plane-based clustering methods.},

The objective of this paper is to compare the achievement of fuzzy sets with that of artificial neural network-based decision trees on credit scoring to predict the recovered value using a sample of 1890 borrowers. Comparing with fuzzy logic, the decision analytic approach can more easily present the outcomes of the analysis. On the other hand, fuzzy logic makes some implicit assumptions that may make it even harder for credit-grantors to follow the logical decision-making process. This paper leads an initial study of collateral as a variable in the calculation of the credit scoring. The study concludes that the two models make modelling of uncertainty in the credit scoring process possible. Although more difficult to implement, fuzzy logic is more accurate for modelling the uncertainty. However, the decision tree model is more favourable to the presentation of the problem.},

Thereby, they can be used to model prediction of time series data, since time series values are also a sequence of discrete time data. However, due to various existing RNN architectures, their functioning modes, the growth of hyper parameters and some other bottlenecks arise when it comes to train them. Thus, it becomes perplex to find out the most suited model for a given task. To address these matters, we propose a step-wise approach to predict the time series data, especially net asset value in this paper. We have started the study with the memory size of RNN to set the optimal memory size based on the prediction accuracy. Then, the study follows by analyzing existing data preparation methods and proposing a new one. The proposed data preparation methods prove their effectiveness in both stateless and stateful mode with single RNN layer. Finally, we confront the single RNN layer to stacked and bidirectional RNN to sort out the best performing models based on their prediction accuracy in various time horizons.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing plays a major role in reducing the expenditure of infrastructural costs on the basis of pay per use model. Security is the major concern wherein detection of security attacks and crimes is very difficult. Due to the distributed nature of attacks and crimes in the cloud, there is a need for an efficient security mechanism. Traditional security mechanisms cannot be applied directly to identify the source of attack due to the dynamic changes in the cloud. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) flooding attacks are identified by keeping track of all the activities of the virtual machine instances running in the cloud. It is hard to identify the source of an attack since an attacker deletes all the possible traces. So, in order to mitigate this issue, the proposed method reads the logs, extracts the relevant features and investigates HTTP flooding attacks by a grouping of similar input patterns using fuzzy bat clustering and determines the anomalous behavior using deviated anomalous score. The suspicious source is determined by finding the event correlation between the virtual machine instance issued by cloud service provider with the suspicious source list. The experimental results are compared with the existing approaches, viz., k-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering, bat clustering and Bartd method in which the proposed method determines the anomalies accurately with very few false alarm than existing approaches.},

The research results show that the interactive, simulated natural-state and three-dimensional environment can be formed at the display terminal through the processing and operation of information by computer program, which can make people feel immersed. It can be seen that in the environment of Internet of Things, the research on virtual reality technology should not only lay out top-level design and improve security and transmission efficiency, but also promote industrial application and enhance user stickiness. It would help to reveal the development trend of technology and the industrial layout and help relevant subjects to improve their level of technology R&amp;D (research and development) and formulate competitive offensive and defensive strategies.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modality matching refers to the problem of comparing similarity/dissimilarity of a pair of data points of different modalities, such as an image and a text. Deep neural networks have been popular to represent data points of different modalities due to their ability to extract effective features. However, existing works use simple distance metrics to compare the deep features of multiple modalities, which do not fit the nature of cross-modality matching, because it imposes the features of different modalities to be of the same dimension and do not allow cross-feature matching. To solve this problem, we propose to use convolutional neural network (CNN) models with soft-max activation layer to represent a pair of different-modality data points to two histograms (not necessarily of the same dimensions) and compare their dissimilarity by using earth mover’s distance (EMD). The EMD can match the features extracted by the two CNN models of different modalities freely. Moreover, we develop a joint learning framework to learn the CNN parameters specifically for the EMD-driven comparison, supervised by the relevance/irrelevance labels of the data pairs of different modalities. The experiments over applications such as image–text retrieval, and malware detection show its advantage over existing cross-modality matching methods.},

The proposed INN can greatly reduce the dimension of sparse data via the weight-interaction layer, while the multi-layer neural network can be used to capture high-order feature latent patterns.

  abstract     = {Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is an efficient biological-inspired optimization method, which mimics the foraging behavior of honey bees to solve the complex and nonlinear optimization problems. However, in some cases, it suffers from inefficient exploration, low exploitation and slow convergence rate. These shortcomings cause the problem of stagnation at local optimum which is dangerous in determining the true solution (optima) of the problem. Therefore, in the present paper, an attempt has been made toward the removal of the drawbacks from the classical ABC by proposing a novel hybrid method called SCABC algorithm. The SCABC algorithm hybridizes the ABC with sine cosine algorithm (SCA) to upgrade the level of exploitation and exploration in the classical ABC algorithm. The SCA is a recently introduced algorithm, which uses the trigonometric functions sine and cosine to perform the search. The validation of the SCABC algorithm is performed on a well-known benchmark set of 23 optimization problems. The various analysis metrics such as statistical, convergence and performance index analysis verify the better search ability of the SCABC as compared to classical ABC, SCA. The comparison with some other optimization algorithms demonstrates a comparatively better state of exploitation and exploration in the SCABC algorithm. Moreover, the SCABC is also employed on multilevel thresholding problems. The various performance measures demonstrate the efficacy of the SCABC algorithm in determining the optimal thresholds of gray images.},

Four parameters, namely proportion of polyester–silver nanocomposite fibres in yarn, yarn count (diameter), machine gauge and type of fabric (100\% polyester or 50:50 polyester–cotton), were used as input parameters for predicting antibacterial activity of knitted fabrics. For each of the input parameters, two fuzzy sets (low and high) were considered to reduce the complexity of ANFIS model. The sixteen linguistic fuzzy rules trained by ANFIS were able to explain the relationship between input parameters and antibacterial activity. A comparison between ANN and ANFIS models has also been presented. Both the models predicted the antibacterial activity of knitted fabrics with very good prediction accuracy in the training and testing data sets with coefficient of determination greater than 0.92 and mean absolute prediction error less than 5\%. The robustness of the prediction results against data partitioning between training and testing sets has also been investigated. It is found that prediction accuracy of both the models was quite robust with ANFIS showing better performance with lesser number of training data.},

In particular, being aware of which factors or rules drive repeat purchases is as significant as knowing the outcomes of predictions in the business field. Therefore, an interpretable model with excellent prediction performance is required. Many classifiers, such as the multilayer perceptron, have exceptional predictive abilities but lack model interpretability. Tree-based models possess interpretability; however, their predictive performances usually cannot achieve high levels. Based on these observations, we design an approach to balance the predictive and interpretable performance of a decision tree with model distillation and heterogeneous classifier fusion. Specifically, we first train multiple heterogeneous classifiers and integrate them through diverse combination operators. Then, classifier combination plays the role of teacher model. Subsequently, soft targets are obtained from the teacher and guide training of the decision tree. A real-world repeat buyer prediction dataset is utilized in this paper, and we adopt features with respect to three aspects: users, merchants, and user–merchant pairs. Our experimental results show that the accuracy and AUC of the decision tree are both improved, and we provide model interpretations of three aspects.},

Moreover, the incorrect classification can easily come into being when the training samples from the different classes are very similar. To address the issues, we propose a novel discriminative collaborative representation-based classification (DCRC) method via $$l_2$$ regularizations to enhance the power of pattern discrimination. In the proposed model, we consider not only the discriminative decorrelations among all the classes, but also the similarities between the reconstructed representation of all the classes and the class-specific reconstructed representations in the $$l_2$$ regularizations. The experiments on several public face databases have demonstrated that the proposed DCRC effectively and robustly outperforms the state-of-the-art representation-based classification methods.},

In this paper, a new motion segmentation technique is proposed based on spatio-temporal background–foreground bimodal. The temporal background information is modeled using a weighted sigma–delta estimation, cumulative frame differencing is used to model the foreground pixels, and the spatial correlation between neighboring pixels is utilized to combine both background and foreground models. The median of consecutive frame difference adapts sudden illumination variation, update background model, and reinitialize foreground model. Comparative experimental results for typical urban traffic sequences show that the proposed technique achieves robust and accurate segmentation, which improves adaptation, reduce false detection, and satisfy real-time requirements.},

  abstract     = {Patient falls due to unattended bed-exits are costly to patients, healthcare personnel and hospitals. Numerous researches based on up to three predetermined factors have been conducted for preventing falls. The present comprehensive proposal is based on four sub-systems that synthesize six factors. A parameter is assigned to each factor with a coefficient specifically determined for each individual patient and per admittance. The parameters are aggregated in equations that lead to an early warning about a probable bed-exit, or an alarm about an imminent bed-exit. The ultimate aim of our proposal is the generation of the earliest possible warning to grant the longest time for nurse intervention. Thus, the probable fall of high-risk patients can be prevented, by stopping the unattended bed-exits. The proposal is supported by a prototype multi-tier system design and the results of laboratory patient bed-exit scenarios, carried out using the design. Comparison of the obtained results with previous work shows that our proposed solution is unmatched in providing the longest time for nurse intervention (up to 15.7 ± 1.1 s), because of the comprehensive six-factor synthesis, specific to each individual patient and each admittance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we proposed an age assessment method evaluated on Malaysian children aged between 1 and 17. The approach is based on global fuzzy segmentation, local feature extraction using a projection-based feature transform and a designed deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) model. In the first step, a global labelling process was achieved based on fuzzy segmentation, and then, the first-to-third molar teeth were segmented. The deformation invariant features were next extracted based on an intensity projection technique. This technique provided high-order features which were invariant to rotation and partial deformation changes. Finally, the designed DCNN model extracts a large set of features in the hierarchical layers which provided scale, rotation and deformation invariance. The method using this approach was evaluated using a comprehensive and labelled orthopantomographs of 456 patients, which were captured in the Department of Dentistry and Research at Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia. The results from the analysis have suggested that the method can classify the images with high performance, which enabled automated age estimation with high accuracy.},

The experience of the contractor on previous road projects is an important element that can help to prevent errors and increase the chances of success in similar future projects. Data on construction costs collected from past projects can be used to estimate costs at different stages of the project life cycle through artificial neural networks. In this paper, artificial neural networks (MLP, GRNN, RBFNN) for estimating road construction costs are modeled. During the modeling, the database of roads constructed on the territory of the Republic of Croatia was used. Comparison of performance of neural networks has shown that the GRNN has obtained the best accuracy with MAPE of 13\% and coefficient of determination of 0.9595. The neural network has proven to be a promising approach to use in the initial design phase when there is usually a limited or incomplete set of data for cost analysis, and this method could yield much more accurate results and the estimation error could be reduced.},

Careful feature engineering on a set of related magnitudes as meteorology and traffic has proven useful, and we have coupled these neural models with mesoscale numerical pollution forecasts, which improve precision by up to 10\%. The experiments show that some neural networks and ensembles consistently outperform the reference models, particularly improving the Naive model’s results from around (20\%) up to (57\%) for longer forecasting horizons.

However, existing quantum simulation methods are still limited on the basis of particle swarm optimizer. This paper explores the principle of memetic computing to develop a novel memetic quantum evolution algorithm for solving global optimization problem. First, we design a quantum theory-based memetic framework to handle multiple evolutionary operators, in which multiple units of different kinds of algorithmic information are harmoniously combined. Second, we propose the memetic evolutionary operator and the quantum evolutionary operator to complete the balance between the global search and the local search. The memetic evolutionary operator emphasizes meme diffusion by the shuffled process to enhance the global search ability. The quantum evolutionary operator utilizes an adaptive selection mechanism for different potential wells to tackle the local search ability. Furthermore, the Newton’s gravity laws-based gravitational center and geometric center as two important components are introduced to improve the diversity of population. These units can be recombined by means of different evolutionary operators that are based on the synergistic coordination between exploitation and exploration. Through extensive experiments on various optimization problems, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms 11 state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) framework is one of safety aspects that is important to the industrial sector to ensure its high-quality production and processes. However, the development of FDD system in chemical process systems could have difficulties, e.g. highly nonlinear correlation within the variables, highly complex process, and an enormous number of sensors to be monitored. These issues have encouraged the development of various approaches to increase the effectiveness and robustness of the FDD framework, such as the wavelet transform analysis, where it has the advantage in extracting the significant features in both time and frequency domain. It has motivated us to propose an extension work of the multi-scale KFDA method, where we have modified it with the implementation of Parseval’s theorem and the application of ANFIS method to improve the performance of the fault classification. In this work, through the implementation of Parseval’s theorem, the observation of fault features via the energy spectrum and effective reduction in DWT analysis data quantity can be accomplished. The extracted features from the multi-scale KFDA method are used for fault diagnosis and classification, where multiple ANFIS models were developed for each designated fault pattern to increase the classification accuracy and reduce the diagnosis error rate. The fault classification performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated using a benchmarked Tennessee Eastman process. The results indicated that the proposed multi-scale KFDA-ANFIS framework has shown the improvement with an average of 87.02\% in classification accuracy over the multi-scale PCA-ANFIS (78.90\%) and FDA-ANFIS (70.80\%).},

  abstract     = {To address the variabilities of the number and position of extracted feature points for the traditional scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) method, an improved SIFT algorithm is proposed for robust emotion recognition. Specifically, shape decomposition is first performed on the detected facial images by defining a weight vector. Then, a feature point constraint algorithm is developed to determine the optimum position of the feature points that can effectively represent the expression change regions. On this basis, the SIFT descriptors are applied to extract the regional gradient information as feature parameters. Finally, the support vector machine classifier combined with the principal component analysis method is used to reduce the feature dimensions and facial expression recognition. Experiments have been performed under different conditions, i.e., varied illuminations, face poses and facial moisture levels, using 15 participants. In the cases of frontal face and 5-degree face rotation views, the average recognition accuracies are 98.52\% and 94.47\% (no additional light sources), as well as 96.97\% and 95.40\% (two additional light sources), respectively. In addition, as an effective supplement to the problem of changes in illumination, the average recognition ratios are 96.23\% and 96.20\% under dry and wet face conditions, respectively. The experimental results reveal the robust performance of the proposed method in facial expression recognition.},

The robust Huber loss function is considered as the generalization of Hinge loss and L2-norm loss that behaves like the quadratic L2-norm loss for closer error points and the linear Hinge loss after a specified distance. Three functional iterative approaches based on generalized Huber loss function are proposed in this paper to solve support vector classification problems of which one is based on SVM, i.e. generalized Huber support vector machine and the other two are in the spirit of TWSVM, namely generalized Huber twin support vector machine and regularization on generalized Huber twin support vector machine. The proposed approaches iteratively find the solutions and eliminate the requirements to solve any quadratic programming problem (QPP) as for SVM and TWSVM. The main advantages of the proposed approach are: firstly, utilize the robust Huber loss function for better generalization and for lesser sensitivity towards noise and outliers as compared to quadratic loss; secondly, it uses functional iterative scheme to find the solution that eliminates the need to solving QPP and also makes the proposed approaches faster. The efficacy of the proposed approach is established by performing numerical experiments on several real-world datasets and comparing the result with related methods, viz.

Recently, Nagai et al. (Int J Multimed Inf Retr 7(1):3–16, 2018), Uchida et al. (Embedding watermarks into deep neural networks, ICMR, 2017) proposed to watermark convolutional neural networks for image classification, by embedding information into their weights. While this is a clear progress toward model protection, this technique solely allows for extracting the watermark from a network that one accesses locally and entirely. Instead, we aim at allowing the extraction of the watermark from a neural network (or any other machine learning model) that is operated remotely, and available through a service API. To this end, we propose to mark the model’s action itself, tweaking slightly its decision frontiers so that a set of specific queries convey the desired information. In the present paper, we formally introduce the problem and propose a novel zero-bit watermarking algorithm that makes use of adversarial model examples. While limiting the loss of performance of the protected model, this algorithm allows subsequent extraction of the watermark using only few queries. We experimented the approach on three neural networks designed for image classification, in the context of MNIST digit recognition task.},

Second, a specific word spotting method is used to spot query words in a large collection of documents. The proposed spotting system is based on deep bidirectional long short-term memory neural network and hidden Markov model (HMM) hybrid architecture. It takes advantage of DNN’s strong representation learning power and HMM’s sequential modeling ability.

  abstract     = {Smoke detection plays an essential role in the wild video surveillance systems for abnormal events warning. In this paper, we introduced a dedicated neural network structure named Sniffer-Net to simultaneously extract smoke dynamic feature robustly and evaluate the smoke concentration accurately. Firstly, we utilize an improved LiteFlowNet to estimate the global optical flow from image sequence. Meanwhile, a Marr–Hildreth method is brought up and fused into this network to distinguish and eliminate occluded regions from global flow map. Then, an evaluation module based on Context-Encoder network is put forward specially to quantify smoke concentration levels. This network, following the improved LiteFlowNet, is modified through replacing the loss function and removing the multiscale scheme and trained to infer approximate smoke optical flow behind occlusion regions. Starting from the statistical view, the irregular RGB/HSV feature spaces are converted into a specific quantitative evaluation space. As a result, the whole evaluation system is responsible to transform the distribution of irregular smoke motion feature into a quantified form of representation. In turn, this transformation endows the system with a novel numerical standard for smoke concentration evaluation. Finally, an accuracy assessment method is applied to compare the results of detected smoke concentration with the human experience prior model, which feedback the accuracy and false detection rate of system algorithm. In the experiments of five smoke datasets, our proposed smoke detection approach is superior to other state-of-the-art methods, and concentration algorithm achieves the satisfactory performance of 97.3\% accuracy on some specialized dataset.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the application of an improved stochastic fractal search algorithm (ISFSA) for optimizing five single objectives of optimal power flow (OPF) problem and satisfying all constraints consisting of operating limits of electric components, power balance and load voltage magnitude limits. The proposed ISFSA is formed by implementing three improvements on the conventional stochastic fractal search algorithm (SFSA). The first improvement cancels one ineffective formula but keeps another one in diffusion process. The second improvement selects some worst solutions in the first update and some best solutions in the second update for producing new solutions. In the third improvement, a proposed technique is applied for carrying out the update processes. Comparisons of obtained results from three standard IEEE power systems indicate that the proposed method is superior to SFSA in terms of optimal solution quality, execution speed as well as success rate. The performance comparisons with other existing methods available in previous studies also lead to the conclusions that the proposed method can reach lower generation fuel cost, smaller total power losses, less amount of emission, better voltage profile and faster execution process. As a result, it can be recommended that the proposed ISFSA should be used for OPF problem in high-voltage power system field.},

  abstract     = {Outlier detection has become an important research area in the field of stream data mining due to its vast applications. In the literature, many methods have been proposed, but they work well for simple and positive regions of outliers, where boundary regions are not given much importance. Moreover, an algorithm which processes stream data must be effective and able to compute infinite data in one pass or limited number of passes. These problems have motivated us to propose an outlier detection approach for large-scale data stream. The proposed algorithm employs the concept of relative cardinality, entropy outlier factor theory of information-based system, and size-variant sliding window in stream data. In addition, we propose a new methodology for concept drift adaptation on evolving data streams. The proposed method is executed on nine benchmark datasets and compared with six existing methods that are EXPoSE, iForest, OC-SVM, LOF, KDE, and FastAbod. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms six existing methods in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve, precision recall, and computational time for positive regions as well as for boundary regions.},

  abstract     = {Microgrid systems are becoming a very promising solution to meet the power demand growth especially in remote areas where diesel generators (DG) are commonly used as a main energy source. Photovoltaic (PV) systems are commonly used as a sustainable energy source to economize DG fuel. Due to the intermittent and fluctuating behavior of PV generators, energy storage systems (ESS) such as electrochemical battery are suggested. PV and ESS are usually connected using one inverter/charger called hybrid inverter. The power management is crucial to optimize the fuel consumption and operate efficiently ESS. Additionally, in an off-grid operation, the microgrid frequency becomes sensible due to the slow dynamic of DG which requires an additional control tool to improve the frequency regulation. This paper proposes a new power management based on Mamdani fuzzy logic. The proposed controller considers the targets mentioned above by only controlling the hybrid inverter. Simulation results prove that fuzzy-based controller reduces the DG fuel consumption by more than 12\% compared to classical hysteresis management control. Moreover, the proposed controller performs efficiently regarding the conventional frequency regulation, which is widely used in microgrid control.},

  abstract     = {Image set classification has drawn much attention due to its rich set information. Recently, the most popular set-to-set distance-based representation methods have achieved interesting results by measuring the between-set distance. However, there are two intuitive assumptions, which are largely ignored: (1) The homogeneous samples should have positive contributions to approximate the nearest point in the probe set, while the heterogeneous samples should have no contributions and (2) the learned nearest points in each gallery set should have the lowest correlations. Therefore, this paper presents a novel method called nonnegative discriminative encoded nearest points for image set classification. Specifically, we use two explicit nonnegative constraints to ensure the coding coefficients sparse and discriminative simultaneously. Moreover, we additionally introduce a new class-wise discriminative term to further boost the discriminant ability of different sets. In this way, they can be boosted mutually so that the obtained coding coefficients are beneficial to the purpose of set classification. The results from extensive experiments and comparisons with some state-of-the-art methods on four challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of travertine rocks with an indirect modeling approach and machine learning algorithms is useful as models can reduce the cost and time required to obtain accurate measurements of UCS, which is important for the prediction of rock failure. This approach can also address the limitations encountered in preparing detailed measured samples using direct measurements. The current paper developed and compared the performance of three standalone tree-based machine learning models (random forest (RF), M5 model tree, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)) for the prediction of UCS in travertine rocks from the Azarshahr area of northwestern Iran. Additionally, an ensemble committee-based artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to integrate the advantages of the three standalone models and obtain further accuracy in UCS prediction. To date, an ensemble approach for estimating UCS has not been explored. To construct and validate the models, a set of rock test data including p-wave velocity (Vp (Km/s)), Schmidt Hammer (Rn), porosity (n\%), point load index (Is (MPa)), and UCS (MPa) were acquired from 93 travertine core samples. To develop the ensemble tree-based machine learning model, the input matrix representing Vp, Rn, n\%, and Is data with the corresponding target variable (i.e., UCS) was incorporated with a ratio of 70:15:15 (train: validate: test). Results indicated that a standalone MARS model outperformed all other standalone tree-based models in predicting UCS. The ANN-committee model, however, obtained the best performance with an r-value of approximately 0.890, an RMSE of 3.980 MPa, an MAE of 3.225 MPa, a WI of 0.931, and an LMI of 0.537, demonstrating the improved accuracy of the ensemble model for the prediction of UCS relative to the standalone models. The results suggest that the proposed ensemble committee-based model is a useful approach for predicting the UCS of travertine rocks with a limited set of model-designed datasets.},

  abstract     = {Recently, some researchers concentrate on applying multi-view learning to the correlation filter tracking to achieve both the efficiency and accuracy. However, most of them fail to effectively collaborate multiple views to deal with more complex environment. Moreover, their methods are prone to drift in case of long-term occlusion due to the memory loss. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view correlation filters-based tracker for robust visual tracking. First, we present an adaptive multi-view collaboration strategy to highlight different contributions of different views by jointly considering the reliability and discrimination. Second, an effective memory-improved model update rule is introduced to avoid falling into a contaminated target model. Compared with the conventional linear interpolation update rule, it can effectively deal with long-term occlusion by improving the memory of historical models. Furthermore, instead of assigning a unified learning rate for all views in each frame, we design varying learning rates for different views according to their respective evaluations on the current tracking result, which can prevent the target models of all views from being contaminated at the same time. Finally, a failure-aware scale update scheme is developed to avoid noisy scale estimation in case of temporal tracking failure. Extensive experimental results on the recent benchmark demonstrate that our tracker performs favorably against other state-of-the-art trackers with a real-time performance.},

Following this aspiration, in this study, we explored the possibility of better object manipulation performance by connecting the visual recognition of objects to their physical attributes, such as weight and center of gravity (CoG). To develop and test this idea, an object manipulation platform is built comprising a robotic arm, a depth camera fixed at the top center of the workspace, embedded encoders in the robotic arm mechanism, and microcontrollers for position and force control. Since both the visual recognition and force estimation algorithms use deep learning principles, the test set-up was named as Deep-Table. The objects in the manipulation tests are selected from everyday life and are common to be seen on modern office desktops. The visual object localization and recognition processes are performed from two distinct branches by deep convolutional neural network architectures. We present five of the possible cases, having different levels of information availability on the object weight and CoG in the experiments. The results confirm that using our algorithm, the robotic arm can move different types of objects successfully varying from several grams (empty bottle) to around 250 g (ceramic cup) without failure or tipping. The proposed method also shows that connecting the object recognition with load estimation and contact point further improves the performance characterized by a smoother motion.},

The study not only presents five models for the same set of data but also compares the overall performance of them. Dataset used consists of 255 samples acquired from laboratory experiments. Out of the total, 170 randomly chosen samples were used for training and remaining 85 were used for testing the models. Input dataset consists of eight parameters (uniformity coefficient, coefficient of curvature, maximum dry density, optimum moisture content, lime, lime sludge, curing period and 7-day soaked California bearing ratio), while the output is UCS value at 7, 28, 45, 90 and 180 days of curing. Comparisons of results propose that Gaussian processes modeling strategy works well and the overall performance was substantially nearer to the exact agreement line. As a result of GP model, higher value of CC = 0.997 and lower values of RMSE = 23.016 kPa and MAE = 16.455 were obtained for testing the dataset. Sensitivity analysis suggests that lime, lime sludge, curing period and California bearing ratio are the significant parameters for predicting the unconfined compressive strength of stabilized pond ashes. The results confirmed that GP models are in a position to predict the unconfined compressive strength of stabilized pond ashes with an excessive degree of accuracy; however, GP modeling approach proves that this approach is more economical and less difficult in comparison with tedious laboratory work.},

  abstract     = {Epilepsy is a commonly observed long-term neurological disorder that impairs nerve cell activity in the brain and has a severe impact on people’s daily lives. Accurate seizure detection in the long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained vital importance in the diagnosis of patients with epilepsy. Visual interpretation and detection of epileptic seizures in long-term EEG is a time-consuming and burdensome task for neurologists. Therefore, in this study, we propose a computationally efficient automated seizure detection model using a novel feature called successive decomposition index (SDI). We observed that the SDI feature was significantly higher during the epileptic seizure as compared to normal EEG. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using three databases, namely the Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (DB1), CHB-MIT (DB2) and the Temple University Hospital (DB3) consisting of 58 h, 884 h, and 408 h of EEG, respectively. Experimental results revealed the sensitivity–false detection rate–median detection delay of 97.53\%–0.4/h–1.5 s, 97.28\%–0.57/h–1.7 s, and 95.80\%–0.49/h–1.5 s for DB1, DB2, and DB3, respectively, using the support vector machine classifier. The proposed method significantly outperformed previously presented methods (wavelets and other feature extraction methods) while being computationally more efficient. Further, to the best of the author’s knowledge, present study is the first study that was tested on three different EEG databases and showed consistent results leading to the generalization and robustness of the algorithm. Hence, the proposed method is an efficient tool for neurologists to detect epileptic seizures in long-term EEG.},

  abstract     = {C-Mantec neural network constructive algorithm Ortega (C-Mantec neural network algorithm implementation on MATLAB. https://github.com/IvanGGomez/CmantecPaco, 2015) creates very compact architectures with generalization capabilities similar to feed-forward networks trained by the well-known back-propagation algorithm. Nevertheless, constructive algorithms suffer much from the problem of overfitting, and thus, in this work the learning procedure is first analyzed for networks created by this algorithm with the aim of trying to understand the training dynamics that will permit optimization possibilities. Secondly, several optimization strategies are analyzed for the position of class separating hyperplanes, and the results analyzed on a set of public domain benchmark data sets. The results indicate that with these modifications a small increase in prediction accuracy of C-Mantec can be obtained but in general this was not better when compared to a standard support vector machine, except in some cases when a mixed strategy is used.},

  abstract     = {Multi-step time series forecasting (TSF) is a crucial element to support tactical decisions (e.g., designing production or marketing plans several months in advance). While most TSF research addresses only single-point prediction, prediction intervals (PIs) are useful to reduce uncertainty related to important decision making variables. In this paper, we explore a large set of neural network methods for multi-step TSF and that directly optimize PIs. This includes multi-step adaptations of recently proposed PI methods, such as lower–upper bound estimation (LUBET), its ensemble extension (LUBEXT), a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm LUBE (MLUBET) and a two-phase learning multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (M2LUBET). We also explore two new ensemble variants for the evolutionary approaches based on two PI coverage–width split methods (radial slices and clustering), leading to the MLUBEXT, M2LUBEXT, MLUBEXT2 and M2LUBEXT2 methods. A robust comparison was held by considering the rolling window procedure, nine time series from several real-world domains and with different characteristics, two PI quality measures (coverage error and width) and the Wilcoxon statistic. Overall, the best results were achieved by the M2LUBET neuroevolution method, which requires a reasonable computational effort for time series with a few hundreds of observations.},

  abstract     = {Image segmentation using multilevel thresholding (MT) is one of the leading methods. Although, as most techniques are based on the image histogram to be segmented, MT approaches only include the occurrence frequency of particular intensity range disregarding each spatial information. Energy curve-based contextual information can help to improve the quality of the thresholded image as it computes not only the value of the pixel but also its vicinity. Therefore, the energy curve is intended to carry spatial information into a curve with the same properties as the histogram. In this paper, classical Otsu’s method (between-class variance) is combined with energy curve for multilevel thresholding to perform segmentation of colored images. The energy curve-based Otsu (Energy-Otsu) uses an exhaustive search process to determine the optimal threshold values. However, due to the multidimensionality and multimodal nature of the color images, it becomes challenging and highly complex to obtain optimal thresholds. Therefore, the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is coupled with Otsu thresholding criteria to perform MT over the energy curve. The proposed Energy-Otsu-CS method produces better-segmented results as compared to other well-known optimization algorithms such as differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, firefly algorithm, bacterial foraging optimization, and artificial bee colony algorithm. The proposed approach is examined intensively regarding quality, and the numerical parameter analysis is presented to compare the segmented results of the algorithms against closely related current approaches such as gray-level co-occurrence matrix and Renyi’ entropy-based thresholding approaches.},

However, in the process of rebuilding appearance, because of the low quality of the video of the recorded concert, the result of the reconstruction may be far from the real appearance. In this paper, a robust 3D face reconstruction application is described that can be applied to a video recording. The application first uses DeblurGAN program to run anti-ambiguity calculation and removes the ambiguity in the concert video. Then, the super-resolution program is used to enlarge every frame of the concert video by four times, thus making every frame of the video clearer. Finally, the 3D faces are obtained after 3D reconstruction of the processed video frames via the 3DMM_CNN program.},

  abstract     = {This paper highlights the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at classifying EEG data listening to different kinds of music without the requirement for handcrafted features. Deep learning architectures presented in this paper include CNN of different depths and different convolutional kernels. Support vector machine (SVM) taking in EEG features describing the frequency spectrum, signal regularity, and cross-channel correlation has been applied for performance comparison with CNN. The best performing CNN model presented in this paper achieves the tenfold cross-validation (CV) binary classification average accuracy of 98.94\% (validation) and 97.46\% (test), and the tenfold CV three-class classification accuracy of 97.68\% (validation) and 95.71\% (test). In comparison, the SVM classifier achieves tenfold CV binary classification accuracy of 80.23\% (validation). The CNN model presented is able to not only differentiate EEG of subjects listening to music from that of subjects without auditory input, but it is also capable of accurately differentiating the EEG of subjects listening to different music. In the context of designing neural computing models for EEG analysis, this paper shows that decomposing two-dimensional spatiotemporal convolutional kernels into separate one-dimensional spatial and one-dimensional temporal kernels significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters (size) of the model while retaining the classification performance. This finding is useful, especially in designing CNN for memory-critical embedded systems for EEG processing. In neurological aspect, auditory stimulus is found to have altered the EEG pattern of the frontal lobe and the left cerebral hemisphere more than the other brain regions.},

Meanwhile, a correlation coefficient is a prominent measure to measure the relationship between two sets. Motivated by these primary characteristics, it is interesting to present some information measures to the PDHFSs and hence decision-making approach based on the correlation coefficient. In this paper, we develop a method to solve the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem under PDHFS environment. For it, firstly, we define the informational energy and the covariance between the two PDHFSs and study their properties. Secondly, we develop correlation coefficients and the weighted correlation coefficients for PDHFSs. In the formulation, DHFSs are able to represent the information in terms of their respective degrees, while the assigned probabilities give more details about the level of agreeness or disagreeness. Also, some properties of the proposed measures are also studied. Thirdly, a novel algorithm is developed based on the proposed operators to solve MCDM problems. A practical example is provided to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and feasibility. Also, a comparative analysis with several existing studies reveals the proposed method is better during solving the decision-making problems.},

Therefore, solutions for errors reduction or compensation are required to improve the process. In this paper, an optimization procedure of the geometric precision, based on genetic algorithm, global optimum determination by linking and interchanging kindred evaluators solver and newly developed algorithm called grasshopper optimization algorithm, is tested and doubly validated numerically and experimentally. The denture plate part simultaneously simulated and manufactured shows how it is possible to obtain sound component with reduced geometric errors such as springback, bending and pillow effect errors by properly chosen optimal process parameters. The results indicated that the reduction in the shape defects between the obtained geometry and the target model generated by computer-aided design can be achieved through coupling of numerical simulations and optimization techniques.},

  abstract     = {The problem of autonomous transportation in industrial scenarios is receiving a renewed interest due to the way it can revolutionise internal logistics, especially in unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel architecture allowing a robot to detect, localise, and track (possibly multiple) pallets using machine learning techniques based on an on-board 2D laser rangefinder only. The architecture is composed of two main components: the first stage is a pallet detector employing a Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) detector cascaded with a CNN-based classifier; the second stage is a Kalman filter for localising and tracking detected pallets, which we also use to defer commitment to a pallet detected in the first stage until sufficient confidence has been acquired via a sequential data acquisition process. For fine-tuning the CNNs, the architecture has been systematically evaluated using a real-world dataset containing 340 labelled 2D scans, which have been made freely available in an online repository. Detection performance has been assessed on the basis of the average accuracy over k-fold cross-validation, and it scored 99.58\% in our tests. Concerning pallet localisation and tracking, experiments have been performed in a scenario where the robot is approaching the pallet to fork. Although data have been originally acquired by considering only one pallet as per specification of the use case we consider, artificial data have been generated as well to mimic the presence of multiple pallets in the robot workspace. Our experimental results confirm that the system is capable of identifying, localising and tracking pallets with a high success rate while being robust to false positives.},

We apply this method to predict the hourly ozone concentration on each day for the entire year using several predictors from the previous day, including the wind fields, temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and precipitation, along with in situ ozone and NO2 concentrations. We refer to a history of all observed parameters between 2014 and 2016 for training the predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the 25 monitoring sites for the year 2017 report average indices of agreement (IOA) of 0.84–0.89 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74–0.81, indicating reasonable performance for the CNN forecasting model. Although the CNN model successfully captures daily trends as well as yearly high and low variations of the ozone concentrations, it notably underpredicts high ozone peaks during the summer. The forecasting results are generally more accurate for the stations located in the southern regions of the Han River, the result of more stable topographical and meteorological conditions. Furthermore, through two separate daytime and nighttime forecasts, we find that the monthly IOA of the CNN model is 0.05–0.30 higher during the daytime, resulting from the unavailability of some of the input parameters during the nighttime. While the CNN model can predict the next 24 h of ozone concentrations within less than a minute, we identify several limitations of deep learning models for real-time air quality forecasting for further improvement.},

Firstly, based on precompensation technique, an appropriate model transformation is proposed to convert the error system into augmented error system, and an exquisite performance index function is defined for this system. Secondly, on the basis of Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation, the optimal consensus control is designed and a novel policy iteration (PI) algorithm is put forward to learn the solutions of the HJB equation online. Here, the proposed PI algorithm is implemented on account of GFHMs. Compared with dual-network model including critic network and action network, the proposed scheme only requires critic network. Thirdly, the augmented consensus error of each agent and the weight estimation error of each GFHM are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded, and the stability of our method has been verified.

This task in text plays a critical role in natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis and semantic comprehension system. However, most existing methods for this emotion cause extraction task only focus on feature engineering and ignore the latent semantic information between emotion word and context to hinder the performance. In this paper, we propose a novel computational multi-granularity bidirectional attention stream network based on a machine comprehension frame to settle this problem. The context and query are embedded by this multistage hierarchical process based on the fine-grained levels of embeddings. Then, the bidirectional attention stream mechanism is applied to get an emotional query-aware context representation. Meanwhile, we have conducted extensive experiments on available Chinese emotion cause dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is able to extract the emotion cause.},

  abstract     = {Fractional calculus plays a fundamental role in understanding the physics of nonlinear systems due to its heritage of uncertainty, nonlocality and complexity. In this study, novel sign fractional least mean square (F-LMS) algorithms are designed for ease in hardware implementation by applying sign function to input data and estimation error corresponding to first and fractional-order derivative terms in weight update mechanism of the standard F-LMS method. Theoretical expressions are derived for proposed sign F-LMS and its variants; strength of methods for different fractional orders is evaluated numerically through computer simulations for parameter estimation problem based on nonlinear Hammerstein system for low and high signal–noise variations. Comparison of the results from true parameters of the model illustrates the worth of the scheme in terms of accuracy, convergence and robustness. The stability and viability of design methodologies are examined through statistical observations on sufficiently large number of independent runs through mean square deviation and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency performance indices.},

  abstract     = {Recently multimodal neuroimaging which combines signals from different brain modalities has started to be considered as a potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The current study aimed to explore a new method for discriminating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients and control group by means of simultaneous measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Twenty-three pre-medicated combined type ADHD children and 21 healthy children were included in the study. Nonlinear brain dynamics of subjects were obtained from EEG signal using Higuchi fractal dimensions and Lempel–Ziv complexity, latency and amplitude values of P3 wave obtained from auditory evoked potentials and frontal cortex hemodynamic responses calculated from fNIRS. Lower complexity values, prolonged P3 latency and reduced P3 amplitude values were found in ADHD children. fNIRS indicated that the control subjects exhibited higher right prefrontal activation than ADHD children. Features are analyzed, looking for the best classification accuracy and finally machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes and Multilayer Perception Neural Network, are introduced for EEG signals alone and for combination of fNIRS and EEG signals. Naive Bayes provided the best classification with an accuracy rate of 79.54\% and 93.18\%, using EEG and EEG-fNIRS systems, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that utilization of information by combining features obtained from fNIRS and EEG improves the classification accuracy. As a conclusion, our method has indicated that EEG-fNIRS multimodal neuroimaging is a promising method for ADHD objective diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {This study aimed to develop a new methodology for evaluating and benchmarking a multi-agent learning neural network and Bayesian model for real-time skin detectors based on Internet of things (IoT) by using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). The novelty of this work is in the use of an evaluation matrix for the performance evaluation of real-time skin detectors that are based on IoT. Nevertheless, an issue with the performance evaluation of real-time skin detector approaches is the determination of sensible criteria for performance metrics and the trade-off amongst them on the basis of different colour spaces. An experiment was conducted on the basis of three phases. In the first phase, a real-time camera based on cloud IoT was used to gather different caption images. The second phase could be divided into two stages. In the first stage, a skin detection approach was developed by applying multi-agent learning based on different colour spaces. This stage aimed to create a decision matrix of various colour spaces and three groups of criteria (i.e. reliability, time complexity and error rate within a dataset) for testing and evaluating the developed skin detection approaches. In the second stage, Pearson rules were utilised to calculate the correlation between the criteria in order to make sure, either needs to use all of the criteria in decision matrix and the criteria facts that affect the behaviour of each criterion, in order to make sure that use all the criteria in evaluation as multidimensional measurements or not. In the third phase, the MCDM method was used by integrating between a technique in order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution and multi-layer analytic hierarchy process to benchmark numerous real-time IoT skin detection approaches based on the performed decision matrix from the second phase. Three groups of findings were obtained. Firstly, (1) statistically significant differences were found between the criteria that emphasise the need to use all of the criteria in evaluation. (2) The behaviour of the criteria in all scenarios was affected by the distribution of threshold values for each criterion based on the different colour spaces used. Therefore, the differences in the behaviour of criteria that highlight the use of the criteria in evaluation were included as multidimensional measurements. Secondly, an overall comparison of external and internal aggregation values in selecting the best colour space, namely the normalised RGB at the sixth threshold, was discussed. Thirdly, (1) the YIQ colour space had the lowest value and was the worst case, whereas the normalised RGB had the highest value and was the most recommended of all spaces. (2) The lowest threshold was obtained at 0.5, whereas the best value was 0.9.},

The networks containing two and four neurons have been designed, and their complex dynamical behavior has also been verified. The proposed implementation vis-à-vis the already reported designs offers the benefits of: (1) low-voltage operation, (2) integrability, due to resistor-less design and the employment of only grounded components, (3) electronic tunability of performance parameters by external currents, which adds flexibility to the proposed designs even after their final fabrication, (4) absence of inductors as, in contrast to reported designs, the delay has been implemented using component substitution method where inductors have been replaced by emulated inductors and (5) low-power implementation due to the inherent class AB nature of sinh-domain technique. Besides, for the first time, the complex dynamical behavior of four-neuron delayed inertial network has been implemented and its functioning for different activations functions has been considered and verified.

  abstract     = {This paper extends one of the most extensively used multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS), to adapt to highly complicated uncertain environments based on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) sets. In contrast to classical TOPSIS methods, this paper develops a novel concept of Pearson-like IVPF correlation coefficients instead of distance measures to not only construct a useful and effective association measure between two IVPF characteristics but also depict the outranking relationship of IVPF information. Moreover, this paper proposes the (weighted) IVPF correlation-based closeness coefficients to establish a Pearson-like correlation-based TOPSIS model to manage MCDA problems within the IVPF environment. In particular, there is a definite improvement in determining the closeness coefficient required in the TOPSIS procedure. This paper considers anchored judgments with respect to the positive- and negative-ideal IVPF solutions and provides new approach- and avoidance-oriented definitions for the IVPF correlation-based closeness coefficient, which is entirely different from the traditional definition of relative closeness in TOPSIS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a comprehensive IVPF correlation-based closeness index to balance the consequences between ultra-approach orientation and ultra-avoidance orientation and acquire the ultimate compromise solution for decision support and aid. The feasibility and practicability of the developed methodology are illustrated by a practical MCDA problem of rehabilitation treatment for hospitalized patients with acute stroke. The application results, along with experimentations and comparative analyses, demonstrate that the developed methods are rational and effective.},

Our method utilizes the variety of matrix to mine the potential information in the data and constructs regularization term that measures the neighboring relationship among instances with entropy to enhance the stability of decision boundary. The different shapes of matrix contain distinct spatial information. As a result, the origin vector-oriented data are reorganized into multiple shapes of matrix to expand the different spatial information. The nearest entropy is used to measure the local certainty of instances so that the stable instances can be selected to train by the new regularization term. In order to compare the advantages of introducing the multi-matrices and entropy, several ensemble learning methods that have similar ensemble strategy and variants of linear classification models are selected to implement experiments, based on 55 binary classification datasets of KEEL benchmark.},

A single objective function consisting of minimizing the cost associated with equipment, labor wage, and station establishment is considered for the problem. This problem is more complicated comparing to the literature as worker qualification is considered for determining his/her wage. As this problem is of NP-hard optimization problems, some meta-heuristic solution approaches, e.g., simulated annealing, variable neighborhood search, genetic algorithm, tabu search, population-based simulated annealing, and their hybrid versions are proposed. In the proposed algorithms, a novel encoding–decoding scheme is applied. This scheme uses the Hungarian method to assign the workers to the station to reduce the total wage of the workers. To study the performance of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithms, ten test problems are generated randomly, and using one of them the parameters of the algorithms are tuned by the Taguchi method. The final experiments on the proposed algorithms and the test problems show that in the most of the experiments, among the proposed algorithms, the single-solution-based algorithms, except TS, perform better than the population-based algorithms, especially for the case of large size test problems.},

The proposed method can find a low-dimensional latent space and a low-rank and sparse representation simultaneously. To preserve the local manifold structure of the data, we have adopted a graph constraint in our model to obtain a discriminative latent space.

Current feedback operation amplifiers are utilized to achieve integral operation and output function. Given these designs, the proposed circuit can perform continuous recursive operations in parallel and process different optimization problems with the programmability of the memristor array. On the basis of the proposed circuit, binary and greyscale image restorations are conducted through self-organizing network operations, providing a hardware implementation platform for IR tasks.

This proposed network structure is called extreme learning machine with autoencoding receptive fields (ELM-ARF), which has two parts including convolution feature extraction and feature coding. In the convolution feature extraction part, local features are extracted using orthogonalized local receptive fields. The ELM-AE theory and local receptive fields are used to encode the global receptive fields, which is used to extract global features. The pooled global features and local features are combined and input into the next layer. In the feature coding part, the shallow layer feature can be input to any deep layer through the ELM-ARF connection structure. A series of encodings are performed on the combined features in each layer to achieve a nonlinear mapping relationship from input information to target categories. In order to verify the validity of the structure, ELM-ARF is tested on four classic databases: USPS, MNIST, NORB and CIFAR10. The experimental results show that ELM-ARF effectively improves image classification accuracy by encoding the combined features that contain global attributes.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new problem in the field of combinatorial optimization. This problem can be named as the ring star problem with secondary sub-depots (RSPSSD). RSPSSD has one fixed main depot, and it allows a network to be divided into three types of nodes, namely primary sub-depots (includes the main depot too), secondary sub-depots and left out nodes. The challenge of the problem is to select some primary and secondary sub-depots that minimize the total routing cost which has three components. The first one is the routing cost of the main circuit that covers all the primary sub-depots including the main depot. The second one is the total routing cost of all the secondary circuits, each of which covers a set of few secondary sub-depots and their nearest primary sub-depot. The secondary circuits also have a constraint on the number of secondary sub-depots in it. The last one is the assignment cost of the left out nodes to their nearest concentrators which is nothing but anyone from the main depot, primary or secondary sub-depots. The proposed RSPSSD problem is solved with the proposed modified discrete antlion optimizer and tested using some TSP benchmark instances. The random walk of an antlion and an ant is encoded with ternary number system. The statistical analysis and comparison of the result against some other algorithms are also presented. A real-life case study has also been shown to validate the proposed model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the sparse mechanism of biological neural systems, an approach of strengthening response sparsity for deep learning is presented in this paper. Firstly, an unsupervised sparse pre-training process is implemented and a sparse deep network is begun to take shape. In order to avoid that all the connections of the network will be readjusted backward during the following fine-tuning process, for the loss function of the fine-tuning process, some regularization items which strength the sparse responsiveness are added. More importantly, the unified and concise residual formulae for network updating are deduced, which ensure the backpropagation algorithm to perform successfully. The residual formulae significantly improve the existing sparse fine-tuning methods such as which in sparse autoencoders by Andrew Ng. In this way, the sparse structure obtained in the pre-training can be maintained, and the sparse abstract features of data can be extracted effectively. Numerical experiments show that by this sparsity-strengthened learning method, the sparse deep neural network has the best classification performance among several classical classifiers; meanwhile, the sparse learning abilities and time complexity all are better than traditional deep learning methods.},

What’s more, AF is a high-risk factor for stroke, ischemia myocardial and other malignant cardiovascular diseases, which would threaten people’s life significantly. Using a mobile device to screen AF segments is an effective way to reduce the mortality and morbidity of malignant cardiovascular diseases. However, most of existing AF detection methods mainly centered on clinical resting ECG signals and were incapable of processing mobile ECG signals with low signal-to-noise ratio which collected by mobile devices. In this paper, we take advantage of a fully convolutional network variant named U-Net for heart rhythmic information capturing by locating R peak positions as well as calculating RR intervals and a 34-layer residual network for waveform morphological features capturing from ECG signals. Combining both rhythmic information and waveform morphological features, two-layer fully connected networks are employed successively to discriminate AF, normal sinus rhythm , and other abnormal rhythm (other). The extensive experimental results show that our proposed AF our proposed AF screening framework named FRM-CNN can achieve $$F_{1}$$ value of 85.08 ± 0.99\% and accuracy of $$87.22 \pm 0.71$$\% on identifying AF segments well without handcraft engineering.

To accelerate the speed, many variance reduction methods have been proposed. However, most of these methods require additional memory cost or computational burden on full gradient, which results in low efficiency or even unavailable while applied to real-world applications with large-scale datasets. To handle this issue, we propose a new flexible variance reduction method for SGD, named FVR-SGD, which can reduce memory overhead and speed up the convergence using flexible subset without extra computation. We analyze the details of convergence property for our method, and linear convergence rate can be guaranteed while using flexible variance reduction. Some efficient variants for distributed environment and deep neural networks are also proposed in this paper. Several numerical experiments are conducted on a genre of real-world large-scale datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that FVR-SGD outperforms the currently popular algorithms. Specifically, the proposed method can achieve up to 40\% reduction in the training time to solve the optimization problem of logistic regression, SVM and neural networks.},

In the proposed image cryptosystem, the architecture of permutation and diffusion is adopted. Firstly, plaintext-related Latin-square-based block permutation is proposed to randomly shuffle pixels of the color plain image, diffusion method dependent on the plaintext and scrambled image is further given to modify pixels of permutated image, and finally cipher image is gotten. The chaotic sequence for diffusing the current pixel is dynamically generated according to the plain image and scrambled image, and diffusion operations of red, green and blue components of color plain image affect each other. Besides, chaotic sequences used in encryption are produced by new one-dimensional chaotic systems and dynamically selected, and initial values of chaotic systems are computed by plain image and external keys. Experimental results and security analyses demonstrate that our image encryption has large key space and high security level, and it can be applied for the secure communication of image information.},

Our method is on the basis of ensemble learning, and the base learners include both one-class classifiers and multi-class classifiers. The core idea is that one-class classifier ensemble model is used to address the problem of missing label, and the usage of multi-class classifier ensemble model is to further improve its performance when outlier examples are available. The essential motivation for this proposal is that results from a classifier trained using only positive data will not be as good as the results using both positive and negative data. We investigate the performance of the proposed scheme with a series of experiments. Ten benchmark data sets and two real-world industrial systems are used, and the results approve the performance of our detection scheme.},

  abstract     = {Maximum margin clustering (MMC) is a recent approach of applying margin maximization in supervised learning to unsupervised learning, aiming to partition the data into clusters with high discrimination. Recently, extreme learning machine (ELM) has been applied to MMC (called iterative ELM clustering or ELMCIter) which maximizes the data discrimination by iteratively training a weighted extreme learning machine (W-ELM). In this way, ELMCIter achieves a substantial reduction in training time and provides a unified model for both binary and multi-class clusterings. However, there exist two issues in ELMCIter: (1) random feature mappings adopted in ELMCIter are unable to well obtain high-quality discriminative features for clustering and (2) a large model is usually required in ELMCIter because its performance is affected by the number of hidden nodes, and training such model becomes relatively slow. In this paper, the hidden layer in ELMCIter is encoded by an approximate empirical kernel map (AEKM) rather than the random feature mappings, in order to solve these two issues. AEKM is generated from low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix, derived from the input data through a kernel function. Our proposed method is called iterative AEKM for clustering (AEKMCIter), whose contributions are: (1) AEKM can extract discriminative and robust features from the kernel matrix so that better performance is always achieved in AEKMCIter and (2) AEKMCIter produces an extremely small number of hidden nodes for low memory consumption and fast training. Detailed experiments verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. As an illustration, on the MNIST10 dataset, our approach AEKMCIter improves the clustering accuracy over ELMCIter up to 5\%, while significantly reducing the training time and the memory consumption (i.e., the number of hidden nodes) up to 1/7 and 1/20, respectively.},

  abstract     = {A new hybrid model combining the kernel functions along with the random vector functional link neural network (RVFLN) is proposed in this paper for an effective solar power prediction. The conventional RVFLN is known for its fast learning speed, simple architecture and good generalization capabilities and allows direct connection between input and output nodes along with nonlinear enhancement nodes with random weights. However, the bottleneck of selecting the number of hidden enhancement nodes and mapping functions is still a challenging problem. To overcome these deficiencies of the conventional RVFLN, kernel functions are used for both the direct links and the hidden nodes to provide better stability, generalization and regression accuracy. Instead of using a single kernel for the enhancement nodes, this paper proposes an optimal kernel function that comprises a linear combination of weighted local kernel and a global kernel to improve the prediction accuracy of the solar power generation. This optimal kernel will be known as multi-kernel RVFLN (MK-RVFLN), and its parameters are optimized using an efficient metaheuristic evaporation-based water cycle (EVWCA-MKRVFLN) to provide accurate prediction of solar power. To validate its superior prediction accuracy, two solar power plants of 25 and 100 MW capacity in the states of New York and California are considered for 5-min- and 60-min-ahead prediction in the months of January, April, July and October. The result analysis shows that the MK-RVFLN algorithm attains better performance than many other techniques.},

Two different kernel functions, namely exponential radial basis function (ERBF) and radial basis function (RBF), were used to develop the SVR model. An experimental database of 115 data samples was collected from different literatures to develop the SVR model. The data used in SVR model have been organized in the form of six input parameters that covers dosage of binder content, fly ash, water–powder ratio, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate and superplasticiser. The above-mentioned ingredients have been taken as input variables, whereas slump flow value, L-box ratio, V-funnel time and compressive strength have been considered as output variables. The obtained results indicate that the SVR–ERBF model outperforms SVR–RBF model for learning and predicting the experimental data with the highest value of the coefficient of correlation (R) equal to 0.965, 0.954, 0.979 and 0.9773 for slump flow, L-box ratio, V-funnel and compressive strength, respectively, with small values of statistical errors. Also, the efficiency of SVR model is compared to artificial neural network (ANN) and multivariable regression analysis (MVR). In addition, a sensitivity analysis was also carried out to determine the effects of various input parameters on output. This study indicates that SVR–ERBF model can be used as an alternative approach in predicting the properties of self-compacting concrete.},

  abstract     = {High-fidelity multi-scale design optimization of many real-life applications in structural engineering still remains largely intractable due to the computationally intensive nature of numerical solvers like finite element method. Thus, in this paper, an alternate route of metamodel-based design optimization methodology is proposed in multi-scale framework based on a symbolic regression implemented using genetic programming (GP) coupled with d-optimal design. This approach drastically cuts the computational costs by replacing the finite element module with appropriately constructed robust and efficient metamodels. Resulting models are compact, have good interpretability and assume a free-form expression capable of capturing the non-linearly, complexity and vastness of the design space. Two robust nature-inspired optimization algorithms, viz. multi-objective genetic algorithm and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, are used to generate Pareto optimal solutions for several test problems with varying complexity. TOPSIS, a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is then applied to choose the best alternative among the Pareto optimal sets. Finally, the applicability of GP in efficiently tackling multi-scale optimization problems of composites is investigated, where a real-life scenario is explored by varying fractions of pertinent engineering materials to bring about property changes in the final composite structure across two different scales. The study reveals that a microscale optimization leads to better optimized solutions, demonstrating the advantage of carrying out a multi-scale optimization without any additional computational burden.},

  abstract     = {The intrusion detection is an essential section in network security because of its immense volume of threats which bothers the computing systems. The real-time intrusion detection dataset comprises redundant or irrelevant features. The duplicate features make it quite challenging to locate the patterns for intrusion detection. Hybrid optimization scheme (HOS) is designed for combining adaptive artificial bee colony (AABC) with adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) for detecting intrusive activities. The schemes are aggregated for locating improved optimization-based outcomes, and the precision during categorization is acquired using tenfold cross-validation scheme. The main objective of the proposed method is to improve the rate of precision in intrusion activities in internetwork by choosing the relevant features. Effectiveness of the hybrid categorization scheme is accessed using an NSL-KDD dataset. Single feature selection method and random feature selection method are used to assess the proposed HOS intrusion detection approaches. The effectiveness of the designed scheme is evaluated with existing machine learning schemes such as Naive Bayes, AABC, APSO, and support vector machine, which outperform the HOS.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of the Internet promotes the growth of textual data, and people get the information they need from the amount of textual data to solve problems. The textual data may include some potential information like the opinions of the crowd, the opinions of the product, or some market-relevant information. However, some problems that point to “How to get features from the text” must be solved. The model of extracting the text features by using the neural network method is called neural network language model. The features are based on n-gram Model concept, which are the co-occurrence relationship between the vocabularies. The word vectors are important because the sentence vectors or the document vectors still have to understand the relationship between the words, and based on this, this study discusses the word vectors. This study assumes that the words contain “the meaning in sentences” and “the position of grammar.” This study uses recurrent neural network with attention mechanism to establish a language model. This study uses Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and NLPCC2017 text datasets. According to these datasets, the proposed models provide the better performance by the perplexity.},

  abstract     = {Recently, artificial intelligence technologies have received considerable attention because of their practical applications in various fields. The key factor in this prosperity is deep learning which is inspired by the information processing in biological brains. In this study, we apply one of the representative deep learning techniques multi-channel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the fluctuation of the stock index. Furthermore, we optimize the network topology of CNN to improve the model performance. CNN has many hyper-parameters that need to be adjusted for constructing an optimal model that can learn the data patterns efficiently. In particular, we focus on the optimization of feature extraction part of CNN, because this is the most important part of the computational procedure of CNN. This study proposes a method to systematically optimize the parameters for the CNN model by using genetic algorithm (GA). To verify the effectiveness of our model, we compare the prediction result with standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) and CNN models. The experimental results show that the GA-CNN outperforms the comparative models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach of GA and CNN.},

NFC-Net mainly targets resource constraint environment where there is a limited computation power or inadequate training samples or restricted training time. Previous approaches to handwritten script recognition included handcrafted features such as structure-based features and texture-based features. In contrast, here our model learns relatively different features from raw input pixels using NFC-Net. Various parameters of the NFC-Net are adjusted to present a vast and comprehensive study of the neural net in the domain of handwritten script recognition. In order to evaluate the performance of the NFC-Net with suitable parameter estimation, a dataset of 18,000 handwritten multiscript word images consisting of 1500 text words from each of the 12 officially recognized Indic scripts has been considered and a maximum script recognition accuracy of 96.30\% is noted. Our proposed model also performs better than some of the recently published script recognition methods in bi-script, tri-script, tetra-script and 12-script scenarios. It has been additionally tested on the RaFD and BHCCD datasets with improved results to prove dataset independency of our model.},

Numerous solutions have been proposed by various researchers so far for intrusion detection in networks. However, the need to efficiently identifying any intrusion in the network is on the rise as the network attacks are increasing exponentially. This research work proposes a deep learning-based system for hybrid intrusion detection and signature generation of unknown web attacks referred as D-Sign. D-Sign is capable of successfully detecting and generating attack signatures with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. It has been for attack detection and signature generation of web-based attacks. D-Sign has reported significantly low False Positives and False Negatives.

A memory to keep the best ants and feature dimension-dependent pheromone update has also been used to perform FS in a multi-objective manner. Our proposed approach has been evaluated on various real-life datasets, taken from UCI Machine Learning repository and NIPS2003 FS challenge, using K-nearest neighbors and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. The experimental outcomes have been compared to some popular FS methods. The comparison of results clearly shows that our method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art algorithms used for FS.

  abstract     = {Precise measurement or estimation of evaporation losses is extremely important for the development of water resource management strategies and its effective implementation, particularly in drought-prone areas for increasing agricultural productivity. Evaporation can either be measured directly using evaporimeters, or it can be estimated by means of empirical models with the help of climatic factors influencing evaporation process. In general, variations in climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunshine and solar radiation influence and control the evaporation process to a great extent. Due to the highly nonlinear nature of evaporation phenomenon, it is invariably very difficult to model the evaporation process through climatic factors especially in diverse agro-climatic situations. The present investigation is carried out to examine the potential of deep neural network architecture with long short-term memory cell (Deep-LSTM) to estimate daily pan evaporation with minimum input features. Depending upon the availability of climatic data Deep-LSTM models with different input combinations are proposed to model daily evaporation losses in three agro-climatic zones of Chhattisgarh state in east-central India. The performance of the proposed Deep-LSTM models are compared with commonly used multilayer artificial neural network and empirical methods (Hargreaves and Blaney–Criddle). The results of the investigations in terms of various performance evaluation criteria reveal that the proposed Deep-LSTM structure is able to successfully model the daily evaporation losses with improved accuracy as compared to other models considered in this study.},

This decomposition technique is also used to reduce the network state space of the cell cycle network of fission yeast for finding the singleton attractors. Some special classes of Boolean functions with respect to the interaction graphs have been discussed. A unique recursive procedure is devised which uses the Cartesian product of sets starting from the set of one-variable Boolean function. Interaction graphs generated with these Boolean functions have only positive/negative edges, and the corresponding state spaces have periodic attractors with length one/two.},

We deeply analyzed the data using an unsupervised classification approach, obtaining a model where the number of distinct user profiles and the number of features were considered not trivial as well as not too complex for museum stakeholders. We observed that some optimistic expectations about visitor performances were only partially met, devising possible explanations in terms of the different user profiles and features of the model.

  abstract     = {Word embeddings learned on external resources have succeeded in improving many NLP tasks. However, existing embedding models still face challenges in situations where fine-gained semantic information is required, e.g., distinguishing antonyms from synonyms. In this paper, a distant supervision method is proposed to guide the training process by introducing semantic knowledge in a thesaurus. Specifically, the proposed model shortens the distance between target word and its synonyms by controlling the movements of them in both unidirectional and bidirectional, yielding three different models, namely Unidirectional Movement of Target Model (UMT), Unidirectional Movement of Synonyms Model (UMS) and Bidirectional Movement of Target and Synonyms Model (BMTS). Extensive computational experiments have been conducted, and results are collected for analysis purpose. The results show that the proposed models not only efficiently capture semantic information of antonyms but also achieve significant improvements in both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation tasks. To validate the performance of the proposed models (UMT, UMS and BMTS), results are compared against well-known models, namely Skip-gram, JointRCM, WE-TD and dict2vec. The performances of the proposed models are evaluated on four tasks (benchmarks): word analogy (intrinsic), synonym-antonym detection (intrinsic), sentence matching (extrinsic) and text classification (extrinsic). A case study is provided to illustrate the working of the proposed models in an effective manner. Overall, a distant supervision method based on paradigmatic relations is proposed for learning word embeddings and it outperformed when compared against other existing models.},

Through continuous patterns selection, the proposed method ultimately achieves effective learning of unlabeled patterns. Furthermore, using local density and relative distance can effectively respond to the relationship between patterns. Compared with the traditional distance-based similarity measure, the ability to deal with complex data is improved.

  abstract     = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are operated on battery source, and the sensor nodes are used for collecting the information from the environment and transmitting the same to the base station. The sensor nodes consume more energy for the process of data communication and also affect the network lifetime. Energy efficiency is one of the important features for designing the sensor networks. Clustering technique is mainly used to perform the energy-efficient data transmission that consumes the minimum energy and also prolongs the lifetime of the network. In this paper, a Hybrid approach of Firefly Algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization (HFAPSO) is proposed for finding the optimal cluster head selection in the LEACH-C algorithm. The hybrid algorithm improves the global search behavior of fireflies by using PSO and achieves optimal positioning of the cluster heads. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated by using the number of alive nodes, residual energy and throughput. The results show the improvement in network lifetime, thus increasing the alive nodes and reducing the energy utilization. While making a comparison with the firefly algorithm, it has been found that the proposed methodology has achieved better throughput and residual energy.},

Earlier studies have reported that ELM performs better than SVM for groundwater level prediction. This has been verified by comparing the prediction of groundwater levels at six locations in the district of Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, using ANN, GP, SVM and ELM. Based on the comparison, it is observed that the performance of ELM is the best compared to other models. ELM is capable of predicting the nonlinear behavior of the groundwater levels. SVM performs better than GP and ANN. The performance of GP and ANN is analogous. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to enhance the performance of SVM by using SVM hybrid models such as SVM-QPSO and SVM-RBF, and the same has been compared with SVM and ELM. Results indicate that the performance of SVM-QPSO is far better compared to the performance of SVM and SVM-RBF. Moreover, performance of ELM is observed to be the best, but on some occasions, SVM-QPSO performs on par with ELM.},

  abstract     = {Many crime reports are available online in various blogs and Newswire. Though manual annotation of these massive reports is quite tedious for crime data analysis, it gives an overall crime scenario of all over the world. This motivates us to propose a framework for crime data analysis based on the online reports. Initially, the method extracts the crime reports and identifies named entities. The intermediate sequence of context words between every consecutive pair of named entities is termed as a crime vector that provides relationships between the entities. The feature vectors for each entity pair are generated from these crime vectors using the Word2Vec model. The paper considers three different types of named entity pairs to facilitate the major crime data analysis task, and for each type, similarity between every pair of entities is measured using respective feature vectors. For each type of named entity pair, a separate weighted graph is generated with entity pairs as vertices and similarity score between them as the weight of the corresponding edge. Then, Infomap, a graph-based clustering algorithm, is applied to obtain optimal set of clusters of entity pairs and a representative entity pair of each cluster. Each cluster is labelled by the relationship, represented by the crime vector, of its representative entity pair. In reality, all the entity pairs in a cluster may not reflect contextual similarity with their representative entity pair. So the clusters are further partitioned into subclusters based on WordNet-based path similarity measure which makes the entity pairs in each subcluster more contextually similar compared to their original cluster. These subclusters provide us various statistical crime information over the time period. The method is experimented only using the crime reports related to crime against women in India. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the method compared to others for analysing the crime data.},

Nevertheless, the evolution of e-learning systems is yet to provide full adaptability to the e-learners due to several weaknesses in the systems. Normally, e-learners have varying degrees of progress in their respective learning methodology. Over a period of time, this affects the e-learners performance while providing the same course to all e-learner. Hence, there is a need to create the adaptive e-learning environment to offer the appropriate e-learning contents to all the e-learners. This proposed work puts forth a fuzzy-based novel, intelligent and adaptive e-learning context for a programming language and offers appropriate domain contents to the e-learners which shall update the e-learners better than the previous works. The dependency relation among the concepts in the programming language is provided using fuzzy cognitive map which in turn paves the way for the development of the existing e-learning system. The fuzzy sets and the fuzzy rules represent the e-learners knowledge level and help in providing appropriate recommendations for the previous and subsequent related concepts in a fuzzy cognitive map. Evaluations of the proposed intelligent e-learning system provide promising results in the precise categorization of e-learners and to find their true knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, crime is a major threat to the society that affects the normal life of human beings all over the world. It is very important to make the world free from all aspects of crime activities. The main motivation of this work is to understand various crime patterns for avoiding and preventing the crime events to occur in future and save the world from such curse. Though research is going on for solving such problems, no work is noticed to handle the roughness or ambiguity that exists in the crime reports. The present work extracts all possible crime features from the crime reports and selects only the important features required for crime pattern analysis. For this purpose, it develops a purely supervised feature selection model integrating rough set theory and graph theory (spanning tree of a directed weighted graph). The crime reports are preprocessed, and crime features are extracted to represent each report as a feature vector (i.e., a set of distinct crime features). For crime pattern analysis, the main objective of our work, all extracted features are not necessarily essential, rather a minimal subset of relevant features are sufficient. Thus, feature selection is the main contribution in the paper that not only enhances the efficiency of subsequent mining process but also increases its correctness. The rough set theory-based relative indiscernibility relation is defined to measure the similarity between two features relative to the crime type. Based on the similarity score, a weighted and directed graph has been constructed that comprises the features as nodes and the inverse of the similarity score representing the similarity of feature v to u as the weight of the corresponding edge. Then, a minimal spanning tree (termed as rough-spanning tree) is generated using Edmond/Chu–Liu algorithm from the constructed directed graph and the importance of the nodes in the spanning tree is measured using the weights of the edges and the degrees (in-degrees and out-degrees) of the nodes in the spanning tree. Finally, a feature selection algorithm has been proposed that selects the most important node and remove it from the spanning tree iteratively until the modified graph (not necessarily a tree) becomes a null graph. The selected nodes are considered as the important feature subset sufficient for crime pattern analysis. The method is evaluated using various statistical measures and compared with related state-of-the-art methods to express its effectiveness in crime pattern analysis. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, a popular nonparametric version of the two-sample t test, is done to express that the proposed supervised model is statistically significant.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the application of a neuro-fuzzy learning method based on data streams for high impedance fault (HIF) detection in medium-voltage power lines. A wavelet-packet-transform-based feature extraction method combined with a variation of evolving neuro-fuzzy network with fluctuating thresholds is considered for recognition of spatial–temporal patterns in the data. Wavelet families such as Haar, Symlet, Daubechie, Coiflet and Biorthogonal were investigated as a way to provide the most discriminative features for fault detection. The proposed evolving neuro-fuzzy classification model has shown to be particularly suitable for the problem because the HIF environment is subject to concept changes. Different from other statistical and intelligent approaches to the problem, the developed neuro-fuzzy model for HIF classification is not only parametrically, but also structurally adaptive to cope with nonstationarities and novelties. New neurons and connections are incrementally added to the neuro-fuzzy network when necessary for the identification of new patterns, such as faults and usual transients including sag, swell and spikes due to the switching of 3-phase capacitors and energization of transformers. Experimental evaluations compare the proposed classifier with other well-established computational intelligence methods, viz. multilayer perceptron neural network, learning vector quantization neural network and a support vector machine model. Results have shown that the evolving neuro-fuzzy system is effective and robust to changes. The system is able to maintain its detection and classification accuracy even in situations in which other classifiers exhibit a significant drop in accuracy due to gradual and abrupt changes of the fault patterns. Fuzzy rules are useful for interpretability purposes and help to enhance model credibility for decision making.},

The primary objective of this investigation is to find the best optimized model to maintain the best glucose monitoring and insulin delivery. In order to tune the PID controller to decide on the efficient insulin injection, an investigation was conducted for an optimization algorithm [such as genetic algorithm, gravitational search algorithm, particle swarm optimization, sequential randomized algorithm, brain storm optimization algorithm, class topper optimization, and gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWOA)].

Benefitting from the fact that the QP over a single sphere can be solved in a closed form by solving a secular equation, we derive a tighter bound of the minimiser of the secular equation. We also propose to generate a new positive semidefinite matrix with a low condition number from the matrices in the quadratic constraint, which is shown to improve convergence of the proposed augmented-Lagrangian algorithm.

This work proposed a bi-objective-based antlion optimization algorithm (BO-ALO) which is aimed to improve the geometrical and evolutionary relationship among the protein structures. The bi-objective functions are the RMSD and TM scores which aim to minimize the RMSD score and maximize the TM score. The BO-ALO method has been compared with various widespread existing methods such as SPalignNS, UniAlign, DALI, MICAN, GANGSTA, DeepAlign, TM-align, CE, ant colony optimization and artificial bee colony optimization methods. The experiments were taken from the benchmark datasets, namely SCOPe and CATH. Also, the predicted alignments were compared with gold standard benchmark databases such as CDD, MALIDUP, MALISAM and HOMSTRAD. The outcomes of the proposed method have better bi-objective function scores and performance measures than other well-known existing approaches. This work also evaluates the proposed method with its biological significance of predicting the common gene ontology functions among the aligned protein structures. Finally, the statistical significance of the BO-ALO is computed by employing the Wilcoxon matched-signed rank test.

Moreover, the structural design of the system is optimized by a memetic algorithm. The memetic algorithm combines features of the artificial bee colony method and the covariance matrix adaption evolutionary strategy method. The simulation and experiment results show that the receiver coil can receive about dozens of millivolt when the power transfer distance is about 15 cm. This means the proposed system is suitable for implantable biomedical devices. Compared with the two-coil WPT system, in addition, the power received in the receiver coil of three-coil WPT system can increase about 48\%.},

  abstract     = {Current group decision-making fuzzy analytic hierarchy processes (FAHPs) have two major problems. First, inconsistent fuzzy pairwise comparison results, rather than compromised fuzzy weights, are aggregated. Second, a consensus among decision makers (DMs) cannot be guaranteed. To address these problems, in this study, the guaranteed-consensus posterior-aggregation FAHP (GCPA-FAHP) method was proposed. In the proposed methodology, the membership functions of the linguistic terms for performing fuzzy pairwise comparisons were designed to guarantee a consensus among the DMs and can be modified afterward to enhance the estimation precision. In addition, fuzzy intersection and center of gravity were used to aggregate and defuzzify the estimated fuzzy weights. The GCPA-FAHP method was applied to a real case to evaluate its effectiveness. The experimental results revealed that the GCPA-FAHP method guaranteed consensus among the DMs and improved the precision of estimating fuzzy weights.},

The proposed substitution boxes have good algebraic properties and are able to resist against algebraic attacks. Second, we propose a new method for creating multiple substitution boxes with the same algebraic properties using permutation of symmetric group on a set of size 8 and bitwise XOR operation. Third, the proposed substitution boxes with the same algebraic properties are then applied to images and it is observed that the statistical properties of substituted images are different from each other. The simulation results and statistical and security analysis for the proposed substitution boxes are very competitive.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an improved computer-aided diagnosis model to identify mammographic images as normal or abnormal, and further, benign or malignant. The proposed scheme employs all the steps associated with other classification schemes; however, the contribution of the suggested scheme is fourfold. Initially, a fusion-based feature extraction method is employed to obtain the features using a combination of 2-D block discrete wavelet transform (2D-BDWT) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Next, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to reduce the large dimension of the feature vector. Furthermore, to select the most optimal features from the reduced set of features, forest optimization algorithm (FOA) is used. The FOA-based feature selection algorithm is utilized as a wrapper-based technique which includes both feature selection and classification. In the proposed framework, several classifiers, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and decision tree (C4.5), are applied. The proposed method is compared with the benchmark schemes on two standard datasets, namely Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). Simulation results and analysis confirm that the proposed scheme brings potential improvements with respect to classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under curve, F-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient. The classification accuracy is measured with respect to normal versus abnormal and further, benign versus malignant. The proposed scheme with different combinations of classifiers, namely 2D-BDWT + GLCM + PCA + FOA + SVM, 2D-BDWT + GLCM + PCA + FOA + k-NN, and 2D-BDWT + GLCM + PCA + FOA + C4.5, achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 100\% for both the MIAS and DDSM datasets.},

The beam effective stiffness can be readily computed using mechanics, but the evaluation of column stiffness is a complicated process and the use of support vector regression helps in this regard. Therefore, in this study, an attempt is made to predict the effective stiffness ratio of reinforced concrete columns using support vector regression (SVR) approach. A data set of 208 samples, which are collected through nonlinear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete buildings using SAP2000 software, is utilized to develop the SVR model. The input parameters considered are reinforcement percentage, axial load and depth of the column section in both the perpendicular directions, and the output parameter is the effective stiffness ratio of columns. Three different kernel parameters are used, namely exponential radial basis function (ERBF), Gaussian radial basis function and polynomial function for SVR modelling, among which ERBF is found to be the most suitable one. The obtained results indicate that the statistical performance of the SVR-ERBF model is better than the models with other two kernels in predicting the effective stiffness ratio of reinforced concrete columns. Performance of the SVR model is compared with the results of multi-variable regression analysis. In addition to that, a sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the influence of each input parameter on output responses.},

The performance of the proposed OB-C-ALO is evaluated over a set of benchmark problems of different varieties of characteristics and analysed statistically by performing Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The proposed version then utilizes K-means clustering by refining the clusters formed using K-means as objective function.

Entity types and relation types both contain various kinds of information content though only a subset of them are helpful in the specific triples. Although significant progress has been made by existing models, they have two major shortcomings. First, these models seldom learn an explicit representation of entities and relations with semantic information. Second, they reason without discriminating distinct role types that the same entity with multiple types plays in different triples. To address these issues, we develop a novel path-based reasoning with constrained type attention model, which tries to identify entity types by leveraging relation type constraints in the corresponding triples. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms the state of the art on a real-world dataset. Further analyses also confirm that both word-level and triple-level attention mechanisms of our model are effective.},

  abstract     = {The protection of mutually coupled series capacitor-compensated (SCC) parallel transmission lines is a more complicated task than uncompensated lines due to the effect of mutual coupling, inter-circuit faults, and non-linearity of effective impedance of SCC line. A method that can overcome these issues and still work efficiently is a supervised learning-based method which is an adaptive technique. Hence, in this work, various supervised learning-based intelligent schemes like artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and decision tree (DT) are employed to find a suitable method for the protection of series capacitor-compensated lines. Discrete wavelet transform has been used to process the three-phase current signals of the parallel lines measured at one terminal only. A moving window of 20 samples is selected, and approximate wavelet coefficient is calculated up to level 1 using DB-4 mother wavelet. The resultant is then given as input to the intelligent schemes (ANN, SVM, and DT). The proposed intelligent schemes have been tested with variety of fault conditions such as inter-circuit faults, cross-country faults, transforming faults, single-circuit operation, and high resistance faults. A large number of fault simulation studies corroborate that DT-based fault classification method is better than ANN and SVM. The accuracy of faulty phase and ground identification scheme is 100\% for all the tested fault cases. Hence, the proposed supervised learning-based intelligent method can be implemented in real power system network effectively.},

In this study, eight standard imbalanced datasets were used for testing our proposed algorithm. For verification, the results of the SSD-SVM algorithm are compared with grid search, which is a conventional method of searching parameter values, and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The experimental results show that the SSD-SVM algorithm is capable of finding near-optimal values of SVMs parameters.

In this study, during seed formation in the TSA, trees were selected using the tournament selection method rather than by random means. Efforts were also made to enhance high-dimensional solutions, utilizing problem dimensions, D, of 20, 50, 100 and 1000 by optimizing the search tendency parameter within the structure of the algorithm, resulting in a modified TSA (MTSA). Empirical test data, convergence graphs and box plots were obtained by applying the MTSA to numerical benchmark functions. In addition, the results of the current algorithms in the literature were compared with the MTSA and the statistical test results were presented. The results from this analysis demonstrated that the MTSA could achieve superior results to the original TSA.},

In order to better capture the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics and the seasonal cycles of future electricity demand data, a new concept of the integrated model is developed and successfully applied to research the forecast of electricity demand in this paper. The proposed model combines adaptive Fourier decomposition method, a new signal preprocessing technology, for extracting useful element from the original electricity demand series through filtering the noise factors. Considering the seasonal term existing in the decomposed series, it should be eliminated through the seasonal adjustment method, in which the seasonal indexes are calculated and should multiply the forecasts back to restore the final forecast. Besides, a newly proposed moth-flame optimization algorithm is used to ensure the suitable parameters of the least square support vector machine which can generate the forecasts. Finally, the case studies of Australia demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed integrated model. Simultaneously, it can provide a better concept of modeling for electricity demand prediction over different forecasting horizons.},

This paper tackles the problem of fully automatic extraction of the foreground on green-screen images with extraction of the corresponding alpha matte. The method is based on a multi-layer perceptron that assigns an alpha value, from a discrete set of ten alpha values, to each patch on a green-screen image. The approach for assigning an alpha value to an image patch is based on a set of features that enhance discrimination between foreground and background. The classifier is trained to learn to separate foreground objects from green-screen backgrounds as well as to generate the corresponding alpha matte map required for subsequent digital compositing. To test how the proposed approach handles alpha matte extraction under unsuitable conditions, a 64-image dataset was generated. The main contribution is that our method overcomes two challenges publicly posed within a dataset of green-screen image sequences, donated by Hollywood Camera Work LLC. Tests with this dataset generate high-quality visual results for those two cases. These results are confirmed by comparing the proposed fully automatic alpha matte extraction with that based on the use of Adobe After Effects Creative Cloud, an application which heavily depends on user interaction.},

This problem is more difficult when each user submits multi-tasks to the cloud environment. Hence, CSP needs an efficient framework to optimize multiple objectives, e.g., cost, time, and load balancing as well as to manage tasks of different users in a secure way. This paper presents a new efficient scheduling framework, called highest priority first execute (HPFE), for serving multiple users with multiple tasks in a secure and optimized way. Computational results show that the proposed HPFE reduces the makespan and increases the load balancing degree comparing to the most recent algorithms; Min–Min, Max–Min, minimum completion time, first come first serve, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.},

In this work, it is aimed to aggregate both CKs and MKs autonomously without the need of kernel coefficient adjustment manually. Convex combination of predefined kernel functions is implemented by using multiple kernel extreme learning machine. Thus, complex optimization processes of standard MKL are disposed of and the facility of multi-class classification is profited. Different types of kernel functions are placed into MKs in order to realize hybrid kernel scenario. The proposed methodology is performed over Pavia University, Indian Pines, and Salinas hyperspectral scenes that have ground-truth information. Multiple composite kernels are constructed using Gaussian, polynomial, and logarithmic kernel functions with various parameters, and then the obtained results are presented comparatively along with the state-of-the-art standard machine learning, MKL, and CK methods.},

  abstract     = {The automatic classification of abstract sentences into its main elements (background, objectives, methods, results, conclusions) is a key tool to support scientific database querying, to summarize relevant literature works and to assist in the writing of new abstracts. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach based on a convolutional layer and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit to classify sentences of abstracts. First, the proposed neural network was tested on a publicly available repository containing 20 thousand abstracts from the biomedical domain. Competitive results were achieved, with weight-averaged Precision, Recall and F1-score values around 91\%, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 99\%, which are higher when compared to a state-of-the-art neural network. Then, a crowdsourcing approach using gamification was adopted to create a new comprehensive set of 4111 classified sentences from the computer science domain, focused on social media abstracts. The results of applying the same deep learning modeling technique trained with 3287 (80\%) of the available sentences were below the ones obtained for the larger biomedical dataset, with weight-averaged Precision, Recall and F1-score values between 73 and 76\%, and an AUC of 91\%. Considering the dataset dimension as a likely important factor for such performance decrease, a data augmentation approach was further applied. This involved the use of text mining to translate sentences of the computer science abstract corpus while retaining the same meaning. Such approach resulted in slight improvements (around 2 percentage points) for the weight-averaged Recall and F1-score values.},

The two domains contain images from the same classes, but these images look different. Recent approaches use generative adversarial networks in various configurations and architectures to perform the translation. By using GANs, they inevitably inherit their problems like training instability and mode collapse. We propose a novel approach to the problem that does not use a GAN. Instead, it relies on an hierarchical architecture that encapsulates information of the target domain by using individually trained networks. This hierarchical architecture is then trained as one unified deep network. Using this approach, we show that images from the original domain are translated to the target domain both for the case when there is a one-to-one correspondence between the images of the two domains and for the case that such correspondence information is absent. We visualize and evaluate the translation from one information domain to the other and discuss the proposed model’s relation to the conditional generative adversarial networks. We further argue that deep learning can benefit from the proposed hierarchical architecture.},

  abstract     = {Two difficulties continue to burden deep learning researchers and users: (1) neural networks are cumbersome tools, and (2) the activity of the fully connected (FC) layers remains mysterious. We make contributions to these two issues by considering a modified version of the FC layer we call a block diagonal inner product (BDIP) layer. These modified layers have weight matrices that are block diagonal, turning a single FC layer into a set of densely connected neuron groups; they can be achieved by either initializing a purely block diagonal weight matrix or by iteratively pruning off-diagonal block entries. This idea is a natural extension of group, or depthwise separable, convolutional layers. This method condenses network storage and speeds up the run time without significant adverse effect on the testing accuracy, addressing the first problem. Looking at the distribution of the weights through training when varying the number of blocks in a layer gives insight into the second problem. We observe that, even after thousands of training iterations, inner product layers have singular value distributions that resemble that of truly random matrices with iid entries and that each block in a BDIP layer behaves like a smaller copy. For network architectures differing only by the number of blocks in one inner product layer, the ratio of the variance of the weights remains approximately constant for thousands of iterations, that is, the relationship in structure is preserved in the parameter distribution.},

  abstract     = {Zebrafish pretectal neurons exhibit specificities for large-field optic flow patterns associated with rotatory or translatory body motion. We investigate the hypothesis that these specificities reflect the input statistics of natural optic flow. Realistic motion sequences were generated using computer graphics simulating self-motion in an underwater scene. Local retinal motion was estimated with a motion detector and encoded in four populations of directionally tuned retinal ganglion cells, represented as two signed input variables. This activity was then used as input into one of three learning networks: a sparse coding network (competitive learning), PCA whitening with subsequent sparse coding, and a backpropagation network (supervised learning). All simulations developed specificities for optic flow which are comparable to those found in a neurophysiological study (Kubo et al. in Neuron 81(6):1344–1359, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.02.043), but relative frequencies of the various neuronal responses were best modeled by the sparse coding approach without whitening. We conclude that the optic flow neurons in the zebrafish pretectum do reflect the optic flow statistics. The predicted vectorial receptive fields show not only typical optic flow fields but also “Gabor” and dipole-shaped patterns that likely reflect difference fields needed for reconstruction by linear superposition.},

  abstract     = {The automatic analysis of ultrasound sequences can substantially improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis. This article presents an attempt to automate the challenging task of measuring the vascular diameter of the fetal abdominal aorta from ultrasound images. We propose a neural network architecture consisting of three blocks: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the extraction of imaging features, a convolution gated recurrent unit (C-GRU) for exploiting the temporal redundancy of the signal, and a regularized loss function, called CyclicLoss, to impose our prior knowledge about the periodicity of the observed signal. The solution is investigated with a cohort of 25 ultrasound sequences acquired during the third-trimester pregnancy check, and with 1000 synthetic sequences. In the extraction of features, it is shown that a shallow CNN outperforms two other deep CNNs with both the real and synthetic cohorts, suggesting that echocardiographic features are optimally captured by a reduced number of CNN layers. The proposed architecture, working with the shallow CNN, reaches an accuracy substantially superior to previously reported methods, providing an average reduction of the mean squared error from 0.31 (state-of-the-art) to 0.09 $$\mathrm{mm}^2$$, and a relative error reduction from 8.1 to 5.3\%.

  abstract     = {With the emergence of online learning systems which generate ever-growing amounts of data, quantifying the uncertainty in predictions regarding the system’s operation is becoming increasingly more important. Prediction intervals offer a powerful tool for assessing prediction uncertainty in artificial neural network applications; nevertheless, little work has been conducted on constructing prediction intervals for online learning applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach which employs artificial neural networks to directly estimate prediction intervals for both batch and online approximation scenarios. The aim of the approach is to provide high-quality prediction intervals, combining high coverage probability for future observations with small and thus informative interval widths. Compared with three popular methods for offline construction of prediction intervals, the proposed approach demonstrates a strong capacity for reliably representing prediction uncertainty in real-world regression applications. The approach is extended to adaptive approximation, whereby four online learning schemes are proposed to iteratively update prediction intervals based on recent measurements, requiring a reduced computational cost compared to offline approximation. The four online prediction intervals methods are compared over two synthetic and one real-world regression datasets, whereby data arrive in a sequential manner. Our results suggest the potential of an online learning scheme relying on a human-like memory mechanism, to construct high-quality online prediction intervals, capable of adapting to dynamic changes in data patterns. The proposed method is associated with low computational cost—an attractive feature for online learning applications requiring real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {Feed-forward, fully connected artificial neural networks or the so-called multi-layer perceptrons are well-known universal approximators. However, their learning performance varies significantly depending on the function or the solution space that they attempt to approximate. This is mainly because of their homogenous configuration based solely on the linear neuron model. Therefore, while they learn very well those problems with a monotonous, relatively simple and linearly separable solution space, they may entirely fail to do so when the solution space is highly nonlinear and complex. Sharing the same linear neuron model with two additional constraints (local connections and weight sharing), this is also true for the conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and it is, therefore, not surprising that in many challenging problems only the deep CNNs with a massive complexity and depth can achieve the required diversity and the learning performance. In order to address this drawback and also to accomplish a more generalized model over the convolutional neurons, this study proposes a novel network model, called operational neural networks (ONNs), which can be heterogeneous and encapsulate neurons with any set of operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex and multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training data. Finally, the training method to back-propagate the error through the operational layers of ONNs is formulated. Experimental results over highly challenging problems demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of ONNs even with few neurons and hidden layers.},

  abstract     = {Outliers are a critical factor that affects the accuracy of data-based predictions and some other data-based processing; thus, outliers must be effectively detected as soon as possible to improve the credibility of the data. In recent years, massive outlier detection approaches have been proposed for static data and precise data; however, the uncertainty and weight information of each item was not considered in this prior work. Moreover, traditional outlier detection approaches only take the deviation degree of each data element as the standard for determining outliers; therefore, the detected outliers do not fit the definition of an outlier (i.e., rarely appearing and different from most of the other data). Aimed at these problems, a minimal weighted infrequent itemset mining-based outlier detection approach that can be applied to an uncertain data stream, called MWIFIM–OD–UDS, is proposed in this paper to effectively detect implicit outliers, which have a rarely occurring frequency, uncertainty and a certain weight of the itemset, while the characteristics of the data stream are considered. In particular, a matrix structure-based approach that is called MWIFIM–UDS is proposed to mine the minimal weighted infrequent itemsets (MWiFIs) from an uncertain data stream, and then, the MWIFIM–OD–UDS method is proposed based on the mined MWiFIs and the designed deviation indexes. Experimental results show that the proposed MWIFIM–OD–UDS method outperforms the frequent itemset mining-based outlier detection methods, FindFPOF and LFP, in terms of its runtime and detection accuracy.},

However, traditional spectral clustering methods usually ignore the intersection problem that may exist between the different clusters of data, so the resulting matrix could be unreliable. This paper proposes a new local covariance-based method to solve the above problem. Specifically, we first learn an initial affinity matrix by adding the local covariance into traditional matrix construction step, which could guarantee the obtained matrix avoids the impact of the intersection point while preserving the neighborhood relationship of data. We then employ the normalized Laplacian on the obtained matrix to further improve the clustering performance. The ACC and NMI of the proposed method increased by 6.40\% and 5.33\% on average compared with six classical spectral clustering methods. Experimental evaluation on eight benchmark data sets shows that the proposed method has better clustering performance.},

  abstract     = {Mu rhythm is a spontaneous neural response occurring during a motor imagery (MI) task and has been increasingly applied to the design of brain–computer interface (BCI). Accurate classification of MI is usually rather difficult to be achieved since mu rhythm is very weak and likely to be contaminated by other background noises. As an extension of the single layer feedforward network, extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently proven to be more efficient than support vector machine that is a benchmark for MI-related EEG classification. With probabilistic inference, this study introduces a sparse Bayesian ELM (SBELM)-based algorithm to improve the classification performance of MI. SBELM is able to automatically control the model complexity and exclude redundant hidden neurons by combining advantageous of both ELM and sparse Bayesian learning. The effectiveness of SBELM for MI-related EEG classification is validated on a public dataset from BCI Competition IV IIb in comparison with several other competing algorithms. Superior classification accuracy confirms that the proposed SBELM-based algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of an MI BCI.},

  abstract     = {Haze environments pose serious challenges for object detection, making existing methods difficult to generate satisfied results. However, there is no escape from haze environments in real-world applications, especially in water and bad weather. Hence, it is necessary to enable object detection methods to conquer the difficulties caused by the haze effect. In spite of the diversity between various conditions, haze environments share a common characteristic that the haze concentration is changed with the scene depth. Hence, this haze concentration feature can be used as a representation of the scene depth. This provides us a novel cue available for object detection in haze that the object-background depth contrast can be identified. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based object detection method by jointly using the color and depth features. A pair of background models is built separately with the color and depth features, forming two streams of our multi-task learning framework. The final object detection results are generated by fusing the results given by color and depth features. In contrast to existing object detection methods, the novelty of our method lies in the combination of the color and depth features under a unified multi-task learning mechanism, which is experimentally demonstrated to be robust against challenging haze environments.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised feature selection is an important machine learning task since the manual annotated data are dramatically expensive to obtain and therefore very limited. However, due to the existence of noise and outliers in different data samples, feature selection without the help of discriminant information embedded in the annotated data is quite challenging. To relieve these limitations, we investigate the embedding of spectral learning into a general sparse regression framework for unsupervised feature selection. Generally, the proposed general spectral sparse regression (GSSR) method handles the outlier features by learning the joint sparsity and the noisy features by preserving the local structures of data, jointly. Specifically, GSSR is conducted in two stages. First, the classic sparse dictionary learning method is used to build the bases of original data. After that, the original data are project to the basis space by learning a new representation via GSSR. In GSSR, robust loss function $$\ell _{2,r}{-}{norm}(0&lt;r\le 2)$$ and $$\ell _{2,p}-{norm}(0&lt;p\le 1)$$ instead of the traditional F norm and least square loss function are simultaneously considered as the reconstruction term and sparse regularization term for sparse regression. Furthermore, the local topological structures of the new representations are preserved by spectral learning based on the Laplacian term. The overall objective function in GSSR is optimized and proved to be converging. Experimental results on several publicly datasets have demonstrated the validity of our algorithm, which outperformed the state-of-the-art feature selections in terms of classification performance.},

Our network draws on U-shape structure, and we embed residual unit into network. In Res-CNN, we use residual unit to alleviate the degradation problem and use multi-modality to exploit the complementary information in MRIs. Before training the model, we use data fusion and data augmentation methods to increase the number of training images. Seven neural networks are extensively evaluated on two acute ischemic stroke datasets. Res-CNN shows good performance compared with other six networks both in single modality and multi-modality. Furthermore, compared with the gold standard segmentation manually labeled by two neurologists on a local test dataset, our network achieves the best results in seven neural networks. The average Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance of our method are 74.20\% and 2.33 mm, respectively.

At the region proposal stage, we adopt a deep feature pyramid architecture with lateral connections, which makes the semantic feature of small object more sensitive. At the classification stage, densely connected convolutional network is used to strengthen the feature transmission and multiplexed, which leads to more accurate classification with less number of parameters.

This study is useful in many mobile applications such as urban computing, region recommendation, and location-based service in general. This problem is challenging due to two reasons: (1) how to model the spatial-density correlation effectively and practically and (2) how to process the problem in interactive time. To overcome the challenges, we design a novel spatial-density correlation function to evaluate the relationship between regions and trajectories, and the density of POIs and network distance are taken into account.

During the last few years, great efforts have been made to develop a number of scene classification methods for remote sensing images. However, the existing remote sensing image classification methods do not perform satisfactorily in dealing with multi-class classification problems and rely heavily on the quality of data sets. These disadvantages seriously restrict the application of remote sensing image, including industrial research, analysis and calculation of land use and land coverage. To this end, this paper proposes a remote sensing image classification algorithm based on the sparse regularized feature learning method. Specifically, after constructing bag of features by using speeded up robust features extraction algorithm, direct sparsity optimization-based feature selection method is applied for selecting discriminative features, which is used for constructing support vector machine classifier model. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated and compared with other advanced feature selection methods on four public remote sensing image data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed image classification algorithm, which has been successfully applied to remote sensing image classification tasks.},

Thus, we have proposed a novel SFS to (1) preserve both local information and global information of original data in feature-selected subset to provide comprehensive information for learning model; (2) integrate graph construction and feature selection to propose a robust spectral feature selection easily obtaining global optimization of feature selection. Besides, for the proposed problem, we further provide a optimization algorithm to effectively tackle the problem with a fast convergence.

  abstract     = {There is a large amount of semi-structured information on Web pages. Comprehensive and accurate annotation of Web page information with uniform semantics can enhance the use value of information and provide support for Web site information integration. According to the characteristics of semi-structured information on Web pages, a semantic annotation method based on header recognition and data item classification is proposed. Firstly, a description model is constructed for the domain to be annotated. Secondly, header recognition is used to annotate data items on extracted pages. For those data items fail to be annotated by header recognition, feature vectors are constructed based on the feature sets in the domain description model and semantics of those data items are annotated by the classification results of back-propagation neural network. The proposed method is tested on 19,657 data items in the domain of agricultural product price and 8089 data items in the domain of recruitment information. The annotation precision is 97.39\% and 95.67\% respectively, and the annotation recall is 95.41\% and 95.67\%, respectively. These results show that the proposed method can annotate semi-structured information on Web pages accurately and completely.},

However, in most previous work, the extracted feature models do not achieve the relative text tasks well. To address this issue, we introduce a novel multi-task learning approach called a hybrid representation-learning network for text classification tasks. Our method consists of two network components: a bidirectional gated recurrent unit with attention network module and a convolutional neural network module. In particular, the attention module allows for the task learning private feature representation in local dependence from training texts and that the convolutional neural network module can learn the global representation on sharing. Experiments on 16 subsets of Amazon review data show that our method outperforms several baselines and also proves the effectiveness of joint learning multi-relative tasks.},

  abstract     = {Imperfect lightness conditions usually lower the visual quality of an image by bringing in unclear image details and poor image contrast. Traditional low-light enhancement models based on one single input are often limited in avoiding the effect of over-enhancement or under-enhancement. Models based on fusing multiple input sources usually perform well in relieving this issue, as they can harmonize the complementary visual appearances of a same scene provided by different sources. Nevertheless, these models still have difficulty in dealing with the situation that only one input is at hand, which usually happens in many practical situations. In this paper, we propose a low-light enhancement model that artificially enriches input sources and then seamlessly fuses them. Specifically, with an input image, we first generate multiple enhanced images based on a lightness-aware camera response model. These images are then fused at mid-level based on a patch-based image decomposition model. To validate our model, we conduct qualitative and quantitative comparisons with several state-of-the-art single-source and multi-source models on a collection of real-world images. Experimental results show that our model better improves the image quality in terms of visual naturalness and aesthetics.},

For this reason, an unsupervised nonlinear feature selection algorithm via kernel function is proposed in this paper. First, each data feature is mapped to a kernel space by a kernel function. In this way, nonlinear feature selection can be performed. Secondly, the low-rank processing of the kernel coefficient matrix is used to eliminate the interference of noise samples.

  abstract     = {Review text has been widely studied in traditional tasks such as sentiment analysis and aspect extraction. However, to date, no work is toward the end-to-end abstractive review summarization that is essential for business organizations and individual consumers to make informed decisions. This study takes the lead to study the aspect/sentiment-aware abstractive review summarization in domain adaptation scenario. Our novel model Abstractive review Summarization with Topic modeling and Reinforcement deep learning (ASTR) leverages the benefits of the supervised deep neural networks, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised probabilistic generative model to strengthen the aspect/sentiment-aware review representation learning. ASTR is a multi-task learning system, which simultaneously optimizes two coupled objectives: domain classification (auxiliary task) and abstractive review summarization (primary task), in which a document modeling module is shared across tasks. The main purpose of our multi-task model is to strengthen the representation learning of documents and safeguard the performance of cross-domain abstractive review summarization. Specifically, ASTR consists of two key components: (1) a domain classifier, working on datasets of both source and target domains to recognize the domain information of texts and transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. In particular, we propose a weakly supervised LDA model to learn the domain-specific aspect and sentiment lexicon representations, which are then fed into the neural hidden states of given reviews to form aspect/sentiment-aware review representations; (2) an abstractive review summarizer, sharing the document modeling module with the domain classifier. The learned aspect/lexicon-aware review representations are fed into a pointer-generator network to generate aspect/sentiment-aware abstractive summaries of given reviews by employing a reinforcement learning algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on real-life Amazon reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. Quantitatively, ASTR achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art summarization methods in terms of ROUGE score and human evaluation in both out-of-domain and in-domain setups. Qualitatively, our model can generate better sentiment-aware summarization for reviews with different categories and aspects.},

Since no single selection algorithm seems to be capable of ensuring optimal results in terms of both predictive performance and stability (i.e. robustness to changes in the input data), researchers have increasingly explored the effectiveness of “ensemble” approaches involving the combination of different selectors. While interesting proposals have been reported in the literature, most of them have been so far evaluated in a limited number of settings (e.g. with data from a single domain and in conjunction with specific selection approaches), leaving unanswered important questions about the large-scale applicability and utility of ensemble feature selection. To give a contribution to the field, this work presents an empirical study which encompasses different kinds of selection algorithms (filters and embedded methods, univariate and multivariate techniques) and different application domains. Specifically, we consider 18 classification tasks with heterogeneous characteristics (in terms of number of classes and instances-to-features ratio) and experimentally evaluate, for feature subsets of different cardinalities, the extent to which an ensemble approach turns out to be more robust than a single selector, thus providing useful insight for both researchers and practitioners.},

The improvement in the proposed method is confirmed by solving benchmark optimization functions, IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system. Obtained results from ISSO are compared to those from other existing methods available in other studies together with other popular and state-of-the-art methods, which are implemented in the work. As compared to standard SSO for application to ORPD problem, ISSO can reduce the number of computation steps and one control parameter, and shorten simulation time. About the result comparisons with SSO and other remaining methods, ISSO can find more favorable solutions with higher quality and ISSO can stabilize solution search function with approximately all trial runs finding lower value of fitness. Furthermore, the strong search ability of ISSO is also indicated because it uses less value for control parameters.

  abstract     = {In recent days, most of the business enterprises and individuals are attracted towards cloud computing due to its cost efficiency and scalability. Though the cloud adoption is significant, its security has become nightmare due to its multi-tenancy property. Generally cloud service providers commit to ensure data reliability and security, but they may get depleted due to the rapid growth rate of cloud customers. To overcome the security issues and to protect the documents uploaded in cloud, cryptography is more used. Data security can further be improved with a technique called fragmentation which helps in outsourcing data partitions instead of entire document. The fragmentation becomes a difficult and time-consuming process when the size of document grows. In this paper, an efficient fragmentation process with virtualization is proposed. CPU cycles are efficiently used by the generation of VMs which reduce the time complexity of fragmentation process. The factors such as document size, processor capacity, storage capacity and number of VMs are taken into consideration to analyse their influence on the fragmentation time. Healthcare documents’ fragmentation process is conducted, and measured real-time values are analysed statistically. For experimentation purpose, a private cloud OpenStack on Oracle virtual box is used. Taguchi technique (L27 orthogonal array) is employed to find the optimum levels of the parameters on the fragmentation time, while analysis of variance is used to analyse the contribution of the parameters towards the performance of fragmentation process. Results reveal that the document size is the most dominant factor influencing the fragmentation time followed by processor speed. By parallelizing the fragmentation process with the help of multiple VMs, the time complexity of the process gets reduced.},

In recent years, nature-inspired algorithms are applied to task scheduling which performs better than conventional algorithms. In this paper, crow search algorithm (CSA) is proposed for task scheduling in cloud. It is inspired from the food collecting habits of crow. In reality, the crow keeps on eyeing on its other mates to find a better food source than current food source. In this way, the CSA finds a suitable VM for the task and minimizes the makespan.

  abstract     = {The automatic assessment of the aesthetic value of an image is a task with many applications but really complex and challenging, due to the subjective component of the aesthetics for humans. The computational systems that carry out this task are usually composed of a set of ad hoc metrics proposed by the researchers and a machine learning system. We propose a new approach that fully automates the metrics creation process, its filtering and adjustment without human subjectivity. Thus, it does not depend on the authors’ human aesthetic intuitions. Our proposal is therefore based on the integration of two machine learning algorithms: CNN, which works as a feature extractor, and Correlation by Genetic Search (CGS)—a novel regression method, working as a supervised learning method. CGS is based on the creation of an adjusted linear regression model using Pearson’s correlation as a measure of performance in an evolutionary process.

  abstract     = {From the point view of behavioral finance, market sentiment plays an important role in forecasting stock returns. How to accurately measure the impact of market sentiment is a challenge work. Two issues on nonlinear relationship and mixed-frequency data have to be addressed. To this end, we introduce methods of mixed-frequency data into SVRs and develop a novel (U)MIDAS-SVR model. It can be estimated by solving the Lagrange duality technique of quadratic programming. We then apply the (U)MIDAS-SVR model to predict weekly returns of SHSE and SZSE in China using the mixed-frequency market sentiment as covariates. The empirical results show that the (U)MIDAS-SVR model is promising and MIDAS-SVR is superior to those competing models in terms of MAE and RMSE. In addition, we design seven scenarios by considering different data source combinations and find that the multi-source market sentiment is helpful to improve forecasting performance on stock returns.},

  abstract     = {In traditional neural trees (NTs), each internal node is designed as a neural network (NN), such as single- or two-layer neural networks, to determine which branch should be followed for an input sample. Because each NN contained in the internal nodes is designed separately, the produced NT does not consider overall effectiveness. Thus, the designed NT is usually not an optimal NT. In this study, the tree-structured multilayer neural network (TSMLNN) is proposed for classification. The TSMLNN is similar to an NT, which is the result of dividing a deep multilayer NN into many small sub-networks. The TSMLNN has the advantages of both a multilayer NN and an NT. In addition, the split method is proposed to determine how to split the network in the TSMLNN. The genetic algorithm is proposed to automatically search for the weights, activation threshold of each node and the proper number of nodes at each layer according to both the computing complexity and classification error rate in the TSMLNN, and the proposed TSMLNN tends to be optimal. A heuristic method is also proposed to help users to decide which TSMLNN is the best within the classification error rate range. Finally, the performance of the proposed TSMLNN is compared with that of state-of-the-art neural networks in experiments.},

A novel segmentation and context network (SCN) structure is proposed that combines the segmentation and context information for improving the accuracy of bounding box regression for pedestrian detection. The SCN model contains the segmentation sub-model and the context sub-model. For separating the pedestrian instance from the background and solving the pedestrian occlusion problem, this paper uses the segmentation sub-model for extracting pedestrian segmentation information to generate more accurate pedestrian regions. Considering that different pedestrian instances need different context information, this paper uses context regions with different scales to extract context information. For improving the detection performance, this paper uses the hole algorithm in the context sub-model to expand the receptive field of the output feature maps and connect the multi-channel features with the skip layer. Finally, the loss functions of the two sub-models outputs are fused. The experimental results on different datasets validate the effectiveness of our SCN model, and the deeply supervised algorithm has a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity.},

  abstract     = {Uncertain and imprecise data are inherent to many domains, e.g. casting lightweight components. Fuzzy logic offers a way to handle such data, which makes it possible to create predictive models even with small and imprecise data sets. Modelling of cast components under fatigue load leads to understanding of material behaviour on component level. Such understanding is important for the design for minimum warranty risk and maximum weight reduction of lightweight cast components. This paper contributes with a fuzzy logic-based approach to model fatigue-related mechanical properties of as-cast components, which has not been fully addressed by the current research. Two fuzzy logic models are constructed to map yield strength to the chemical composition and the rate of solidification of castings for two A356 alloys. Artificial neural networks are created for the same data sets and then compared to the fuzzy logic approach. The comparison shows that although the neural networks yield similar prediction accuracy, they are less suitable for the domain because they are opaque models. The prediction errors exhibited by the fuzzy logic models are 3.53\% for the model and 3.19\% for the second, which is the same error level as reported in related work. An examination of prediction errors indicated that these are affected by parameters of the membership functions of the fuzzy logic model.},

However, manifold learning suffers from the problem of manual selection of parameters, which seriously affects the algorithm performance. Recently, applications of collaborative representation have received concern in some fields such as image processing and pattern recognition research. Based on manifold learning and collaborative representation, this paper develops a new algorithm for feature extraction, which is called collaborative representation-based discriminant neighborhood projections (CRDNP). In CRDNP, we first construct intra-class and inter-class neighborhood graphs of the input data as well as a weight matrix based on collaborative representation model and class label information. Then, a projection to a reduced subspace is obtained by margin maximization between the between-class neighborhood scatter and within-class neighborhood scatter. CRDNP not only characters the inherent geometry relationship of the dataset using L2-graph, but also enhances the between-class submanifold separability. In addition, the discriminating capability of CRDNP is further improved by obtaining the orthogonal projection vectors. Experiment results on public face datasets prove that CRDNP can achieve more accurate results compared with the existing related algorithms.},

This paper studies a discrete supermarket location problem which considers the utilization rate and capacity constraint of the supermarkets simultaneously. Firstly, a mathematical model is developed with the objective of minimizing the total system cost consisting of operating cost and transportation cost. Then, a self-adaptive estimation of distribution algorithm with differential evolution strategy, named DE/AEDA, is proposed to solve the problem. Finally, computational experiments are carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the benchmark algorithm by using a non-parametric test method.

  abstract     = {In steel manufacturing industry, powdered iron ore is agglomerated in a pelletizing disk to form iron ore green pellets. The agglomeration process is usually monitored using a camera. As pellet size distribution is one of the major measures of product quality monitoring, pellets detection and segmentation from the image are the key steps to determine the pellet size. Traditional image processing algorithms are not only challenged by the complicated constitution of pellets, sediment and residuals in the image, but also by the harsh and unbalanced light reflection on the pellet centrum area and the background which results in tedious parameter adjustment work and pool performance. To solve these problems, we design a lightweight U-net deep learning network to automatically detect pellets from images and to obtain the probability maps of pellet contours. Compared to classic U-net, the proposed network has fewer parameters and introduces batch normalization layers, which greatly reduces the computing time and improves generalization ability of the network. A concentric circle model is then used to separate clumped contours of the pellets, and the pellets shapes are detected via ellipse fitting. The proposed method is verified using images captured from an industrial pelletizing disk, and its performance is compared with traditional methods and the classic U-net. Results show that the proposed method achieves better segmentation performance in DICE and ROC indexes and shows good robustness to uneven illumination. Tests on temporal image sequences demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in monitoring the pellet size distribution and the pellet shape as well. Results of this work have potential usage in online detection of iron ore green pellets and other types of particles.},

However, the selection of optimal SAW process parameters is indeed an intricate task which aims to accomplish the desired quality of welded part at an economic way. Therefore, in the present paper, the research efforts are made on an implementation of efficient hybrid intelligent algorithms, i.e., hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (hybrid PSO-GA) for the optimization of SAW process parameters. The emphasis was given on different direct parameters such as voltage, wire feed rate, welding speed and nozzle to plate distance and indirect parameters such as flux condition and plate thickness, respectively. The parameters were chosen at two levels using fractional factorial design to study their effect on responses including flux consumption, metal deposition rate and heat input. Besides, the linear regression technique and analysis of variance were used for mathematical modeling of each response. Then, the direct effect and interaction effect on selected responses were investigated by 3D surface plots. At the end, the performance of hybrid PSO-GA is compared with general PSO and GA algorithms for indices including success rate, best solution, mean, computational time, standard deviation and mean absolute percentage error between. The overall results suggested that the hybrid PSO-GA is better option than other two algorithms, i.e., PSO and GA for obtaining the optimum SAW process parameters.},

When minority class sample generation by interpolation is meaningless, the recourse to undersampling the majority class is mandatory in order to reach some acceptable results. Ensembles of classifiers provide the advantage of the diversity of their members, which may allow adaptation to the imbalanced distribution. In this paper, we present a pipeline method combining random undersampling with bootstrap aggregation (bagging) for a hybrid ensemble of extreme learning machines and decision trees, whose diversity improves adaptation to the imbalanced class dataset. The approach is demonstrated on a realistic greatly imbalanced dataset of emergency department patients from a Chilean hospital targeted to predict patient readmission.

Based on this idea, a six-category fingerprint database is annotated manually and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for identifying real fingerprint patterns. The new CNN consists of four convolutional layers, three max-pooling layers, two norm layers, and three fully connected layers. The best accuracy the model achieved was 94.87\% for a six-category fingerprint database and 92.9\% accuracy for a four-category fingerprint database.

  abstract     = {The idea of constructing the biological neural system model as realistic as possible can not only provide a new artificial neural network (ANN), but also offer an effective object to study biological neural systems. As a very meaningful attempt about the idea, a bionic model of olfactory neural system, KIII model, is introduced in this paper. There are the unique characteristics of KIII model different from those of general ANNs. The KIII model realistically simulates the structure of the real olfactory neural system and the process of odor molecules gradually transformed by the core components of the olfactory system including olfactory receptor, olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. The neuron model of the KIII model is constructed and optimized based on neurophysiological experimental data and accurately reflects the response of olfactory neurons to odor stimulation. In particular, the noise introduced to KIII model can further improve the performance of the model. In addition, the KIII model is analyzed based on the idea of deep learning. The qualitative analysis shows that there are obvious similarities between the KIII model and the deep learning model. Furthermore, with the epileptic electroencephalograph (EEG) recognition task, two groups of experiments are designed to comprehensively analyze the performance of the KIII model. In the first group of experiments, a typical pattern recognition experiment with feature extraction stage is shown. The features of epileptic EEG were extracted based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), and the KIII model was used as a classifier. The experimental results show that the KIII model only needs a small number of iterations to memorize different modes and has a high recognition rate, over 91\%. In the second group of experiments, a direct recognition experiment without feature extraction stage is shown. The original epileptic EEG signals as KIII model inputs directly were recognized. The experimental results show that there is still an excellent performance in the KIII model, over 96\%, and the recognition result is similar to the characteristics of the deep learning model. The theoretical analysis and experimental results prove that KIII model with the idea of deep learning is an excellent bionic model of olfactory neural system and gets a good balance between high bionics and good performance, which is a good reference for related research.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained high accuracy results for pedestrian re-identification in the past few years. There is always a trade-off between high accuracy and computational time in CNNs. Training CNN is always very difficult as it may take a long time to produce high accuracy results. To overcome this limitation, a novel method parallel stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) is proposed to train a five-hierarchical parallel CNNs that is designed according to pedestrian attributes. Moreover, the momentum correction and adaptive adjustment of learning rate are applied during training process and the time interval for updating parameters is inspected during optimization of parameters selection. The results of this paper prove the effectiveness of proposed PSGD that successfully decreases the training process by five times and surpasses the state-of-the-art methods of pedestrian re-identification in terms of both accuracy and time. The minimum reported running time of the proposed method is 8.7 s which is minimum among all other state-of-the-art methods. These promising results show the efficiency and performance of the proposed model.},

In this paper, we study the task scheduling problem to minimize the schedule length of parallel applications while satisfying the energy constraints in heterogeneous distributed systems. The existing approaches mainly allocate unassigned tasks with minimal energy consumption which cannot achieve optimistic scheduling length in most cases. Based on this situation, we propose a reformed scheduling method with energy consumption constraint algorithm, which is based on an energy consumption level to pre-allocate energy consumption for unassigned tasks. The experimental results show that compared with the existing algorithms, our new algorithm can achieve better scheduling length under the energy consumption constraints.},

On the other hand, 3D methods can perform higher performance than 2D methods but also face the problem of overfitting due to the limit of training data. With those problems, we propose a 2.5-dimensional convolutional neural network with convolutional long short-term memory to extract the information time sequence and combined with 3D anchors to gather the spatial information for final mitotic detection. Furthermore, we also propose the method with a parallel model on multi-GPUs to speed up the detection time.

Then, considering the importance characteristics of financial index data, expert weights based on BP, are introduced to propose weights backpropagation (WBP) model. On the basis of the timing characteristics of financial market, the WBP model is improved and the timing weights backpropagation (TWBP) model is proposed. Experiments show that different training cases bring out various effects. The accuracy rate of interest rate and reserve change value is lower than the original value after training. The mutation after data processing affects the learning of neural network.

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep convolutional neural network have achieved remarkable performance in object detection and image classification. However, there are still some practical challenges in large-scale image recognition tasks. To be specific, the visual separability between different object categories is extremely uneven, and some categories have strong inter-class similarities. Existing CNN networks are trained as flat n-way classifiers, which is usually not sufficient to meet the challenges. Hence, we propose a framework: multi-task cascade deep convolutional neural network (MTCD-CNN), which contains two phases: object detection and hierarchical image classification, for large-scale commodity recognition. First, the object detection framework is utilized to locate and crop the areas that may contain objects. Then, hierarchical spectrum clustering is adopted to construct a category and a tree-like image classification model. During the testing phase, the indistinguishable objects are classified from coarse to fine by searching the path of the category tree. The proposed hierarchical image classification method provides an insight into the data by identifying the group of classes that are hard to classify and require more attention when compared to others. Through extensive experiments and comparative analyses of commodity detection in supermarkets and stores of Jinzhou city, the performance of MTCD-CNN has proved to be superior to other advanced methods, indicating that our proposed method has effectively solved the problem of excessive similarity of confusingly similar categories.},

To address this problem, we propose a parallel MvC method in a distributed computing environment. The proposed method builds upon concept factorization with local manifold learning, denoted by parallel multi-view concept clustering (PMCC). Concept factorization learns a compressed representation for the data. Local manifold learning preserves the locally intrinsic geometrical structure in the data. The weight of each view is learned automatically and a cooperative normalized approach is proposed to better guide the learning of a consensus representation for all views. For the proposed PMCC architecture, the calculation of each part is independent. It is clear that our PMCC can be performed in a distributed computing environment.

To improve the security in MSN routing, a trust-based security routing mechanism is presented in this paper, i.e., a malicious behavior detection mechanism with identity verification scheme. The main idea is to introduce the behavior trust and the identity trust to guide the routing. Firstly, we judge a node’s behavior based on both comprehensive trust and social relationship strength. And then, we forward messages according to the different measurement within and outside the friend groups. We also propose a distributed key management scheme which can issue, verify or revoke certificates based on the evaluation of the social relationship strength. We further improve the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by verifying the identity trust of the node. The simulation results indicate that the proposed routing mechanism can lower the impact of malicious behavior of nodes effectively and it has greater security performance than some classical routing algorithms do.},

Due to a large number of users and tasks, it is important to achieve efficient scheduling of tasks submitted by users. Task scheduling is one of the crucial and challenging non-deterministic polynomial-hard problems in cloud computing. In task scheduling, obtaining shorter makespan is an important objective and is related to the pros and cons of the algorithm. Machine learning algorithms represent a new method for solving this type of problem. In this paper, we propose a novel task scheduling algorithm called QL-HEFT that combines Q-learning with the heterogeneous earliest finish time (HEFT) algorithm to reduce the makespan. The algorithm uses the upward rank (ranku) value of HEFT as the immediate reward in the Q-learning framework. The agent can obtain better learning results to update the Q-table through the self-learning process. The QL-HEFT algorithm is divided into two major phases: a task sorting phase based on Q-learning for obtaining an optimal order and a processor allocation phase using the earliest finish time strategy. Experiments show that QL-HEFT achieves a shorter makespan compared to three other classical scheduling algorithms as well as good performances in terms of the average response time.},

  abstract     = {The current task scheduling is separated from the virtual machine (VM) allocation, which, to some extent, wastes resources or degrades application performance. The scheduling algorithm influences the demand of VMs in terms of service-level agreement, while the number of VMs determines the performance of task scheduling. Workload plays an indispensable role in both dynamic VM allocation and task scheduling. To address this problem, we coordinate task scheduling and VM allocation based on workload characteristics. Workload is empirically time-varying and stochastic. We demonstrate that the acquired workload data set has Markov property which can be modeled as a Markov chain. Then, three workload characteristic operators are extracted: persistence, recurrence and entropy, which quantify the relative stability, burstiness, and unpredictability of the workload, respectively. Experiments indicate that the persistence and recurrence of workloads has a direct bearing on the average response time and resource utilization of the system. A nonlinear model between the load characteristic operators and the number of VMs is established. In order to test the performance of the collaborative framework, we design a scheduling algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA), which takes the estimated number of VMs as input and the task completion time as the optimization target. Simulation experiments have been performed on the CloudSim platform, testifying that the estimated average absolute VMs error is only 2.6\%. The GA-based task scheduling algorithm could improve resource utilization and reduce task completion time compared with the first come first serve and greedy algorithm. The proposed coordination mechanism in this paper has proved able to find the optimal match and reduce the resource cost by utilizing the interaction between VM allocation and task scheduling.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, by combining the dynamic gain and the self-adaptive neural network, an output feedback fault-tolerant control method was proposed for a class of nonlinear uncertain systems with actuator faults. First, the dynamic gain was introduced and the coordinate transformation of the state variables of the system was performed to design the corresponding state observers. Then, the observer-based output feedback controller was designed through the back-stepping method. The output feedback control method based on the dynamic gain can solve the adaptive fault-tolerant control problem when there are simple nonlinear functions with uncertain parameters in the system. For the more complex uncertain nonlinear functions in the system, in this paper, a single hidden layer neural network was used for compensation and the fault-tolerant control was realized by combining the dynamic gain. Finally, the height and posture control system of the unmanned aerial vehicle with actuator faults was taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Although deep neural networks have made great success in several scenarios of machine learning, they face persistent challenges in small training datasets learning scenarios. Few-shot learning aims to learn from a few labeled examples. However, the limited training samples and weakly distinguishable embedding vectors in a metric space often lead to unsatisfactory test results and directly calculating the distance between tensors can cause ambiguity. This paper proposes an embedded adaptive cross-modulation (EACM) method for few-shot learning which combines the information between support and query examples. Specifically, the inter-class categorizability between the support set prototype representations is enhanced by the adaptive cosine metric module to improve the accuracy of the few-shot recognition result. The learning is performed by using the cross-modulation module at many levels of abstraction layers along the prediction pipeline. The support set and query set feature cross-enhance, which improves the generalization ability and robustness of image recognition. Afterward, we further combine above two methods by a weight balance scalar to determine the task-related metric space and construct a joint loss function. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalization ability of EACM. We conduct comprehensive experiments on mini-ImageNet and CUB datasets. Experimental results show that our approach is the state-of-the-art approach by significant margins.},

  abstract     = {Recently, there is a potential technology called graph-based signal processing (GSP) that is being used in many applications. GSP has been used successfully in the domains such as signal and image filtering and processing. In the paper, GSP is used as an applicable method to non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NILM). In NILM, all of power consumption is disaggregated down to every appliance’s consumption without hardware. Although there is over 30 years after NILM was proposed, there are still some problems faced by applications of NILM in real scenario if there is no training data. By combination of NILM with GSP concept, such a challenge is tackled with better performance over existing methods. As the first step, we propose a new graph learning algorithm to get a graph suitable for appliance load representation and for the disaggregation algorithm. In the following steps, graph-based signal processing method is used three times, from representation of the data sets of power measurements. Public datasets are used to demonstrate the proposed method’s performance and feasibility.},

Nearly 100,000 people die in traffic accidents every year in China. The use of the assisted driving system effectively reduces the incidence of traffic accidents, while road surface object recognition is the key research object in the assisted driving system. At present, in the research on the recognition of pavement objects, there are problems such as low recognition rate and long recognition time, which cannot play the role of assisting driving. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a research on pavement object recognition based on machine learning, including analysis of key technologies of machine learning and optimization of related algorithms. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed method in the assisted driving system, the research results are applied to the road surface object recognition device and the experiment is carried out under the actual traffic environment. The results show that in the selected experimental scenes, the recognition accuracy of the road surface object recognition device applying the research results of this paper is 100\%, and the recognition time is far lower than the traditional road object recognition method. The results show that the proposed method can quickly and effectively identify the pavement object, and then assist the driver to control the vehicle, which has good applicability in the assisted driving system.},

In this study, Hy-Line Gray chickens were bred as objects. Through manual marking, the training set, validation set and test set were established, and YOLO v3 model was adopted to detect the collected images. The value of subdivision and batch size were determined by experiment. The learning rate was dynamically adjusted according to the change of loss value in the training model. Finally, the mean average precision of the trained model on the validation set was 92.09\%. In this paper, the recognition rates of six kinds of behaviors in the morning and in the afternoon and under different densities were analyzed. Furthermore, a kind of welfare indicator was tested and abnormal behavior was evaluated. The results showed that: The mean precision rate of the six behaviors was followed by mating (94.72\%), stand (94.57\%), feed (93.10\%), spread (92.02\%), fight (88.67\%) and drink (86.88\%). The mean false rate ranged from low to high was spread (0.11\%), mating (0.14\%), fight (0.20\%), drink (0.25\%), feed (1.17\%) and stand (8.62\%). The mean missing rate ranged from low to high was mating (4.65\%), stand (5.01\%), feed (5.15\%), spread (6.25\%), fight (14.69\%) and drink (15.79\%).

Therefore, the research of machine learning algorithms in regression problems is a research hotspot in the field of machine learning in recent years. However, real-world regression problems often have very complex internal and external factors, and various machine learning algorithms have different effects on scalability and predictive performance. In order to better study the application effect of machine learning algorithm in regression problem, this paper mainly adopts three common machine learning algorithms: BP neural network, extreme learning machine and support vector machine. Then, by comparing the effects of the single model and integrated model of these machine learning algorithms in the application of regression problems, the advantages and disadvantages of each machine learning algorithm are studied. Finally, the performance of each machine learning algorithm in regression prediction is verified by simulation experiments on four different data sets.

However, for the research method is relatively simple and the accuracy is low, this paper carries out the work from the two aspects of feature extraction and feature classification of the ground object, and analyzes and studies the application and value of the polarimetric SAR system. The basic algorithm of polarization SAR image classification is proposed. A polarimetric SAR image feature classification method based on polarization target decomposition and support vector machine is proposed. Four kinds of scattering features and Freeman decomposition are obtained by Cloude decomposition. The simulation results show that the accuracy of using combined features is about 6.5\% higher than that of single features. A polarization classification model based on polarization target decomposition and limit learning method is proposed. The simulation experiment shows ELM learning. The algorithm is indeed much faster than SVM learning. In this paper, a polarimetric SAR image classification method based on improved scattering mechanism coefficients is proposed, and the effectiveness of the polarimetric SAR image classification method based on improved scattering mechanism coefficients is verified. Experimental results show that after feature selection, the method of combining Freeman decomposition and Wishart classifier can get better classification results.},

State-of-the-art multimodality image registration techniques greatly rely on mutual information between paired images to obtain their correspondence. However, it has been observed that mutual information-based image registration approaches suffer from inaccuracy especially when they are applied to small-sized images. Bearing this in mind, a novel groupwise registration approach is proposed by mapping the extracted features from multimodality images into the same latent space. To evaluate the proposed approach, the comparison experiments are conducted between state-of-the-art methods and the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art techniques.

At present, in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, medical imaging and pathological puncture are the main methods of diagnosis. These methods have a high diagnostic rate for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, but it is difficult to apply to the diagnosis of early pancreatic cancer. In response to these problems, this paper proposes a pancreatic cancer diagnosis model based on the fusion of distribution estimation algorithm and genetic algorithm. By collecting pathological data of patients with pancreatic cancer from a hospital oncology, pathological data include clinical manifestations of pancreatic cancer patients, serum tumor markers, etc., after data preprocessing, input models, and then use different machine learning classification algorithms to make pancreatic cancer for diagnosis. By evaluating the diagnosis results of each classification algorithm, an optimal classification algorithm is obtained and applied to the diagnosis model of pancreatic cancer. The results show that compared with other classification algorithms, the model using classification algorithm has the highest accuracy, recall rate and harmonic mean, and the diagnostic performance is the best. The results show that the diagnostic model constructed in this paper has a very high application value in the early auxiliary pre-diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.},

Recent work regards aspect-level sentiment analysis as two separate tasks, i.e., aspect classification and sentiment analysis, and this pipeline method leads to error propagation. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved multi-way matching deep neural network model for fine-grained sentiment analysis, which jointly models the two tasks in one phase and improves current attention by directly capturing past attention in the multi-round alignment architecture, so as to prevent error propagation and attention deficiency problems. Experimental results on fine-grained sentiment analysis data sets of catering industry indicate that the F1 score of this model in actual test set reaches 0.7302 and EM score 87.1973, which are higher than baseline DocRNN model by 3.8\% and 0.88\% in F1 and EM, and are higher than SVM by 15.4\% and 25.6\%, which verified that our model could effectively predict fine-grained sentiment and have better generalization performance.},

Through the construction of the hierarchical deep network model, the group behaviors are judged; the stability, accuracy, expression movement, orientation, error, and work efficiency of the model, as well as the support vector machine model and the convolution network model, are compared and analyzed. The hierarchical depth network model has distinct advantages in comparison with the support vector machine model and the convolution network model. The standard deviation of the hierarchical depth network model is 0.013, while the standard deviations of the other two models are larger than the hierarchical depth network model. The proposed algorithm has an excellent performance in detection accuracy and error. Compared with the other two models, it has certain advantages. In addition, the hierarchical depth network is used for recognizing human behaviors and orientations, as well as extracting and recovering the expressions in group behaviors. Compared with the other two models, the proposed model is also more efficient. The model used in this study has little influence on group behavior recognition by the regional environment and other factors, and there is no significant difference in the judgment results. The operation of the model is studied by identifying the group behaviors based on the hierarchical depth network. The research results show that the model proposed in this study has a comprehensive and excellent result, which also indicates that group behavior recognition is an overall result.

  abstract     = {Stock forecasting is a very complex non-stationary, nonlinear time series forecasting, and is often affected by many factors, making it difficult to predict it with a simple model. Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the common data mining methods in the field of machine learning. It has outstanding advantages compared with other methods and it is widely used in various fields. However, there are still many problems in the practical application of the method, and the model itself has many fields that need to be improved. The purpose of this paper is to accurately predict the trend of stock prices, providing a reference model for the trend of stock market and the tracking method of stock price prediction, and provide value reference for research on the forecasting model of stock market and investor’s investment decision. Research using a combined model to predict stock market trends whether will have a significant improvement compared to using a single model to forecast that. The method of this paper is to analyze the shortcomings of current stock market forecasting methods and standard support vector machines firstly, at the same time, based on this, a cumulative auto-regressive moving average is proposed, which combines the least squares support vector machine synthesis model (ARI-MA-LS-SVM) to make basic predictions for the stock market. Secondly, process the data first for the predictive indicators by using cumulative auto-regressive moving average. Then, use the least squares support vector machine of simple indicator system to predict stock price fluctuations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combined model based on ARI-MA-LS-SVM is more suitable for stock price forecasting than the single forecasting model, and the actual performance is better. At the same time, a large number of simulation experiments show that the algorithm of multiple model’s fusion can achieve the expected effect, which indicate that the model has universal applicability, market applicability and stability feasibility. This model can bring some guidance and reference value for many investors and market regulators.},

However, in the course of the operation of microfinance companies, due to the lack of careful management and risk control, the problem of risk management has become increasingly prominent. The purpose of this paper is to study the microfinance risk based on polygenic artificial neural network, and it provides theory and practice application for risk management of microcredit enterprises. Taking the risk management of China’s microfinance companies as the research object, on the basis of previous studies, this paper analyzes the risks of bank microfinance companies. Secondly, the basic theory of neural network model and its transformation function are introduced, and the learning method of neural network. At the same time, the learning algorithm of neural network and its improved algorithm are mainly introduced. It lays a theoretical foundation for the follow-up empirical research. Then, through the empirical study of data-based risk assessment of microcredit of farmers, the sample data are divided into training samples and test samples for comparison. Then, we use MATLAB software to establish a neural network model for farmers’ microcredit risk assessment. Finally, in order to make the neural network model of farmers’ credit risk assessment better popularize and apply, and effectively reduce the credit risk of farmers’ microcredit. The corresponding policy suggestions are put forward, which proves the validity and applicability of the neural network in the field of farmers’ microcredit risk assessment.

The knowledge representation method based on the theory of basic elements can not only express knowledge more accurately and reduce the contradiction between knowledge, but also extend more knowledge from existing knowledge and systematically describe the development of things according to the development nature of basic elements.

However, discriminative correlation filter-based method heavily suffers from the problem of the multiple peaks and model drift in responds maps incurred by occlusion and rotation. To solve the above problem, we proposed convolution operators for visual tracking based on spatial–temporal regularization. Firstly, we add spatial–temporal regularization in loss function, which will guarantee continuity of the model in time. And we use preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to obtain filter coefficients. Secondly, we proposed channel reliability to estimate quality of the learned filter and fuse the different reliability coefficients to weight response map in location. We set a threshold to reduce the number of iteration in location and accelerate the compute speed of algorithm. Finally, we use two different correlation filters to estimate location and scale of target, respectively. Extensively experiment in five video sequences show that our tracker has been significantly improved performance in case of occlusion and rotation. The AUC in success plot improves 33.2\% than ECO-HC and 41.5\% than STRCF, respectively.},

For most interest rate models at this stage, its parameter estimation has become the focus of many scholars in recent years. At present, for the parameter estimation of the interest rate model, there is often a problem that the parameter estimation accuracy is not high and the algorithm stability is poor. Therefore, this research work investigates the parameter estimation method of the no-arbitrage Nelson–Siegel model for the classical interest rate model and points out the shortcomings of the estimation method. In the iterative process, the mean error and the estimated error covariance will expand continuously. The phenomenon eventually leads to the consequences of poor estimation. In this study, an improved adaptive Kalman filtering method is proposed. In the process of algorithm updating, an exponential decay factor is added to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation and the stability of the algorithm.

The ESIMPCA operates on sub-image and full image at a time and captures the local and global variation of images. The dimensionality problem of ESIMPCA feature matrices is eliminated by further applying 2DPCA on two-dimensional ESIMPCA feature matrices to generate EFLPCA feature matrices. The summarization of variances, time and space complexities of the proposed methods and their relationship with some existing variations of one-directional 2DPCAs are addressed. The experiment is conducted on ORL and YALE face databases with different image resolutions. The experimental results, using EFLPCA, show superiority performance in terms of feature dimensionality, recognition accuracy and speed with reasonable space requirement over some existing variations of one-directional 2DPCA.},

However, most of the existing studies neglect the internal distinctiveness of an image and the output of most methods tends to be of blurring, smoothness and implausibility. In this paper, we proposed a unified model which combines the deep model with the image restoration model for single-image SR. This model can not only reconstruct the SR image, but also keep the distinct fine structures for the low-resolution image. Two statistic priors are used to guide the updating of the output of the deep neural network: One is the non-local similarity and the other is the local smoothness. The former is modeled as the non-local total variation regularization, and the latter as the steering kernel regression total variation regularization. For this unified model, a new optimization function is formulated under a regularization framework. To optimize the total variation problem, a novel algorithm based on split Bregman iteration is developed with the theoretical proof of convergence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified model improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio of the deep SR model. Quantitative and qualitative results on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed model achieves better performance than the deep SR model without regularization terms.},

Firstly, a new self-adaptive PSO (SAPSO) is established to guide movements of particles in the proposed hybrid PSO. Aiming at well trade-offing the global and local search capabilities, a self-adaptive strategy is proposed to adaptively update the three main control parameters of particles in SAPSO. Since the performance of PSO heavily relies on its convergence, the convergence of SAPSO is analytically investigated and a convergence-guaranteed parameter selection rule is provided for SAPSO in this study. Subsequently, a modified self-adaptive differential evolution is presented to evolve the personal best positions of particles in the proposed hybrid PSO in order to mitigant the potential stagnation issue. Next, the performance of the proposed method is validated via 25 benchmark test functions and two real-world problems. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method performs significantly better than its peers at a confidence level of 95\% over the 25 benchmarks in terms of the solution optimality. Besides, the proposed method outperforms its contenders over the majority of the 25 benchmarks with respect to the search reliability and the convergence speed. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed method is comparable with those of some other enhanced PSO–DE methods compared. The simulation results over the two real-world issues reveal that the proposed method dominates its competitors as far as the solution optimality is considered.},

Most of network embedding methods focus on learning the representations solely from the topological structure. Recently, attributed network embedding, which utilizes both the topological structure and node content to jointly learn latent representations, becomes a hot topic. However, previous studies obtain the joint representations by directly concatenating the one from each aspect, which may lose the correlations between the topological structure and node content. In this paper, we propose a new attributed network embedding method, TLVANE, which can address the drawback by exploiting the deep variational autoencoders (VAEs). Particularly, a two-level VAE model is built, where the first-level accounts for the joint representations while the second for the embeddings of each aspect. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have been conducted, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art competitors.},

In this work, a novel machine learning-based method for estimation of intensity or maximum sustained wind speed of tropical cyclones over their life cycle is presented. The approach is based on a support vector regression model over novel statistical features of infrared images of a hurricane. Specifically, the features characterize the degree of uniformity in various temperature bands of a hurricane. Performance of several machine learning methods such as ordinary least squares regression, backpropagation neural networks and XGBoost regression has been compared using these features under different experimental setups for the task. Kernelized support vector regression resulted in the lowest prediction error between true and predicted hurricane intensities (approximately 10 knots or 18.5 km/h), which is better than previously proposed techniques and comparable to SATCON consensus. The performance of the proposed scheme has also been analyzed with respect to errors in annotation of center of the hurricane and aircraft reconnaissance data.

First, the generator and discriminator of DCGAN are combined to generate realistic Chinese characters from corrupted images, and the contextual loss and the content loss are further used to inpaint generated images. Finally, we use the improved GoogLeNet with traditional feature extraction methods to recognize the recovered handwritten Chinese characters. The proposed method is evaluated on the extended CASIA-HWDB1.1 dataset for two challenging inpainting tasks with different portions of blocks or random missing pixels. Experimental results show that our method can achieve higher repair rates and higher recognition accuracies than most of existing methods.},

One is the problem arising from improper extraction of feature sets, such as the weakness of the features and the feature vector usually has the property of high-dimensional and multisource. The other is that the outliers interfere with the clustering results. In this paper, we use the idea of co-clustering to cluster datasets and feature sources at the same time, and use the information which received from the information sharing between tasks to improve the accuracy of clustering tasks through the idea of multitask. And we used the advantage of the typical degree to construct a new parameter selection index to identify the outliers, and to correct each parameter by weakening the influence of the identified outliers on the clustering results. In order to reflect the applicability and robustness of the algorithm, we extend the algorithm to the non-precise dataset and evaluate the algorithm from multiple aspects through experiments. Experiments show that the proposed algorithms not only improve the clustering accuracy, but also greatly reduce the interference of outliers to clustering results.},

In recent years, neural networks have been successfully applied to different tasks such as image and music generation, demonstrating their great potential in realizing computational creativity. The fuzzy definition of creativity combined with varying goals of the evaluated generative systems, however, makes subjective evaluation seem to be the only viable methodology of choice. We review the evaluation of generative music systems and discuss the inherent challenges of their evaluation. Although subjective evaluation should always be the ultimate choice for the evaluation of creative results, researchers unfamiliar with rigorous subjective experiment design and without the necessary resources for the execution of a large-scale experiment face challenges in terms of reliability, validity, and replicability of the results. In numerous studies, this leads to the report of insignificant and possibly irrelevant results and the lack of comparability with similar and previous generative systems. Therefore, we propose a set of simple musically informed objective metrics enabling an objective and reproducible way of evaluating and comparing the output of music generative systems. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed metrics with several experiments on real-world data.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks can learn powerful and discriminative representations from a large number of labeled samples. However, it is typically costly to collect and annotate large-scale datasets, which limits the applications of deep learning in many real-world scenarios. Domain adaptation, as an option to compensate for the lack of labeled data, has attracted much attention in the community of machine learning. Although a mass of methods for domain adaptation has been presented, many of them simply focus on matching the distribution of the source and target feature representations, which may fail to encode useful information about the target domain. In order to learn invariant and discriminative representations for both domains, we propose a Cross-Domain Minimization with Deep Autoencoder method for unsupervised domain adaptation, which simultaneously learns label prediction on the source domain and input reconstruction on the target domain using shared feature representations aligned with correlation alignment in a unified framework. Furthermore, inspired by adversarial training and cluster assumption, a task-specific class label discriminator is incorporated to confuse the predicted target class labels with samples draw from categorical distribution, which can be regarded as entropy minimization regularization. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation methods on both visual and non-visual cross-domain adaptation tasks.},

Single-lead ECG recordings were measured for an average 7.2-h duration and segmented into 10-s events. The dataset comprised a training dataset (68,545 events) from 74 patients and test dataset (17,157 events) from 18 patients. The proposed method achieved high performance with an F1-score of 98.0\% for LSTM and 99.0\% for GRU. The results demonstrate superior performance over conventional methods. The proposed method can be used as a precise screening and diagnosing tool for patients with SDB disorders.},

  abstract     = {It is known that the existing $$\nu$$-twin support vector regression ($$\nu$$-TWSVR) has the ability to optimize $$\varepsilon _1$$ and $$\varepsilon _2$$ automatically through the proper selections of the parameters $$\nu _1$$ and $$\nu _2$$. However, since only the points near the lower-bound and upper-bound regressors are considered, it often results in overfitting problems. Furthermore, the equal penalties are applied to all samples that normally have different effects on the regressor function. In this paper, we propose an adaptive twin support vector regression (ATWSVR) machine to reduce the negative impacts of the possible outliers in $$\nu$$-twin support vector regression ($$\nu$$-TWSVR) by incorporating the fuzzy and rough set theories. First, two optimization models are constructed to obtain the lower and upper-bound regressors involving the use of the tools in rough and fuzzy set theories. Consequently, Theorems 1 and 2 are derived, through the application of KKT conditions and duality theory, to provide the connections between the dual optimal values and the location regions of the data points. Then, the definitions of different types of support vectors and their fuzzy proportions are given and Theorems 3 and 4 are proved to provide the bounds for the fuzzy proportions of these support vectors. Finally, the training data points located in different regions are assigned different fuzzy membership values by using iterative methods. Moreover, this approach can achieve the structural risk minimization and automatically control the fuzzy proportions of support vectors. The proposed ATWSVR is more robust for the data sets with outliers, as evidenced by the experimental results on both simulated examples as well as the benchmark real-world data sets. These results also confirm the claims made in the theorems mentioned above.},

However, optimizing the complex function is usually time-consuming. Nowadays, convolution neural networks have been applied in optical flow area. Most of them use large dataset for learning optical flow end-to-end, which can learn motion information from a large amount of prior information prepared in advance. However, these methods rely excessively on the learning ability of the network while ignoring some of well-proven assumptions in traditional approaches. In this paper, inspired by traditional methods, we present a network for learning optical flow, which combines traditional constraints with a supervised network. In the process of network optimization, the brightness constancy, gradient constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions are used to guide the training of network. Moreover, we stack several sub-networks integrated with prior constraints to form a large network for iterative refinement. Our method is tested on several public datasets, such as MPI-Sintel, KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury. The experimental results show that adding the prior constraints during training can obtain more refined and accurate flow. Compared with other recent methods, our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks.},

Since its birth 13 years ago, Histogram Of Gradient (HOG) descriptor has become a popular descriptor for pedestrian detection. Besides its original instantiation, the HOG also reflects a general methodology of constructing descriptors based on histograms of gradients of certain image sub-blocks. Following this general methodology, a number of HOG-style descriptors have been reported in the literature. The generation process of these descriptors is summarized in this work, and a new descriptor is presented for pedestrian detection. Three contributions are made in this work. First, a general model called descriptor generation model (DGM) is proposed, which can be used to systematically construct a wide range of HOG-style descriptors for pedestrian detection. Second, based on the DGM, a pedestrian detection experimental framework (PDEF) is introduced to find the optimal HOG-style descriptor. In the PDEF, the performance of each descriptor can be evaluated. At last, the genetic algorithm is employed to search the optimal (or semi-optimal) HOG-style descriptor in the descriptor space. And a new descriptor named Second-order Gradient for Pedestrian detection (G2P) is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the G2P descriptor over the standard HOG descriptor with ETH, CVC-02-system, NITCA and KITTI dataset, which also reflects the effectiveness of the DGM-based PDEF in finding better descriptors for pedestrian detection.},

Motivated by practical considerations, an event-triggered broadcasting strategy is further developed for each agent. Therein, the implementation of communication is driven by the designed triggered condition monitored by agents. Consequently, the proposed continuous-time algorithm can be executed with discrete-time communication, thus being able to greatly save communication expenditure.

The major problem in these systems is the inclusion of false positives in the results, which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis. A nodule detection and classification method is proposed that consists of four major phases. First, the lung region extraction is performed based on optimal gray level threshold that is computed by fractional-order Darwinian particle swarm optimization. Then, a novel nodule candidate detection method, based on geometric fit in parametric form incorporating the geometric properties of the nodules, is proposed. In the next phase, a hybrid geometric texture feature descriptor is created for better representation of the candidate nodules, which is a combination of 2D as well as 3D information about nodule candidates. Finally, a deep learning approach based on stacked autoencoder and softmax for feature reduction and classification is applied to reduce false positives. Performance analysis on the largest publically available dataset, Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative, depicts that the proposed method has significantly reduced the number of false positives to 2.8 per scan with a promising sensitivity of 95.6\%. The results demonstrate the significance of the methodology in automatic lung nodule detection and classification.

  abstract     = {Multilevel thresholding for image segmentation is a crucial process in several applications such as feature extraction and pattern recognition. The meticulous search for the best values for the optimization of fitness function using classical operations needs profuse computational time, which also results in inaccuracy and instability. In this paper, a new beta differential evolution (BDE)-based fast color image multilevel thresholding scheme using two objective functions has been presented. The optimal threshold values are determined by maximizing Kapur’s and Tsallis entropy (entropy criterion) thresholding functions coupled with BDE algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed method is examined over existing multilevel thresholding methods such as artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimization, wind-driven optimization and differential evolution. These approaches are aimed to determine optimum threshold values at different levels of thresholding for color image segmentation. The proficiency of the presented methodology is demonstrated visually and computationally on five real-life true color images as well as four satellite images. Experimental outcomes are exhibited in terms of the optimal threshold value, best objective function and computational cost (in seconds) for each method at different thresholding levels. Afterward, the proposed scheme is examined intensively regarding the superiority of quality. The experimentally evaluated results show that the proposed BDE-based approach for multilevel color image segmentation can accurately and efficiently examine for multiple thresholds, which are near to optimal ones searched using an exhaustive search process.},

A suitable similarity transformation simplifies the system of partial differential equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. The obtained system of the governing ordinary differential equations is then solved numerically by using the bvp4c function from MATLAB. The generated numerical results are presented graphically and discussed in the relevance of the governing parameters. Dual solutions are found as the sheet is shrunk in the horizontal direction. Stability analysis shows that the first solution is physically realizable whereas the second solution is not practicable.},

  abstract     = {Pollution, climate change, fast natural resource depletion, deforestation and global warming have become major worldwide problems relevant with the petroleum-based powered vehicles and alternatives for this conventional transportation type have been started to change in the last decade. In this modification process, electric vehicles (EVs) have a leading position due to their low damage effect to the environment. Selecting the most sustainable location for charging station for EVs plays an important role in the life cycle of them. This process needs to consider some conflicting criteria and has a complex decision problem that can be modeled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The inclusion of such criteria in a location selection requires the fuzzy sets to be used in the decision-making methodology. For this aim, intuitionistic fuzzy sets have been used in this paper. By the way, a decision-making procedure based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets and consists of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory, analytic hierarchy process and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution has been suggested for the location selection of charge stations. The proposed fuzzy-based model is applied to a case study for Istanbul in Turkey.},

The growth of the user population of these products or services is a kind of collective behaviour propagation phenomenon. Here, questions come: how can we describe the collective behaviour propagation as a function of time? How the endogenous and exogenous social effects influence the collective behaviour propagation and how to quantify these two effects? In order to answer all these questions, an ordinary differential equation model is proposed to describe the growth of the user population of this class of markets. Firstly, a networked community is constructed, where users and prospective users are considered as nodes, and their relationship provides the method of building edges. Then, two fundamental influences of decision-making can be realized based on the network. A useful application of the model can be conceived and illustrated by one new database containing weekly sales of 25,237 video games released in the home and handle consoles and personal computer in USA, UK, Germany, France and Japan from 1989 to 2018. Results show that historical sales profile of a video game follows the growth equation, and the numerical procedure for finding the model parameters allows the market size, and the relative effectiveness of customer service and promotional efforts to be estimated according to the available historical data.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve action recognition accuracy, a new nonnegative matrix factorization with local constraint (LC-NMF) is firstly presented. By applying it for effective trajectory clustering, complex backgrounds are removed and then the motion salient regions are obtained. Secondly, a nonnegative matrix factorization with temporal dependencies constraint (TD-NMF) is proposed, which fully mines the spatiotemporal relationship in a video not only between adjacent frames, but also between multi-interval frames. Meanwhile, the introduction of $$ l_{2,1} $$-norm makes the spatiotemporal features possess better sparseness and robustness. In addition, these features are directly learned from data and thus have an inherent generalization ability. Finally, a Deep NMF method is established, which takes the proposed TD-NMF as the unit algorithm of each layer. By introducing the hierarchical feature extraction strategy, the base matrix of the first layer is gradually decomposed; then, it is supplemented and completed layer by layer. Consequently, the more complete and accurate local feature estimations are obtained, and then the discriminative and expressive abilities of features are effectively enhanced and recognition performance is further improved. Adequate and extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Moreover, the update rules and convergence proofs for LC-NMF and TD-NMF are also given.},

In this paper, a pricing method of online group-buying based on continuous price function is proposed. We adopt an algorithm called Vickrey–Clarke–Groves for group-buying; buyers’ payments are the sum of commodities’ price and the extra amount by purchase quantity. The mechanism motivates buyers to report truthful preference through the compensatory payment.

One application for cognitive computing is sentiment analysis on online reviews, which reflects opinions and attitudes toward products and services experienced by consumers. A high level of classification performance facilitates decision making for both consumers and firms. However, while much effort has been made to propose advanced classification algorithms to improve the performance, the importance of the textual quality of the data has been ignored. This research explores the impact of two influential textual features, namely the word count and review readability, on the performance of sentiment classification. We apply three representative deep learning techniques, namely SRN, LSTM, and CNN, to sentiment analysis tasks on a benchmark movie reviews dataset. Multiple regression models are further employed for statistical analysis. Our findings show that the dataset with reviews having a short length and high readability could achieve the best performance compared with any other combinations of the levels of word count and readability and that controlling the review length is more effective for garnering a higher level of accuracy than increasing the readability. Based on these findings, a practical application, i.e., a text evaluator or a website plug-in for text evaluation, can be developed to provide a service of review editorials and quality control for crowd-sourced review websites. These findings greatly contribute to generating more valuable reviews with high textual quality to better serve sentiment analysis and decision making.},

Subsequently, the early forecast of lung growth is compulsory for the analysis procedure, and it gives the higher possibilities for fruitful treatment. It is the most difficult approach to upgrade a patient’s possibility for survival. Henceforth, a higher-order neural network system called recurrent neural network with Levenberg–Marquardt model with the help of glowworm swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for managing multimodal disease information. The execution of the proposed strategies is tried with information and the benchmark dataset, and the outcomes demonstrate that the higher-order recurrent neural systems with glowworm swarm optimization give better accuracy of 98\% in comparison with customary optimized neural network.},

Conventional learning-based methods ignore these variations; thus, the hallucinated high-resolution faces are not reasonable for the following recognition task. For recognition purpose, we prefer to obtain near-frontal faces. To this end, we propose a nuclear norm regularized structural orthogonal Procrustes regression (N2SOPR) approach in this work to acquire pose-robust feature representations for face hallucination with pose. The orthogonal Procrustes regression is used to seek an appropriate transformation between two data matrixes. Additionally, the nuclear norm regularization is imposed on the representation residual to preserve image structural property. We also impose a low-rank restraint on the combination weight to automatically cluster each input into the same subspace with the training samples. Both hallucination and recognition experiments conducted on common face databases have verified that our N2SOPR can obtain reasonable performance than some related methods.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99\% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients.},

In the implicit feedback recommender system, the key issue is how to represent users and products. In recent years, deep learning has achieved good performance in many fields including speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. We propose a deep learning-enhanced framework for implicit feedback recommendation. In this framework, we simultaneously learn the new distributed representation of users and items via node2vec to improve the negative sampling strategy. Finally, we develop a deep neural network recommendation model to integrate user features, product features and interaction features.

The real-time automated visual inspection in industrial production is a challenging task. Speed and accuracy are crucial factors for the process of automating the defect detection. Many statistical and spectrum analysis approaches have been introduced; however, they suffer from high computational cost with average performance. This paper proposes a neighborhood-maintaining approach, which is based on the minimum ratio for fast and reliable inspection of industrial products. The minimum ratio between local neighborhood sliding windows is used as a similarity measure for localizing defection. Extreme learning machine is then adapted to classify surfaces to defect or normal. A defect detection accuracy on textile fabrics has achieved 98.07\% with 91.29\% sensitivity and 99.67\% specificity. The minimum ratio shows highly discriminant power to distinguish between normal and abnormal surfaces. A defective region produces a smaller value of minimum ratio than that of a defect-free region. Experimental results show superior speed and accuracy performance over many existing defect detection methods.},

This paper proposes a novel local descriptor, called the quaternionic local angular binary pattern (QLABP), for color image classification. QLABP is based on the quaternionic representation (QR) of color images such that it is able to handle all color components holistically as well as consider their relations. Using QR, the quaternionic angular information is further developed to account for more color characteristics. We provide two ways to derive the quaternionic angular information from different perspectives. A pattern encoding operation is finally conducted on the obtained angular information to obtain QLABP. The effectiveness of QLABP has successfully been evaluated by comparing with several state-of-the-art descriptors.},

In recent years, deep learning and neural network techniques have been widely applied to action recognition and attained remarkable results. However, it is still a difficult task to recognize actions in complicated scenes, such as various illumination conditions, similar motions, and background noise. In this paper, we present a spatiotemporal neural network model with a joint loss to recognize human actions from videos. This spatiotemporal neural network is comprised of two key connected substructures. The first one is a two-stream-based network extracting optical flow and appearance features from each frame of videos, which characterizes the human actions of videos in spatial dimension. The second substructure is a group of Long Short-Term Memory structures following the spatial network, which describes the temporal and transition information in videos. This research effort presents a joint loss function for training the spatiotemporal neural network model. By introducing the loss function, the action recognition performance is improved. The proposed method was tested with video samples from two challenging datasets. The experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline comparison methods.},

In most real-world problems, manual annotation is practically intractable due to time/labour constraints; thus, the development of automated and adaptive data annotation systems is highly sought after. In this paper, we propose both a (1) deep Bayesian self-training methodology for automatic data annotation, by leveraging predictive uncertainty estimates using variational inference and modern neural network (NN) architectures, as well as (2) a practical adaptation procedure for handling high label variability between different dataset distributions through clustering of NN latent variable representations. An experimental study on both public and private datasets is presented illustrating the superior performance of the proposed approach over standard self-training baselines, highlighting the importance of predictive uncertainty estimates in safety-critical domains.},

Successive reformulations of the keyword and full-text word sequences are performed, so that they can serve as the input and target of the network as efficiently as possible.

Sophisticated spam filters must be developed to deal with this complex problem. Traditional machine learning approaches such as neural networks, support vector machines and Naïve Bayes classifiers are not effective enough to process and utilize complex features present in high-dimensional data on social network spam. Moreover, the traditional objective criteria of social network spam filters cannot cope with different costs assigned to type I and type II errors. To overcome these problems, here we propose a novel cost-sensitive approach to social network spam filtering. The proposed approach is composed of two stages. In the first stage, multi-objective evolutionary feature selection is used to minimize both the misclassification cost of the proposed model and the number of attributes necessary for spam filtering. Then, the approach uses cost-sensitive ensemble learning techniques with regularized deep neural networks as base learners. We demonstrate that this approach is effective for social network spam filtering on two benchmark datasets. We also show that the proposed approach outperforms other popular algorithms used in social network spam filtering, such as random forest, Naïve Bayes or support vector machines.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method for continuous fine-grained drone control, that allows for acquiring high-quality frontal view person shots. To this end, a head pose image dataset is combined with 3D models and face alignment/warping techniques to develop an RL environment that realistically simulates the effects of the drone control commands. An appropriate reward-shaping approach is also proposed to improve the stability of the employed continuous RL method. Apart from performing continuous control, it was demonstrated that the proposed method can be also effectively combined with simulation environments that support only discrete control commands, improving the control accuracy, even in this case.

Reinforcement learning takes quick and specific local decisions, deep learning clusters enables identity and memory, and deep learning management clusters make final strategic decisions. The presented genetic algorithm transmits the learned information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. Because the subject’s information, a combination of memory, identity and decision data, is never lost but transmitted, the genetic algorithm provides immortality. The management decision structure has been applied and validated in a smart investment Fintech application: an intelligent banker that makes buy and sell asset decisions with an associated market and risk that entirely transmits itself to a future generation.

  abstract     = {In communication networks resilience or structural coherency, namely the ability to maintain total connectivity even after some data links are lost for an indefinite time, is a major design consideration. Evaluating resilience is a computationally challenging task since it often requires examining a prohibitively high number of connections or of node combinations, depending on the structural coherency definition. In order to study resilience, communication systems are treated in an abstract level as graphs where the existence of an edge depends heavily on the local connectivity properties between the two nodes. Once the graph is derived, its resilience is evaluated by a tensor stack network (TSN). TSN is an emerging deep learning classification methodology for big data which can be expressed either as stacked vectors or as matrices, such as images or oversampled data from multiple-input and multiple-output digital communication systems. As their collective name suggests, the architecture of TSNs is based on tensors, namely higher-dimensional vectors, which simulate the simultaneous training of a cluster of ordinary multilayer feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). In the TSN structure the FFNNs are also interconnected and, thus, at certain steps of the training process they learn from the errors of each other. An additional advantage of the TSN training process is that it is regularized, resulting in parsimonious classifiers. The TSNs are trained to evaluate how resilient a graph is, where the real structural strength is assessed through three established resiliency metrics, namely the Estrada index, the odd Estrada index, and the clustering coefficient. Although the approach of modelling the communication system exclusively in structural terms is function oblivious, it can be applied to virtually any type of communication network independently of the underlying technology. The classification achieved by four configurations of TSNs is evaluated through six metrics, including the F1 metric as well as the type I and type II errors, derived from the corresponding contingency tables. Moreover, the effects of sparsifying the synaptic weights resulting from the training process are explored for various thresholds. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves a very high accuracy, while it is considerably faster than the computation of each of the three resilience metrics. Concerning sparsification, after a threshold the accuracy drops, meaning that the TSNs cannot be further sparsified. Thus, their training is very efficient in that respect.},

  abstract     = {Smart Grids are critical infrastructure networks. They play a critical role in the survival of our postmodern economies, as all other areas depend on their availability. An interruption in their operation may have a direct impact on the availability of other services (e.g., health, transportation). The problem is particularly intense when no backup networks are available, or the required recovery time is beyond backup autonomy. The transition to a decentralized management and control system for these networks requires digital technologies, advanced interconnected system communications, and Internet access. These technologies expose critical infrastructure networks to external threats that require careful assessment of cyber-security risks and appropriate countermeasures. An important factor that enhances the range of threats is the heterogeneity of Smart Grids, which incorporate industrial control systems such as the SCADA, distributed control system, and programmable logic controllers to which security improvements may not have been made since they were installed. Υet, another serious problem arises from the fact that older technologies were designed at times when cyber-security was not part of their technical design specifications. At the same time, it should be seriously considered that many of the systems of these networks that can be cyber-attacked may not be easily disconnected, as this could potentially lead to generalized operational problems. In this scientific research, a sophisticated active security framework is proposed, which is based solely on advanced computational intelligence methods and concerns the digital security of critical infrastructure networks. Specifically, this research introduces a sophisticated adaptive ensemble classification framework for real-time data streams by distributed control systems. It is a “Kappa” architecture framework that is based on a two-step online ensemble learning model based on bagging and boosting methods. The aim is performance of real-time analysis and evaluation of data flows from Smart Grids, toward the effective identification of APT attacks.},

Predominantly, the features extracted from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of the EEG data significantly improve the classification accuracy. A specific number of narrow band oscillatory components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), are obtained after EMD of the data. The first three IMFs are selected to extract three time and three frequency domain statistical features corresponding to each IMF. These features are chosen due to the strong data adaptation capability of EMD for the transient signals such as an EEG. Furthermore, the features are selected keeping in mind the differences in the distribution, average value, and regularity of the guilty and innocent subjects’ brain signals. The proposed combination of extracted features with customized SVM demonstrates better accuracy than the other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods reported earlier. The proposed hybrid combination of features prominently distinguishes the guilty and innocent subjects with the classification accuracy of 99.44\%.},

For this purpose, data of 14 hydrochemical parameters from 108 wells were sampled in 2016, Golestan province, northeast of Iran. The results showed that the optimal clusters of the K-means and FCM were 5 and 6, respectively. The evaluation of water quality by FCM for drinking uses showed that in terms of total dissolved solid (TDS) and chlorine (Cl) parameters, cluster 3 was in an unfavorable condition. Moreover, according to the K-means algorithm, cluster 1 was in inappropriate condition in terms of the TDS and Cl. Water quality assessment by FCM for agricultural use showed that in general, cluster 3 was not in a good condition, especially for the electrical conductivity (EC) parameter. Also, according to the K-means, in general, cluster 1 had an inappropriate state for the EC and sodium adsorption ratio parameters. Investigating the hydrochemical facies of clusters using the FCM and K-means showed that in the northern half of the Golestan province, most samples are Cl–Na and in the southern half, most of the samples are HCO3–Ca. In general, by comparing the results of clustering algorithms, it was found that the FCM algorithm has better results than the K-means clustering algorithm, mainly due to consideration of uncertainty conditions in determining the class boundary.},

  abstract     = {Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a recently developed nature-inspired global optimization method which mimics the social behaviour and hunting mechanism of grey wolves. Though the algorithm is very competitive and has been applied to various fields of research, it has poor exploration capability and suffers from local optima stagnation. So, in order to improve the explorative abilities of GWO, an extended version of grey wolf optimization (GWO-E) algorithm is presented. This newly proposed algorithm consists of two modifications: Firstly, it is able to explore new areas in the search space because of diverse positions assigned to the leaders. This helps in increasing the exploration and avoids local optima stagnation problem. Secondly, an opposition-based learning method has been used in the initial half of iterations to provide diversity among the search agents. The proposed approach has been tested on standard benchmarking functions for different population and dimension sizes to prove its effectiveness over other state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that the GWO-E algorithm performs better than GWO, bat algorithm, bat flower pollinator, chicken swarm optimization, differential evolution, firefly algorithm, flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and grasshopper optimization algorithm. Statistical testing of GWO-E has been done to prove its significance over other popular algorithms. Further, as a real-world application, the GWO-E is used to design non-uniform linear antenna array (LAA) for minimum possible sidelobe level and null control. Performance of GWO-E for the synthesis of LAA is evaluated by considering the several different case studies of LAA that exists in the literature, and the results are compared with the results of other popular meta-heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithm, ant lion algorithm, FPA, cat swarm optimization, GWO and many more. Numerical results further show the superior performance of GWO-E over original GWO and other popular algorithms.},

To deal with multi-seasonality, we consider four methods of the problem decomposition. Depending on the decomposition degree, the problem is split into local subproblems which are modeled using neural networks. We move from the global model, which is competent for all forecasting tasks, through the local models competent for the subproblems, to the models built individually for each forecasting task. Additionally, we consider different ways of the input data encoding and analyze the impact of the data representation on the results. The forecasting models are examined on the real power system data from four European countries. Results indicate that the local approaches can significantly improve the accuracy of load forecasting, compared to the global approach. A greater degree of decomposition leads to the greater reduction in forecast errors.},

  abstract     = {Anomaly detection is a very effective method to extract useful information from abundant data. Most existing anomaly detection methods are based on normal region or some specific algorithms, which ignore the fact that many actual datasets are mainly imbalanced, resulting in not function properly or effectively in practical, especially in the medical field. On the other hand, imbalanced dataset is also a frequently encountered problem in the learning of neural network because the lack of data in a minority class may lead to uneven classification accuracy. In this paper, inspired by these observations, a novel anomaly detection approach by using classical echo state network (ESN), a brain-inspired neural computing model, is presented. The entire dataset of the proposed method obeys an extremely imbalanced distribution, that is, anomalies are much rarer than normal data. And the training dataset has only the normal data. When the ESN is well trained, the parameters in ESN are the memory of normal data. If the normal data are added into the well-trained network, the error between the input data and the corresponding output is smaller compared with the error between abnormal input data and its corresponding output. Then anomaly behavior is detected if the error between the input data and the corresponding predictive value exceeds a certain threshold. Different from setting an invariable threshold arbitrarily for all of the data, the threshold value used in the proposed method is determined from the analysis of information theory and can be adjust adaptively according to different datasets. Experiments on abnormal heart rate detection are conducted to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of the proposed detection algorithm and theory.},

This paper proposes a generalization of the counting Bloom filter approach, called “autoscaling Bloom filters”, which allows adjustment of its capacity with probabilistic bounds on false positives and true positives. Thus, by relaxing the requirement on perfect true positive rate, the proposed autoscaling Bloom filter addresses the major difficulty of Bloom filters with respect to their scalability. In essence, the autoscaling Bloom filter is a binarized counting Bloom filter with an adjustable binarization threshold. We present the mathematical analysis of its performance and provide a procedure for minimizing its false positive rate.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of supply chain management is a way of ensuring the usability of resources and related technologies at the best possible way. Transportation scheduling of vehicle and transportation nodes in supply chain management is an important factor in order to create a stable chained network by ensuring the highest amount of product distribution and lowest logistics cost. In recent years, a number of programming models like linear programming, heuristics and meta-heuristics optimization approaches are proposed by the researchers to solve this combinatorial NP-hard problem. In this paper, we have studied and analyzed the nature of transportation vehicle scheduling problem in a supply chain network with the help of third-party logistics enterprise by using a meta-heuristic algorithm called chemical reaction optimization (CRO). At first, we have classified all the transportation nodes into three distinct classifications. Then, a collaborative transportation scheduling strategy is used which is based on two significant kinds of transportation nodes. For the first two kinds of nodes, we have randomly created a large number of combined transportation routes, and the vehicle scheduling for the last standalone nodes is created by a random matrix generation. Then, we have proposed a CRO algorithm using four reaction operators with an additional repair operator to find out the best transportation routes within shortest computing time. We named our proposed algorithm as chemical reaction optimization for supply chain management (CRO-SCM). The proposed CRO-SCM algorithm is analyzed with the standard dataset from the proposed model using modified ACO-NSO algorithm which is the state of the art. In addition, a random dataset of different scales of transportation nodes is considered to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, six different scales of problem sets consisting different number of nodes are adopted to analyze the performance of the proposed CRO algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical and efficient than existing ACO-based solutions and the experimental results are more efficient and optimal.},

The proposed model is termed as ‘Large-margin Distribution Machine-based Regression’ (LDMR) model, and it is in the spirit of Large-margin Distribution Machine (LDM) (Zhang and Zhou, in: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, ACM, 2014) classification model. The LDM model optimizes the margin distribution instead of minimizing a single-point margin as is done in the traditional SVM. The optimization problem of the LDMR model has been mathematically derived from the optimization problem of the LDM model using an interesting result of Bi and Bennett (Neurocomputing 55(1):79–108, 2003). The resulting LDMR formulation attempts to minimize the $$\epsilon$$-insensitive loss function and the quadratic loss function simultaneously. Further, the successive over-relaxation technique (Mangasarian and Musicant, IEEE Trans Neural Netw 10(5):1032−1037, 1999) has also been applied to speed up the training procedure of the proposed LDMR model. The experimental results on artificial datasets, UCI datasets and time-series financial datasets show that the proposed LDMR model owns better generalization ability than other existing models and is less sensitive to the presence of outliers.},

  abstract     = {The used metering technique in this paper is based on the multienergy (at least dual) gamma-ray attenuation. The aim of the current study is investigation of different combinations of sources in order to find the best combination for precise metering gas, oil and water percentages in annular three-phase flows. The required data were generated numerically using Monte Carlo N Particle extended (MCNPX) code. As a matter of fact, the current investigation devotes to predict the volume fractions in the annular three-phase flow, on the basis of a multienergy metering system including different radiation sources and one sodium iodide detector, using the hybrid model. Since the summation of volume fractions is constant, a constraint modeling problem exists, meaning that the hybrid model must predict only two volume fractions. Six hybrid models associated with the number of applied radiation sources are employed. The models are applied to predict the oil and gas volume fractions. For the next step, the hybrid models are trained based on numerically obtained data from the MCNPX code. The results show that the best prediction results are obtained for the oil and gas volume fractions of a system with the (241Am &amp; 137Cs) radiation sources.},

  abstract     = {In conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA), a production system has been seen as a black box for measuring the efficiency without any attention to what is happening inside the system. However, in practice, performance improvement often requires observing the internal structure of the producing system in order to find the sources of inefficiencies. In addition, weight flexibility as a key property of the multiplier DEA models allows a system to totally disregard an assessment factor, either input or output, from the evaluation process by assigning a value of zero or epsilon to its weight. This paper contributes to the existing literature by proposing a common-weights DEA model when the production system includes a number of interrelated processes. To this end, we propose an aggregate DEA model to calculate the most favourable common weights for determining the efficiency of all production systems and their processes at the same time. Our proposed aggregate model not only is linear for equitably evaluating the producing units on the same scale, but also enables us to deal with the mixed network structures. Furthermore, the network system is decomposed into a series system to build a relational network DEA model that emphasises separate relatedness. This greatly reduces the computational complexities for enormous volumes of data in many real applications and treat difficulties in network DEA models including the zero value and fluctuating weights and multiple solutions. Managerially speaking, this paper aims to provide the top management team of a production system with an integrated framework to shape a better strategic decision process about firm performance, which is to treat the sources of inefficiencies and ultimately take corrective actions over the long run. Put differently, the proposed framework helps top managers make proper decisions in complex situations with a view of improving a firm’s efficiency in all production divisions, which can be identified as a core competency leading to competitive advantages of the organisation. In the context of performance management, our study is equipped with a simple numerical example and a case study of the non-life insurance companies to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed common-weights network model.},

In this study, ABC and FPA have been used to develop different delay models which are linear, semi-quadratic, quadratic and power forms. Analysis period (T), the green ratio (g/C; effective green to cycle length) and the degree of saturation (x = v/c; volume to capacity) are used as input parameters while developing the models. The results of present models are compared to estimations obtained from analytical models which are Highway Capacity Manual and Australian (Akçelik) delay models. Semi-quadratic form yielded to best results in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error and mean absolute error. Additionally, FPA approach showed better performance than ABC approach finding the optimal solution in the lower number of iterations.},

In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for future self-face image synthesis using age and weight, resulting in visualization of future face image derived from given weight category and age. A Constrained Local Model is first used for weight progressed future face image synthesized and then age-progressed future face image is generated using Conditional Adversarial Auto Encoder.

  abstract     = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive technique to measure blood volume changes in blood vessels. Despite the wide usage of PPG signal in medical and non-medical applications, this signal can be affected by the motion artifacts leading to data loss. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to detect motion artifacts and reconstruct the corrupted parts of the signal using real-time modeling based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The developed algorithm was applied to reconstruct the corrupted parts of PPG signals of 23 healthy 25- to 28-year-old volunteers. In the experimental phase, the left- and right-hand PPG signals of the volunteers were simultaneously obtained. While the left hand of the subjects were fixed, they were asked to shake their hands without any predetermined pattern, to simulate the real-life motion accelerations. To statistically and physiologically evaluate the performance of the proposed models, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland–Altman plot (with the 95\% limits of agreement), and time-domain feature analysis tests were adopted. The results indicated that the ANFIS with subtractive clustering algorithm shows the best performance in modeling the lost parts of the right-hand signals with an average PCC and ICC of 0.80 and 0.77, respectively, with the reference signal (left-hand signals) over all the tests. Also, the proposed ANFIS-based algorithm had an ability to retrieve the important time-domain PPG signal features, namely mean of inter-beat intervals (NN), standard deviations of NN (SDNN), root mean square of standard deviations (RMSSD) and standard deviation of standard deviations (SDSD) without any significant difference at p &lt; 0.05 level to those of the reference signal (left-hand signal).},

  abstract     = {The assessment of semantic similarity between lexical terms plays a critical part in semantic-oriented applications for natural language processing and cognitive science. The optimization of calculation models is still a challenging issue for improving the performance of similarity measurement. In this paper, we investigate WordNet-based measures including distance-based, information-based, feature-based and hybrid. Among them, the distance-based measures are considered to have the lowest computational complexity due to simple distance calculation. However, most of existing works ignore the meronymy relation between concepts and the non-uniformity of path distances caused by various semantic relations, in which path distances are simply determined by conceptual hyponymy relation. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model to calculate the path distance between concepts, and also propose a similarity measure which nonlinearly transforms the distance to semantic similarity. In the proposed model, we assign different weights in accordance with various relations to edges that link different concepts. On basis of the distance model, we use five structure properties of WordNet for similarity measurement, which consist of multiple meanings, multiple inheritance, link type, depth and local density. Our similarity measure is compared against state-of-the-art WordNet-based measures on M&amp;C dataset, R&amp;G dataset and WS-353 dataset. According to experiment results, the proposed measure in this work outperforms others in terms of both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients, which indicates the effectiveness of our distance model. Besides, we construct six additional benchmarks to prove that the proposed measure maintains stable performance.},

Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for process monitoring and control has been an effective field of research for two decades. This area has been used widely in sophisticated engineering design applications to ensure the proper functionality and performance diagnosis of advanced and complex technologies. Robust fault detection of the realistic faults in distillation column in dynamic condition has been considered in this study. For early detection of faults, the model is based on nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) network. Tapped delays lines (TDLs) have been used for the input and output sequences. A case study was carried out with three different fault scenarios, i.e., valve sticking at reflux and reboiler, and tray upset. These faults would cause the product degradation. The normal data (no fault) is used for the training of neural network in all three cases. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can be used for the detection of both internal and external faults in the distillation column for dynamic system monitoring and to predict the probability of failure.},

A neural network (NN) identifier is established to approximate the interconnected dynamic coupling. Based on ADP and local online policy iteration algorithm, the Hamiltonian–Jacobi–Bellman equation is solved by constructing a critic NN, and then the approximate optimal control policy derivation is possible. The closed-loop robotic system is asymptotic stable by the implementation of a set of developed decentralized control policies.

For removing artifacts, we have used the wavelet denoising method. Different mother wavelet functions, with different thresholding algorithms, are compared. The dmeyer mother wavelet function along with Rigorous SURE soft thresholding emerged as the best combination for denoising. Comparison of wavelet energy features has revealed improved rhythmic activity in AVGPs. Also, two measures of engagement index β/(α + θ) and β/α are computed which has provided good classification accuracies with ANFIS classifier. Higher engagement indexes are found in the frontal, right parietal and occipital cortex of AVGPs. These results evidence the neurocortical modulation among the players that may attribute to the effective cognitive processes in AVGPs related to the task.},

  abstract     = {Historical preservation is becoming ever important in globalizing Shanghai city. However, traditional survey-based ways of policy making are not efficient. This work introduces the data-driven technique with machine learning algorithm to find the relationship between the features of the historical sites and the popularity, which relates to the economy such as tourism and the associated GDP contribution. The method is automatic, which relieves the work load from statistical surveys and other inefficient traditional approaches. Moreover, while the surveys can only reflect the current conditions, the machine learning approach has the ability of predicting the possible outcomes based on existing data, which is helpful when decisions on protection and development are to be made. We collect data from selected historical sites in Shanghai to illustrate the procedure of the proposed data-driven approach. The case study demonstrates the capability of prediction and shows its promising future in guiding policy making, resource allocation and scientific research.},

The gains are fed as inputs to the controller and are to be decided before its run. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the biped walk purely depends on the performance of the PID controller. Initially, the upper and lower body gaits of the two-legged robot are determined using the concept of inverse kinematics. Further, the dynamics of the biped robot is derived by using Lagrange–Euler formulation. The main objective of the present research is to decide the gains of the torque-based PID controller with the help of a neural network trained by using nature-inspired optimization algorithms, namely MCIWO and PSO. The adaptiveness of the algorithm lies in modifying the gains of the controller based on the magnitude of the error in the angular displacement received at the input to the NN. Once the controller is developed, its effectiveness is tested in computer simulations. Finally, the optimum controlled gait angles obtained by the best approach are tested on a real biped robot.},

Bat algorithm (BA) is a recently developed swarm-based optimization technique which is inspired by the echolocation behavior of bats. The standard BA shows premature convergence and reduced convergence speeds under some conditions. So, the EBA is used to perform the design optimization of laminated composites. The laminate analysis based on classical laminate theory is utilized for the stress calculations. Tsai–Wu failure curve is considered as the constraint in this constrained optimization problem. Number of plies at each orientation angle are considered as the design variables. The design optimization has been carried out for both conventional and unconventional (dispersed plies) stacking sequences considering different loading configurations: uniaxial tension, biaxial tension with and without shear loadings. Ply angles dispersed in the range of $$5^{\circ }$$–$$85^{\circ }$$, $$25^{\circ }$$–$$65^{\circ }$$ and $$0^{\circ }$$–$$90^{\circ }$$ at intervals of $$5^{\circ }$$ are considered for the unconventional stacking sequence to increase damage tolerance. In addition, a new mathematical function is proposed to measure the dispersion of ply angles in the laminate called the dispersion function. Also, the performance of EBA is compared with standard BA in the optimum weight design of composite laminates.},

IT2FSs are more capable than classic fuzzy sets in coping with uncertainty and providing more degree of freedom to model the uncertain conditions. Also, the RPR is better than defuzzification because it does not lose the fuzzy message, and the method avoids pairwise comparisons. In fact, the MABAC method is extended by the RPR for reducing the time complexity. Furthermore, an extended MABAC method is developed under IT2FSs to better address the uncertainty. Weights of decision makers (DMs) are computed by introducing a new IT2F-RPR-based MABAC concept in the proposed new decision model. Also, experts’ opinions are aggregated by using weights of the DMs. Moreover, weights of criteria are determined based on a new extended weighted aggregated sum-product assessment (WASPAS) method by using the DMs or experts’ opinions on the importance of criteria and weights of DMs. As a matter of fact, weights of DMs are determined by a new version of extended MABAC method, and weights of criteria are specified using a new version of WASPAS method for the first time in the literature. Finally, a case study about aircraft maintenance planning is solved to address the calculation process and applicability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a system identification (SID) model for an historical art gallery of great cultural significance. These buildings require tight indoor temperature and moisture controls that demand significant energy from air handling units. Complex dynamic building systems, stringent conservation restrictions, and lack of detailed monitoring make diagnosing and optimising their energy use difficult. Building simulation software programmes have proven to be effective, but have tended to rely on data generated by simulation models. This study shows how artificial neural network (ANN) models trained with historical real data can predict a building’s energy use and the optimal indoor microclimate necessary for conservation. Four ANN target-data scenarios were designed for optimised model predictions, and 12 ANN training algorithms were tested with six architectural scenarios collecting daily and hourly data. The ANN models used a randomised 80\% sample of the database, with the remainder (20\%) validating the models. The model displayed a high coefficient of correlation (0.99), with the mean square error and mean absolute error less than 0.1\% and 2\%, respectively. This ANN-based SID tool efficiently represents a complex building system and could be an ideal method for investigating optimisation strategies prior to their implementation.},

To better handle the contaminated data, we employ an insensitive loss function to control the fitting error of the samples in one class and introduce the weight (fuzzy membership) of each sample into the proposed model. The alternating optimization technique is utilized to solve the proposed model due to the characteristics of the model. The accelerated version of first-order methods is used to solve a quadratic programming problem, and the fuzzy membership of each sample is achieved analytically in the case of Bregman divergences.

Based on this observation, one can separate singing voice from the background music. However, the quality of such separation might be limited, since the vocal part may be not described very well by low rank, and moreover its more prior information, such as annotation, should be considered when designing separation algorithm. Based on these considerations, in this paper, we present two categories, time–frequency-based source separation algorithms. Specifically, one incorporates both the vocal and instrumental spectrograms as sparse matrix and low-rank matrix, meanwhile combines some side information of vocal part, i.e., the reconstructed voice spectrogram from the annotation. The others further consider both the vocal and instrumental spectrograms as sparse matrix and group-sparse matrix, respectively.

This paper proposes two new efficient initialization and updating mechanisms in PSO with the goal of minimizing the number of features and maximizing the classification performance in less computational time. The proposed algorithms are compared with six existing feature selection methods, including two traditional PSO-based feature selection methods and four PSO with different initialization strategy and updating mechanism-based feature selection methods. Experiments on eight benchmark dataset show that the proposed algorithms can automatically evolve a feature subset with a smaller number of features with higher classification performance than using all features.

  abstract     = {An enhancement in the thermal conductivity of conventional base fluids has been a topic of great concern in recent years. An effective way to improve the heat transfer rate of conventional base fluids is the suspension of solid nanoparticles. In this framework, a theoretical study is performed to analyse the heat and mass transfer performance in the time-dependent flow of non-Newtonian Williamson nanofluid towards a stretching surface. There exist several studies focusing on the flow of Williamson fluid by assuming zero infinite shear rate viscosity. Nonetheless, there is a lack of knowledge regarding mathematical formulation for two-dimensional flow of the Williamson fluid by taking into account the impacts of infinite shear rate viscosity. In the current review, the Buongiorno model for nanofluids associated with Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion is employed to describe the heat transfer performance of nanofluids. The thermal system is composed of flow velocity, temperature, and nanoparticles concentration fields, respectively. The governing dimensionless equations are solved numerically by Runge–Kutta Fehlberg integration method. The numerical results are compared with published results and are found to have an excellent agreement. Effects of numerous dimensionless parameters on velocity, temperature, and nanoparticle concentration field together with the skin friction coefficient and rates of heat and mass transfer are presented with the assistance of graphical and tabular illustrations. With this analysis, we reached that the thermal boundary layer thickness as well as the nanofluids temperature has higher values with increase in thermophoresis and Brownian motion. It is further observed that the rate of heat transfer is significantly raised with an increment in Prandtl number and unsteadiness parameter.},

  abstract     = {Combining multiple classifiers to create hybrid learners (ensembles) has gained popularity in recent years. Ensembles are gaining more interest in the field of data mining as they have reportedly performed best predictions as compared to individual classifiers. This has resulted in experimentation with new ways of ensemble creation. This paper presents a study on creation of novel hybrid ways of combining multiple ensemble models using ‘over production and choose approach.’ In contrast to the original concept of ensembles that combine various learners, the proposed ensemble models comprise of combinations of other ensembles. In particular, we have combined learners as in composition of other learners, thus producing nested learners. Two such models named as Boosted-Stacked learners and Bagged-Stacked learners are proposed and are shown to outperform the traditional ensembles. Experiments are performed in churn prediction domain where a benchmark customer churn dataset (available on UCI repository) and a newly created dataset from a South Asian wireless telecom operator (named as SATO) are used. SATO dataset is created as balanced dataset (having equal number of churners and non-churners). The novel Boosted-Stacked learner and Bagged-Stacked learner achieved accuracies of 98.4\% and 97.2\%, respectively, on the UCI Churn dataset outperforming the existing state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, a high accuracy on the SATO dataset validates the effectiveness of the proposed models on balanced as well as imbalanced datasets.},

This paper proposes an efficient method for sentiment analysis by effectively combining three procedures: (a) creating the ontologies for extraction of semantic features (b) Word2vec for conversion of processed corpus (c) convolutional neural network (CNN) for opinion mining. For CNN parameter tuning, a multi-objective function is solved for nondominant Pareto front optimal values using particle swarm optimization.

  abstract     = {Community detection is one of the most well-known and emerging research topics in the area of social network analysis. There are a wide variety of approaches to find communities in the literature, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. A majority of these approaches tend to detect communities by only using the network topology. However, the distribution of the node attributes is correlated with the community structure in many real networks. Therefore, the quality of the discovered partitions can be enhanced by considering node attributes. In this study, two novel mathematical programming approaches are proposed to integrate the topological structure and node similarities, in which first the primary attributed network is converted into a secondary non-attributed network. Then, a mathematical model will be developed to find communities in the secondary network. Thanks to the fact that the objective function and constraints of the proposed model are defined linear, the global optimality of the obtained solutions is guaranteed. In order to validate the proposed approaches, they are applied to both real-world and benchmark networks. Computational results of two well-known evaluation measures including Rand index and normalized mutual information demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches in discovering better partitions.},

  abstract     = {Modelling of anomalous geological source from the gravity data is vital for understanding the crustal/sub-crustal interface depths and associated hazard assessment. Two-dimensional radial power spectra have usually been used to infer average depth of protuberant geological structures, which lack details of dimensional comprehension of lateral interfaces. Here in this study, we implement jointly scaled conjugate gradient-based Bayesian neural network (SCG-BNN) scheme with variogram modelling to carve out shallow and deeper interfaces of complex geological terrain of Eastern Indian Shield, India, using Bouguer gravity anomaly (BGA) and altitude variations data. Our “learner codes” uses the SCG-BNN optimization algorithm to build up a statistical model involving appropriate control parameters for the modelling of shallow and deeper interfaces. We have also compared the proposed SCG-BNN modelling results with the results of both conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) schemes (e.g. conjugate gradient-based ANNs (CG-ANN) and SCG-ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) modelling to demonstrate the robustness of the underlying method. Comparative analysis suggests that the SCG-BNN model produced superior results than the results of CG-ANN, SCG-ANN and SVR models. The results based on SCG-BNN analysis and variogram modelling have identified the existence of three conspicuous fault structures, namely Malda–Kishanganj Fault, Munger–Saharsha Ridge Marginal Fault and Katihar Fault. The analyses also significantly minimize prediction error in three independent datasets (viz. training, validation and test), enhancing the precision of estimated shallow and deeper interface depths and thereby extenuating feasibility of “SCG-BNN” learner code. We, therefore, conclude that the underlying approach is robust to model various interface depths and generate precisely variation in the shallow and deeper interfaces with appropriate input data from altitude variation and BGA. The “SCG-BNN learner scheme” may potentially be used to exploit interface depths from several other complex tectonic regions.},

Furthermore, these approaches require extensive computational time to extract the facial features and to train the models. This article proposes a novel geometrical fuzzy-based approach to accurately recognize facial emotions in images in less time. The four corner vertices of the mouth are the most important features to recognize facial emotions and can be extracted without the need of a reference face. These extracted features can then be used to define the quadrilateral shape, and the associated degree of impreciseness in the shape can be accessed using the proposed geometric fuzzy membership functions. Hence, four fuzzy features are derived from the membership functions and given to classifiers for emotion evaluations. In our tests, the fuzzy features achieved an accuracy rate of 96.17\% in the Japanese Female Facial Expression database, and 98.32\% in the Cohn-Kanade Facial Expression database, which are higher than the ones achieved by other common up-to-date methods. In terms of computational time, the proposed method required an average of 0.375 s to build the used model in a common PC.},

Neural network approaches have been developed to make the agents behave human-like in the sense that they would assess the game environment in a way a human would assess it. Specifically, a thorough investigation has been conducted on the application of adversarial neural network combined with Q-learning for designing the game playing agents in the game. The searchers, called detectives and the hider, called Mister X (Mr. X) have been modeled as neural network agents, which play the game of Scotland Yard. Though it is a type of two-player (or, two-sided) game, all the five detectives must cooperate to capture the hider to win the game. A special kind of feature space has been designed for both detectives and Mr. X that would aid the process of cooperation among the detectives. Rigorous experiments have been conducted, and the performance in each experiment has been noted. The evidence from the obtained results demonstrates that the designed neural agents could show promising performance in terms of learning the game, cooperating, and making efforts to win the game.},

Attackers are in continuous search of getting information from network traffic, and this is the main reason that efficient intrusion detection techniques are required to identify different kinds of network attacks. In past, various supervised and semi-supervised methods have been developed for intrusion detection. Most of these methods require a large amount of data to develop an efficient intrusion detection system. In the proposed deep neural network and adaptive self-taught-based transfer learning technique, we have exploited the concept of self-taught learning to train deep neural networks for reliable network intrusion detection. In the proposed method, a pre-trained network on regression-related task is used to extract features from NSL-KDD dataset. Original features along with extracted features from the pre-trained network are then provided as an input to the sparse auto-encoder. Self-taught learning-based extracted features, when concatenated with the original features of NSL-KDD dataset, enhance the performance of the sparse auto-encoder. Performance of self-taught learning-based approach is compared against several techniques using ten independent runs in terms of accuracy, false alarm and detection rate, area under the ROC, and PR curve. It is experimentally observed that the auto-encoder trained on the combined original and extracted features is stable and offers good generalization in comparison with the sparse auto-encoder trained on original features alone.},

The proposed algorithm is combined with evolution and H&amp;P compliance mechanisms which are responsible for increasing the performance of the algorithm. The evolution mechanism improves the performance of each individual solution. On the other hand, the H&amp;P compliance mechanism tries to place the H monomer close to the center and place the P monomer as far as possible from the center of the related structure. The algorithm also applies four reactant operations of typical CRO algorithm decomposition, on-wall ineffective collision, synthesis and inter-molecular ineffective collision to solve the problem efficiently. The reactants or mechanisms may cause overlapping of the corresponding solutions. The algorithm also includes a repair mechanism which transforms invalid solutions into valid ones by removing overlapping in cubic lattice points. This algorithm has been tested over some sets of sequences and it shows very good performance.},

The proposed MOGSABAT algorithm is divided into three stages. In the first stage (moving space), a switch in a solution from single function to multiple functions that contain more than one objective to use the gravitational search algorithm GSA is determined. We established a new equation to calculate the masses of individuals in the population using the theoretical work found in the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm. In the second stage (moving in space), how to handle the bat algorithm BAT to solve multiple functions is established. We applied the theoretical work of multi-objective particle swarm optimisation into the BAT algorithm to solve multiple functions. In the third stage, multi-objective GSA and multi-objective BAT are integrated to obtain the hybrid MOGSABAT algorithm. MOGSABAT is tested by adopting a three-part evaluation methodology that (1) describes the benchmarking of the optimisation problem (bi-objective and tri-objective) to evaluate the performance of the algorithm; (2) compares the performance of the algorithm with that of other intelligent computation techniques and parameter settings; and (3) evaluates the algorithm based on mean, standard deviation and Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic of the function values. The optimisation results and discussion confirm that the MOGSABAT algorithm competes well with advanced metaheuristic algorithms and conventional methods.},

We rely on the differences in spatio-temporal heat signatures of idling and stopped cars and monitor the car temperature with a long-wavelength IR camera. We formulate the idling car detection problem as spatio-temporal event detection in IR image sequences and employ deep networks for spatio-temporal modeling. We collected the first IR image sequence dataset for idling car detection. First, we detect the cars in each IR image using a convolutional neural network, which is pre-trained on regular RGB images and fine-tuned on IR images for higher accuracy. Then, we track the detected cars over time to identify the cars that are parked. Finally, we use the 3D spatio-temporal IR image volume of each parked car as input to convolutional and recurrent networks to classify them as idling or not. We carried out an extensive empirical evaluation of temporal and spatio-temporal modeling approaches with various convolutional and recurrent architectures. We present promising experimental results on our IR image sequence dataset.},

A combination of thermal power plant and renewable plant of wind and solar photovoltaic is considered for optimal solution at minimal cost using Dragonfly Algorithm. Swarming behaviour of dragonfly is used for optimization of the present Economic Load Dispatch problem. The modelling of solar and wind power plant is done using 2-m point estimation technique to consider the uncertainties in power generation from such renewable sources. The solution of objective function is found using the proposed method (Dragonfly Algorithm), and the same is compared with that obtained using other well-known algorithms such as Crow Search Algorithm, Ant Lion Optimizer, Oppositional Real-Coded Chemical Reaction Optimization, Biogeography-Based Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm. It is found that the proposed method gives better solution in terms of execution time and cost effectiveness. To validate the performance of Dragonfly Algorithm, four test systems have been considered. It is observed that the total generation cost obtained by Dragonfly Algorithm for each test system is less (10,049.1948 $/h for test system I, 2018.0762 $/h for test system II, 15,268.8325 $/h for test system III and 32,310.2922 $/h for test system IV) as compared to other well-known optimization methods. It is also found that the time required to reach minimum solution is lesser in case of Dragonfly Algorithm (8 s for test system I, 12 s for test system II, 15 s for test system III and 20 s for test system IV) as compared to other optimization techniques.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to reformulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, reformulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student-t distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student-t process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real-data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets.},

  abstract     = {The joint decision-making of order acceptance and scheduling has recently gained increasing attention. Besides, the two-stage assembly scheduling problem has various real-life applications. The current paper considers an integrated model for order acceptance and scheduling decisions in two-stage assembly problem. The objective is maximizing profit which is the sum of revenues minus total weighted tardiness of the accepted orders. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed based on time-index variables. Also, a new concept of semi-permutation scheduling is introduced assuming that positions of each job on all of the machines have no significant difference in the optimal solution. This problem is NP-hard, and therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based heuristic is proposed to apply semi-permutation concept, named semi-permutation GA (SPGA), to solve the problem efficiently. The solutions of SPGA are compared with those of CPLEX and non-semi permutation GA (N-SPGA). Computational experiments are conducted in a diverse range of problem instances indicating that the SPGA performs much better than CPLEX regarding the average percentage of improvement, ranging from 1.4 to 168.84\%, and run time. The results revealed that an increasing number of machines and orders could lead to a dramatic decrease in the performance of CPLEX and N-SPGA than SPGA. Also, the effect of semi-permutation scheduling is investigated. According to the result, semi-permutation scheduling had a strong effect on the performance of the algorithm. As a result, the SPGA algorithm outperformed the non-semi permutation version of GA completely. Moreover, SPGA could represent the better performance of 36.27\% in average in comparison with N-SPGA.},

  abstract     = {Modern building codes increasingly enforce evaluating the inelastic response of structures to ensure their safety in major seismic events. Although an inelastic dynamic analysis provides the most realistic and accurate measure for the seismic response, its application for large-scale structures is hampered by the excessive computational burden involved. This is particularly the case for the optimization of inelastic structures subjected to dynamic loads using metaheuristic algorithms where numerous analyses are required before the design converges to the optimum. In this regard, developing predictive models with sufficient accuracy will significantly help to reduce the computational demand, thus making the seismic analysis and optimization of large structures more feasible and common practice. Motivated by this need, this paper reports a study on the capabilities of a wavelet weighted least squares support vector machine (WWLSSVM) and a feedforward, backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict the inelastic seismic responses of structures. The force- and displacement-based seismic responses of an 18-story reinforced concrete frame subjected to different earthquake ground motion records scaled to the design basis earthquake and maximum considered earthquake levels are used to train the models and examine their accuracies. The first three natural periods of the frame and combinations thereof are considered as the inputs for the model. The results indicate that both models exhibit satisfactory prediction performances, with the ANN model having a slight edge on accuracy in most of the cases studied, especially when a smaller number of samples are used for training. A parametric sensitivity analysis shows that the seismic responses predicted by the ANN model generally exhibit less sensitivity to the inputs than do those predicted by the WWLSSVM model. The results also indicate that force- and displacement-based responses exhibit the highest sensitivity to the first and second natural periods, respectively.},

In this article, the classification of regions representing calcified components in computed tomography angiography (CTA) images of the carotid artery is tackled. The proposed classification model has two main steps: the classification per pixel and the classification per region. Features extracted from each pixel inside the carotid artery are submitted to four classifiers in order to determine the correct class, i.e. calcification or non-calcification. Then, geometrical and intensity features extracted from each candidate region resulting from the pixel classification step are submitted to the classification per region in order to determine the correct regions of calcified components. In order to evaluate the classification accuracy, the results of the proposed classification model were compared against ground truths of calcifications obtained from micro-computed tomography images of excised atherosclerotic plaques that were registered with in vivo CTA images. The average values of the Spearman correlation coefficient obtained by the linear discriminant classifier were higher than 0.80 for the relative volume of the calcified components. Moreover, the average values of the absolute error between the relative volumes of the classified calcium regions and the ones calculated from the corresponding ground truths were lower than 3\%. The new classification model seems to be adequate as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for identifying calcifications and allowing their morphology assessment.},

  abstract     = {Epileptic spikes are complementary sources of information in EEG to diagnose and localize the origin of epilepsy. However, not only is visual inspection of EEG labor intensive, time consuming, and prone to human error, but it also needs long-term training to acquire the level of skill required for identifying epileptic discharges. Therefore, computer-aided approaches were employed for the purpose of saving time and increasing the detection and source localization accuracy. One of the most important artifacts that may be confused as an epileptic spike, due to morphological resemblance, is eye blink. Only a few studies consider removal of this artifact prior to detection, and most of them used either visual inspection or computer-aided approaches, which need expert supervision. Consequently, in this paper, an unsupervised and EEG-based system with embedded eye blink artifact remover is developed to detect epileptic spikes. The proposed system includes three stages: eye blink artifact removal, feature extraction, and classification. Wavelet transform was employed for both artifact removal and feature extraction steps, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for classification purpose. The proposed method is verified using a publicly available EEG dataset. The results show the efficiency of this algorithm in detecting epileptic spikes using low-resolution EEG with least computational complexity, highest sensitivity, and lesser human interaction compared to similar studies. Moreover, since epileptic spike detection is a vital component of epilepsy source localization, therefore this algorithm can be utilized for EEG-based pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy.},

  abstract     = {A novel adaptive neurofuzzy H-infinity control approach to feedback control of DC–DC converters, being used in applications of renewable energy generation, is developed. The form and the parameters of the differential equations that constitute the dynamic model of the controlled system are considered to be unknown, while there is only knowledge about the order of the system. The model of the controlled system undergoes approximate linearization around a temporary operating point which is re-computed at each iteration of the control algorithm. The linearization procedure makes use of Taylor series expansion and the computation of Jacobian matrices. For the approximately linearized model of the DC–DC converter, it is possible to design a stabilizing H-infinity feedback controller, provided that knowledge about the matrices of the linearized state-space description is available. In such a case, the computation of the feedback controller’s gain comes from the solution of an algebraic Riccati equation taking also place at each iteration of the control method. However, since the elements of these matrices are unknown, it is proposed to estimate them with the use of neurofuzzy approximators. Actually, neurofuzzy networks are employed for learning the constituent functions of the system’s dynamic model. Based on these function estimates, the system’s Jacobian matrices are also obtained and this allows the implementation of the H-infinity feedback controller. To assure the stability of the control loop, the learning rate of the neurofuzzy approximators is chosen from the requirement that the first derivative of the system’s Lyapunov function to be always a negative one. The global asymptotic stability and the robustness properties of the control method are proven through Lyapunov stability analysis.},

This approach ensures sufficiently simple and efficient calculation of an ultra-large neural network in the stand-alone hardware with limited computing resources. The model consists of three separate functional parts: dendrites, soma, and axon, which allows implementing any connections between functional parts of different neurons, thus making the neural network architecture more flexible. To perform functional testing of the neuron model, the test neural network performing simple association and constructed as a consequent stack of functional blocks with primary connections organized using experimental neurophysiological data was simulated. It is shown that encoding of the information transmitted by the impulses, similar to biological ones, allows using memristors for calculating recurrence expressions that describe the change in the quantity of neurotransmitter receptors of the dendrite membrane. The elaborated biomorphic neuron model, defined conceptual principles of a neural network construction based on it, as well as replacement of synapses in the neural network with memristors will allow building an ultra-large biomorphic neural network that simulates the functioning of a separate brain cortical column in the stand-alone hardware—a biomorphic neuroprocessor.},

The discharge data from the year 1999 to 2002 have been used in this study. The extended VPMM method has been used to simulate 9 flood events of the year 2002, and later the results were compared with SVM and WASVM models. The analysis of statistical and graphical results suggests that the extended VPMM method was able to predict the flood wave movement better than the SVM and WASVM models. A model complexity analysis was also conducted which suggests that the two parameter-based extended VPMM method has less complexity than the three parameter-based SVM and WASVM model. Further, the model selection criteria also give the highest values for VPMM in 7 out of 9 flood events. The simulation of flood events suggested that both the approaches were able to capture the underlying physics and reproduced the target value close to the observed hydrograph. However, the VPMM models are slightly more efficient and accurate, than the SVM and WASVM model which are based only on the antecedent discharge data. The study captures the current trend in the flood forecasting studies and showed the importance of both the approaches (physical and data-based modeling). The analysis of the study suggested that these approaches complement each other and can be used in accurate yet less computational intensive flood forecasting.},

Both theoretical analysis and numerical results show that it can control the magnitude of weights of the networks. Moreover, the deterministic theoretical analysis of the new algorithm is proved. The monotonicity of the empirical risk with penalty term is guaranteed in the training procedure. The weak and strong convergence results indicate that the gradient of the total error function with respect to weights tends to zero, and the weight sequence goes to a fixed point when the iterations approach positive infinity. Numerical experiment has been implemented and effectively verifies the proved theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a self-adaptive global mine blast algorithm (GMBA) is proposed for numerical optimization. This algorithm is designed in a novel way, and a new shrapnel equation is proposed for the exploitation phase of mine blast algorithm. A theoretical study is performed, which proves the convergence of any typical shrapnel piece; a new definition for parameters values is defined based on the performed theoretical studies. The promising nature of newly designed exploitation idea is verified with the help of multiple numerical experiments. A state-of-the-art set of benchmark problems are solved with the proposed GMBA, and the optimization results are compared with seven state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The experimental results are statistically validated by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and time complexity of GMBA is also calculated. It has been justified that the proposed GMBA works as a global optimizer for constrained optimization problems. As an application to the newly developed GMBA, an important data clustering problem is solved on six data clusters and the clustering results are compared with the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The promising results claim the proposed GMBA as a strong optimizer for data clustering application.},

In this process, a problem is addressed while measuring the periodic fluctuation in bipolar information at the given phase of time. This changes in human cognition used coexist often in our daily life where the sentiments (i.e., love or hatred) for anyone may change several times from morning to evening office time. In this case precise representation of this type of bipolar information and measuring its pattern is a major issue for the researchers. To deal with this problem, the current paper proposes three methods for adequate representation of bipolar complex data set using the calculus of complex fuzzy matrix, $$\delta$$-equality and the calculus of granular computing, respectively. Hence, the proposed method provides an umbrella way to navigate or decompose the bipolar complex data sets and their semantics using an illustrative example. The results obtained from the proposed methods are also compared to validate the results.},

In this work, an entropy-based method was used based on supervised learning to differentiate between normal tissue and breast tumor based on their gene expression profiles. This work employs four widely used machine learning techniques for breast cancer prediction, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and naive Bayes. The performance of these techniques was evaluated on four different classification performance measurements which result in getting more accuracy in case of SVM as compared to other machine learning algorithms. Classification accuracy of 91.5\% was achieved by support vector machine with 0.833 F1 measures. Furthermore, these techniques were evaluated on the basis of performance by ROC curve and calibration graph.},

Our method provides an optimal multiple kernel and optimal parameters in Support Vector Regression, improving the accuracy of prediction. The proposed approach is structured on two levels. The macro-level uses a breeder genetic algorithm for choosing the optimal multiple kernel and the SVR optimal parameters. The fitness function of each chromosome is computed in the micro-level using a SVR algorithm. The regression model based on the optimal multiple kernel and optimal parameters is then validated and used for forecasting. The experimental results prove that OMK–SVR performs better than GEP, RBF-SVR and ELM for predicting the future behavior of the study series.

Wireless networks also provide efficient, low cost, fast and reliable solutions for different fields of life.

However, because of unpredictable dense and sparse traffic conditions in urban areas, data communication is a challenging task for effective and reliable data links. Various topology-, location- and cluster-based protocols have been adopted to deal with high mobility of nodes and dynamic nature of network topologies. This paper presents a distance and signal quality aware routing (DSQR) protocol to deal with vehicular networks. The propose protocol initiates its forwarding decision based on Mid-Area node selection by evaluating direction and distance of neighbour nodes and also taking link quality into account and selects the best next forwarder node towards the destination node. The performance of DSQR is evaluated carrying out with vehicle speed and traffic density in realistic environment. Performance comparisons evaluation indicated the higher performance of propose protocol compared with existing protocols and reduces packet dropping and link failure issues.},

The transverse orientation is a special kind of navigation method, which demonstrates the movement of moths toward moon in a straight path. This algorithm has been successfully applied on various optimization problems. But, MFO suffers from the problem of poor exploration. So, in order to enhance the performance of MFO, some modifications are proposed. A Cauchy distribution function is added to enhance the exploration capability, influence of best flame has been added to improve the exploitation and adaptive step size and division of iterations is followed to maintain a balance between the exploration and exploitation. The proposed algorithm has been named as enhanced moth flame optimization (E-MFO) and to validate the applicability of E-MFO, and it has been applied to twenty benchmark functions. Also, comprehensive comparison of E-MFO with other meta-heuristic algorithms like bat algorithm, bat flower pollination, differential evolution, firefly algorithm, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and flower pollination algorithm has been done. Further, the effect of population and dimension size on the performance of MFO and E-MFO has been discussed. The experimental analysis shows the superior performance of E-MFO over other algorithms in terms of convergence rate and solution quality. Also, statistical testing of E-MFO has been done to prove its significance.},

  abstract     = {Reservoir computing (RC) is a powerful machine learning methodology well suited for time-series processing. The hardware implementation of RC systems (HRC) may extend the utility of this neural approach to solve real-life problems for which software solutions are not satisfactory. Nevertheless, the implementation of massive parallel-connected reservoir networks is costly in terms of circuit area and power, mainly due to the requirement of implementing synapse multipliers that increase gate count to prohibitive values. Most HRC systems present in the literature solve this area problem by sequencializing the processes, thus loosing the expected fault-tolerance and low latency of fully parallel-connected HRCs. Therefore, the development of new methodologies to implement fully parallel HRC systems is of high interest to many computational intelligence applications requiring quick responses. In this article, we propose a compact hardware implementation for Echo-State Networks (an specific type of reservoir) that reduces the area cost by simplifying the synapses and using linear piece-wise activation functions for neurons. The proposed design is synthesized in a Field-Programmable Gate Array and evaluated for different time-series prediction tasks. Without compromising the overall accuracy, the proposed approach achieves a significant saving in terms of power and hardware when compared with recently published implementations. This technique pave the way for the low-power implementation of fully parallel reservoir networks containing thousands of neurons in a single integrated circuit.},

  abstract     = {Infertility affects one out of seven couples around the world. Therefore, the best possible management of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment and patient advice is crucial for both patients and medical practitioners. The ultimate concern of the patients is the success of an IVF procedure, which depends on a number of influencing attributes. Without any automated tool, it is hard for the practitioners to assess any influencing trend of the attributes and factors that might lead to a successful IVF pregnancy. This paper proposes a hill climbing feature (attribute) selection algorithm coupled with automated classification using machine learning techniques with the aim to analyze and predict IVF pregnancy in greater accuracy. Using 25 attributes, we assessed the prediction ability of IVF pregnancy success for five different machine learning models, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), C4.5, classification and regression trees (CART) and random forest (RF). The prediction ability was measured in terms of widely used performance metrics, namely accuracy rate, F-measure and AUC. Feature selection algorithm reduced the number of most influential attributes to nineteen for MLP, sixteen for RF, seventeen for SVM, twelve for C4.5 and eight for CART. Overall, the most influential attributes identified are: ‘age’, ‘indication’ of fertility factor, ‘Antral Follicle Counts (AFC)’, ‘NbreM2’, ‘method of sperm collection’, ‘Chamotte’, ‘Fertilization rate in vitro’, ‘Follicles on day 14’ and ‘Embryo transfer day.’ The machine learning models trained with the selected set of features significantly improved the prediction accuracy of IVF pregnancy success to a level considerably higher than those reported in the current literature.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to identify a method for classifying signals using their reduced sparse forms with a higher degree of accuracy. Many signals, such as sonar, radar, or seismic signals, are either sparse or can be made sparse in the sense that they have sparse or compressible representations when expressed in the appropriate basis. They have a convenient transform domain in which a small number of sparse coefficients express them as linear sums of sinusoidals, wavelets, or other bases. Although real-valued artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been frequently used in the classification of sonar signals for a long time, complex-valued wavelet neural network (CVWANN) is used for these complex reduced sparse forms of sonar signals in this study. Before the classification, the number of inputs was reduced to 1/3 dimension. Complex-valued sparse coefficients (CVSCs) obtained from the reduced form were classified by CVWANN. The performance of the proposed method is presented and compared to other classification methods. Our method, CVSCs + CVWANN, is very successful as 94.23\% by tenfold cross-validation data selection and 95.19\% by 50–50\% training–testing data selection.},

  abstract     = {Recently, boost and buck converters are widely applied in many applications, especially in recycled energy industry. The efficiency of DC–DC converter, which can increase or decrease the input voltage according to the driver output voltage, can effectively affect the total efficiency of the systems. In this paper, a sliding mode interval type-2 fuzzy wavelet cerebellar model articulation controller (T2WFCMAC)-based control system is designed for the DC–DC converters. The proposed control system contains a main controller and a robust compensation controller. The main controller is the T2WFCMAC which is used to mimic an ideal controller, and the robust compensation is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the main controller and the ideal controller. The sliding hyperplane is applied to improve the robustness of the control system. All the adaptive laws for adjusting the parameters of T2WFCMAC are obtained using the gradient descent method. The stability of control system is guaranteed in the sense of Lyapunov function. Finally, numerical experimental results of boost and buck converters are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the change in the input voltage and the load resistance variations.},

Initially, the Gaussian pyramid has been used as a multiresolution technique. Subsequently, seven variants of the local binary pattern (LBP) have been employed to extract the features. At last, support vector machine and random forest classifiers are used for classification. The performances of conventional LBP variants and proposed features have been evaluated on MR image database in three classes, i.e., mild, moderate, and severe, in three different views. The Gaussian pyramid-based center-symmetric local binary pattern performed well in all three views. The achieved classification accuracies are 95.66 ± 0.98\% in the apical 2 chamber, 94.47 ± 1.91\% in the apical 4 chamber and 94.21 ± 1.31\% in parasternal long axis views using SVM classifier with the tenfold cross-validation. The outcomes of paper confirm that the performance of the conventional LBP features is enhanced significantly and the proposed CAC system is useful in assisting cardiologists in the severity analysis of MR.},

To enhance the performance of MBO algorithm, harmony search (HS) is introduced as a mutation operator during the adjusting operator of MBO. A novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization method, the so-called HMBO, is introduced to find the best solution for the global optimization problems. HMBO combines HS exploration with MBO exploitation, and therefore, it produces potential candidate solutions. The implementation process for enhancing MBO method is also presented. To evaluate the effectiveness of this improvement, fourteen standard benchmark functions are used. The mean and the best performance of these benchmark functions in 20, 50, and 100 dimensions demonstrated that HMBO often performs better than the original MBO and other population-based optimization algorithms such as ACO, BBO, DE, ES, GAPBIL, PSO and SGA. Moreover, the t-test result proved that the performance differences between the enhanced HMBO and the original MBO as well as the other optimization methods are statistically significant.},

Though recommender systems are proven personalization tool available, the need for the improvement of its recommendation ability and efficiency is high. Among various recommendation generation mechanisms available, collaborative filtering-based approaches are widely utilized to produce similarity-based recommendations. To improve the recommendation generation process of collaborative filtering approaches, clustering techniques are incorporated for grouping users. Though many traditional clustering mechanisms are employed for the users clustering in the existing works, utilization of bio-inspired clustering techniques needs to be explored for the generation of optimal recommendations. This article presents a new bio-inspired clustering ensemble through aggregating swarm intelligence and fuzzy clustering models for user-based collaborative filtering. The presented recommendation approaches have been evaluated on the real-world large-scale datasets of Yelp and TripAdvisor for recommendation accuracy and stability through standard evaluation metrics. The obtained results illustrate the advantageous performance of the proposed approach over its peer works of recent times.},

  abstract     = {The prominence of incorporating the renewable energy resources in a power system via microgrids has increased in the recent years, which impose a caution on conventional protection schemes. Protection schemes proposed earlier use local measurements, but fault classification for selective phase tripping using wide area measurements for microgrid has not been reported so far. This paper presents a wide area monitoring and protection of microgrid with distributed generations (DGs) using modular artificial neural networks (MANNs) for the fault detection and classification without affecting the relays in non-faulty or healthy sections of the microgrid. The distinct characteristics of the microgrid sort the proposed methodology into two stages. In stage 1, ANN 1 is developed to identify the operating mode of microgrid, whether it is operating in grid-connected mode (GCM) or islanded mode (IM). In stage 2, there are two MANNs corresponding to GCM and IM. Each MANNs consists of three separate ANNs for fault detection, classification, and section identification. A standard IEC 61850-7-420 microgrid with DGs (wind and photovoltaic) penetration is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. The three-phase voltages and currents are measured with time synchronization considering the microphasor measurement units located at each bus. The extensive study includes different simulation scenarios such as shunt faults, high impedance fault, and dynamic situations like connection/disconnection of DGs/distribution lines. The results confirm the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

In this algorithm, the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales is exploited. However, this algorithm, in its present form, is appropriate for continuous problems. To make it applicable to discrete problems, a binary version of this algorithm is being proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the solutions are binarized and sigmoidal transfer function is utilized to update the position of whales. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on 29 benchmark functions. Furthermore, unpaired t test is carried out to illustrate its statistical significance. The experimental results depict that the proposed algorithm outperforms others in respect of benchmark test functions. The proposed approach is applied on electrical engineering problem, a real-life application, named as “unit commitment”. The proposed approach uses the priority list to handle spinning reserve constraints and search mechanism to handle minimum up/down time constraints. It is tested on standard IEEE systems consisting of 4, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 units and on IEEE 118-bus system and Taiwan 38-bus system as well.

Initially, a total of 136 experiments have been conducted to realize the process and subsequently influences of three inputs (feed–speed ratio, roller infeed and axial stagger) on the three outputs, viz. internal diameter, springback and ovality have been studied. Three neural network-based approaches (back-propagation neural network, limited-memory BFGS network and genetic neural system) have been developed for forward as well as reverse modelling of the process. During forward modelling, the performances of the three neural network-based approaches have been compared with the regression model. It is seen that GANN has performed much better compared to the other methods. Percentage accuracy in predicting ovality using regression analysis is the worst, and it necessitates consideration of more input process parameters for better prediction accuracy. However, NN-based approaches adapted such cases well. Comparison of all the three NN-based approaches among themselves has been made during reverse modelling. During this process, prediction accuracy, using LBFGSNN, is found to be better than the other two methods. Thus, it is perceived that NN-based models might suit better for prediction of shape accuracy of flow-formed shell.},

  abstract     = {There are many challenges in the task of predicting ore deposits from big data repositories. The data are inherently complex and of great significance to the intervenient spatial relevance of deposits. The characteristics of the data make it difficult to use machine learning algorithms for the quantitative prediction of mineral resources. There are considerable interest and value in extracting spatial distribution characteristics from two-dimensional (2-d) ore-controlling factor layers under different metallogenic conditions. In this paper we undertake such analysis using a deep convolutional neural network algorithm named AlexNet. Training on the 2-d mineral prediction and classification model is performed using data from the Songtao–Huayuan sedimentary manganese deposit. It mines the coupling correlation between the spatial distribution of chemical elements, sedimentary facies, the outcrop of Datangpo Formation, faults, water system, and the areas where manganese ore bodies are present, as well as the correlation among different ore-controlling factors by employing the AlexNet networks. By comparing the training loss, training accuracy, verification accuracy, and recall of models trained by different scales of grids and different combinations of ore-controlling factor layers, we further discuss the most appropriate scale division and the optimal combination of ore-controlling factors to make the model achieve its strongest robustness. It is found that the prediction performance of AlexNet networks reaches its peak when selecting a grid division of 200 pixels × 200 pixels (the actual distance is 10 km × 10 km) and inputting the distribution layers of 21 chemical elements maps, lithofacies–paleogeographic map, formation and tectonic map, outcrop map of Datangpo Formation, and water system map. The training loss, training accuracy, verification accuracy, and recall of the optimal model are 0.0000001, 100.00\%, 86.21\%, and 91.67\%, respectively. The proposed method is successfully applied to the 2-d metallogenic prediction in Songtao–Huayuan study area. And five metallogenic prospective areas from A to E are delineated with large probability for potential ore bodies.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a short-term traffic flow forecasting method based on deep belief network–support vector regression. Support vector regression classifier SVR is used at the top of the model. Data processing is from bottom to top. Firstly, at the bottom of the model, the input traffic flow data are processed differently; then, the DBN model is used to learn the traffic flow characteristics. Finally, SVR is used to predict the traffic flow at the top of the model. The average absolute error of the prediction is 9.57\%, and the average relative error is 5.91\%. The relationship between the predicted value and the actual traffic flow data is found through simulation experiments. The predicted value of the model proposed in this paper is in good agreement with the measured value, and the prediction accuracy is high. The model can effectively predict short-term traffic flow. Finally, compared with the traditional DBN prediction model and other common prediction models, the proposed prediction model has higher prediction accuracy.},

In this paper, we analyze the low-carbon integrated forward/reverse logistics network and made relevant simulation tests. The results show that the changes of the confidence level and carbon emission limits have obvious influences on logistics costs. If the emission limit is large, carbon trading mechanism has little effect on the total logistics cost in the same scenario. Therefore, the government needs to use the appropriate emission limits to guide enterprises to reduce carbon emissions, and enterprises can make coping strategies according to the different limit at the same time.

  abstract     = {Virtual network embedding (VNE) refers to allocating reasonable substrate network resources for virtual network (VN) requests that include computing resources and network resources, so as to obtain optimal income from leasing virtual resources. Such a way of providing virtual resources is the key technology of cloud computing and can greatly save the operating cost of enterprises and provide flexibility of application deployment. However, the existing VNE algorithms are mostly oriented to traditional stochastic network topologies. Due to the high connectivity and server density of data centers and the complexity of the user’s resource requirements, the traditional VNE algorithms suffer from low resource utilization rate and revenues in the VNE on the data centers. Different from the existing algorithms which are often based on heuristic algorithms, this paper proposes a VNE algorithm for data center topology based on the Q-learning algorithm which is a typical reinforcement learning method. The algorithm an agent for each VN designs a reward function related to the effect of virtual link embedding, which is used to update the Q-matrix through unsupervised learning process. Then, the agent can find the optimal embedding strategy based on the Q-table from each learning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the resource utilization ratio and obtain a better revenue/cost ratio of the substrate network compared with the traditional heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In the big data environment, hospital medical data are also becoming more complex and diversified. The traditional method of manually processing data has not been able to meet the management needs of massive medical data. With the further development of big data technology and machine learning, the smart medical aided diagnosis model came into being. However, there is almost no auxiliary diagnosis mode for orthopedic diseases. In order to make up for the gap in the auxiliary diagnosis of orthopedics and promote the wisdom process of orthopedic disease diagnosis, this paper proposes an orthopedic auxiliary classification prediction model based on XGBoost algorithm. The experimental data were obtained from the clinical case information of femoral neck patients from April 2016 to October 2018, Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumor Surgery, Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning Cancer Hospital &amp; Institute. In order to make the experimental results more convincing, while constructing the XGBoost model, the orthopedic auxiliary classification prediction model is constructed based on the random forest algorithm and the associated classification algorithm, respectively, and the three models are compared and analyzed. The results show that compared with the random forest model and the associated classification model, the XGBoost algorithm classification prediction model has higher accuracy, faster calculation speed, and more applicability in orthopedic clinical data. The XGBoost algorithm can cope with complex and diverse medical data, and can better meet the requirements of timeliness and accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis. The classification and prediction model of orthopedic auxiliary diagnosis proposed in this paper helps to reduce the workload of medical workers, help patients prevent and recover early, and realize real auxiliary medical services.},

In this paper, the key technologies of detection and recognition of underground seismic signal are studied. The target recognition algorithm is designed to realize the target recognition through denoising the collected target signal and extracting the characteristic quantity. Considering that ground motion signals generated by moving targets on the ground are susceptible to environmental noise, this paper introduces the working principle of wavelet packet denoising and its support vector machine classification model. Wavelet packet was used to transform the signal to denoise first, then zero-crossing rate analysis of the denoised signal was carried out after wavelet packet denoising and extracts the parameters, and the energy of cross-correlation criteria was selected finally. Quantitative indices are combined to construct multi-feature vectors, which are used as input of multi-class support vector machine for training and prediction. In this model, the optimal parameters of support vector machine model are found by genetic algorithm parameter optimization. The experimental results show that the improved model can recognize and classify the ground motion signals caused by people and vehicles correctly and can improve the performance of the classifier.},

In recent years, the number of the elderly population is increasing, and the incidence of elderly diseases has increased significantly. The most representative of these diseases is Alzheimer’s disease. According to some data, the average survival time of Alzheimer’s disease patients is only 5.5 years, which is the “fourth killer” that endangers the health of the elderly after cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and cancer. According to conservative estimates of the International Federation of Alzheimer’s Diseases, the number of Alzheimer’s disease patients worldwide will increase to 75.62 million by 2030; by 2050, the number of patients will reach 135.46 million. Therefore, it is urgent to classify the course of Alzheimer’s disease. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) model method is used to classify and predict different disease processes of Alzheimer’s disease based on structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging data, so as to help the auxiliary diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, the extracted MRI data and the SVM model are combined to obtain more accurate classification prediction results. The accuracy of classification and prediction is the best. According to the predicted results, the data characteristics related to diseases can be determined, which can provide a basis for clinical and basic research, etiology and pathological changes.},

In this paper, we develop a new rainy image model to describe rain scenes at night with low illumination. From this model, we propose a joint deep neural network-based method for single nighttime rainy image enhancement. First, a decom-net based on Retinex theory is employed for image decomposition, and the purpose of this sub-net is to extract the reflection image and the illumination image from the input image. Then, an enhancement net is proposed for illumination adjustment. The goal of this sub-net is to remove the negative effect (low visual) caused by low illumination. Finally, a symmetric sub-net termed multi-stream network-based contextual autoencoder is developed, where rain features are directly learned from the enhanced nighttime rainy images in a recurrent way. The goal of this sub-net is to effectively remove rain streaks from the illumination-enhanced image. The experimental results show the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed method, and evident improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods are obtained with the proposed method.},

Using the cross-validation method to make the most reasonable statistics for the classification and recognition accuracy of the adjusted support vector machine avoids the situation that the classification accuracy of the support vector machine is unstable or the statistics are inaccurate.

It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. China’s air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained. The results are ideal, which provides a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention and control of air pollution and urban management planning.},

  abstract     = {Most of the text in the questions of community question–answering systems does not consist of a definite mechanism for the restriction of inappropriate and insincere content. A given piece of text can be insincere if it asserts false claims or assumes something which is debatable or has a non-neutral or exaggerated tone about an individual or a group. In this paper, we propose a pipeline called Deep Refinement which utilizes some of the state-of-the-art methods for information retrieval from highly sparse data such as capsule network and attention mechanism. We have applied the Deep Refinement pipeline to classify the text primarily into two categories, namely sincere and insincere. Our novel approach ‘Deep Refinement’ provides a system for the classification of such questions in order to ensure enhanced monitoring and information quality. The database used to understand the real concept of what actually makes up sincere and insincere includes quora insincere question dataset. Our proposed question classification method outperformed previously used text classification methods, as evident from the F1 score of 0.978.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Capsule Network is an emerging neural network structure that is characterized by the ability to maintain high classification accuracy. By analyzing the difference between Capsule Network and traditional convolutional neural network, it is found that the model compression method applied to the traditional neural network cannot be directly used in the Capsule Network. To address the problem, an IPC-CapsNet compression algorithm is proposed based on the structural characteristics of the Capsule Networks. The algorithm can reduce the computational complexity and compress the scale of model computation on the basis of retaining the accuracy of model classification. Considering the deficiency of Capsule Network processing serialized text data separately, we combined with IPC-CapsNet and then come up with a sentiment classification algorithm SPT-CapsNet. It has conducted a sentiment analysis experiment of MicroBlog dataset. Compared to other methods, our SPT-CapsNet obtained the best performance among the metrics. The SPT-CapsNet improves the running speed and maintains the balance between classification accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of computers and the rapid development of various application platforms, the explosive growth of data poses a huge challenge to data analysis and storage. For large-scale image analysis applications, the time delay in storing read data becomes an important issue that constrains this application. The semantic information asymmetry between image application and storage is the root cause of this problem. In view of content semantic analysis, in recent years, intelligent computing has become the main research direction. Among them, machine learning has become a research hot spot because of its offline learning and online generation characteristics. For the semantics of image content, machine learning can complete tasks such as content semantic association, classification, annotation and hash mapping, and provide algorithm support for applying image semantics and improving semantic analysis ability in large-scale environment. Image annotation is an important topic in the semantic analysis of image content. Annotation can establish a classification relationship between image content and semantics. In order to solve the problem of extracting a large amount of data in large-scale image analysis, a content semantic image content analysis and storage scheme based on intelligent computer learning image annotation is proposed. Combined with DSTH work, the program introduces deep learning, visual lexicon and map metadata. Hash semantic metadata supplemental metadata is obtained through deep learning, and semantic metadata is constructed and managed in a hierarchical structure. In addition, according to the characteristics of the graph structure, by improving the PageRank algorithm, the SemRank node ranking algorithm based on Hamming distance is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Due to the efficiency and efficacy in performance to tackle complex optimization problems, swarm intelligence (SI) optimizers, newly emerged as nature-inspired algorithms, have gained great interest from researchers over different fields. A large number of SI optimizers and their extensions have been developed, which drives the need to comprehensively review the characteristics of each algorithm. Hence, a generalized framework laid upon the fundamental principles from which SI optimizers are developed is crucial. This research takes a multidisciplinary view by exploring research motivations from biology, psychology, computing and engineering. A learning–interaction–diversification (LID) framework is proposed where learning is to understand the individual behavior, interaction is to describe the swarm behavior, and diversification is to control the population performance. With the LID framework, 22 state-of-the-art SI algorithms are characterized, and nine representative ones are selected to review in detail. To investigate the relationships between LID properties and algorithmic performance, LID-driven experiments using benchmark functions and real-world problems are conducted. Comparisons and discussions on learning behaviors, interaction relations and diversity control are given. Insights of the LID framework and challenges are also discussed for future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, which is responsible for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. Early diagnosis of melanoma can significantly reduce mortality rates and treatment costs. Therefore, skin cancer specialists are using image-based diagnostic tools for detecting melanoma earlier. We aim to develop a handheld device featured with low cost and high performance to enhance early detection of melanoma at the primary healthcare. But, developing this device is very challenging due to the complicated computations required by the embedded diagnosis system. Thus, we aim to exploit the recent hardware technology in reconfigurable computing to achieve a high-performance embedded system at low cost. Support vector machine (SVM) is a common classifier that shows high accuracy for classifying melanoma within the diagnosis system and is considered as the most compute-intensive task in the system. In this paper, we propose a dynamic hardware system for implementing a cascade SVM classifier on FPGA for early melanoma detection. A multi-core architecture is proposed to implement a two-stage cascade classifier using two classifiers with accuracies of 98\% and 73\%. The hardware implementation results were optimized by using the dynamic partial reconfiguration technology, where very low resource utilization of 1\% slices and power consumption of 1.5 W were achieved. Consequently, the implemented dynamic hardware system meets vital embedded system constraints of high performance and low cost, resource utilization, and power consumption, while achieving efficient classification with high accuracy.},

Compared with the Western developed capital market, China’s current stock market’s main smart investment strategy still has certain defects. Based on the SVM model, this paper establishes a predictive model that combines kernel parameters and parameter optimization to model. The mesh search method, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm are used to optimize the parameters of the SVM under various kernel functions such as radial basis kernel function. The algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm optimize the parameters of the SVM to strengthen the applicability of the model in practice. The empirical results show that under the three-parameter optimization algorithms, the prediction results are higher than the random prediction accuracy, which indicates that it is effective to optimize the model by adjusting the parameters of the SVM. Among them, the SVM using the genetic algorithm parameter optimization under the radial basis kernel function shows the better prediction effect, which is the closest to the real value in the stock market forecast. The particle swarm algorithm supports the vector machine to predict the effect is slightly lower than the grid. Search method. In addition, through comparison experiments, the guess accuracy of BP neural network is worse than that of the support vector machine model before the adjustment.

  abstract     = {With the rapid rise of the Internet, China’s e-commerce has also flourished. The development of e-commerce has led to an increase in the volume of logistics and distribution. The further development of e-commerce has also placed higher demands on the timeliness of logistics and distribution. The competition of e-commerce companies has shifted from the competition between business models to the competition between logistics services. The scientific and rational distribution site selection planning is the prerequisite and guarantee for the efficient operation of logistics distribution network. To balance the contradiction between logistics distribution speed and distribution cost has become the key to competition among e-commerce companies. This paper analyzes the current network structure and distribution mode of e-commerce logistics city distribution, and analyzes and discusses the problems existing in current e-commerce logistics city distribution. Furthermore, the bi-level programming is studied. According to the characteristics of the bi-level programming problem, the genetic algorithm flow suitable for bi-level programming is proposed. The bi-level programming model of urban distribution service network site selection with limited lines is proposed. Through the verification of the genetic algorithm in this paper, the proposed method can plan a reasonable service site location layout and distribution models and path selection. The results show that the average daily fuel cost can be reduced by 37.6\%, and the transportation distance and fuel cost can be optimized best.},

Traditional forensics exists problems of inaccurate information, unfair responsibility definition and risk of leakage of user’s privacy. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we proposed a trusted forensics scheme based on digital image watermark in intelligent VANET, in which we proposed technical and fair algorithms for trusted forensics, and the trusted forensics scheme includes basic forensics parameter data obtaining critical forensics data automatic generation and forensics data extraction. Once there vehicle accident occurred, the forensics system first obtains the location, timestamp, forensics device data as basic forensics parameter data, and then, it embeds the forensics parameter as watermark into the real-time vehicle accident photograph by the proposed digital watermark algorithm, and thus, the real-time and undeniable forensics data are automatic generated as evidence; when necessary, the forensics system can extract the evidence data and watermark data from the critical forensics data. The proposed scheme can detect the content integrity of image data and even find out tampering mark when the image data are tampered. Additionally, we used neural network algorithm for vehicle license plate recognition and rapid vehicle information gathering. Finally, experiments evaluations manifest the proposed is forensics scheme is secure, robust, and efficient in vehicle forensics.},

To bright this gap between the practical requirements and the applications, one convex optimization-based framework with one L0 regularization and the constraint on the learners’ characteristics was presented.

In the perspective of government regulation, this paper focuses on the regulatory warning model of regional product quality. In reference to the regional competitiveness index and customer satisfaction index system, the regulatory warning index system is established, according to the four aspects of regional economic development, residential living standard, situation of industrial enterprise and government regulation. In this work, the warning model based on back-propagation artificial neural network is introduced; the quantitative results shows that the predicted value is highly consistent with the actual value after conducting the empirical research on the warning model, using the data of Shandong Province from 2000 to 2013. The study demonstrates that early warning indicators could be useful for the prediction of accidents of regional product quality through back-propagation artificial neural network model.

The paper proposed a new picking algorithm with the emerging new graph signal processing technology in the signal processing field. Fundamentally, first arrival picking is actually as a problem to recognize direct seismic waves among background noises. It is apparently that background noises and the direct waves are from different sources, and therefore, there is no connectivity among them, which formulates the fundamentals of the proposed method. With the help of graph signal processing theory, such non-connectivity is fully explored and cast into an optimization problem for picking the first arrivals in oil exploration. From simulations and real measurements results, the proposed method is validated for first arrival picking with good performances, especially in situations with low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Because financial data contain complex, incomplete and fuzzy information, predicting their development trends is an extremely difficult challenge. Fluctuations in financial data depend on a myriad of correlated constantly changing factors. Therefore, predicting and analysing financial data are a nonlinear, time-dependent problem. Deep neural networks (DNNs) combine the advantages of deep learning (DL) and neural networks and can be used to solve nonlinear problems more satisfactorily compared to conventional machine learning algorithms. In this paper, financial product price data are treated as a one-dimensional series generated by the projection of a chaotic system composed of multiple factors into the time dimension, and the price series is reconstructed using the time series phase-space reconstruction (PSR) method. A DNN-based prediction model is designed based on the PSR method and a long- and short-term memory networks (LSTMs) for DL and used to predict stock prices. The proposed and some other prediction models are used to predict multiple stock indices for different periods.

With the continuous development of computer network technology and communication technology, audio information has become a very important part. Audio is a non-semantic symbolic representation and an unstructured binary stream. Because the audio itself lacks the description of content semantics and structured organization, it brings great difficulty to the audio classification work. The research of digital audio classification will become more and more important with the increasing number of digital audio resources in the network. Digital audio classification technology is the key technology to solve this problem. It is the key to solve the problem of audio structure and extract audio structured information and content semantics. It is a research hot spot in the field of audio analysis. It has important application value in many fields, such as audio retrieval, video summary and auxiliary video analysis. This paper studies the structure of audio, the analysis and extraction of audio features, the digital audio classifier based on support vector machines (SVM) and the audio segmentation technology based on BCI. SVM is an important achievement of machine learning research in recent years. As a new machine learning method, SVM can solve practical problems such as small sample, nonlinearity and high dimension, so it has become a new research hot spot after the study of neural network. Experiments show that the SVM-based audio classification algorithm has good classification effect, and the smoothed audio segmentation results are more accurate.

  abstract     = {The bottom hole pressure (BHP) of managed pressure drilling (MPD) is a typically unstable object with hysteresis that is difficult to be directly controlled. However, at the present stage, BHP control still focuses on conventional PID control and simple intelligent control, requiring repeated data alignment. There are some related problems, such as lack of control over BHP, longer working hours and high cost of drilling. In order to increase economic effects of MPD, this paper analyzes the MPD system and utilizes wellhead back pressure as the controlled variable. According to throttle valve features, basic parameters and boundary conditions of MPD, a mathematical model of throttle valve is also calculated. Besides, this paper focuses on studying the control model and proposes an improved particle swarm algorithm to optimize PID neural network (IPSOPIDNN) model. This model is improved based on inertia weight and fitness function of conventional particle swarm algorithm. Moreover, the particle swarm algorithm is used to optimize the initial weight value of PID neural network, shorten the search time for optimal value of particle swarm, and reduce the chance of local minimum. The real-time control results of IPSO-PIDNN are compared with results of traditional particle swarm optimization PID neural network (PSO-PIDNN) and particle swarm optimization PID neural network (PSO-PIDNN). IPSO-PIDNN control system has some advantages, including favorable self-learning, optimization quality, high levels of control precision, no overshoot, rapid response and short setting time. In this way, advanced automation control of BHP is conducted during managed pressure drilling process, thus providing technical support for the well control safety of managed pressure drilling.},

During the manufacturing process, CNC machine tools, as large-scale and complex equipment, involve a variety of service demands in the life cycle, especially the productive service demands are numerous and scattered. The article established the correlation model between customer demands and productive service demands based on clustering ideas and mathematical statistics theory to complete the modularization of productive service demands for CNC machine tools. A comprehensive correlation coefficient model and an improved AP clustering algorithm were put forward. The comprehensive correlation coefficient model mined the correlation between customer demand and production service demand and the self-correlation of production service demands directly based on the combination weight obtained by the analytic hierarchy process and rough set theory. The improved AP clustering algorithm was the combination of AP and Kruskal minimum tree principle. By this new algorithm, the clustering project of productive service demands for every customer demand could be attained. Finally, the five matrices can be computed in 1083 ms, 1067 ms, 1029 ms, 1149 ms and 1042 ms, respectively, by the improved AP clustering algorithm. However, the original AP method should spend 1122 ms, 1241 ms, 1231 ms, 1383 ms and 1231 ms, respectively.

Task scheduling in cloud computing environment is one of the main problems that need to be addressed in order to improve system performance and increase cloud consumer satisfaction. Although there are many task scheduling algorithms, existing approaches mainly focus on minimizing the total completion time while ignoring workload balancing. Moreover, managing the quality of service (QoS) of the existing approaches still needs to be improved. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named MGGS (modified genetic algorithm (GA) combined with greedy strategy). The proposed algorithm leverages the modified GA algorithm combined with greedy strategy to optimize task scheduling process. Different from existing algorithms, MGGS can find an optimal solution using fewer number of iterations. To evaluate the performance of MGGS, we compared the performance of the proposed algorithm with several existing algorithms based on the total completion time, average response time, and QoS parameters. The results obtained from the experiments show that MGGS performs well as compared to other task scheduling algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Ball mills are extensively used in the size reduction process of different ores and minerals. The fill level inside a ball mill is a crucial parameter which needs to be monitored regularly for optimal operation of the ball mill. In this paper, a vibration monitoring-based method is proposed and tested for estimating the fill level inside a laboratory-scale ball mill. A vibration signal is captured from the base of a laboratory-scale ball mill by using a ± 5 g accelerometer. Features are extracted from the vibration signal by using different transforms such as fast Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform, wavelet packet decomposition, and empirical mode decomposition. These features are given as input to an artificial neural network which is used to predict the percentage fill level inside the ball mill. In this paper, the predicted fill level obtained by using different features are compared. It is found that the predicted fill level due to features obtained after fast Fourier transform outperforms other transforms.},

  abstract     = {Classification of athletes’ performance in vertical jump (VJ) tests is a recommended practice at various stages of athlete fitness development and performance enhancement. The practice is, however, currently conducted subjectively and mainly based on measures of the vertical jump height (VJH) attained in standardized VJ tests. The current study presents an intelligent integrated classification framework (IICF) for classification of athlete performance in single-leg (SL) and double-leg (DL) standing VJ tests based on lower extremity (LE) biomechanical data. Biomechanical data consisted of three-dimensional (3D) kinematics and electromyography (EMG) features generated from ankle–knee joints and eight LE muscles of 13 healthy female national netball players (subjects) obtained during six trials of SL-left leg (SLLL), SL-right leg (SLRL), and DL VJ tests. Each participating subject had prior VJ classification by the trainer as either excellent or very good in each of the three VJ tests. IICF introduced in this work utilizes an integration of the scalable and interoperable relational database management system (MySQLDB) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Integrated pattern sets containing the extracted features (EF) obtained from first three VJ trials data were randomly partitioned into design and test data sets and ANN implemented using fully connected multilayer perceptron feedforward neural networks (MLP-FFNN) with three different training algorithms. Subjects’ prior VJ classifications were used as MLP-FFNN target outputs. A second classifier is trained using support vector machine (SVM) using three different kernel mapping functions and performances between MPL-FFNN and SVM classifiers compared on both training and independent test pattern sets. The test pattern sets comprise of EF generated from the latter three VJ trials data stored in MySQLDB. The average classification accuracy (F-measure) achieved by the optimally trained MLP-FFNN classifier on independent test pattern sets across all the three VJ activities was 93.33\% (86.67–96.77\%), whereas SVM classifier’s was 82.5\% (73.33–87.5\%). Through a custom-made web-based interface having backend integration of MySQLDB and the optimally trained MLP-FFNN, classification of individual subjects’ pattern sets from either VJ activities is also enabled. Individual subjects’ classification results can then be compared with prior classifications by the trainer, and differences were highlighted. IICF introduced in this work has demonstrated its feasibility as an objective complementary assessment tool for trainers during conducting of SL and DL vertical jump tests for netball players and athletes in general. Descriptive statistics for the entire experimental data sets’ features used in this study are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Short-term electricity price forecasting in deregulated electricity markets has been studied extensively in recent years but without significant reduction in price forecasting errors. Also demand-side management and short-term scheduling operations in smart grids do not require strictly very accurate forecast and can be executed with certain practical price thresholds. This paper, therefore, presents a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for both short-term electricity price forecasting and classification according to some prespecified price thresholds. The kernel ELM does not require the hidden layer mapping function to be known and produces robust prediction and classification in comparison with the conventional ELM using random weights between the input and hidden layers. Further in the MKELM formulation, the linear combination of the weighted kernels is optimized using vaporization precipitation-based water cycle algorithm (WCA) to produce significantly accurate electricity price prediction and classification. The combination of MKELM and WCA is named as WCA-MKELM in this work. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three electricity markets, namely PJM, Ontario and New South Wales, are considered for electricity price forecasting and classification producing fairly accurate results.},

  abstract     = {Learning Bayesian network (BN) structures from data is a NP-hard problem due to the vastness of the solution space. To address this issue, hybrid approaches that integrate the constraint-based (CB) method and the score-and-search (SS) method have been developed in the literature, but when the constrained search space is fixed and inaccurate, it is very likely to lose the optimal solution, leading to low learning accuracy. Besides, due to the randomness and uncertainty of the search, it is difficult to preserve the superiority of the structures, resulting in low learning efficiency. Therefore, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm based on an improved evolutionary approach to explore BN structure with highest matching degree of data set in dynamic constrained search space. The proposed algorithm involves two phases, namely the CB phase and the SS phase. In the CB phase, the mutual information is utilized as the restriction to limit the search space, and a binding parameter is introduced to the novel encoding scheme so that the search space can be dynamically changed in the evolutionary process. In the SS phase, a new operator is developed to pass on the excellent genes from generation to generation, and an update principle for the binding parameter is exploited for the dynamic selection of the search space. We conduct the comparative experiments on the benchmark network data sets and provide performance and applicability analysis of our proposed method. The experimental results show that the new algorithm is effective in learning the BN structures.},

  abstract     = {Single-sample face recognition has been investigated by a few researches over the past few decades. However, due to the demand of identity of interest searching from video surveillance in recent years, this system has been expanded to open-set face recognition (OSFR) scheme. The OSFR system provides the identity of registered subjects and rejects the unregistered ones using only single-sample reference. This is important in video surveillance applications in which both database members and non-members are expected to appear in the scene. In this paper, we propose to use fuzzy ARTMAP neural network to solve the problem of open-set single-sample face recognition in real-world video surveillance scenario. Our proposed approach can recognize faces in near-frontal views under various illumination and facial expression conditions. Facial features are extracted using histograms of oriented gradients and Gabor wavelets and then fused using canonical correlation analysis to yield feature vectors that are robust against the aforementioned conditions. The fuzzy ARTMAP classifier has been trained using only single sample per person. We have conducted experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets, namely AR, FRGC, and ChokePoint. The experimental results have shown that the proposed approach has a superior performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

SVM classifier is used during watermark extraction to obtain improved robustness under diverse attack conditions. In this work, a detailed analysis of imperceptibility and robustness performance with the use of different sub-bands has been presented. The performance on different sub-band has been analyzed so as to maximize the robustness against different attacks keeping imperceptibility at adequate level. Robustness is observed against various attacks such as noising attacks, denoising attacks, image processing attacks, lossy compression attacks and geometric attacks. It is seen that high-frequency sub-band provides better invisibility, whereas variation of robustness performance on different sub-bands depend on the type of attacks. It is observed from the performance analysis that all the attacks do not have exactly same effect on the frequency content of the image. For instance, noising attack affects every frequency component of the image almost equally, whereas the embedding in high-frequency band makes the system fragile to lossy compression attack. The algorithm is tested on a large image database to observe the variation in the performance of the system. Comparative analysis suggests that the proposed sub-band provides improved performance over some benchmark methods in most of the cases.},

ANN models are studied with two different sets of input, i.e. for the first case the inputs to the model are the three features of Hα line such as the peak intensity count, full-width half maximum and area under Hα line, while for the second case, the peak intensity count of a group of emission lines like Hα, Ar I, O I, K I, Na D lines are considered as the inputs. ANN model is developed for estimating four different sets of hydrogen flow rates 5, 8, 10 and 12 litres per minute (lpm) when the argon flow rate is constant at 10 lpm. For both the input features, the model performances are compared, and it is shown that improved estimation accuracy is observed from the second case, i.e. from peak intensity count of a group of emission lines instead of only hydrogen emission line.},

New approaches are thus being souhgt to tackle these issues and deploy real-time DNNs into resource-limited IoT devices. This paper presents a comprehensive review on hardware-and-software-co-design approaches developed to implement DNNs on low-resource hardware platforms. These approaches explore the trade-off between energy consumption, speed, classification accuracy, and model size. First, an overview of DNNs is given. Next, available tools for implementing DNNs on low-resource hardware platforms are described. Then, the memory hierarchy designs together with dataflow mapping strategies are presented. Furthermore, various model optimization approaches, including pruning and quantization, are discussed. In addition, case studies are given to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing DNNs for IoT applications. Finally, detailed discussions, research gaps, and future directions are provided.

So a GWO based on random opposition learning, strengthening hierarchy of grey wolves and modified evolutionary population dynamics (EPD), named as RSMGWO, is proposed. Firstly, a search way based on strengthening hierarchy of grey wolves is added; each grey wolf uses two kinds of updating modes, including a global-best search way based on random dimensions and the original search way of GWO, to improve the optimization performance. Secondly, a modified EPD is embedded to improve the optimization performance further. Finally, a random opposition learning strategy is merged to avoid falling into local optima. Experimental results on 19 different (especially large scale) dimensional benchmark functions and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) optimization for cancer identification show that compared with GWO and quite a few state-of-the-art algorithms, RSMGWO is able to provide more competitive results, in terms of both accuracy and convergence.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the Internet of Things and the e-Health are producing huge collections of Time Series that are analyzed in order to classify current status or to detect certain events, among others. In two-class problems, when the positive events to detect are infrequent, the gathered data lack balance. Even in unsupervised learning, this imbalance causes models to decrease their generalization capability. In order to solve such problem, Time Series balancing algorithms have been proposed. Time Series balancing algorithms have barely been studied; the different approaches make use of either a single bag of Time Series extracting some of them in order to generate a synthetic new one or ghost points in the distance space. These solutions are suitable when there is one only data source and they are univariate datasets. However, in the context of the Internet of Things, where multiple data sources are available, these approaches may not perform coherently. Besides, up to our knowledge there is not multiple datasources and multivariate TS balancing algorithms in the literature. In this research, we study two main concerns that should be considered when designing balancing Time Series algorithms: on the one hand, the TS balancing algorithms should deal with multiple multivariate data sources; on the other hand, the balancing algorithms should be shape preserving. A new algorithm is proposed for balancing multivariate Time Series datasets, as part of our work. A complete evaluation of the algorithm is performed dealing with two real-world multivariate Time Series datasets coming from the e-Health domain: one about epilepsy crisis identification and the other on fall detection. A thorough analysis of the performance is discussed, showing the advantages of considering the Time Series issues within the balancing algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In the hereby work, we present the use of sparse representation and overcomplete dictionary learning method for examining the case of anomaly detection in an electrocardiographic record. The above mentioned signal was introduced in a form of correct electrocardiographic morphological structures and outliers which describe different sorts of disorders. In the course of study, two sorts of dictionaries were used. The first consists of atoms created with the use of differently parameterized analytic Gabor functions. The second sort of dictionaries uses the modified Method of Optimal Directions to find a dictionary reflecting proper structures of an electrocardiographic signal. In addition, in this approach, the condition of decorrelation of dictionary atoms was introduced for the sake of gaining more precise and optimal representation. The dictionaries obtained in these two ways became a basis for the analyzed sparse representation of electrocardiographic record. During the anomaly detection process, which was based on decomposition of the analyzed signal into correct values and outliers, a modified alternating minimization algorithm was used. A commonly accessible base of data of electrocardiograms, that is MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, was utilized to examine the conduct of the recommended method. The effectiveness of the solution, which validated itself in searching of anomalies in the analyzed electrocardiographic record, was confirmed by experiment results.},

In this work, artificial neural network ensembles models were trained on with data from 325 bruxist patients examined at the Department of Prosthodontics and Occlusion (Craniomandibular Dysfunction Unit) of Oviedo University. The information retrieved from each patient included some occlusal variables and other information such as their gender and age. The aim of the model is to classify individuals suffering from bruxism in clenching and grinding patients. The models were analyzed using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, calibration assessments, inter- and intra-method variations. Effective odds ratios for the artificial neural network ensembles were compared. The model resulted in an area under the receiver operation characteristics curve of 86\%. At 95\% sensitivity, the specificity was 84.1\%, for the existence of 43.5\% of bruxists clenching patients in the population of this study. This population corresponds to a grinding patients’ best predictive value of 97.2\% and a clenching patients’ best predictive value of 89.5\% both using the bagging method. The artificial neural network model obtained can distinguish between clenching and grinding patients requiring the analysis of a few variables and with a high rate of success.},

  abstract     = {Over the last decades, advances in diagnosis and tissue microsurgical reconstruction of soft tissues have modified the therapeutic approach to salivary gland cancers, but long-term survival rates have increased only marginally. Due to the relatively low frequency of these tumors together with their diverse histopathological types, it is not easy to perform a prognosis assessment. Multivariate adaptative regression splines (MARS) is a data mining technique with a well-known ability to describe a response starting from a large number of predictors. In this work, MARS was used for determining the prognosis of cancers of salivary glands using clinical and histological variables, as well as molecular markers. Here, we have generated four different models combining different sets of variables, with sensitivities and specificities ranging from 95.45 to 100\%. Specifically, one of these models which combined five clinical variables (Tumor size –T–, neck node metastasis –N–, distant metastasis –M–, age and number of tumor recurrences) plus one molecular factor (gelatinase B -MMP-9-) showed a sensitivity and a specificity of 100\%. Therefore, the MARS model was applied to the modeling of the influence of several clinical and molecular variables on the prognosis of salivary gland cancers with success. A self-organizing map (SOM) is a type of neural network what was used here to determine a prognostic model composed for four variables: N, M, number of recurrences and tumor type. The sensitivity of this model was that of 97\%, and its specificity was that of 94.7\%.},

Despite numerous studies in which the demand is sensitive to selling price, in this paper demand function is considered as a function of both selling price and advertising level. Decisions are made in a CLSC consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a third party under centralized and decentralized decision making structures. In the decentralized structure, three different models are examined which differ on the member who collects used products from customers. Collection process is conducted by the manufacturer, the retailer or the third party. The problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game model in which the manufacturer acts as a leader. Moreover, various collection structures are deeply studied through a numerical analysis in which a real case study is provided and useful managerial insights are presented based on numerical results. The results show that the centralized structure outperforms the decentralized one in achieving the highest total expected profit, attaining highest demand by setting lowest selling price, and also by considering the environmental viewpoint and resource usage (achieving highest collection rate). Finally, sensitivity analysis on triangular fuzzy parameters is conducted to examine impact of triangular fuzzy parameters on model’s outputs.},

Demand from injured people relates to the vulnerability of regions that depends on the quality of buildings and severity of damage. In the studied problem, the commodities collected from relief centers, donations and storage warehouses are distributed to the shelters. It aims at minimizing the total cost, and unfulfilled demand and maximizing the coverage and accessibility of relief centers. The LP-metric approach is utilized to solve the multi-objective model, and a scenario-based optimization is used to incorporate the uncertainty in the proposed model. Moreover, an LP–GA method is proposed for optimizing large-scale instances. Several problems in different scales are solved to show its flexibility and time-efficiency. Finally, a case study of an earthquake disaster in Amol city in Iran is presented. The obtained results suggest better service in the distressed urban areas.},

Second, a new weight coefficients’ estimation method has been introduced between the pattern and summation layers of PNN. Third, a novel convex fitness function has been designed for the bat algorithm to obtain an optimal smoothing parameter vector. The designed fitness function maintains a balance between the sensitivity and specificity values. The performance of the proposed algorithm “bat algorithm-based weighted Laplacian probabilistic neural network” is compared with that of conventional PNN, weighted PNN, extreme learning method, optimal pruned extreme learning machine and K-nearest neighbor. Experimental evaluation is carried out on eleven benchmark data sets using different performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and Youden’s index. The comparative performance evaluation of the proposed model has been made with the PNN, and other standard algorithms outperform the compared approaches in terms of classification accuracy.

However, the reconstruction quality degrades appreciably as the measurement rate decreases for existing CS methods. To address this problem, we propose a half-precision CS framework for end-to-end person Re-ID named HCS4ReID, which efficiently recoveries detailed features of the person-of-interest regions in video frames. HCS4ReID supports half-precision CS sampling, transmitting and storing CS measurements with half-precision floats, and CS reconstruction with two measurement rates. Extensive experiments implemented on the PRW dataset indicate that the proposed HCS4ReID achieves 1.55 $$\times$$ speedups over the single-precision counterpart on average for the CS sampling on an Intel HD Graphics 530, and only half-network bandwidth and storage space are needed to transmit and store the generated CS measurements. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed HCS4ReID is a scalable and portable CS framework with two measurement rates, and suitable for end-to-end person Re-ID. Especially, it achieves the comparable performance on the reconstructed PRW dataset against CS reconstruction with single-precision floats and a single measurement rate.},

  abstract     = {Perceptual audio coding is heavily and successfully applied for audio compression. However, perceptual audio coders may inject audible coding artifacts when encoding audio at low bitrates. Low-bitrate audio restoration is a challenging problem, which tries to recover a high-quality audio sample close to the uncompressed original from a low-quality encoded version. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven method for audio restoration, where temporal and spectral dynamics are explicitly captured by a deep time-frequency-LSTM recurrent neural networks. Leveraging the captured temporal and spectral information can facilitate the task of learning a nonlinear mapping from the magnitude spectrogram of low-quality audio to that of high-quality audio. The proposed method substantially attenuates audible artifacts caused by codecs and is conceptually straightforward. Extensive experiments were carried out and the experimental results show that for low-bitrate audio at 96 kbps (mono), 64 kbps (mono), and 96 kbps (stereo), the proposed method can efficiently generate improved-quality audio that is competitive or even superior in perceptual quality to the audio produced by other state-of-the-art deep neural network methods and the LAME-MP3 codec.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the success of deploying deep learning in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, this learning paradigm has also found its way into the field of Music Information Retrieval. In order to benefit from deep learning in an effective, but also efficient manner, deep transfer learning has become a common approach. In this approach, it is possible to reuse the output of a pre-trained neural network as the basis for a new learning task. The underlying hypothesis is that if the initial and new learning tasks show commonalities and are applied to the same type of input data (e.g., music audio), the generated deep representation of the data is also informative for the new task. Since, however, most of the networks used to generate deep representations are trained using a single initial learning source, their representation is unlikely to be informative for all possible future tasks. In this paper, we present the results of our investigation of what are the most important factors to generate deep representations for the data and learning tasks in the music domain. We conducted this investigation via an extensive empirical study that involves multiple learning sources, as well as multiple deep learning architectures with varying levels of information sharing between sources, in order to learn music representations. We then validate these representations considering multiple target datasets for evaluation. The results of our experiments yield several insights into how to approach the design of methods for learning widely deployable deep data representations in the music domain.},

This paper studies the analogous task in the audio domain and takes a critical look at the problems that arise when adapting the original vision-based framework to handle spectrogram representations. We conclude that CNN architectures with features based on 2D representations and convolutions are better suited for visual images than for time–frequency representations of audio. Despite the awkward fit, experiments show that the Gram matrix determined “style” for audio is more closely aligned with timbral signatures without temporal structure, whereas network layer activity determining audio “content” seems to capture more of the pitch and rhythmic structures. We shed insight on several reasons for the domain differences with illustrative examples. We motivate the use of several types of one-dimensional CNNs that generate results that are better aligned with intuitive notions of audio texture than those based on existing architectures built for images. These ideas also prompt an exploration of audio texture synthesis with architectural variants for extensions to infinite textures, multi-textures, parametric control of receptive fields and the constant-Q transform as an alternative frequency scaling for the spectrogram.},

  abstract     = {Separating a singing voice from its music accompaniment remains an important challenge in the field of music information retrieval. We present a unique neural network approach inspired by a technique that has revolutionized the field of vision: pixel-wise image classification, which we combine with cross entropy loss and pretraining of the CNN as an autoencoder on singing voice spectrograms. The pixel-wise classification technique directly estimates the sound source label for each time–frequency (T–F) bin in our spectrogram image, thus eliminating common pre- and postprocessing tasks. The proposed network is trained by using the Ideal Binary Mask (IBM) as the target output label. The IBM identifies the dominant sound source in each T–F bin of the magnitude spectrogram of a mixture signal, by considering each T–F bin as a pixel with a multi-label (for each sound source). Cross entropy is used as the training objective, so as to minimize the average probability error between the target and predicted label for each pixel. By treating the singing voice separation problem as a pixel-wise classification task, we additionally eliminate one of the commonly used, yet not easy to comprehend, postprocessing steps: the Wiener filter postprocessing. The proposed CNN outperforms the first runner up in the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) 2016 and the winner of MIREX 2014 with a gain of 2.2702–5.9563 dB global normalized source to distortion ratio when applied to the iKala dataset. An experiment with the DSD100 dataset on the full-tracks song evaluation task also shows that our model is able to compete with cutting-edge singing voice separation systems which use multi-channel modeling, data augmentation, and model blending.},

  abstract     = {We explore the potential of a popular distributional semantics vector space model, word2vec, for capturing meaningful relationships in ecological (complex polyphonic) music. More precisely, the skip-gram version of word2vec is used to model slices of music from a large corpus spanning eight musical genres. In this newly learned vector space, a metric based on cosine distance is able to distinguish between functional chord relationships, as well as harmonic associations in the music. Evidence, based on cosine distance between chord-pair vectors, suggests that an implicit circle-of-fifths exists in the vector space. In addition, a comparison between pieces in different keys reveals that key relationships are represented in word2vec space. These results suggest that the newly learned embedded vector representation does in fact capture tonal and harmonic characteristics of music, without receiving explicit information about the musical content of the constituent slices. In order to investigate whether proximity in the discovered space of embeddings is indicative of ‘semantically-related’ slices, we explore a music generation task, by automatically replacing existing slices from a given piece of music with new slices. We propose an algorithm to find substitute slices based on spatial proximity and the pitch class distribution inferred in the chosen subspace. The results indicate that the size of the subspace used has a significant effect on whether slices belonging to the same key are selected. In sum, the proposed word2vec model is able to learn music-vector embeddings that capture meaningful tonal and harmonic relationships in music, thereby providing a useful tool for exploring musical properties and comparisons across pieces, as a potential input representation for deep learning models, and as a music generation device.},

Although achieving state-of-the-art performances, it is still not fully understood what these networks learn and how the learned representations correlate with the emotional characteristics of speech. The aim of this work is to contribute to a deeper understanding of the acoustic and prosodic features that are relevant for the perception of emotional states. Firstly, an artificial deep neural network architecture is proposed that learns the auditory features directly from the raw and unprocessed speech signal. Secondly, we introduce two novel methods for the analysis of the implicitly learned representations based on data-driven and network-driven visualization techniques. Using these methods, we identify how the network categorizes an audio signal as a two-dimensional representation of emotions, namely valence and arousal. The proposed approach is a general method to enable a deeper analysis and understanding of the most relevant representations to perceive emotional expressions in speech.},

However, their left-to-right generation procedure only allows a limited control from a potential user which makes them unsuitable for interactive and creative usages such as interactive music generation. This article introduces a novel architecture called anticipation-RNN which possesses the assets of the RNN-based generative models while allowing to enforce user-defined unary constraints. We demonstrate its efficiency on the task of generating melodies satisfying unary constraints in the style of the soprano parts of the J.S. Bach chorale harmonizations. Sampling using the anticipation-RNN is of the same order of complexity than sampling from the traditional RNN model. This fast and interactive generation of musical sequences opens ways to devise real-time systems that could be used for creative purposes.},

The motivation is in using the capacity of deep learning architectures and training techniques to automatically learn musical styles from arbitrary musical corpora and then to generate samples from the estimated distribution. However, a direct application of deep learning to generate content rapidly reaches limits as the generated content tends to mimic the training set without exhibiting true creativity. Moreover, deep learning architectures do not offer direct ways for controlling generation (e.g., imposing some tonality or other arbitrary constraints). Furthermore, deep learning architectures alone are autistic automata which generate music autonomously without human user interaction, far from the objective of interactively assisting musicians to compose and refine music. Issues such as control, structure, creativity and interactivity are the focus of our analysis. In this paper, we select some limitations of a direct application of deep learning to music generation and analyze why the issues are not fulfilled and how to address them by possible approaches. Various examples of recent systems are cited as examples of promising directions.},

In this contribution, we investigate, both theoretically and experimentally, the influence of this pre-processing step on the network’s performance and pose the question whether replacing it by applying adaptive or learned filters directly to the raw data can improve learning success. The theoretical results show that approximately reproducing mel-spectrogram coefficients by applying adaptive filters and subsequent time-averaging on the squared amplitudes is in principle possible. We also conducted extensive experimental work on the task of singing voice detection in music. The results of these experiments show that for classification based on convolutional neural networks the features obtained from adaptive filter banks followed by time-averaging the squared modulus of the filters’ output perform better than the canonical Fourier transform-based mel-spectrogram coefficients. Alternative adaptive approaches with center frequencies or time-averaging lengths learned from training data perform equally well.},

Nevertheless, theoretical insights on harmonic ambiguity from harmony theory, experimental studies on annotator subjectivity in harmony annotations, and the availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous (subjective) harmony annotations in crowd-sourced repositories make the notion of a single-harmonic “ground truth” reference annotation a tenuous one. Recent studies suggest that subjectivity is intrinsic to harmonic reference annotations that should be embraced in automatic chord estimation rather than resolved. We introduce the first approach to automatic chord label personalization by modeling annotator subjectivity through harmonic interval-based chord representations. We integrate these representations from multiple annotators and deep learn them from audio. From a single trained model and the annotators’ chord-label vocabulary, we can accurately personalize chord labels for individual annotators. Furthermore, we show that chord personalization using multiple reference annotations outperforms using just a single reference annotation.

Recent high-profile advances in deep learning have improved performance across many application domains; however, they typically rely on large data sets that may not always be available. This paper presents an application of deep learning for acoustic event detection in a challenging, data-scarce, real-world problem. We show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), operating on wavelet transformations of audio recordings, demonstrate superior performance over conventional classifiers that utilize handcrafted features. Our key result is that wavelet transformations offer a clear benefit over the more commonly used short-time Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that features, handcrafted for a particular dataset, do not generalize well to other datasets. Conversely, CNNs trained on generic features are able to achieve comparable results across multiple datasets, along with outperforming human labellers.

  abstract     = {In this study, a modular design methodology inherited from cognitive neuroscience and neurophysiology is proposed to develop artificial neural networks, aiming to realize the powerful capability of brain—divide and conquer—when tackling complex problems. First, a density-based brain-like partition method is developed to construct the modular architecture, with a highly connected center in each sub-network as the human brain. The whole task is also divided into different sub-tasks at this stage. Then, a compact radial basis function (RBF) network with fast learning speed and desirable generalization performance is applied as the sub-network to solve the corresponding task. On the one hand, the modular structure helps to improve the ability of neural networks on complex problems by implementing divide and conquer. On the other hand, sub-networks with considerable ability could guarantee the parsimonious and generalization of the entire neural network. Finally, the novel modular RBF (NM-RBF) network is evaluated through multiple benchmark numerical experiments, and results demonstrate that the NM-RBF network is capable of constructing a relative compact architecture during a short learning process with achievable satisfactory generalization performance, showing its effectiveness and outperformance.},

  abstract     = {The convolutional neural network architecture has different components like convolution and pooling. The pooling is crucial component placed after the convolution layer. It plays a vital role in visual recognition, detection and segmentation course to overcome the concerns like overfitting, computation time and recognition accuracy. The elementary pooling process involves down sampling of feature map by piercing into subregions. This piercing and down sampling is defined by the pooling hyperparameters, viz. stride and filter size. This down sampling process discards the irrelevant information and picks the defined global feature. The generally used global feature selection methods are average and max pooling. These methods decline, when the main element has higher or lesser intensity than the nonsignificant element. It also suffers with locus and order of nominated global feature, hence not suitable for every situation. The pooling variants are proposed by numerous researchers to overcome concern. This article presents the state of the art on selection of global feature for pooling process mainly based on four categories such as value, probability, rank and transformed domain. The value and probability-based methods use the criteria such as the way of down sampling, size of kernel, input output feature map, location of pooling, number stages and random selection based on probability value. The rank-based methods assign the rank and weight to activation; the feature is selected based on the defined criteria. The transformed domain pooling methods transform the image to other domains such as wavelet, frequency for pooling the feature.},

Being an inspiring technology for improving the availability and sharing of medical data, the coded caching scheme for medical data is not only convenient for the medical staffs to grasp the patients’ health conditions and treatment history in time, but also effective for the patients to obtain improved quality of medical services. In this paper, the coded caching scheme for the combination network which is the model for the medical data sharing is studied. In the combination network, the server communicates with the users via multiple relays, and the relays as well as the users have cache memories. Using the maximum distance separable codes and placement delivery array (PDA) algorithm, the coded placement phase and delivery phase for combination networks are designed. In addition, for combination networks that satisfy the resolvability property, we extend the PDA algorithm to the case where the users’ priority is considered. The proposed scheme greatly reduces the subpacketization level with slightly increasing the transmission rate. The users with higher priority can get the requested content faster. We demonstrate that relays with cache memories can reduce the data transmission in peak time. The gap between the upper bound and lower bound of the transmission rate is gradually decreased with the increase in the users’ memories. The proposed scheme will shorten the latency time of the system and improve system efficiency for storage and access of medical data.},

  abstract     = {Hypopnea syndrome is a chronic respiratory disease that is characterized by repetitive episodes of breathing disruptions during sleep. Hypopnea syndrome is a systemic disease that manifests respiratory problems; however, more than 80\% of Hypopnea syndrome patients remain undiagnosed due to complicated polysomnography. Objective assessment of breathing patterns of an individual can provide useful insight into the respiratory function unearthing severity of Hypopnea syndrome. This paper explores a novel approach to detect incognito Hypopnea syndrome as well as provide a contactless alternative to traditional medical tests. The proposed method is based on S-Band sensing technique (including a spectrum analyzer, vector network analyzer, antennas, software-defined radio, RF generator, etc.), peak detection algorithm and Sine function fitting for the observation of breathing patterns and characterization of normal or disruptive breathing patterns for Hypopnea syndrome detection. The proposed system observes the human subject and changes in the channel frequency response caused by Hypopnea syndrome utilizing a wireless link between two monopole antennas, placed 3 m apart. Commercial respiratory sensors were used to verify the experimental results. By comparing the results, it is found that for both cases, the pause time is more than 10 s with 14 peaks. The experimental results show that this technique has the potential to open up new clinical opportunities for contactless and accurate Hypopnea syndrome monitoring in a patient-friendly and flexible environment.},

  abstract     = {Parkinson’s disease (PD), a multi-system neurodegenerative disorder which affects the brain slowly, is characterized by symptoms such as muscle stiffness, tremor in the limbs and impaired balance, all of which tend to worsen with the passage of time. Available treatments target its symptoms, aiming to improve the quality of life. However, automatic diagnosis at early stages is still a challenging medicine-related task to date, since a patient may have an identical behavior to that of a healthy individual at the very early stage of the disease. Parkinson’s disease detection through handwriting data is a significant classification problem for identification of PD at the infancy stage. In this paper, a PD identification is realized with help of handwriting images that help as one of the earliest indicators for PD. For this purpose, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network classifier with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to improve the identification. Two approaches like freeze and fine-tuning of transfer learning are investigated using ImageNet and MNIST dataset as source task independently. A trained network achieved 98.28\% accuracy using fine-tuning-based approach using ImageNet and PaHaW dataset. Experimental results on benchmark dataset reveal that the proposed approach provides better detection of Parkinson’s disease as compared to state-of-the-art work.},

For WBAN, energy consumption is the major concern which has been addressed in many researches. Different from existing works, this work studies a joint scheduling and admission control problem with objective of optimizing the energy efficiency of both intra- and beyond-WBAN link. The problem is formulated as constrained Markov decision processes, and the relative value iteration and Lagrange multiplier approach are used to derive the optimal intelligent algorithm. Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is capable of, in comparison with greedy scheme, achieving nearly 100\% throughput improvement in various power consumption budgets. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 5.5× power consumption saving for sensor node in comparison with other scheduling algorithms.},

Next, the case sheets were mined using tagging and maximum entropy methodologies, and the proposed stemmer extracts the common and unique set of attributes to classify the strokes. Then, the processed data were fed into various machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks, support vector machine, boosting and bagging and random forests. Among these algorithms, artificial neural networks trained with a stochastic gradient descent algorithm outperformed the other algorithms with a higher classification accuracy of 95\% and a smaller standard deviation of 14.69.},

After collecting the data from the various resources, the immune clonal selection algorithm approach is used to remove inconsistent data and minimize the dimensionality of data. The selected features are trained by the proposed associative decision tree approach which helps to compare with the testing features using the HDNN that successfully recognize the genetic disease-based features effectively.

  abstract     = {Today, most of the people are affected by lung cancer, mainly because of the genetic changes of the tissues in the lungs. Other factors such as smoking, alcohol, and exposure to dangerous gases can also be considered the contributory causes of lung cancer. Due to the serious consequences of lung cancer, the medical associations have been striving to diagnose cancer in its early stage of growth by applying the computer-aided diagnosis process. Although the CAD system at healthcare centers is able to diagnose lung cancer during its early stage of growth, the accuracy of cancer detection is difficult to achieve, mainly because of the overfitting of lung cancer features and the dimensionality of the feature set. Thus, this paper introduces the effective and optimized neural computing and soft computing techniques to minimize the difficulties and issues in the feature set. Initially, lung biomedical data were collected from the ELVIRA Biomedical Data Set Repository. The noise present in the data was eliminated by applying the bin smoothing normalization process. The minimum repetition and Wolf heuristic features were subsequently selected to minimize the dimensionality and complexity of the features. The selected lung features were analyzed using discrete AdaBoost optimized ensemble learning generalized neural networks, which successfully analyzed the biomedical lung data and classified the normal and abnormal features with great effectiveness. The efficiency of the system was then evaluated using MATLAB experimental setup in terms of error rate, precision, recall, G-mean, F-measure, and prediction rate.},

  abstract     = {Considering the increase in the number of the Barrett’s esophagus (BE) in the last decade, and its expected continuous increase, methods that can provide an early diagnosis of dysplasia in BE-diagnosed patients may provide a high probability of cancer remission. The limitations related to traditional methods of BE detection and management encourage the creation of computer-aided tools to assist in this problem. In this work, we introduce the unsupervised Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) classifier for learning visual dictionaries in the context of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) and automatic adenocarcinoma diagnosis. The proposed approach was validated in two datasets (MICCAI 2015 and Augsburg) using three different feature extractors (SIFT, SURF, and the not yet applied to the BE context A-KAZE), as well as five supervised classifiers, including two variants of the OPF, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function and Linear kernels, and a Bayesian classifier. Concerning MICCAI 2015 dataset, the best results were obtained using unsupervised OPF for dictionary generation using supervised OPF for classification purposes and using SURF feature extractor with accuracy nearly to $$78\%$$ for distinguishing BE patients from adenocarcinoma ones. Regarding the Augsburg dataset, the most accurate results were also obtained using both OPF classifiers but with A-KAZE as the feature extractor with accuracy close to $$73\%$$. The combination of feature extraction and bag-of-visual-words techniques showed results that outperformed others obtained recently in the literature, as well as we highlight new advances in the related research area. Reinforcing the significance of this work, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first one that aimed at addressing computer-aided BE identification using bag-of-visual-words and OPF classifiers, being the application of unsupervised technique in the BE feature calculation the major contribution of this work. It is also proposed a new BE and adenocarcinoma description using the A-KAZE features, not yet applied in the literature.},

Within this framework, this paper deals with the task of evaluating several artificial intelligence techniques to automatically distinguish between different activities of daily living (ADLs) and different types of falls. To do this, UniMiB SHAR, a publicly available data set containing instances of nine different ADLs and of eight kinds of falls, is considered. We take into account five different classes of classification algorithms, namely tree-based, discriminant-based, support vector machines, K-nearest neighbors, and ensemble mechanisms, and we consider several representatives for each of these classes. These are all the classes contained in the Classification Learner app contained in MATLAB, which serves as the computational basis for our experiments. As a result, we apply 22 different classification algorithms coming from artificial intelligence under a fivefold cross-validation learning strategy, with the aim to individuate which the most suitable is for this data set. The numerical results show that the algorithm with the highest classification accuracy is the ensemble based on subspace as the ensemble method and on KNN as learner type. This shows an accuracy equal to 86.0\%. Its results are better than those in the other papers in the literature that face this specific 17-class problem.},

  abstract     = {The video salient object detection (SOD) is the first step for the devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) to understand the environment around them. The video SOD needs the objects’ motion information in contiguous video frames as well as spatial contrast information from a single video frame. A large number of IoT devices’ computing power is not sufficient to support the existing SOD methods’ expensive computational complexity in emotion estimation, because they might have low hardware configurations (e.g., surveillance camera, and smartphone). In order to model the objects’ motion information efficiently for SOD, we propose an end-to-end video SOD algorithm with an efficient representation of the objects’ motion information. This algorithm contains two major parts: a 3D convolution-based X-shape structure that directly represents the motion information in successive video frames efficiently, and 2D densely connected convolutional neural networks (DenseNet) with pyramid structure to extract the rich spatial contrast information in a single video frame. Our method not only can maintain a small number of parameters as the 2D convolutional neural network but also represents spatiotemporal information uniformly that enables it can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our proposed method on four benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with the other five methods.},

  abstract     = {Efficient computation of quality of service (QoS) during medical data processing through intelligent measurement methods is one of the mandatory requirements of the medial healthcare world. However, emergency medical services often involve transmission of critical data, thus having stringent requirements for network quality of service (QoS). This paper contributes in three distinct ways. First, it proposes the novel adaptive QoS computation algorithm (AQCA) for fair and efficient monitoring of the performance indicators, i.e., transmission power, duty cycle and route selection during medical data processing in healthcare applications. Second, framework of QoS computation in medical applications is proposed at physical, medium access control (MAC) and network layers. Third, QoS computation mechanism with proposed AQCA and quality of experience (QoE) is developed. Besides, proper examination of QoS computation for medical healthcare application is evaluated with 4–10 inches large-screen user terminal (UT) devices (for example, LCD panel size, resolution, etc.). These devices are based on high visualization, battery lifetime and power optimization for ECG service in emergency condition. These UT devices are used to achieve highest level of satisfaction in terms, i.e., less power drain, extended battery lifetime and optimal route selection. QoS parameters with estimation of QoE perception identify the degree of influence of each QoS parameters on the medical data processing is analyzed. The experimental results indicate that QoS is computed at physical, MAC and network layers with transmission power (− 15 dBm), delay (100 ms), jitter (40 ms), throughput (200 Bytes), duty cycle (10\%) and route selection (optimal). Thus it can be said that proposed AQCA is the potential candidate for QoS computation than Baseline for medical healthcare applications.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this study is to propose an alternative, hybrid solution method for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images. In detail, the hybrid method is based on using both image processing and deep learning for improved results. In medical image processing, reliable diabetic retinopathy detection from digital fundus images is known as an open problem and needs alternative solutions to be developed. In this context, manual interpretation of retinal fundus images requires the magnitude of work, expertise, and over-processing time. So, doctors need support from imaging and computer vision systems and the next step is widely associated with use of intelligent diagnosis systems. The solution method proposed in this study includes employment of image processing with histogram equalization, and the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization techniques. Next, the diagnosis is performed by the classification of a convolutional neural network. The method was validated using 400 retinal fundus images within the MESSIDOR database, and average values for different performance evaluation parameters were obtained as accuracy 97\%, sensitivity (recall) 94\%, specificity 98\%, precision 94\%, FScore 94\%, and GMean 95\%. In addition to those results, a general comparison of with some previously carried out studies has also shown that the introduced method is efficient and successful enough at diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images. By employing the related image processing techniques and deep learning for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, the proposed method and the research results are valuable contributions to the associated literature.},

  abstract     = {Cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) is inspired from the special and exotic lifestyle of a bird family called the cuckoo and her amazing and unique behavior in egg laying and breeding. Just like any other population-based swarm intelligence metaheuristic algorithms, the basic COA starts with a set of randomly generated solutions called “habitats.” Actually, the habitats can be the current locations of either the mature cuckoos or their eggs. In an iterative manner, cuckoos lay their eggs around their habitats inside the other birds’ nests by mimicking their eggs’ color, pattern, and size, and this is a kind of parasitic brooding behavior. Some hosts may discriminate the strange eggs and throw them out while the others not. The survival competition between cuckoos and their hosts, and migration of cuckoos in swarm are two main underlying motivations to introduce the COA. In this paper, an adaptive cuckoo optimization algorithm named A-COA is proposed in which three novelties in egg-laying and migration phases are applied. These modifications have made the basic algorithm more efficient with faster convergence to solve continuous and discrete optimization problems. A comprehensive comparison study of A-COA versus not only the basic COA but also some other conventional metaheuristics like GA, PSO, ABC, and TLBO has been made on a variety of unimodal and multimodal numerical benchmark functions with different characteristics, and the results show an overall 25.85\% of improvement in terms of performance with a faster convergence speed compared to the basic COA, where the statistical Wilcoxon rank-sum test certifies our conclusions. In addition, a discretized version of A-COA and its application to the multiprocessor task scheduling problem as a complex combinatorial optimization problem are investigated where the proposed A-COA is very competitive with not only the strongest conventional heuristics, for example, MCP, ETF, and DLS, but also the basic COA and the newly proposed ACO-based approach.},

  abstract     = {Alcoholism changes the structure of brain. Several somatic marker hypothesis network-related regions are known to be damaged in chronic alcoholism. Neuroimaging approach can help us better understanding the impairment discovered in alcohol-dependent subjects. In this research, we recruited subjects from participating hospitals. In total, 188 abstinent long-term chronic alcoholic participants (95 men and 93 women) and 191 non-alcoholic control participants (95 men and 96 women) were enrolled in our experiment via computerized diagnostic interview schedule version IV and medical history interview employed to determine whether the applicants can be enrolled or excluded. The Siemens Verio Tim 3.0 T MR scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) was employed to scan the subjects. Then, we proposed a 10-layer convolutional neural network for the diagnosis based on imaging, including three advanced techniques: parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU); batch normalization; and dropout. The structure of network is fine-tuned. The results show that our method secured a sensitivity of 97.73 ± 1.04\%, a specificity of 97.69 ± 0.87\%, and an accuracy of 97.71 ± 0.68\%. We observed the PReLU gives better performance than ordinary ReLU, clipped ReLU, and leaky ReLU. The batch normalization and dropout gained enhanced performance as batch normalization overcame the internal covariate shift and dropout got over the overfitting. The results of our proposed 10-layer CNN model show its performance better than seven state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) can separate thousands of different compounds, and is used for many important applications such as petrochemical processing and environmental monitoring, etc. GC × GC generates rich and complex information, which requires automated processing for rapid chemical identification and classification. A challenge is to remove unwanted streaks that may affect the quantification and identification of analytes. It is difficult to detect streaks because of complex backgrounds, low-contrast data, and variable shapes, scales, and orientations of streaks in GC × GC data. This paper proposes a new approach to detect streaks effectively based on image analysis techniques. By adopting a pseudo-log function and preprocessing methods to compress the original data and enhance the low-contrast data, we employ steerable Gaussian filtering to delineate streak regions based on the specific orientations of streaks. A marker-controlled watershed algorithm is then used to segment the streaks, and highly discriminating characteristics are used to identify candidate regions and reject false streaks. In the end, with a diverse data set generated from gas chromatograph, experiments are carried out and the results demonstrate that our streak detection approach is effective and robust with respect to changes in streak patterns, even in variable chromatographic conditions. The proposed object detection method effective in complex backgrounds and low-contrast conditions is also helpful for object detection in other scenes.},

In this system, loss of confidentiality leads to a passive impact on the security of health record whereas loss of integrity leads can have a serious impact such as loss of a patient’s life. Therefore, it is of prime importance to secure electronic health records. Health records are represented by Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standards and managed by Health Level Seven International Healthcare Standards Organization. Centralized storage of health data is attractive to cyber-attacks and constant viewing of patient records is challenging. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system using the cloud that helps to ensure authentication and that also provides integrity to health records. The keyless signature infrastructure used in the proposed system for ensuring the secrecy of digital signatures also ensures aspects of authentication. Furthermore, data integrity is managed by the proposed blockchain technology. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated by comparing the parameters like average time, size, and cost of data storage and retrieval of the blockchain technology with conventional data storage techniques. The results show that the response time of the proposed system with the blockchain technology is almost 50\% shorter than the conventional techniques. Also they express the cost of storage is about 20\% less for the system with blockchain in comparison with the existing techniques.},

It is a tedious and time-consuming operation exceedingly based on doctors and experience of radiologist. NPC has complex and irregular structures which makes it difficult to diagnose even by an expert physician. However, the diagnosis accuracy results of such methods are still insignificant and need improvement in order to manifest robust solution. The study aim is to develop and propose a new automatic classification of NPC tumor using machine learning techniques and feature-based decision-level fusion scheme from endoscopic images. We have implemented the fusion of the three image texture-based schemes (local binary patterns, the first-order statistics histogram properties, and histogram of gray scale) at the decision level and tested the performance of this scheme using the same experimental setup in the previous section for simple score-level fusion, but for comparison, We used the classifiers methods which are support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors’ algorithm, and artificial neural network (ANN). The results demonstrate that the majority rule for decision-based fusion is outperformed considerably by the single best performing feature scheme (FFGF) for the SVM classifier, but for the ANN and KNN classifier it is significantly outperformed by each of the components features. The classifiers approaches were listed a high accuracy of 94.07\%, the sensitivity of 92.05\%, and specificity of 93.07\%.},

Further, in the second stage, criteria weights are estimated by using newly proposed intuitionistic fuzzy statistical variance method and finally, ranking of cloud vendor (CV) is done using newly proposed three-way VIKOR method under intuitionistic fuzzy environment which introduces neutral category along with cost and benefit for better understanding the nature of criteria. An illustrative example of CV selection is demonstrated to show the practicality and usefulness of the proposed framework.

  abstract     = {Neuroevolution is the name given to a field of computer science that applies evolutionary computation for evolving some aspects of neural networks. After the AI Winter came to an end, neural networks reemerged to solve a great variety of problems. However, their usage requires designing their topology, a decision with a potentially high impact on performance. Whereas many works have tried to suggest rules-of-thumb for designing topologies, the truth is that there are not analytic procedures for determining the optimal one for a given problem, and trial-and-error is often used instead. Neuroevolution arose almost 3 decades ago, with some works focusing on the evolutionary design of the topology and most works describing techniques for learning connection weights. Since then, evolutionary computation has been proved to be a convenient approach for determining the topology and weights of neural networks, and neuroevolution has been applied to a great variety of fields. However, for more than 2 decades neuroevolution has mainly focused on simple artificial neural networks models, far from today’s deep learning standards. This is insufficient for determining good architectures for modern networks extensively used nowadays, which involve multiple hidden layers, recurrent cells, etc. More importantly, deep and convolutional neural networks have become a de facto standard in representation learning for solving many different problems, and neuroevolution has only focused in this kind of networks in very recent years, with many works being presented in 2017 onward. In this paper, we review the field of neuroevolution during the last 3 decades. We will put the focus on very recent works on the evolution of deep and convolutional neural networks, which is a new but growing field of study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best survey reviewing the literature in this field, and we have described the features of each work as well as their performance on well-known databases when available. This work aims to provide a complete reference of all works related to neuroevolution of convolutional neural networks up to the date. Finally, we will provide some future directions for the advancement of this research area.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural network (ANN) aimed to simulate the behavior of the nervous system as well as the human brain. Neural network models are mathematical computing systems inspired by the biological neural network in which try to constitute animal brains. ANNs recently extended, presented, and applied by many research scholars in the area of geotechnical engineering. After a comprehensive review of the published studies, there is a shortage of classification of study and research regarding systematic literature review about these approaches. A review of the literature reveals that artificial neural networks is well established in modeling retaining walls deflection, excavation, soil behavior, earth retaining structures, site characterization, pile bearing capacity (both skin friction and end-bearing) prediction, settlement of structures, liquefaction assessment, slope stability, landslide susceptibility mapping, and classification of soils. Therefore, the present study aimed to provide a systematic review of methodologies and applications with recent ANN developments in the subject of geotechnical engineering. Regarding this, a major database of the web of science has been selected. Furthermore, meta-analysis and systematic method which called PRISMA has been used. In this regard, the selected papers were classified according to the technique and method used, the year of publication, the authors, journals and conference names, research objectives, results and findings, and lastly solution and modeling. The outcome of the presented review will contribute to the knowledge of civil and/or geotechnical designers/practitioners in managing information in order to solve most types of geotechnical engineering problems. The methods discussed here help the geotechnical practitioner to be familiar with the limitations and strengths of ANN compared with alternative conventional mathematical modeling methods.},

  abstract     = {In cloud computing, de-duplication plays an essential role in detecting the de-duplication of encoded data with minimal computation and cost. De-duplication cleans the cloud datacentre’s unwanted storage and helps to identify the right owner of the content in the cloud. Even if there is only one copy of each data file stored in the cloud, the cloud has huge quantity of cloud users who own such data file. The existing method discussed a convergent encryption technique to solve the de-duplication problem. It also developed a system which does not allow storing any duplicate data in the cloud. However, the method does not assure consistency, reliability and confidentiality in cloud. Similar or different cloud users could store duplicated file in the cloud server, where cloud storage utilises high volume of storage. To find a solution for the above problems, the paper introduces enhanced secure content de-duplication identification and prevention (ESCDIP) algorithm to enhance the file-level and content-level de-duplication detection of encoded data with reliability in cloud environment. Every cloud user’s files contain an independent master key for encryption using ESCDIP technique and outsourcing them into the cloud. It reduces the overheads that are associated with the interactive duplication detection and query processes. The proposed method identifies the unique data chunking to store in the cloud. Based on experimental result, the ESCDIP method reduces 2.3 data uploading time in seconds, 2.31 data downloading time in seconds and 32.66\% communication cost compared to existing approaches.},

This paper aims to provide an overview on its application in the field of fault identification and diagnosis (FID), as well as the guiding elements behind their successful implementations in engineering-related applications. In most of the reviewed studies, the ANN architecture of choice for FID problem-solving is the multilayer perceptron (MLP). This is likely due to its simplicity, flexibility, and established usage. Its use managed to find footing in a variety of fields in engineering very early on, even before the technology was as polished as it is today. Recurrent neural networks, while having overall stronger potential for solving dynamic problems, are only suggested for use after a simpler implementation in MLP was attempted. Across various ANN applications in FID, it is observed that preprocessing of the inputs is extremely important in obtaining the proper features for use in training the network, particularly when signal analysis is involved. Normalization is practically a standard for ANN use, and likely many other decision-based learning methods due to its ease of use and high impact on speed of convergence. A simple demonstration of ANN’s ease of use in solving a unique FID problem was also shown.},

  abstract     = {The generation of photo-realistic images is a major topic in computer graphics. By using the principles of physical light propagation, images that are indistinguishable from real photographs can be generated. However, this computation is a very time-consuming task. When simulating the real behavior of light, images can take hours to be of sufficient quality. This paper proposes a bio-inspired architecture with spiking neurons for fast rendering in global illumination. The objective is to find the number of paths that are required for each image in order to be perceived identical to the visually converged one computed by the path tracing algorithm. The challenge is that the visually converged image is unknown so that we start from a very noisy image to converge toward the less noisy image. This architecture with functional parts of sparse encoding, dynamic learning, and decoding consists of a robust convergence measure on blocks. Different pooling strategies are performed in order to separate noise from signal in a deep learning process. The learning algorithm selects the most pertinent images using clustering dynamic learning. The system dynamic computes a learning parameter for each image based on its level of noise. The experiments are conducted on a global illumination set which contains a large number of images with different resolutions and noise levels computed using diffuse and specular rendering. With respect to the scenes with $$512\times 512$$ resolution, 3232 different images are used for learning and 9696 images are used for testing. For the scenes with $$800\times 800$$ resolution, the training and the testing data contain, respectively, 3760 and 6320 images. The result is a system composed from only two spike pattern association neurons that accurately predict the quality of images with respect to human psycho-visual scores. The pooling spike neural network has been compared with the support vector and fast relevance vector machines. The obtained results show that the proposed method gives promising efficiency in terms of accuracy (which is calculated as the mean square error on each block of the scenes and the variation of the actual thresholds of the perception models and the desired human psycho-visual scores) and less number of parameters.},

The system is based on modeling the detection problem as a binary classification problem from atmospheric reanalysis data inputs. Specifically, a hybrid neuro-evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which combines artificial neural networks such as extreme learning machine (ELM), with evolutionary algorithms to optimize the trained models and carry out a feature selection on the input variables. The phenomenon under study occurs with a low probability, and for this reason the classification problem is quite unbalanced. Therefore, is necessary to resort to techniques focused on providing a balance in the classes, such as the synthetic minority over-sampling technique approach, the model applied in this work. The final model obtained is evaluated by a test set using both ELM and support vector machine algorithms, and its accuracy performance is analyzed. The proposed approach has been tested in a real problem of WPREs detection in three wind farms located in different areas of Spain, in order to see the spatial generalization of the method.},

Estimation of the state of charge and the state of health is therefore essential. The traditional way uses the voltage level of a battery to determine those values. Modern metal air batteries provide a flat voltage characteristic which necessitates new approaches. One promising technique is the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which measures the AC resistance for a set of different frequencies. Previous approaches match the measured impedances with a nonlinear equivalent circuit, which needs a lot of time to solve a nonlinear least-squares problem. This paper combines the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with neural networks to speed up the state estimation using the example of zinc air batteries. Moreover, these networks are trained with different subsets of the spectra as input data in order to determine the required number of frequencies.},

  abstract     = {This work presents the uncertainty analysis of an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method, called multiharmonic ANN fitting method (MANNFM), which is able to obtain, at a metrological level, the spectrum of asynchronously sampled periodical signals. For sinusoidal and harmonic content signals, jitter and quantization noise contributions to uncertainty are considered in order to obtain amplitude and phase uncertainties using Monte Carlo method. The analysis performed identifies also both contributions to uncertainty for different parameters laboratory configurations. The analysis is performed simultaneously with our method and two others: discrete Fourier transform (DFT), for synchronously sampled signals, and multiharmonic sine-fitting method (MSFM), for asynchronously sampled signals, in order to compare them in terms of uncertainty. Regarding asynchronous methods, results show that MANNFM provides the same uncertainties than MSFM, with the advantage of a simpler implementation. Regarding asynchronous and synchronous methods comparison, results for sinusoidal signals show that MANNFM has the same uncertainty as DFT for amplitude and higher uncertainty for phase values; for signals with harmonic content, amplitude conclusions maintain but, regarding phase, both MANNFM and DFT uncertainties become closer as the frequency increases, which implies, in fact, that when synchronous sampling is not possible, spectrum analysis can be performed with asynchronous methods without incurring in uncertainty increases.},

  abstract     = {Posture transitions are one of the most mechanically demanding tasks and are useful to evaluate the motor status of patients with motor impairments, frail individuals or the elderly, among others. So far, wearable inertial systems have been one of the most employed tools in the study of these movements due to their suitable size and weight, being non-invasive systems. These devices are mainly composed of accelerometers and, to a lesser extent, gyroscopes, magnetometers or barometers. Although accelerometers provide the most reliable measurement, detecting activities where a change of altitude is observed, such as some posture transitions, may require additional sensors to reliably detect these activities. In this work, we present an algorithm that combines the information of a barometer and an accelerometer to detect posture transitions and falls. In contrast to other works, we test different activities (where altitude is involved) in order to achieve a reliable classifier against false positives. Furthermore, by means of feature selection methods, we obtain optimal subsets of features for the accelerometer and barometer sensors to contextualise these activities. The selected features are tested through several machine learning classifiers, which are assessed with an evaluation data set. Results show that the inclusion of barometer features in addition to those obtained for an accelerometer clearly enhances the detection accuracy up to a 11\%, in terms of geometric mean between sensitivity and specificity, compared to algorithms where only the accelerometer is used. Finally, we have also analysed the computer burden; in this sense, the usage of barometers, in addition to increase the accuracy, also reduces the computational resources required to classify a new pattern, as shown by a reduction in the number of support vectors.},

  abstract     = {Methionine is a proteinogenic amino acid that can be post-translationally modified. It is now well established that reactive oxygen species can oxidise methionine residues within living cells. For a long time, it has been thought that such a modification represents merely an inevitable damage derived from aerobic metabolism. However, several authors have begun to contemplate a possible role for this methionine modification in cell signalling. During the last years, a number of proteomic studies have been carried out with the purpose of detecting proteins containing oxidised methionines. Although these proteomic works allow to pinpoint those methionines being oxidised, they are also arduous, expensive and time-consuming. For these reasons, computational approaches aimed at predicting methionine oxidation sites in proteins become an appealing alternative. In the current work, we address methionine oxidation prediction by combining computational intelligence methods with feature engineering and feature selection techniques to improve the efficacy of several machine learning models, while reducing the number of input characteristics needed to get high accuracy rates. We compare random forests, support vector machines, neural networks and flexible discriminant analysis models. Random forests give the best AUC ($$0.8124 \pm 0.0334$$) and accuracy rates ($$0.7590 \pm 0.0551$$) by using only a reduced set of 16 characteristics. These results surpass the outcomes of previous works. In addition, we present an end-user script that has been developed to take a protein ID as an input and return a list with the oxidation state of all the methionine residues found in the analysed protein. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of this tool, we have selected the human $$\alpha 1$$-antitrypsin protein as a case study. This protein was selected because it was not present among the set of proteins used to build up the predictive models but the protein has been well characterised experimentally in terms of methionine oxidation. The prediction returned by our script fully matches the empirical evidence. Out of the nine methionine residues found in this protein, our model predicts the oxidation of only two of them, M351 and M358, which have been reported, on the base of mass spectrometry analyses, to be particularly susceptible to oxidation.},

  abstract     = {The paper introduces a novel modality to efficiently tune the convolutional layers of a deep neural network (CNN) and an approach to also rank the importance of the involved hyperparameters. Evolutionary algorithms (EA) offer a flexible solution to this twofold issue, while the expensive simulations of the deep learner with the generated configurations are resolved by surrogate modelling. Three models have been used and evaluated as surrogates: random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM) and Kriging. Sample convolutional configurations are generated by Latin hypercube sampling and have attached computed accuracy outcomes from real CNN runs. For the hyperparameter estimation task, the fitness of an individual from the EA associated with a surrogate model is subsequently derived from the CNN accuracy estimation on those variable values. With respect to the ranking and variable selection task, RF includes implicit variable selection, the SVM can be straightforwardly supported by a second EA, and Kriging offers a ranking based on the corresponding θ values. The estimated accuracy of the found hyperparameter values is compared with the true validation accuracy, and they are next used for the prediction on the test cases. The ranking of the variables for each of the three surrogate models is compared, and their influence is also revealed by response surface methodology. The experimental testing of the proposed EA–surrogate approaches is conducted on a real-world scenario of histopathological image interpretation in colorectal cancer diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the application of three artificial intelligence methods, including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), M5 model tree (M5Tree), and least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) for the prediction of the mechanical behavior of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). A large and reliable experimental test database containing the results of 650 compressive strength, 421 elastic modulus, 152 flexural strength, and 346 splitting tensile strength tests of RACs with no pozzolanic admixtures assembled from the published literature was used to train, test, and validate the three data-driven-based models. The results of the model assessment show that the LSSVR model provides improved accuracy over the existing models in the prediction of the compressive strength of RACs. The results also indicate that, although all three models provide higher accuracy than the existing models in the prediction of the splitting tensile strength of RACs, only the performance of the LSSVR model exceeds those of the best-performing existing models for the flexural strength of RACs. The results of this study indicate that MARS, M5Tree, and LSSVR models can provide close predictions of the mechanical properties of RACs by accurately capturing the influences of the key parameters. This points to the possibility of the application of these three models in the pre-design and modeling of structures manufactured with RACs.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning and computer vision have driven many of the greatest advances in the modeling of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs). Nowadays, most of the research has been focused on improving recognition accuracy with better DCNN models and learning approaches. The recurrent convolutional approach is not applied very much, other than in a few DCNN architectures. On the other hand, Inception-v4 and Residual networks have promptly become popular among computer the vision community. In this paper, we introduce a new DCNN model called the Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (IRRCNN), which utilizes the power of the Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), the Inception network, and the Residual network. This approach improves the recognition accuracy of the Inception-residual network with same number of network parameters. In addition, this proposed architecture generalizes the Inception network, the RCNN, and the Residual network with significantly improved training accuracy. We have empirically evaluated the performance of the IRRCNN model on different benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet-200, and CU3D-100. The experimental results show higher recognition accuracy against most of the popular DCNN models including the RCNN. We have also investigated the performance of the IRRCNN approach against the Equivalent Inception Network (EIN) and the Equivalent Inception Residual Network (EIRN) counterpart on the CIFAR-100 dataset. We report around 4.53, 4.49 and 3.56\% improvement in classification accuracy compared with the RCNN, EIN, and EIRN on the CIFAR-100 dataset respectively. Furthermore, the experiment has been conducted on the TinyImageNet-200 and CU3D-100 datasets where the IRRCNN provides better testing accuracy compared to the Inception Recurrent CNN, the EIN, the EIRN, Inception-v3, and Wide Residual Networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a linear and nonlinear stochastic distribution for the interactions in multi-agent systems (MAS). The interactions are considered for the agents to reach a consensus using hetero-homogeneous transition stochastic matrices. The states of the agents are presented as variables sharing information in the MAS dynamically. The paper studies the interaction among agents for the attainment of consensus by limit behavior from their initial states’ trajectories. The paper provides a linear distribution of DeGroot model compared with a nonlinear distribution of change stochastic quadratic operators (CSQOs), doubly stochastic quadratic operators (DSQOs) and extreme doubly stochastic quadratic operators (EDSQOs) for a consensus problem in MAS. The comparison study is considered for stochastic matrix (SM) and doubly stochastic matrix (DSM) cases of the hetero-homogeneous transition stochastic matrices. In the case of SM, the work’s results show that the DeGroot linear model converges to the same unknown limit while CSQOs, DSQOs and EDSQOs converge to the center. However, the results show that the linear of DeGroot and nonlinear distributions of CSQOs, DSQOs and EDSQOs converge to the center with DSM. Additionally, the case of DSM is observed to converge faster compared to that of SM in the case of nonlinear distribution of CSQOs, DSQOs and EDSQOs. In general, the novelty of this study is in showing that the nonlinear stochastic distribution reaches a consensus faster than all cases. In fact, the EDSQO is a very simple system compared to other nonlinear distributions.},

Module 1: Urban rail transit can respond to disturbances in time and make corresponding adjustments and adaptations. Module 2: Urban rail traffic can be restored to a completely normal state for certain disturbances. Module 3: Urban rail transit can be completed within a limited self-recovery and adjustment time, and the fragile state after disturbance can be restored to normal state in time.

  abstract     = {A new model parameter selection method for support vector machine based on adaptive fusion of multiple kernel functions is proposed in this paper. Characteristics of local kernels, global kernels, mixtures of kernels and multiple kernels were analyzed. Fusion coefficients of the multiple kernel function, kernel function parameters and regression parameters are combined to form the parameters of the state vector. Thus, the model selection problem is transformed into a nonlinear system state estimation problem. Then, we use a fifth-degree cubature Kalman filter to estimate the parameters. In this way, we realize adaptive selection of the multiple kernel function weighted coefficient, the kernel parameters and the regression parameters. A simulation experiment was performed to interpret the PE process for fault diagnosis.},

Compared with the existing SRV-MVDR, only half spectrum search is needed to solve the DOA fuzzy problem. No subsequent discrimination is needed. The data collected by vector sensors array are processed jointly by using the idea of dimensionality reduction so that it satisfies the processing condition of SRV-MVDR method.

  abstract     = {The forecasting methods of water bloom in existence are hard to reflect nonlinear dynamic change in algal bloom formation mechanism, leading to poor forecasting accuracy of bloom. To solve this problem, this paper deeply analyzes the generation process of algal bloom, introduces the recursive time series algorithm into the deep belief network model and improves the model structure and training algorithm, and proposes a forecasting method based on the recursive timed deep belief network model. The model introduces the current moments and historical time values of the characterization factors and influencing factors at the input layer, and increases the connection between the input layer and the hidden layer of the deep belief network. A recursive algorithm is used to establish the relationship between the current time value of the characterization factor and the historical time value of the characterization factor, and the connection between the current time value of the hidden layer and the influencing factor is increased. By re-extracting the characteristics of the hidden layer at each moment, and then fine tuning the network parameters by the BP neural network, a recursive timing deep belief network model is finally constructed. The results show that compared with the existing forecasting methods, this method can extract the characteristics of time series data more accurately and completely to deal with the dynamic nonlinear process and can further improve the forecast accuracy of algal blooms.},

The CR network has a good amount of energy capacity using battery resource and accesses the data communication via the time-slotted channel. The data communication with moderate energy-level utilization during transmission is a great challenge in CR network security monitoring, since intruders may often attack the network in reducing the energy level of the PU or SU. The framework used to secure the communication is using the discrete-time partially observed Markov decision process. This system proposes a modern data communication-secured scheme using private key encryption with the sensing results, and eclat algorithm has been proposed for energy detection and Byzantine attack prediction.

An energy consumption and stochastic linear programming game in the distributed structure is proposed for the energy payments, so that scheduling for appliances and storage devices can be used here as well. Furthermore, it is easy to implement a proposed two-phase DSLPM (distributed stochastic linear programming management) algorithm to bring about optimality with both energy provider and users to approach payoff sharing under uncertainty.

This article constructs a theoretical model of the indirect impact mechanism of the learning between alliance organizations on alliance performance with relationship capital as the mediator. Based on the questionnaire data of 210 alliance enterprises in China, this article empirically researches into the relationship among inter-organizational learning, relationship capital (trust and relationship commitment) and alliance performance. The findings suggest that in the specific management situations in China, the learning between alliance organizations can affect alliance performance not only in a direct manner, but also in an indirect manner through the intermediary of relationship capital. By summing up the empirical results, the article puts forward some suggestions on management practices to further enrich the understanding of the value of learning between alliance organizations.},

This study starts with an analysis of the original stepwise clustering algorithm and its application to a clustering process of 8784 backward trajectories during 48 h in Changchun City as a benchmark test case. Then, two improvements are made in the algorithm: First, in the process of finding the optimal classification, the algorithm complexity is improved from original O(n3) to O(log(n)*n2) through algorithm improvement. The algorithm performance is enhanced by log(n) times. Second, in the process of re-establishing the classification, the algorithm complexity is improved from the original O(m*n2) to O(m*log(n)*n), that is another algorithm performance improvement by a factor of log(n). Therefore, the accumulative execution efficiency improvement through the algorithm optimization is 2*log(n) times, which has been further verified in the practical application in Changchun City.},

However, the latent semantic analysis can map the high-dimensional and sparse words to k-dimensional semantic space and improve the similarity of the news of the same topic by the semantic correlation between words. In this paper, Web news topic discovery is studied. First, the set of Web news text is vectored and the weight of each feature in the texts is calculated by improved TFIDF. After the original text vector set is analysed by latent semantic analysis, the semantic relation is fully exploited between the texts and the words, and the news topics are extracted by clustering approach. For the extraction of sub-topics, the co-occurrence of words is used to display the sub-topics. In essence, the sub-topic vector is established through these co-occurrence words. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the current hot topics of Web news and related sub-topics.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of big data and cloud computing, vehicular is connected to the Internet in the complex and uncertain driving environment. The rapid growth of the types of services used by vehicles has made the problem of inefficient of traditional driving environment architecture more and more obvious. The vehicle has to register and remember a large number of usernames and passwords to each server. Authentication schemes for multi-server architectures have been proposed and applied to a wide range of areas, but there has been little research on the Internet of vehicles. The long-term evolution for vehicle (LTE-V) is a wireless network architecture and can be used for cooperative communication in vehicular network. Communications and authentication for LTE-V have the high request in complex and uncertain driving environment. To meet the needs of complex and uncertain driving environments, this paper proposes a novel mutual authentication and the key agreement scheme (LEANDER) under multi-server architecture. In this scheme, elliptic curve is used to reduce the computational complexity, and a more concise authentication method is constructed. Random anonymity supports multi-server for two-way authentication and key agreement, so as to effectively protect the privacy of the vehicle. Moreover, it can be use BAN logic to prove and analyze the effectiveness of this scheme. The performance analysis results show that the proposed mutual authentication scheme is effective and more secure than other state-of-the-art methods.},

The processed parameter data can be modeled to analyze the flight safety problems. This paper proposes an attribute reduction method with the flight parameter data of the landing phase, which is period the security incidents occurred most frequently. The study applies the neighbourhood rough set to attribute reduction. The proposed attribute reduction method was evaluated and compared with the attribute reduction of factor analysis. The result suggests that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The neural machine translation model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) has become the mainstream in machine translation with its unique coding–decoding structure and semantic mining features. However, there are few studies on the Mongolian and Chinese neural machine translation combined with LSTM. This paper mainly studies the preprocessing of Mongolian and Chinese bilingual corpus and the construction of the LSTM model of Mongolian morpheme coding. In the corpus preprocessing stage, this paper presents a hybrid algorithm for the construction of word segmentation modules. The sequence that has not been annotated is treated semantically and labeled by a combination of gated recurrent unit and conditional random field. In order to learn more grammar and semantic knowledge from Mongolian corpus, in the model construction stage, this paper presents the LSTM neural network model based on morpheme coding to construct the encoder. This paper also constructs the LSTM neural network decoder to predict the Chinese decode. Experimental comparisons of sentences of different lengths according to the construction model show that the model has improved translation performance in dealing with long-term dependence problems.},

  abstract     = {China, who owns the largest automobile consuming market, is becoming the largest automobile manufacturing country. However, a gap still lies between China and other traditional automobile manufacturing countries in terms of design capability and production efficiency. Standardization can effectively promote technological innovation and industrial upgradation, which enhances the overall performance of the automobile industry. This paper aims at identifying the structural problem in the automobile standard citation network in China, since the citation relationship reflects the transmission and development of knowledge or technologies. To this end, a dynamic standard citation network model is developed for ease of extraction of standard data at any time points. A set of complex network metrics at both node and network level are chosen with rational explanations in the context of automobile industry. With the data collected from publicized Web sites, the topological evolution of this network is analyzed as well. We significantly show that the standard citation networks at different time periods are generally loosely connected and contain too many isolated nodes. Meanwhile, the critical nodes in the standard citation network also change dynamically. We suggest that these isolated standards should be integrated into the citation network through revision activities.},

  abstract     = {The latest development trend of direct-drive electro-hydraulic servo technology is discussed. The working principle, system model and system control theory of an electro-hydraulic servo system are studied. The dynamic behavior of the direct-drive electro-hydraulic servo system is highly nonlinear, structure uncertainty. Considering that the standard PID controller cannot fulfill all the demands, it is necessary to use advanced means for compensation. A PID controller optimized by genetic algorithm for an electro-hydraulic servo system direct driven by a permanent magnet synchronous motor is proposed. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of the PID controller. The simulation and experiment research of one direct-drive electro-hydraulic servo system are carried out to verify the response properties of the proposed controller. The step signal tracking responses of the servo system with different parameters of PID controller are, respectively, reported. In addition, a feedforward PID controller using genetic algorithm optimization is also designed for the direct-drive servo system. The simulation and experiment results show that the feedforward PID controller using genetic algorithm optimization has good dynamic response characteristics in the electro-hydraulic servo system based on a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous motor.},

  abstract     = {Since the beginning of the new millennium, the productivity differences among different enterprises within the industry, namely the heterogeneity of enterprises, have been incorporated into the general equilibrium trade model. At the same time, it brings new focus to trade theory: By analyzing the characteristics of individual enterprises, it analyzes the choice of organizational structure of individual enterprises. Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) and international trade are the two most important international economic activities nowadays. The development of OFDI will have certain impact on export trade. The relationship between OFDI and export trade is different due to the specific national conditions of different countries. Against this background, we study the impact of China’s expanding OFDI on export trade. We should make better use of OFDI to promote the development of China’s export trade and improve the export-oriented economic mode that relies solely on exports to expand the international market. It not only has theoretical value, but also has practical guiding significance for the formulation of China’s “going out” economic and trade policy. This study introduces heterogeneity into the international expansion behavior model of Chinese enterprises in the context of global value chain specialization. Taking the position of Chinese enterprises in the value chain as the location dimension, we have integrated and expanded a new concept of enterprise advantage based on the value chain status from the research category of international trade theory. In this paper, we introduce the behavior of competitors into the dimension of enterprise decision space and construct an endogenous dynamic equilibrium model of Chinese enterprises’ export trade and OFDI. The purpose is to provide theoretical explanations and practical guidance for Chinese enterprises’ export trade and endogenous optimization decision making in the process of deepening the division of labor in the global value chain.},
