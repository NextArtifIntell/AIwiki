  abstract     = {Visual odometry (VO) is one of the promising techniques that estimates pose using the camera and does not necessarily require other sensor aiding. With increasing automation and the use of miniaturized systems such as mobile devices, wearable gadgets, &amp; gaming consoles, demand for efficient algorithms have risen. In this paper, an attempt is made to remove the redundant features from the VO pipeline that do not have a significant effect on the estimation process. A probabilistic approach based on fast mutual information (MI) computation is suggested here as the basis for removing features. The MI value acts as a beacon for selecting distinct features while eliminating the redundant ones, thus improving the overall system speed and reducing storage requirements. The proposed MI-based feature selection framework for VO has been experimented on the KITTI vision benchmark suite and EuRoC MAV datasets available publicly. The estimated trajectory results have shown that the proposed technique is better in terms of computational efficiency and has similar accuracy as compared to the normal VO pipeline. Further investigations have also been carried out over the VSLAM framework to test its applicability in a real-time system.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional configuration space is usually searched using sampling-based motion planning methods. The well-known issue of sampling-based planners is the narrow passage problem caused by small regions of the configuration space that are difficult to cover by random samples. Practically, the presence of narrow passages decreases the probability of finding a solution, and to cope with it, the number of random samples has to be significantly increased, which also increases the planning time. By dilating the free space, e.g., by scaling-down or thinning the robot (or obstacles), narrow passages become wider, which allows us to compute an approximate solution. Then, the configuration space can be sampled densely around the approximate solution to find the solution of the original problem. However, this process may fail if the final solution is too far from the approximate one. In this paper, we propose a method to find multiple approximate solutions in the configuration space to increase the chance of finding the final solution. The approximate solutions are computed by repeated search of the configuration space while avoiding, if possible, the already discovered solutions. This enables us to search for distinct solutions leading through different parts of the configuration space. The number of approximate solutions is automatically determined based on their similarity. All approximate solutions are then used to guide the sampling of the configuration space. The performance of the proposed approach is verified in scenarios with multiple narrow passages and the benefits of the method are demonstrated by comparing the results with the state-of-the-art planners.},

  abstract     = {Quadrotor control is an exciting research area due to its inherent non-linearity, the variety of tasks to be performed, and the wide scope of control strategies. Despite several works have been published, some aspects must be considered before implementation: How a quadrotor will operate in challenging trajectories, how to define trajectory limits, or how changing the device size will affect its performance. A complete user-friendly development platform is presented, where any device may be tested just by setting a few parameters. Typing a set of waypoints and their corresponding times, the tool calculates the optimal trajectory with minimum snap. For the defined waypoints, the control gains are tuned for a chosen control strategy using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Three control strategies are available, but the tool was developed in modular form and opened to others. After tuned the gains the control performance may be visually evaluated through a graphical user interface (GUI). The quadrotor model considers the effect of air drag and propellers’ speed dynamics. Measurement noise and limits for propeller speeds were also considered. Results demonstrate how this tool helps to initiate undergraduate and beginner graduate students in this research area, testing new control strategies, defining limits in challenging trajectories, and determining quadrotor characteristics for specific applications. The tool is available in GitHub (Martins and Rendón 2019).},

  abstract     = {To obtain accurate grid maps of large environments equipped with camera networks in real time, a two-level mapping method is presented in this paper. The local map level is composed of a set of local maps. Once a mobile robot enters a new camera visual field, a new local map corresponding to the camera is built by a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) method using the data from the robot’s laser sensor and odometry. During the local mapping process, a camera-calibration problem is also solved by using a marker attached to the robot which moves as a curve fashion in the camera visual field. The global level is an adjacency graph whose arcs are labeled with the relative transformations between local maps. Among these relative transformations, of particular important are the revisiting constraints. When the robot returns a previous local map, it can be detected and relocated by a calibrated camera corresponding to the local map. Then a revisiting constraint can be attained and added into global constraints. To have an accurate and consistent global map, a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm based on a simple state space is employed to optimize the existed graph after adding and updating each global constraint. Experimental results carried out with a real mobile robot in a large-scale indoor environment illustrate the advantages of our methods over two current state-of-the-art approaches.},

Viewed from this perspective, this survey provides a comprehensive literature review on combined MBC-ANN techniques that are suitable for UAV flight control, i.e., low-level control. The objective is to pave the way and establish a foundation for efficient controller designs with performance guarantees. A reference template is used throughout the survey as a common basis for comparative studies to fairly determine capabilities and limitations of existing research.

Although these tasks are usually considered separately in the literature, we propose a common framework where both problems are formulated as the maximization of online acquired information via the definition of single-robot optimization functions, which differs only slightly in the two cases to take into account the static and dynamic nature of coverage and exploration respectively. A common derivative-free approach based on a stochastic approximation of these functions and their successive optimization is proposed, resulting in a fast and decentralized solution. The locality of this methodology limits however this solution to have local optimality guarantees and specific additional layers are proposed for the two problems to improve the final performance. Specifically, a Voronoi-based initialization step is added for the coverage problem and a combination with a frontier-based approach is proposed for the exploration case. The resulting algorithms are finally tested in simulations and compared with possible alternatives.},

To improve the speed tracking performance, a FOPIDSM surface is designed. Moreover, the proposed FO control approach ensures fast convergence, high precision, good robustness against stochastic perturbations and uncertainties. Finally, the performance of the FOSTPIDSMC is investigated under different scenarios. The simulation results clearly show the high control performance, efficiency and high disturbance rejection capacity of the controller strategy proposed in this work in comparison with the nonlinear internal model control (NLIMC) and FO backstepping sliding mode control (FOBSMC) strategies.},

It is assumed that each agent is initially distributed in a cluttered environment. An agent cannot utilize global positioning systems (GPS) to localize itself. Each agent can only sense neighboring agents and moves based on proximity interaction. This article presents distributed rendezvous algorithms so that heterogeneous agents rendezvous at a designated agent while maintaining (directed) network connectivity. The speed of each agent is set proportional to the remaining power level of the agent. This article then presents a method of estimating the power of each agent by measuring the movement of the agent. Then, we present a method of sharing power if an agent is lack of power. Under the proposed approach, we achieve distributed rendezvous as well as power recharging. It is proved that multiple heterogeneous agents rendezvous at the designated agent while maintaining (directed) network connectivity.

Consequently, for a control purpose, output feedback is used and by considering the coupling effects as disturbance, an observer is designed using the back-stepping method to estimate angular rates. These estimations are used in the controller design and with the Lyapunov function and trajectory initialization, globally uniformly bounded is achieved for the observer-based controlled system.

The dynamic model of a quadrotor coupled to the suspended load is derived using the Euler-Lagrange formulation. The optimal trajectory for carrying the maximum payload and minimum oscillation of swinging load will be obtained. The optimal cable length to increase the maximum payload capacity and reduce the maximum oscillation angle of swinging load is obtained. Also, the effect of load mass on the maximum oscillation angle of swinging load is studied. In this paper, the optimization procedure is based on the solution of the optimal control problem from the class of open loop with an indirect method. The application Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle lead to deriving the optimality conditions and subsequently a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) which is solved by a numerical method. An appropriate algorithm is presented for calculating the maximum payload to move between two specified points. The main superiority of this method is that it can solve a wide range of optimal maneuvers for arbitrary initial and final configurations relevant to every considered cost function. Generating various optimal paths with different maximum payloads and oscillation angles by modifying the values of the penalty matrices. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed method and the presented algorithm, a simulation study is performed for a quadrotor with a suspended load in maneuver between two specified points and various object function.},

The battery runtime that remains of a drone in real-time may be insufficient to complete its flight mission. This may be due to external factors, such as unexpected severe weather or obstacles that move into the drone’s flight path. Under unexpected situations, such as these, the drone cannot safely return to its depot, as planned. To ensure that the drone makes a safe return and that the flight mission is a success, there must be a real-time rerouting process for a drone’s flight path in response to unforeseeable circumstances. Hence, this paper proposes a real-time rerouting process consisting of two optimization models that generate an optimal alternative flight path for a drone that has insufficient remaining battery runtime. The first model is used to find an optimal flight path to visit all remaining target waypoints. If the first model fails to obtain a feasible solution, the second model is implemented to find an optimal flight path to minimize the number of unvisited waypoints. To confine the total flight (travel) time to the insufficient battery runtime, both models include the constraint associated with uncertain flight (travel) times between waypoints. To capture this uncertainty, this paper proposes a chance constrained programming (CCP) approach under the assumption of a known mean, variance, and flight time intervals. Numerical examples show how the proposed rerouting process works, and the CCP method results in more conservative solutions as compared to the deterministic approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new parcel delivery system consisting of a public train and drones. The train, an already existing mobile platform in our neighbourhood, follows its normal predefined route and timetable to transport passengers. In the meanwhile, some parcels to be delivered to some customers and a delivery drone are stored on its roof. The drone can launch from the train, deliver the parcel to a customer, and return to the train. It can also travel with the train and replace its battery on the roof via an automatic battery swap system. As the parcel delivery system cannot manage the movement of the train, the route and the timetable of the train need to be accounted carefully to schedule the deliveries. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total delivery time of a given set of parcels, and we propose two algorithms. Though the exact algorithm gives the optimal schedule, its computational complexity is exponential to the number of parcels. To make the proposed system possible to be implemented in practice, a suboptimal algorithm is developed, which is more efficient than the exact algorithm and can achieve close performance with the exact algorithm. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective strategy to deal with the uncertainty associated with the train’s timetable. Moreover, the proposed algorithm for the single drone case is modified to deal with the multiple drone case. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified via computer simulations and comparison with existing methods. The results show that the presented approach is more cost-efficient than the Truck only scheme and the Truck plus Drone scheme. Moreover, the parcel delivery time can be reduced and the delivery area can be enlarged compared to the scheme using drones only.},

  abstract     = {The intelligent drone is the key device of the future Internet of Drone, and its safe and robust flight in complicated environments still faces challenges. In this paper, we present a sampling-based kinodynamic planning algorithm for quadrotors, which plans a dynamically feasible trajectory in a complicated environment. We have designed a method to constrain the sampling state by using the vector field to construct a cone in the sampling stage of RRT*, so that the generated trajectory is connected as smoothly as possible to other states in the reachable set. The motion primitives are then generated by solving an optimal control problem and an explicit solution of the optimal duration for the motion primitives is given to optimally connect any pair of states. In addition, we have tried a new method to determine the neighbor radius for the non-Euclidean metrics of this paper. Finally, the planned trajectory is applied to the simulated quadrotor, which verifies the dynamic feasibility of the trajectory. Simulation results show that compared with the existing kinodynamic RRT* under the same number of iterations, the proposed algorithm explores more states with a shorter execution time and generates a smoother trajectory.},

  abstract     = {The use of autonomous robots in areas that require executing a broad range of different tasks is currently hampered by the high complexity of the software that adapts the robot controller to different situations the robot would face. Current robot software frameworks facilitate implementing controllers for individual tasks with some variability, however, their possibilities for adapting the controllers at runtime are very limited and don’t scale with the requirements of a highly versatile autonomous robot. With the software presented in this paper, the behavior of robots is implemented modularly by composing individual controllers, between which it is possible to switch freely at runtime, since the required transitions are calculated automatically. Thereby the software developer is relieved of the task to manually implement and maintain the transitions between different operational modes of the robot, what largely reduces software complexity for larger amounts of different robot behaviors. The software is realized by a model-based development approach. We will present the metamodels enabling the modeling of the controllers as well as the runtime architecture for the management of the controllers on distributed computation hardware. Furthermore, this paper introduces an algorithm that calculates the transitions between two controllers. A series of technical experiments verifies the choice of the underlying middleware and the performance of online controller reconfiguration. A further experiment demonstrates the applicability of the approach to real robotics applications.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose, discuss, and validate an online Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method for multi-rotor aerial systems with arbitrarily positioned and oriented rotors which simultaneously addresses the local reference trajectory planning and tracking problems. This work brings into question some common modeling and control design choices that are typically adopted to guarantee robustness and reliability but which may severely limit the attainable performance. Unlike most of state of the art works, the proposed method takes advantages of a unified nonlinear model which aims to describe the whole robot dynamics by explicitly including a realistic physical description of the actuator dynamics and limitations. As a matter of fact, our solution does not resort to common simplifications such as: (1) linear model approximation, (2) cascaded control paradigm used to decouple the translational and the rotational dynamics of the rigid body, (3) use of low-level reactive trackers for the stabilization of the internal loop, and (4) unconstrained optimization resolution or use of fictitious constraints. More in detail, we consider as control inputs the derivatives of the propeller forces and propose a novel method to suitably identify the actuator limitations by leveraging experimental data. Differently from previous approaches, the constraints of the optimization problem are defined only by the real physics of the actuators, avoiding conservative – and often not physical – input/state saturations which are present, e.g., in cascaded approaches. The control algorithm is implemented using a state-of-the-art Real Time Iteration (RTI) scheme with partial sensitivity update method. The performances of the control system are finally validated by means of real-time simulations and in real experiments, with a large spectrum of heterogeneous multi-rotor systems: an under-actuated quadrotor, a fully-actuated hexarotor, a multi-rotor with orientable propellers, and a multi-rotor with an unexpected rotor failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a predictive controller framework with all the valuable aforementioned features is presented and extensively validated in real-time experiments and simulations.},

Also, to return to the original path when the UAV goes out of the path or the camera misses the trail due to disturbances such as wind, the control commands from the CNN are stored for a certain duration of time and used for recovering from such disturbances. To avoid obstacles during the trail navigation, the optical flow computed with another CNN is used to determine the safe maneuver. By combining these methods of i) trail following, ii) disturbance recovery, and iii) obstacle avoidance, the UAV deals with various situations encountered when traveling on the trail.

Firstly, the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is introduced to overcome the above problems. Moreover, LK optical flow algorithm is utilized to process the visual information obtained by the binocular camera, and MSCKF algorithm is employed to realize the fusion of visual information and inertial information, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of the visual inertial odometry system positioning. Finally, the proposed method is simulated on the European Robotics Challenge (EuRoc) dataset by Robot Operating System (ROS), and compared with two other advanced visual inertial odometry systems, ROVIO and MSCKF-mono. A large number of simulations verify that the proposed method can achieve accurate pose estimation, which is superior to the two existing advanced visual inertial odometry systems.},

Visual odometry is a real-time system that estimates the motions of camera setups, in which feature matching is a key step for tracking and relocalization. However, it is still difficult to remove outliers fast and reliably when a high proportion of outliers exist. The proposed HCM algorithm solves this problem by clustering accurate matches hierarchically. Dubious matches excluded from any clusters are removed during the iterations, which finally converges when new clusters no longer generate. Local geometric consistency and descriptor of features are both considered to be a metric to link two clusters using a centroid linkage criterion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method works well on solving the problem mentioned above. Compared to state-of-the-art methods on feature matching, HCM performs much better on efficiency with comparable accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents deployment strategies to achieve full visibility of 1.5D and 2.5D polyhedral environments for a team of mobile robots. Agents may only communicate if they are within line-of-sight. In 1.5D polyhedral terrains we achieve this by algorithmically determining a set of locations that the robots can occupy in a distributed fashion. We characterize the time of completion of the resulting algorithm, which is dependent on the number of peaks and the initial condition. In 2.5D polyhedral terrains we achieve full visibility by asynchronously deploying groups of agents who utilize graph coloring and may start from differential initial conditions. We characterize the total number of agents needed for deployment as a function of the environment properties and allow the algorithm to activate additional agents if necessary. We provide lower and upper bounds for the time of completion as a function of the number of vertices in a planar graph representing the environment. We illustrate our results in simulation and an implementation on a multi-agent robotics platform.},

We show that qualitative models, learned from numerical traces, contain enough information to allow motion planning and path following. We demonstrate our methods on the task of flying a quadcopter. A qualitative control model is learned through motor babbling. Training is significantly faster than training times reported in papers using reinforcement learning with similar quadcopter experiments. A qualitative collision-free trajectory is computed by means of qualitative simulation, and executed reactively while dynamically adapting to numerical characteristics of the system.

With generation of multiple trajectory candidates along the Frenet frame, the vehicle is reactive to other road users or obstacles encountered. Additionally, to deal with more complex driving scenarios, its seamless interaction with an upper behavior planning layer was considered by having longitudinal motion planning responsive to the desired goal state. The trajectory evaluation and selection methodologies, along with the low-level tracking control, were also developed under this framework.

We first identify how artificial emotion can be defined in a robotic system. Next, we investigate the possible roles of emotions in robotic behavior models and analyze different implementations of the concept of emotion in these models.

The innovation of this paper is that the proposed calibration methods can be carried out with simple tools, eliminating the need for expensive and complicated multi-axis turntables, and the designed attitude measurement unit based on calibrated low cost IMU’s inertial sensors has smaller size, higher resolution in roll and pitch, and much lower cost compared with the commercial MTi-G-710.

  abstract     = {Path planning of autonomous mobile robots in a real-world environment presents several challenges which are usually not raised in other areas. The real world is inherently complex, uncertain and dynamic. Therefore, accurate models of path planning are difficult to obtain and quickly become outdated. Anytime planners are ideal for this type of problem as they can find an initial solution very quickly and then improve it as time allows. This paper proposes a new anytime incremental search algorithm named improved Anytime Dynamic A*(iADA*). The algorithm is based on the currently popular anytime heuristic search algorithm, which is Anytime Dynamic A*(ADA*). The iADA* algorithm improves the calculation of the path lengths and decreases the calculating frequency of the path throughout the search, making it significantly faster. The algorithm is designed to provide an efficient solution to a complex, dynamic search environment when the locally changes affected. Our study shows that the two-dimensional path-planning iADA* experiments were between 2.0 to 3.7 times faster than ADA*, both in partially known and fully unknown dynamic environments. Additionally, in this paper shows the experiment results of the comparison with other four existing algorithms based on computing time and path lengths. iADA* was an average 2.57 times reduced on the computational time for the environment which locally changes effected. For the path length is little increase, but it is not the worst case. According to the experiments, the more the environmental problems and complexity increases, the more iADA* provides a rapid in-search time and total time to obtain the final solution.},

The algorithm operates by switching between defined main actions: global path planning, path traversing and passage determination strategy. Kinematic and physical maneuvering constraints are majorly neglected in similar methods evaluated in the geometric planner category. However, the collision avoidance routine, defined under the Navibug scheme, raises the maneuverability capability by forcing the instant decisions to be on a curvilinear trajectory. Such an implementation outperforms the feasibility of the conventional geometric-reactive planners. Global map information is not one of the mandatory inputs of the algorithm, but if the map is known, the path tracking strategy operates in coordination with the dynamic path planning mode to improve the total performance of the main scheme.},

We then focus on the specific action of “approaching a group of people” in order to accurately obtain human data that is used to make the performance of tasks involving interactions with multiple people more smooth. The movement depends on the characteristics of the important sensors used for the task and on the placement of people at and around the destination. Considering the multiple tasks and placement of people, the pre-calculation of the destinations and paths is difficult. This paper thus presents a system of navigation that can accurately obtain human data based on sensor characteristics, task content, and real-time sensor data for processes involving human-robot interaction (HRI); this method does not navigate specifically toward a previously determined static point. Our goal was achieved by using a multimodal path planning based on integration of action modeling by considering both voice and image sensing of interacting people as well as obstacle avoidance.

  abstract     = {A novel robust control method for simultaneous position/force control of constrained flexible joint robots is proposed. The facts that the uncertainties make the usual control task unsolvable and that the equations of the controlled system are differential-algebraic make the problem dealt with considerably demanding. In order to overcome the unsolvability problem due to the constraint uncertainties the position control task is redefined in a practical way such that only a suitable subgroup of the link positions are driven to their desired trajectories. To determine the elements of the subgroup a simple algorithm of practical relevance is proposed. Under certain smoothness conditions to the contact surfaces, it is demonstrated that the position control problem can dynamically be isolated from the force control. Thus, it becomes possible to handle the position and force control tasks separately. The most significant advantage of the separation of the position and force control tasks is that it makes possible to adapt the position control methods known from free robots. Each joint is used in either position control or force control. The proposed position controller has a cascaded structure: First, trajectories for joint positions that drive the link positions to their desired values are calculated. Then, the joint torques that drive the joint positions to their calculated values are determined. A further significant benefit of the separation of the position and force control tasks arises in the force control such that the transformed equations are linear and any linear robust control approach can be used for the force control. The whole controller requires the measurement of the link and joint positions, the link and joint velocities and the contact forces, and allows modeling uncertainties in the equations of both the robot dynamics and the contact surfaces. The proposed control method is also confirmed by simulations.},

  abstract     = {Robot localisation is predominantly resolved via parametric or non-parametric probabilistic methods. The particle filter, the most common non-parametric approach, is a Monte Carlo Localisation (MCL) method that is extensively used in robot localisation, as it can represent arbitrary probabilistic distributions, in contrast to Kalman filters, which is the standard parametric representation. In particle filters, a weight is internally assigned to each particle, and this weight serves as an indicator of a particle’s estimation certainty. Their output, the tracked object’s pose estimate, is implicitly assumed to be the weighted average pose of all particles; however, we argue that disregarding low-weight particles from this averaging process may yield an increase in accuracy. Furthermore, we argue that scan-matching, treated as a prosthesis of (or, put differently, fit in tandem with) a particle filter, can also lead to better accuracy. Moreover, we study the effect of feeding back this improved estimate to MCL, and introduce a feedback method that outperforms current state-of-the-art feedback approaches in accuracy and robustness, while alleviating their drawbacks. In the process of formulating these hypotheses we construct a localisation pipeline that admits configurations that are a superset of state-of-the-art configurations of tandem combinations of particle filters with scan-matching.

  abstract     = {With the rapid aging of the U.S. population, the mobility impairment is becoming a more and more challenging issue that affects a large number of individuals. The research presented in this paper aims at helping the mobility-challenged individuals with a novel robotic companion, which is a walker-type mobile robot capable of accompanying the human user and keeping user at the center for protection and possible power assistance. The robotic companion is equipped with a 3D computer vision system, which provides a unique capability of sensing the human-robot relative position/orientation without physical contact or the need for wearable sensors. As such, the robotic companion enables the user to walk freely with minimum disturbance to his/her normal gait, relieving the user from the physical and cognitive loads associated with the use of traditional assistive devices. For the development of the robotic companion, the authors designed and fabricated a low-cost, differentially steered mobile robotic platform, and also developed a unique image processing system to extract the position/orientation information from the 3D camera-captured images. Furthermore, an advanced motion control system was developed for the robotic companion, which provides novel solutions to the unique challenges such as sway reduction and noise reduction in digital differentiation. To quantify the performance, component and system-level experimentation was conducted, and the results demonstrated that robotic companion and its key components function as desired and the system is expected to reduce the user load and improve the user mobility in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Focusing on the problems of big overshoot and long convergence time due to the large initial heading error, a new path tracking control strategy for autonomous harvesting robots based on improved double arc path planning is designed. Firstly, the improved double arc path planning algorithm includes global path planning and local planning. The shortest path distance is taken as the goal, so the optimal tangent arc path from the initial point to the reference straight line can be automatically planned by the global path planning. Due to the problems such as control delay in harvesting robot, the global path cannot be effectively tracked. By analyzing the influence of the non-mutable steering angle and control delay on path tracking, a new local path planning algorithm is proposed. Then, the two preview points obtained in global planning can be optimized dynamically, and the actual reliability of the algorithm can be enhanced. Secondly, the error compensation model is designed to compensate the installation error of the positioning antenna in real time, to satisfy the simplified condition of the two-wheeled vehicle model. Finally, by combining the large angle steering control method and the pure pursuit algorithm, a new hybrid control strategy is designed to solve the steering angle, and the path tracking function of harvesting robots is realized. Experiment results demonstrate that the hybrid control strategy can reduce the oscillation of driving path, enhance the convergence, then, improve working quality and efficiency of robots.},

  abstract     = {The rope-driven snake manipulator is a bionic mechanism with hyper redundant DOFs and can be applied in narrow and confined environments, such as surgery, spacecraft, nuclear plant, etc. The kinematic mapping expressed by the rope length, joint angle and end pose is highly nonlinear and difficult to be calculated. Moreover, the control methods with rope length as input are prone to redundant driving ropes getting stuck due to differences in model and actual mechanism. Therefore, the perfect kinematic mapping of the rope-driven snake manipulator is necessary for designing high-efficiency motion controllers. In this paper, an analytical mapping about the velocities of ropes, joints and end is established and verified. Firstly, a prototype inspired by the biological snake spine is designed. And then the Jacobian matrix representing the velocity mapping is derived and analyzed in detail. The joint and rope velocities are optimized by configuring the null space vector of the Jacobian matrix. Based on the velocity mapping and optimization, a motion control scheme for the snake manipulator is established to realize servo control of the joints and end. Finally, the trajectory tracking simulation and experiment are executed to verify the velocity mapping theory and control scheme. This research can provide solutions for the complex motion control problems of subsequent snake manipulators.},

The strategy integrates existing methods for computer vision, active vision and active manipulation. Our solution is implemented in a generic software framework, which is independent from software and hardware for implementing error detection and allows for application in other assembly types and components. The value of our strategy was experimentally validated on a simple case, where we inserted a battery into a cell phone. The experiment was performed on 1500 assembly attempts and included 500 detected errors. The whole experiment ran for 42 hours, with no need for operator assistance or supervision.

Its mechanical system and control system are both introduced in this paper. An encoder is installed on both the driver side and the joint side to realize double closed-loop control. Considering the transmission characteristics of the reducer and the tendon-sheath, a position transmission model of a single joint is constructed. Furthermore, the correctness of the transmission model is verified based on the prototype joint four. A proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller and fuzzy PID controller with time-delay estimation (TDE) are designed based on double encoders, and some experiments on the position tracking control are carried out for the robotic joints. The experimental results show that each joint can rotate normally and there is no interference between the different tendon-sheaths. When the drive motor moves to follow the position command of the sinusoidal signal, the TDE-based fuzzy PID controller can reduce the maximum tracking error compared with the traditional PID controller. According to the experimental results, it is feasible to apply the tendon-sheath transmission to the manipulator, which provides a reference for the development of other equipment based on the tendon-sheath.},

Parallel Kinematic Manipulators (PKMs) are highly nonlinear systems, so the design of a suitable control scheme represents a significant challenge given that these kinds of systems are continually dealing with parametric and non-parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The main contribution of this work is the design of an adaptive feedforward compensation term using B-Spline Neural Networks (BSNNs). They make an on-line approximation of the DPR dynamics and integrates it into the control loop. The BSNNs’ functions are bounded according to the extreme values of the desired joint space trajectories that are the BSNNs’ inputs, and their weights are on-line adjusted by gradient descend rules. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme with respect to the standard RISE controller, numerical simulations for different case studies under different scenarios were performed.},

  abstract     = {Continuum robots (CRs) hold great potential for many medical and industrial applications where compliant interaction within the potentially confined environment is required. However, the navigation of CRs poses several challenges due to their limited actuation channels and the hyper-flexibility of their structure. Environmental uncertainty and characteristic hysteresis in such procedures add to the complexity of their operation. Therefore, the quality of trajectory tracking for continuum robots plays an essential role in the success of the application procedures. While there are a few different actuation configurations available for CRs, the focus of this paper will be placed on tendon-driven manipulators. In this research, a new fuzzy reinforcement learning (FRL) approach is introduced. The proposed FRL-based control parameters are tuned by the Taguchi method and evolutionary genetic algorithm (GA) to provide faster convergence to the Nash Equilibrium. The approach is verified through a comprehensive set of simulations using a Cosserat rod model. The results show a steady and accurate trajectory tracking capability for a CR.},

The proposed enhancement to popular sampling-based planning algorithms is aimed at circumventing the exponential dependence on dimensionality, by progressively exploring lower dimensional volumes of the configuration space. Extensive experiments comparing the enhanced and traditional version of RRT, RRT-Connect, and Bidirectional T-RRT on both a planar hyper-redundant manipulator and the Baxter humanoid robot show significant acceleration, up to two orders of magnitude, on computing a solution.

  abstract     = {The development of flexible swarm robotics systems capable of adapting to the task and environmental changes is a serious challenge. The main motivations of Swarm robotics are decentralized control, stability, adaptivity, and flexibility. Usually, ad-hoc approaches are employed to design a controller capable of meeting the problem specifications. However, these methods cannot be easily verified, and in some cases, it is not even shown that they meet the specifications. Moreover, the controller source code has to be developed separately, primarily when formal methods are employed; As a result, it cannot be guaranteed that the implementation matches the design. This paper proposes a new method - probabilistic timed supervisory control (ptSCT) - to formally design a controller from systems specifications. The proposed ptSCT has several advantages: 1) the automatic generation of the controller source code utilizable in ARGoS platform, 2) formal designing capability using the implemented software tool, 3) set of powerful design components like probabilistic decisions and time constraints, and 4) the reusability of formally designed modules among different scenarios and multiple robotic platforms. Two case studies are considered to investigate various aspects of the proposed system. Firstly, the synchronization case study is implemented for a comparison between SCT and ptSCT in terms of design capabilities and memory consumption. Secondly, the foraging case study as a complex and medium-sized problem is modeled using ptSCT step by step.

  abstract     = {In areas that demand short-term Internet connectivity, like events and mobile offices, it is not feasible to have a permanent wireless Internet infrastructure. To provide broadband Internet access to temporary clients, we propose the use of flying networks. These networks need to be carefully managed, mainly due to the limitation on their nodes’ battery capacity. Considering these issues, we introduce a new Location and Positioning Optimization Technique for Flying Networks (LoPoFly). LoPoFly includes two modules: (i) location that uses the Deterministic Annealing (DA) metaheuristic to find a location where a flying node is required based on client distribution and (ii) positioning that manages relocation and exchange of flying nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that employs the DA metaheuristic to manage the flying networks covering restrictions related to energy, replacement, communication, and mobility together. Through simulations, we analyze the performance of LoPoFly in two different mobility scenarios. The results show that in both scenarios, LoPoFly mitigates the number of required flying nodes, even serving a higher number of clients.},

  abstract     = {We encounter a world where the role of robots has increased in society. Day by day, we can observe that problems related to autonomous vehicles are being solved. The focused problem that we have recently confronted is based on collaborative mapping with multi-robots since collaboratively generated map provides more information about the environment than with a single robot. Moreover, the mapping framework for robot team can be more efficient if 3D laser sensors are placed to cover wider area. However, laser sensors are commonly positioned intuitively and depended mostly on the designer’s choice. To overcome designer-independent laser sensor setup for efficient collaborative mapping, a subjective evaluation of laser sensor placement is developed as another key aspect. This paper proposed a collaborative mapping framework for heterogeneous robot teams to make full use of collected information from different viewpoints and explore large areas more efficiently. It’s comprised of two modules, localization of multi-robots and collaborative map construction. In addition, to avoid arbitrary setup of laser sensors in existing methods whose performance is heavily affected by designers’ experience, a metric evaluation system was defined to determine the optimal placements of laser sensors and achieve maximum sweep area. The proposed methods were verified on both simulation and experiments which were carried out on a heterogeneous robot team (including an unmanned aerial vehicle and a ground vehicle). According to the metric evaluation, best placements were chosen for the laser sensors, and presented collaborative mapping technique was shown to work more efficiently compared with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Restricted mission capability becomes one of the most important challenges facing multicopter UAVs with the increasing complexity of the low-altitude remote sensing mission. Mission capability estimation is the major precondition and the foundation of the mission planning, decomposition, and execution. It’s constrained by platform performance, payload characteristics, mission requirements, and environmental conditions. Flight energy consumption has become the main capability metric criterion of multicopter UAVs in coverage path planning based remote sensing missions. Modeling on flight energy consumption has been the principal subject of many pieces of research. However, current models have not established a connection between inflight performance and remote sensing mission characteristics. Therefore, a mechanistic model is proposed in this study to estimate a multicopter UAV’s mission capability during the mission planning procedure. This model is based on the combination of multicopter flight mechanics and remote sensing mission-oriented coverage path planning theories. The field wind condition is taken into consideration as well. The applicability and performance of the model were evaluated by combining simulation and 60 field mission sorties. The model estimated results are in accordance with the true values. The mean error in the total energy consumption is 5% of the battery used in the experiment. This model will ultimately provide a theoretical basis for mission decision making, help to reduce the low-battery risk and guarantee the safety and efficiency of mission operations prior.},

  abstract     = {The propulsion subsystem of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is one of the most complex due to the aerodynamic, aero-elastic and electromechanical elements it comprises. Therefore, accurate models of this subsystem can be difficult to work with. Therefore, simplified models are normally used for the design of control and navigation algorithms. Considering this, the effectiveness of these algorithms is heavily dependent on the identification process used for the estimation of the parameters of the simplified propulsion model. On the other hand, the novel method of fuzzy adaptive neurons (FANs) have interesting characteristics that make them attractive for applications in which a fast response and good precision are required. In this article, the identification of the parameters of the propulsion system and the trajectory tracking of a multi-rotor UAV using FANs is explored. The efficient learning algorithm of the FANs is applied to identify the parameters of a simplified model of the propulsion system and to the self-tuning proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers of the trajectory tracking system. The proposed simplified model with the identified parameters is tested with experimental data obtained with low speed wind tunnels. The proposed PID controllers with self-tuning gains defined by the algorithm of the FANs for trajectory tracking system, are verified with simulations in MATLAB/Simulink® environment. The results showed that the parameter identification and trajectory tracking with PID controllers with self-tuning gains defined by the algorithm of the FANs, are suitable for estimating the parameters of the simplified model and track the trajectory with better error reduction than a classical PID controller.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survivability is crucial when UAVs are required to perform missions in hostile areas. There are complex spatiotemporal interactions among entities in hostile areas; therefore, evaluation of the survivability of a UAV flying along a specific route needs to effectively fuse spatiotemporal information. It is difficult to clarify how information is fused and how threats accumulate along the route. We present a novel solution for building a learnable evaluation model that can extract the required knowledge directly from the data. In this approach, hostile scenarios are decomposed into various threat entities, threat relations (TRs) and UAVs, where a TR is the relation between a threat entity and a UAV. We propose a data-driven evaluation model named the sequential threat inference network (STIN), which can learn TRs and perform spatiotemporal fusion to evaluate survivability. We validate the model in multiple scenarios that contain threat entities of different types, quantities and attributes. The results show that the STIN is superior to the baseline models in various situations. Specifically, the STIN can automatically generalize learned knowledge to scenarios with different numbers of threat entities without retraining. In the generalization experiment, the error increases little when the STIN is directly used in the new scenarios where the number of entities is larger than in the training scenarios.},

The CMTAP is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, which faces many challenges like problem scale, heterogeneity of UAVs (different capability and maneuverability), task coupling and task precedence constraints. To address this issue, we proposed a modified genetic algorithm (GA) with multi-type-gene chromosome encoding strategy. Firstly, the multi-type-gene encoding scheme is raised to generate feasible chromosomes that satisfy the UAV capability, task coupling and task precedence constraints. Then, Dubins car model is adopted to calculate the mission execution time (objective function of CMTAP model) of each chromosome, and make each chromosome conform to the UAV maneuverability constraint. To balance the searching ability of algorithm and the diversity of population, we raise the modified crossover operator and multiple mutation operators according to the multi-type-gene chromosome encoding. The simulation results demonstrate that the modified GA has better optimization performance compared with random search method, ant colony optimization method and particle search optimization method.},

This mechanism uses an Extended State-based Observer (ESO) to estimate the uncertainties and variety of disturbances. The estimation is continually updated and rejected from the main control loop. The reinforcement principle is inspired from the popular Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) technique in order to enhance the robustness ability of a nonlinear reference model-based control strategy (i.e. Interconnection and Damping Assignment-Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC)). The obtained controller is augmented by an additional input, which is derived via sliding modes framework to handle the estimation errors and ensure asymptotic stability. This combination leads to promising results by improving the nominal control technique. The primary results are shown through numerical simulations and are confirmed, experimentally, with several scenarios.},

However, periodic sensor checking operations are time and computation consuming and they are often not needed, especially in situations where the UAV can operate without violating the safety constraint (e.g., in uncluttered free space). In this paper, we introduce a computation-aware framework that limits sensor checking and replanning operations to instances in which such operations could be necessary. To this end, we propose an approach that utilizes reachability analysis to capture the future states of a UAV operating under the effects of noise and disturbance and performs self-triggered scheduling for sensor monitoring and replanning operations while guaranteeing safety. The replanning operation is further relaxed by performing an online reachable tube shrinking. This approach is supplemented with an online speed adaptation policy based on the curvature of the planned path to minimize deviation from the desired trajectory due to complex system dynamics and controller limitations. The proposed technique is validated with both simulations and experiments focusing on a quadrotor motion planning operation in environments consisting of both static and dynamic obstacles.},

A trajectory planner generates a minimum-time kinematically and dynamically feasible trajectory that includes not only standard restrictions such as continuity and limits on the trajectory, constraints in the waypoints, and maximum distance between the planned trajectory and the given path, but also restrictions in the actuators of the aerial robot based on its dynamic model, guaranteeing that the planned trajectory is achievable. Our novel compact multi-phase trajectory definition, as a set of two different kinds of polynomials, provides a higher semantic encoding of the trajectory, which allows calculating an optimal solution but following a predefined simple profile. A Model Predictive Controller ensures that the planned trajectory is tracked by the aerial robot with the smallest deviation. Its novel formulation takes as inputs all the magnitudes of the planned trajectory (i.e. position and heading, velocity, and acceleration) to generate the control commands, demonstrating through in-lab real flights an improvement of the tracking performance when compared with a controller that only uses the planned position and heading. To support our optimization-based solution, we discuss the most commonly used representations of orientations, as well as both the difference as well as the scalar error between two rotations, in both tridimensional and bidimensional spaces SO(3) and SO(2). We demonstrate that quaternions and error-quaternions have some advantages when compared to other formulations.},

However, other important weather variables have impact on UAS performance and they should be properly investigated for a deeper understanding of such vehicles. The primary objective of our study is the preliminary characterization of a propeller in a climate-controlled chamber. Mechanical and electrical data have been measured while testing the propeller at low pressure and cold temperatures. Test results point out that thrust and electric power are strongly affected by air density. A comparison between the experimental data and the results of the Blade Element Theory is carried out to assess the theory capability to estimate thrust in unconventional environments. The overlap between experimental data and theory computation is appropriate despite geometrical uncertainties and corroborate the need of a reliable aerodynamic database. Propeller performance data under unconventional atmospheres will be leveraged to improve UAS design, propulsion system modelling as well as provide guidelines to certify operations in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {The paper deals with the legal facets of the Single European Sky strategy and the reform of today’s European air traffic management network for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The aim of this strategy is to guarantee standards on safety, efficiency and environmental impact of the air traffic, so as to let drones progressively sharing it. The paper scrutinizes the ways in which the European Commission and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) intend to attain this end by September 2023. In addition, the paper sheds light on some of the troubles with this roadmap. First, it is all about the clarification and implementation of the regulations and guidelines set up by both EASA and the Commission. Second, problems of coordination persist among different regulatory authorities in multiple legal domains, e.g. the interaction between civil aviation law authorities and data protection authorities. Third, most solutions on a risk-based regulation, markets integration, and the design of law-abiding drones should involve the UAS sector industries. The latter are an essential factor for the adoption of new technological standards and still, the definition of such standards brings us back to the coordination problems mentioned above. Whether or not these problems on rules, standards and coordination for the governance of law-abiding drones will obstruct the agenda for a Single European Sky remains an open question. But, it seems fair to admit such problems will increasingly attract the attention of scholars over the next years.},

  abstract     = {Poland was one of the first European countries to adopt a national regulatory framework for the operation of drones. During its first years (2013–2016), the national regulator was more focused on VLOS operations, and BVLOS operations were possible only in segregated airspace. Since 2019, a new law has allowed for certain types of BVLOS operations to be conducted outside of segregated airspace, at very low levels. This paper will analyze how national legislation is dealing with this new technology, focusing on the new law on BVLOS operations. As the national regulation will be replaced in June 2020 by common European rules that have been adopted 2019, this paper also aims to highlight the most important provisions of the EU regulation.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, robots equipped with a single camera, such as micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), are easily found at affordable costs. They can be used in different tasks, including the building of 3D environment maps. For building such maps, monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are employed, which usually generate sparse or semi-dense representations that are ill-suited for navigation tasks. We propose a new 3D exploration approach that uses a monocular camera as the only source of information. Our approach transforms a point cloud generated by monocular SLAM into local volumetric maps. These maps are built using the lines-of-sight between points and keyframes, allowing the MAV to navigate safely through the environment. Goal poses are dynamically defined to guide the MAV to explore the environment while avoiding obstacles. Besides that, the proposed approach seeks to determine properly when the environment was entirely explored, preventing that MAV stops before cover all the environment or flies more that is needed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in experiments in two different indoor environments, and show that it is possible to explore an environment using only a MAV equipped with a single monocular camera.},

However, most existing works only consider the geometric information during training, without using semantics. We propose a semantic monocular depth estimation (SE-Net), a neural network framework that estimates depth using semantic information and video sequences. The whole framework is semi-supervised, because we take advantage of labelled semantic ground truth data. In view of the structural consistency between the semantically segmented image and the depth map, we first perform semantic segmentation on the image, and then use the semantic labels to guide the construction of the depth estimation network. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that learning semantic information from images can effectively improve the effect of monocular depth estimation, and SE-Net is superior to the most advanced methods in depth estimation accuracy.},

However, the soft robot is exposed to sharp objects during work, which is ease to cause damage and reduces the service life of the soft robot. In this study, we proposed a bionic earthworm crawling robot with self-healing ability, which is achieved by implanting self-healing silicone elastomer (PDMS-TFB) at key parts with Ecoflex00–30 silica gel as the main body. The PDMS-TFB (Polydimethylsiloxane- Triformylbenzene) elastomer has a high tensile property (maximum strain up to 2400%), which makes it possible to cope with the large deformations that occur during the movement of the soft robot. The soft robot uses the self-healing behavior of materials to make them recyclable. The self-repairing speed of the material can be accelerated by heating, and the performance of the soft robot after healing is almost completely recovered. Actuated by air, the earthworm robot will expand axially after being aerated (10 kPa). When inflate and deflate in designed sequence for each chamber, maximum crawling speed of the soft robot can reach 150 mm/min, meanwhile, it can stably crawl on smooth planes with different angles (maximum 45 degrees) owning to the suction cup structures. This novel strategy provides a solution to greatly improve the service life of soft robots, making them useful in wide applications in scientific research, disaster relief etc.},

  abstract     = {Industry 4.0 is taking human-robot collaboration at the center of the production environment. Collaborative robots enhance productivity and flexibility while reducing human’s fatigue and the risk of injuries, exploiting advanced control methodologies. However, there is a lack of real-time model-based controllers accounting for the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. With this aim, this paper proposes a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) variable impedance controller to assist human operators in collaborative tasks. More in details, an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is used to learn a human-robot interaction dynamic model, capturing uncertainties. Such a learned model is kept updated during collaborative tasks execution. In addition, the learned model is used by a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with Cross-Entropy Method (CEM). The aim of the MPC+CEM is to online optimize the stiffness and damping impedance control parameters minimizing the human effort (i.e, minimizing the human-robot interaction forces). The proposed approach has been validated through an experimental procedure. A lifting task has been considered as the reference validation application (weight of the manipulated part: 10 kg unknown to the robot controller). A KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820 has been used as a test platform. Qualitative performance (i.e, questionnaire on perceived collaboration) have been evaluated. Achieved results have been compared with previous developed offline model-free optimized controllers and with the robot manual guidance controller. The proposed MBRL variable impedance controller shows improved human-robot collaboration. The proposed controller is capable to actively assist the human in the target task, compensating for the unknown part weight. The human-robot interaction dynamic model has been trained with a few initial experiments (30 initial experiments). In addition, the possibility to keep the learning of the human-robot interaction dynamics active allows accounting for the adaptation of human motor system.},

  abstract     = {A type of trust region-sequential quadratic programming (TRSQP) approach with superlinearly convergent property is first proposed, investigated, and implemented on bipedal robots based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). NMPC is utilized to predict the system behavior and optimize the control move in a receding horizon way, which will result in recursive efficiency and stability. Considering that the classical line search rules are expensive or hard in particular applications, the attempted trust region search is leveraged to avoid the drawbacks of the classical line search rules. Moreover, the feasible descent direction is contained in the trust region via a novelly truncated technique which avoids to recompute the quadratic programming subproblem (QPS) for the main search direction. Owing to some suitable conditions, the globally/superlinearly convergent performance and well-defined properties are analyzed and verified for the TRSQP. The main result is illustrated on a simple bipedal robot which is called as compass-like bipedal robot (CLBR) through numerical simulations and is used to generate dynamic locomotion via TRSQP and NMPC. Furthermore, to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of a complex bipedal robot which is called as a high-dimensional bipedal robot, numerical simulations are conducted on the model of a three-link bipedal robot (TLBR) and a five-link robot (RABBIT). Furthermore, simulation results show that the TRSQP approach is effectiveness and superiority through comparing with the classical approaches, which included discrete mechanics and optimal control (DMOC) and hybrid zero dynamic (HZD), and control Lyapunov function-quadratic programming (CLF-QP) for the optimal gait of bipedal robot. In addition, to verify the robustness, the TLBR model with parameter’s disturbance 1.5 times is investigated and analyzed via TRSQP with NMPC technique. Last,this study develops an interesting framework to exploiting control methods on bipedal robots through accurately and effectively solving nonlinear programming problems.},

Since the SAC algorithm can greatly reduce the complexity of exoskeleton system, it is widely used in human augmentation applications. Nevertheless, the performance of the SAC algorithm depends on the accuracy of dynamic model parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel Model-based control with Interaction Predicting (MIP) strategy to lower dependency on the accurate dynamic model of the exoskeleton. The MIP consists of an interaction predictor and a model-based controller. The interaction predictor can predict motion trajectories of the pilot and substitute for the pilot to drive the exoskeleton through an impedance model. In proposed strategy, the model-based controller not only amplify the forces initiated by the interaction predictor, but more importantly the forces imposed by the pilot to correct the errors between the predictive motion trajectory and the intended motion trajectory of the pilot. Illustrative simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy. Additionally, the comparisons with traditional model-based control algorithm are also presented to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed control strategy for lowering dependency on dynamic models.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robots that operate in underwater environment and do not need involvement of an operator when performing some tasks. In order to move independently in water environment, AUVs need navigation capabilities, on the one hand, they have to be able to detect obstacles and avoid them, and on the other hand, they also have to know their own position and spatial orientation, at least course. With regard to the orientation, there are many various solutions like inertial systems, inclinometers, magnetic compasses, optical gyro–compasses, whereas, position due to unavailability of GPS requires solutions dedicated to underwater environment such as inertial navigation. To this end, information about spatial orientation and velocity is necessary. When the vehicle is not equipped with a device to measure velocity, e.g. because of small size of the vehicle itself, the only solution is to use odometry, that is, to apply information from the drive to estimate the velocity. The paper presents Odometric Navigational System (ONS) designed for a small biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV) and tuned by means of neuro–evolutionary techniques. To verify system performance, data from the real BAUV were applied.},

Thus, this paper proposes a novel navigation system, which fuses downward-looking visual odometry and model-based velocity for homing, and recognizes and tracks the light marker for terminal docking, in order to overcome the defects of the conventional navigation method.

As energy is the integral of power over time, the turning radius should be considered explicitly for this type of rover. Lower instantaneous power consumption for wider arcs must be traded off against shorter traversal distance for tighter arcs by evaluating the total energy consumed when following different paths. This research seeks to find the most energy-efficient path from among Circular arc - Line - Circular arc (CLC) paths, a generalization of Point turn - Line - Point turn (PLP) paths which are the simplest path to execute for a skid-steer rover traversing between general start and end poses. The optimally energy-efficient CLC path on hard ground is found to have circular arcs of radius R′, the turning radius at which a skid-steer rover’s inner wheels are not commanded to turn. The radius corresponds to exactly half the rover’s slip-track. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental evidenceis presented to support this result. Further, important features of the R′ turning radius are explored.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a path planner for multi-robot systems based on the solution of the multiple traveling salesman problem by genetic algorithm. The main planning goal is to build an efficient path to each robot of the system which jointly ensures that several a priori known points (ways-points) in the environment can be attained by at least one of the robots. During navigation, each robot try to follow its planned path while performing tasks and deviating from unknown static and dynamic obstacles. As the robots have limited sensing and communication skills, their positions can easily become uncertain and the robots will be unable to follow their planned paths. To circumvent this problem, each robot has a local planner, able to recalculate its position and then to resume its planned path. This computation is based on the knowledge about way-points positions, information exchanged with other robots and a self localization algorithm by triangulation. The proposed global/local path planner is firstly validated by computer simulations. An experimental study is also carried out with a small system with very simple mobile robots with differential drive and Bluetooth communication. The obtained results confirm the efficacy of the proposed path planner.},

  abstract     = {Reliably navigating to a distant goal remains a major challenge in robotics. In contrast, animals such as rats and pigeons can perform goal-directed navigation with great reliability. Evidence from neural science and ethology suggests that various species represent the spatial space as a topological template, with which they can actively evaluate future navigation uncertainty and plan reliable/safe paths to distant goals. While topological navigation models have been deployed in mobile robots, relatively little inspiration has drawn upon biology in terms of topological mapping and active path planning. In this paper, we propose a novel bio-inspired topological navigation model, which consists of topological map construction, active path planning and path execution, for aerial mobile robots with visual landmark recognition and compass orientation capability. To mimic the topological spatial representation, the model firstly builds the topological nodes based on the reliability of visual landmarks, and constructs the edges based on the compass accuracy. Then a reward diffusion algorithm akin to animals’ path evaluation process is developed. The diffusion process takes the topological structure and landmark reliability into consideration, which helps the agent to construct the path with visually reliable nodes. In the path execution process, the agent combines orientation guidance and landmark recognition to estimate its position. To evaluate the performance of the proposed navigation model, a systematic series of experiments were conducted in a range of challenging and varied real-world visual environments. The results show that the proposed model generates animal-like navigation behaviours, which avoids travelling across large visually aliased areas, such as forest and water regions, and achieves higher localization accuracy than navigating on the shortest paths.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the modeling, system identification, simulation and flight testing of the airbrake of an unmanned experimental aircraft in frame of the FLEXOP H2020 EU project. As the aircraft is equipped with a jet engine with slow response an airbrake is required to increase deceleration after speeding up the aircraft for flutter testing in order to remain inside the limited airspace granted by authorities for flight testing. The airbrake consists of a servo motor, an opening mechanism and the airbrake control surface itself. After briefly introducing the demonstrator aircraft, the airbrake design and the experimental test benches the article gives in depth description of the modeling and system identification referencing also previous work. System identification consists of the determination of the highly nonlinear (saturated and load dependent) servo actuator dynamics and the nonlinear aerodynamic and mechanical characteristics including stiffness and inertia effects. New contributions relative to the previous work are a unified servo angular velocity limit model considering opening against the load or closing with it, the detailed construction and evaluation of airbrake normal and drag force models considering the whole deflection and aircraft airspeed range, the presentation of a unified aerodynamic - mechanic nonlinearity model giving direct relation between airbrake angle, dynamic pressure and servo torque and the transfer function-based modeling of stiffness and inertial effects in the mechanism. The identified servo dynamical model includes system delay, inner saturation, the aforementioned load dependent angular velocity limit model and a transfer function model. The servo model was verified based-on test bench measurements considering the whole opening angle and dynamic load range of the airbrake. New, unpublished measurements with gradually increasing servo load as the servo moves are also considered to verify the model in more realistic circumstances. Then the full airbrake model is constructed and tested in simulation to check realistic behavior. In the next step the airbrake model integrated into the nonlinear simulation model of the FLEXOP aircraft is tested by flying simulated test trajectories with the baseline controller of the aircraft in software-in-the-loop (SIL) Matlab simulation. First, the standalone airbrake simulation is compared to the SIL results to verify flawless integration of airbrake model into the nonlinear aircraft simulation. Then deceleration times with and without airbrake are compared underlining the usefulness of the airbrake in the test mission. Finally, real flight data is used to verify and update the airbrake model and show the effectiveness of the airbrake.},

For this reason, the main idea proposed in this research is the design of a robust controller, as autopilot control system candidate for a fixed-wing UAV. In detail, the inner loop of the autopilot system is designed with a tube-based robust model predictive control (TRMPC) scheme, able to handle additive noise. Moreover, the navigation outer loop is regulated by a proportional-integral-derivative controller. The proposed TRMPC is composed of two parts: (i) a linear nominal dynamics, evaluated online with an optimization problem, and (ii) a linear error dynamics,which includes a feedback gain matrix, evaluated offline. The key aspects of the proposed methodology are: (i) offline evaluation of the feedback gain matrix, and (ii) robustness to random, bounded disturbances. Moreover, a path-following algorithm is designated for the guidance task, which provides the reference heading angle as input to the control algorithm. Software-in-the-loop and processor-in-the-loop simulations have been performed to validate the proposed approach. The obtained performance have been evaluated in terms of tracking capabilities and computational load, assessing the real-time implementability compliance with the XMOS development board, selected as continuation of previous works.},

However, existing research seldom investigates such a human-robot collaboration coupled with an extra environment with unknown stiffness. If the end-effector that is guided by a human with various intended motion contacts the unknown environment, the interaction might become unstable. Additionally, current research for this physical human-robot-environment interaction use two force sensors to address the issue, and hence the cost of the robot is likely to increase and it reduces the flexibility to many applications. Therefore, in this paper, we address the issue of physical human-robot interaction coupled with an extra environment whose stiffness is unknown. To achieve this, the condition of robot admittance is rigorously proved in accordance with different human intended motion and environmental stiffness. Moreover, a variable admittance control scheme is proposed based on human intention, environmental force and environment stiffness using the combination of a force sensor and a force observer. Simulation and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

While some visual approaches focus on grasping that satisfy force-closure standards only, we further link affordances-based task constraints to the grasp pose on object parts, so that both force-closure standard and task constraints can be ensured. In this paper, a new single-view approach is proposed for task-constrained grasp pose detection. We propose to learn a pixel-level affordance detector based on a convolutional neural network. The affordance detector provides a fine grained understanding of the task constraints on objects, which are formulated as a pre-segmentation stage in the grasp pose detection framework. The accuracy and robustness of grasp pose detection are improved by a novel method for calculating local reference frame as well as a position-sensitive fully convolutional neural network for grasp stability classification. Experiments on benchmark datasets have shown that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We have also validated our method in real-world and task-specific grasping scenes, in which higher success rate for task-oriented grasping is achieved.},

Classifiers can be incorporated into a SLAM pipeline to add semantic information to a scene. Frequently, this semantic information is conducted for each frame of the image, but semantic labeling is not persistent over time. In this work, we present a nonparametric statistical approach to perform matching/association of objects detected over consecutive image frames. These associated classified objects are then localized in the accrued map using an unsupervised clustering method. We test our approach on multiple data sets, and it shows strong performance in terms of objects correctly associated from frame to frame.

This study shall specifically focus on the evasion strategies of robbers.

In this method, the robbers estimate the control variables of the cops in real time to address the difficulties in obtaining the complete pursuit strategies of the latter for solving the evasion strategies. This method also guarantees the real-time solutions of receding horizon optimization problems. Orthogonal collocation is utilized to discretize the Cops and Robbers dynamic model, and then the resulting nonlinear programming problem is solved to obtain the optimal control. To improve the accuracy of the solution, we propose an iterative hp-adaptive mesh refinement strategy to satisfy the optimality conditions by adjusting the number of finite elements and the order of Lagrange polynomials. This mesh refinement strategy also iteratively uses finite elements and collocation points as well as applies the finite element merging strategy to improve the solution efficiency.

  abstract     = {In the new era, robots play a significant role in assembly lines to assemble different products. In this paper, a combination of humans and robots is used in the mixed-model assembly lines (MMAL) to get better performance from the assembly line. The four-sided assembly line (4-AL) is also considered; that is, in addition to the usual work done on the left and right side, the assembly is also performed on the above and beneath side in some lines. The above-sided tasks are done only by the robot, and it is decided on the other three sides to be done by a robot or a human. The problem’s model has two objectives, minimize the number of mated-station and the cost of utilizing different agents. A small-scale numerical example is solved by the GAMS which indicates the feasibility of the model. An Augmented Multi-Objective particle swarm optimization (AMOPSO) is used to solve the model in large dimensional. AMOPSO has utilized two new methods, local learning strategy and adaptive uniform mutation for the development of the MOPSO algorithm. The Multi-Objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and AMOPSO solutions are compared with each other, and the results show that AMOPSO improves on the responses and has no significant effect on the complexity of solving the problem.},

In order to solve problems in comparison with conventional SMC, a sliding surface with the time-varying parameter is proposed which not only eliminates chattering and increases the stability of the closed loop system, but also prevents the increase of the control input voltage. Furthermore, an approach is proposed to calculate the sliding surface vector coefficients which, in presence of the existing uncertainties, guarantee the global asymptotically stability of the closed loop system. Finally, simulation and practical implementation results are presented to exhibit the helpfulness of the proposed control technique compared to the previous methods.},

  abstract     = {In miniature robotics applications, compliant mechanisms are widely used because of their scalability. In addition, compliant mechanism architecture is compatible with the manufacturing methods used to fabricate small scale robots, such as “foldable robotics”, where the size and the materials used allow much larger deflections. In this paper, the kinematics of compliant mechanisms used in miniature foldable robots are investigated with the assumption of nonlinear large deflections that occur at the flexure joints. The solution of the large beam deflection is acquired using elliptic integrals and is verified with finite element analysis and experiments on a simple small foldable leg linkage. The large deflection model takes joint strain energies into account and yields accurate estimations for load capacity of the mechanism as well as the necessary input torque for actuation of the leg. Therefore, the model presented can be used to estimate the load capacity of a miniature robot, as well as to select appropriate actuators. The work is also extended to estimate the compliant leg kinematics and rigid body dynamics of a foldable robot. The robot’s large deflection simulation results are compared with experiments and a simplified rigid-link pin-joint kinematic model. Our results demonstrate the modeling accuracy of the two approaches and can be used by foldable robotics community when deciding on the strategy to choose for modeling their robots.},

Manipulability index has been extensively studied in the robotics literature and several formulae have been developed, nevertheless, they mainly only exploit the robot redundancy. The general IK is formulated as a Quadratic Programming (QP) that can seamlessly incorporate inequality constraints, such as collision avoidance, and we propose two new formulae to integrate the manipulability index maximization into the QP-based IK solver. We then thoroughly analyze the performance of the proposed formulae in simulation and validate them on a real Baxter research robot. The experimental results revealed the outperformance of the proposed formulae in comparison with the classical formula in the literature.

  abstract     = {Multi-robot patrolling represents a fundamental problem for many monitoring and surveillance applications and has gained significant interest in recent years. In patrolling, mobile robots repeatedly travel through an environment, capture sensor data at certain sensing locations and deliver this data to the base station in a way that maximizes the changes of detection. Robots move on tours, exchange data when they meet with robots on neighboring tours and so eventually deliver data to the base station. In this paper we jointly consider two important optimization criteria of multi-robot patrolling: (i) idleness, i.e. the time between consecutive visits of sensing locations, and (ii) delay, i.e. the time between capturing data at the sensing location and its arrival at the base station. We systematically investigate the effect of the robots’ moving directions along their tours and the selection of meeting points for data exchange. We prove that the problem of determining the movement directions and meeting points such that the data delay is minimized is NP-hard. For this purpose, we define a structure called tour graph which models the neighborhood of the tours defined by potential meeting points. We propose two heuristics that are based on a shortest-path-search in the tour graph. We provide a simulation study which shows that the cooperative approach can outperform an uncooperative approach where every robot delivers the captured data individually to the base station. Additionally, the experiments show that the heuristic which is computational more expensive performs slightly better on average than the less expensive heuristic in the considered scenarios.},

The purpose of this research is to determine the key physical attributes and construct a new mathematical model to determine the probability of visual detection and avoidance of sUAS. Using the Monte Carlo simulation method, this study provided a means for addressing the effects of uncertainty in the uncontrollable inputs. As a result, it produced a set of probability curves for various operating scenarios and depicted the likelihood of visually detecting a small, unmanned aircraft in time to avoid colliding with it. This study suggested the probability of detecting a sUAS in time to avoid a collision, in all cases modeled during the study, is far less than 50%. The probability was well under 10% for sUAS aircraft similar to the products used by many recreational and hobby operators. This study indicated the see-and-avoid is not a reliable technique for collision prevention by manned-aircraft pilots with small, unmanned aircraft and call for regulators and the industry’s deployment of alternative methods.},

The condition with sudden threats can better reflect the real situation of the UAV in the real environment. First of all, the A* algorithm is adopted to generate an optimal path in a known environment in this method. Then, in the situation of static sudden threats, a series of candidate paths are generated by the principle of cubic spline second-order continuity. In order to make the static sudden threat at the center of a cluster of candidate paths, they need to be adjusted. After that, this path cluster completely surrounds the sudden threat and has symmetry about the sudden threat. When encountering a sudden threat of movement, factors such as the speed, acceleration and certain parameters of the movement obstacle or the UAV are considered, and a correlation model of the dynamic sudden threat is established. Finally, the total cost function is established to select the optimal obstacle avoidance path, and the total cost function contains four sub-cost functions, they are static security cost function, smoothness cost function, consistency cost function and dynamic security cost function. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In order to realize obstacle avoidance and path optimization, a path planning method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cubic spline interpolation is developed. The curvature of the path obtained by this method is continuous, which can not only avoid obstacles but also meet the constraint of AUV’s minimum radius of rotation. In the design of kinematics controller, an optimal guidance scheme based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed, which takes into account the wave disturbances. Adaptive dynamical sliding mode control (ADSMC) technology is used to design dynamic controller, which can effectively overcome the influence of model uncertainties. In order to ensure the stability of the system, the stability condition of MPC is designed, and the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by applying cascade system theory. The control strategy proposed in this paper is compared with the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance through simulation experiment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy can not only improve the quality of path following, but also reduce the disturbance of waves, and thus is more conducive to energy saving.},

The EGEA integrate a group-based framework and elitist selection methods into evolutionary path planner, which combine main advantages of these two techniques.The group-based framework allows each offspring individual of evolutionary algorithm to generate its own group of new solutions with a certain probability. Two elitist selection methods, herein referred to as group individual elitist selection (GIES) and whole population elitist selection (WPES), are proposed to facilitate selecting preferable solutions to be passed on to the next generation in the procedure of evolutionary algorithms. The EGEA path planners based on simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are tested to find trajectories for multiple UMVs to collect maximum interested ocean information from regions under investigation. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is also described and evaluated with the proposed EGEA for solving the adaptive sampling problem. Simulation results show that the whole elite group-based simulated annealing algorithm (WEGSA) is able to generate trajectories with more information gain from regions of high scientific interest with constrained energy of multiple UMVs than other techniques. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on the EGEA in comparison with other techniques.},

The control law is designed in terms of desired forces and moments which should act on the system, it does permit to exploit possible estimations of the disturbances acting on the vehicle and does not depend on the multirotor configuration. The control allocation, instead, optimally solves the redistribution of the control efforts among the motors according to the specific multirotor configuration, moreover it can actively cope with actuator faults whenever their estimations are available. Numerical simulations based on realistic scenarios confirm that the control architecture permits to solve the attitude and altitude tracking problem, despite the effects of faults and disturbances on the system.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an optimization-based approach to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters namely drag and added mass coefficients from free-running experiments conducted on an in-house developed Anguilliform-inspired robot. The objective of the optimization problem is to estimate the hydrodynamic parameters that minimize the differences between the trajectories obtained from the simulations and the physical experiments when operated for identical gait parameters and controller gains for both the straight and the turning motions. The hydrodynamic parameters obtained from the developed approach leads to a maximum root-mean-square (RMS) position error of 0.183 BL and a maximum RMS velocity error of 0.03 BL/s between the trajectories obtained from simulations and experiments. Experimental results suggest that the parameters estimated using the developed approach can be useful in predicting the robot’s motion accurately. Accurate robot motion prediction is the fundamental requirement for localization, collision prediction, and motion planning algorithms which in turn are required for automated inspection, maintenance, and repair of sub-sea structures using Anguilliform-inspired robots.},

Applications such as visual servoing, robotic assisted surgery and optronic weapon systems require accurate and high-precision measurements provided by real-time visual-tracking systems. In this case, the DGPIO-Bank was designed using two kinematic models based in constant velocity (CV) and constant acceleration (CA) motion profiles. The main feature of the DGPIO-Bank is the active disturbance rejection (ADR) feature which reduces noise in the position signal of a moving object. The resultant algorithm uses a fusion of four important features: state interaction, Kalman filtering, active disturbance rejection and multiple models combination. For performance comparison, we evaluated our proposed IMM-DGPIO algorithm and other state of the art IMM algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed strategy had the best performance.},

  abstract     = {In this article, the dynamic equations of a reconfigurable non-holonomic mobile robot used for space explorations and rescue operations are presented. Dimensions of mobile robots usually remain unchanged while they are programmed to determine a new path to bypass obstacles. The aim of developing this robot is to upgrade the mechanical structure so it can adapt its structure to pass the obstacles without path deviation. Furthermore, by means of mentioned reconfigurations, less motor power is needed, leading to optimized energy consumption. To this end, longitudinal and transverse adjustments are defined for the robot. In view of the motion restrictions existing in conventional wheels, omnidirectional wheels are used in robot structure and their features are considered when deriving motion eqs. Accordingly, the robot is able to move in the direction of wheels’ axis. To evaluate the designed mechanism, the system is simulated in ADAMS and the results are compared with the derived motion equations. The findings prove that not only is this system implementable, but the results are also consistent with ADAMS with an acceptable error. Additionally, the calculated energy consumption in a robot that uses transverse adjustment to cross obstacles decreases by 12% compared to a robot that climbs the obstacle and 10% decrease occurs compared to path planning method. As the system dynamics are obtained in a general form, the derived equations can be applied in various applications and different configurations.},

Accordingly, two small vibrating motors are utilized to run the micro-robot and the motion principle of stick-slip is used for locomotion purpose. First, a dynamic model of the micro-robot is derived considering the stiffness of the robot’s legs. Then, the influences of robot mass and length of legs on micro-robot motion are studied using simulation. Next, an optimal linear PID control scheme is applied to the micro-robot system. However, it is found that this control method does not have an acceptable performance when friction is low or the system is under disturbance. Consequently, an ACO-based optimal nonlinear PID control is proposed to cope with the mentioned drawbacks as the main contribution of the paper. Afterwards, the performance of both control techniques is compared through simulation. Finally, the micro-robot is developed and experimentally evaluated. It is found that the experimental results are in a good agreement with some of the simulation outcomes through which the validity of the mathematical scheme as well as the feasibility of design is affirmed.},

To accomplish this purpose, first the Gibbs-Appell (G-A) technique is used for getting the dynamic equations of the mentioned manipulator. Indeed, by employing the G-A methodology, one gets rid of the difficulties of Lagrange Multipliers that originate from non-holonomic constraints. To show the generality of the proposed technique, a recursive predictive control-based formulation is subsequently developed for the studied mechanism to systematically find the kinematic control rules. This multivariable kinematic controller specifies the desired angular and linear velocities of the moving base and manipulator links by finding the minimum tracking error between the system’s current position and reference trajectory from a point-wise quadratic objective function. Again, according to the predictive control approach, the system’s dynamic model in state space form and the desired velocities achieved from the kinematic controller are used to obtain the appropriate input torque and force controls while taking the existing uncertainties into consideration. Lastly, computer simulations are performed to emphasize that the suggested method is able to mathematically model the moving platform and end-effector of such complex robotic systems and also control their trajectory tracking.},

  abstract     = {Underwater cooperative robotics offers the possibility to perform challenging intervention applications, such as recovering archeological objects as within the context of the MERBOTS research project, or grasping, transporting and assembly of big objects, using more than one mobile manipulator, as faced by the TWINBOT project. In order to enhance safety during the intervention, it is reasonable to avoid the umbilical, also giving more mobility to the robots, and enabling a broader set of cooperative movements. Several solutions, based on acoustic, radiofrequency (RF) or Visual Light Communication (VLC) have been proposed for underwater communications in the literature. This paper presents the architecture of an underwater wireless communication framework for the control of multiple semi-autonomous robots in cooperative interventions. The proposed framework is composed of several modules as the virtual reality interface using UWSim, the Underwater Multi-robot Cooperative Intervention Remote Control Protocol (UMCI-RCP) and a Generic Link Layer (GLL). UMCI-RCP allows the control of an underwater robot over limited communication links. UMCI-RCP integrates a progressive compression algorithm that provides visual feedback at a constant rate and ensures image reception even in channels with loses. The Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) medium access strategy minimizes the jitter of transmitted packets. The GLL has been designed in order to provide support for multimodal transmission (i.e. acoustic, RF and VLC) and also to interface with the UWSim-NET simulator so that facilitates the experimentation either with a real or with a simulated modem. The possibility of exchange real and simulated devices in the proposed framework are demonstrated by means of a teleoperation experiment with a BlueROV equipped with the S100 RF modems. Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) capabilities are demonstrated repeating the experiment with the real modems and modeling the BlueROV, and also modeling both the modems and the BlueROV.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an improved calibration method to accurately estimate extrinsic calibration parameters of a tilting 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF). Tilting 2D LRF (a low cost 3D scanner device) with a unidirectional rotating platform has been widely used in robotics applications to scan the 3D environment. Ideally, the tilt axis of rotating mechanism should pass through the optical rotation centre of the 2D LRF. However, due to misalignment during assembling of 2D LRF with the rotating platform, the centres of rotation may not coincide with each other. Though, the system must be calibrated to align both the centres of rotation so as to improve the accuracy in building 3D point cloud of the environment. Unlike the previous calibration techniques, the main advantage of the proposed method is that it accurately estimates all 6-DOF calibration parameters, especially rotation and translation calibration parameters along motor rotation axis between 2D LRF and rotating platform without any additional hardware, camera or rolling/bidirectional rotation mechanism. The proposed method utilizes the normal vector to the calibration board plane and coordinates of laser points at the endpoints of the extracted calibration board line in the 2D scan to obtain these remaining calibration parameters. The obtained parameters are then refined using Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear optimization algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is validated on a range of real as well as synthetic data and the estimated parameters with the proposed approach exhibits 24.54% reduction in RMS (root mean square) error as compared to the conventional approach. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that the proposed method produces accurate results and is able to reduce the artifacts along the rotation axis in the 3D point cloud which usually appear in the point cloud obtained from the conventional approach.},

These policies are then autonomously multiplexed during inference using a Recurrent Neural Network terrain classifier conditioned on the state history, giving an adaptive gait appropriate for the current terrain. We perform several tests to assess policy robustness by changing various parameters, such as contact, friction and actuator properties. We also show experiments of goal-based positional control of such a system and a way of selecting several gait criteria during deployment, giving us a complete solution for blind Hexapod locomotion in a practical setting.

In light of this, the methodology of our calculation is changed to deal with these two cases. The control contribution is altered to again allow bending of the robotic arm from the solitary straight stance. The interior singularities are taken into consideration in the calculation to control against invalid spatial movement of the automated arm. By incorporating fuzzy control theorem, we demonstrate that modeling system enables the robotic arm to move within solitary areas and return back to certain locations, so that the usable workspace is expanded.

  abstract     = {Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is a common topic of research, being motivated by robotic competitions and involving several sets of skills. We present a modular architecture to integrate different components for path planning and navigation of an autonomous mobile robot. This architecture was developed in order to participate in the RoboMagellan competition hosted by RoboGames. It is divided in the organizational, functional and executive levels in order to secure that the developed system has programmability, autonomy, adaptability and extensibility. Global and local localization strategies use unscented and extended Kalman filters (UKF and EKF) to fuse data from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, inertial measurement unit (IMU), odometry and camera. Movement is controlled by a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) and a proportional controller. To avoid obstacles a deformable virtual zone (DVZ) approach is used. The architecture was tested in simulated environments and with a real robot, providing a very flexible approach to testing different configurations.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes an artificial neural network model to restore images damaged by inadequate sensor exposure, saturation, and underexposure, at the time of acquisition. The problem has significant relevance in computational and robotics vision applications, especially when obtaining images of scenes with non-Lambertian surfaces, as well as natural images where the sensor limitation or optical arrangement prevents the scene details from being adequately represented in the captured image. We chose to model an alternative based on deep neural networks, which is adequate, considering the variability in equipment and photography techniques, along with several uncontrolled variables affecting the process. Given a set of synthetic and real image pairs, the representation structure is able to converge into a robust image enhancement model. The proposal incorporates recent advances made by convolutional networks on issues such as semantic segmentation and classification in images. The development and evaluation of the research results are primarily quantitative, using qualitative analysis when appropriate. Results measured by different indicators of image quality indicate that the proposed neural network model can improve images damaged by an amount of 3% on the best scenario on the PSNR metric.},

These Agents should effectively synchronize their individual behaviors so that they can act as a team in a coordinated manner to achieve the common goal of the whole system. One of the main issues in MASs is the agents’ coordination; it is common for domain experts observing MASs execution to disapprove agents’ decisions. Even if the MAS was designed using the best methods and tools for agents’ coordination, this difference in decisions between experts and MAS is confirmed. Therefore, this paper proposes a new dataset schema to support learning the coordinated behavior in MASs from demonstration. The results of the proposed solution are validated in a Multi-Robot System (MRS) organizing a collection of new cooperative plan recommendations from the demonstration by domain experts.},

Our strategies aim at a general application and can be used for both indoor and outdoor environments depending only on the type of metric and radio technology employed. In this work, we investigate two metrics: Ultra Wideband (UWB) and the Received Signal Strength (RSS). The first one is a recent technology and presents better overall accuracy than other metrics, and the second is one of the most well-explored metrics in WSN-based localization approaches. We evaluated the performance of our two approaches and compare them with the Decawave® built-in application. The experiments were performed in simulated and real environments with different scenarios (indoors and outdoors) and sensor configurations. The results show the proposed strategies feasibility by improving the localization accuracy for both types of environments. In indoor environments, the proposed system has a mean position error bellow 0.09 meters and mean orientation error of 0.08 rads. Furthermore, the proposed system is in average 0.03 meters more accurate than the built-in application.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of building augmented metric representations of scenes with semantic information from RGB-D images. We propose a complete framework to create an enhanced map representation of the environment with object-level information to be used in several applications such as human-robot interaction, assistive robotics, visual navigation, or in manipulation tasks. Our formulation leverages a CNN-based object detector (Yolo) with a 3D model-based segmentation technique to perform instance semantic segmentation, and to localize, identify, and track different classes of objects in the scene. The tracking and positioning of semantic classes is done with a dictionary of Kalman filters in order to combine sensor measurements over time and then providing more accurate maps. The formulation is designed to identify and to disregard dynamic objects in order to obtain a medium-term invariant map representation. The proposed method was evaluated with collected and publicly available RGB-D data sequences acquired in different indoor scenes. Experimental results show the potential of the technique to produce augmented semantic maps containing several objects (notably doors). We also provide to the community a dataset composed of annotated object classes (doors, fire extinguishers, benches, water fountains) and their positioning, as well as the source code as ROS packages.},

The first process keeps the size of the bubbles more regular, while the second process guarantees a smooth and short path, satisfying the safe constraints imposed by the rosary. To evaluate these proposed approaches, we presented a simulation of the exoskeleton leg performing the swing phase movement in three different scenarios: overcoming an obstacle, walking up and down a step. The resulting planned paths were evaluated and compared, considering the path length and the path smoothness.},

The theoretical aspects of the architecture are introduced through a case study with practical implementations aiming to design a multi-rotor UAV, which also includes the manufacturing steps of a functional prototype. Our proposal can be used in a scenario where the capacity of physical reconfiguration of a UAV would confer an enormous advantage to these aircraft in terms of applicability. This happens in the case where each task typically requires a robot with a particular physical architecture (number and position of propellers, autonomy, thrust, sensors, and communication). Results of a set of tests with an aircraft assembly are presented to verify the versatility of the proposed architecture, demonstrating the better performance of these aircraft when compared with conventional UAVs. The proposed methodology allows applications in a variety of scenarios like cargo transportation, support, agriculture, publicity, pest control, surveillance, inspection, and entertainment, between others. In these scenarios, although a software with some generic components could easily control drones to perform all of them, it is unthinkable to consider that a single drone with a particular physical structure would be able to be adapted to all of the tasks necessary (as path following, localization, and mapping).},

The novel strategies consider important aspects of the patrolling movement, such as time, uncertainty, and communication. Results point out that these strategies improve the centralized version of the NC-Drone considering the uniform distribution of visits and drastically reduce in 76% the standard deviation, making the algorithm more stable. Based on the results, we found that there is a trade-off between the evaluated metrics, making it necessary to perform a large number of turns to obtain a more spatially distributed patrolling. We also present a series of strategy combinations, achieving slight improvements as more combinations are adopted. The resulting algorithm from the combination of all strategies reduces the communication frequency in 50 times and outperforms the original version of the NC-Drone in 4.5%.},

However, the adoption of a thin boundary layer neighboring the switching surface to smooth out the control law and to eliminate the undesired chattering effect usually impairs the controller’s performance and leads to a residual tracking error. As a matter of fact, underwater robots are very sensitive to this issue due to their highly uncertain plants and unstructured operating environments. In this work, Gaussian process regression is combined with sliding mode control for the dynamic positioning of underwater robotic vehicles. The Gaussian process regressor is embedded within the boundary layer in order to enhance the tracking performance, by predicting unknown hydrodynamic effects and compensating for them. The boundedness and convergence properties of the tracking error are analytically proven. Numerical results confirm the improved performance of the proposed control scheme when compared with the conventional sliding mode approach.},

  abstract     = {The minimum jerk principle is commonly used for trajectory planning of robotic manipulators. However, since this principle is stated in terms of the robot’s kinematics, there is no guarantee that the joint controllers will actually track the planned acceleration and jerk profiles because the tuning of the controllers’ gains is decoupled from the trajectory planning. Bearing this in mind, in this paper we introduce a comprehensive framework for optimal estimation of the gains of PID-like controllers for tracking minimum-jerk (MJ) robot trajectories. The proposed methodology relies mainly on a novel variant of error-based performance indices (ISE, ITSE, IAE and ITAE) which are adapted to the tracking of MJ trajectories. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to search for optimal values for the gains of the controllers of all joints simultaneously. The resulting approach is much simpler than recent developments based on more complex performance indices, in which joint controllers were individually optimized. The proposed approach is general enough to easily encompass the tuning of fractional PID controllers and a comprehensive set of experiments are reported comparing the performances of standard and fractional PID controllers for the task of interest.},

  abstract     = {Noise coming from sensors or caused by external world phenomena results in measurement errors that cause uncertainties in some robotic tasks, e.g. tracking a robot displacement and tracking an observed target. Control approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) usually guarantee constraints satisfaction by way of using detailed models of prediction. Although the deterministic MPC allows certain robustness to be controlled in the system, it usually does not adequately deal with uncertainties. Therefore, we introduce in this manuscript a pure perception motion control, which consists of an approach that deals with the uncertainty problem through a stochastic nonlinear model predictive control (SNMPC) by minimizing only the covariances matrices of target observation and robot state estimation. As introduced previously, it can be used to track targets that are observed during some tasks. The SNMPC penalizes the undesired behavior, allowing the robot to converge to the optimal pose to observe the target optimally. A modification provided both in the prediction model and the cost function allows this minimization to be achieved. The proposed stochastic nonlinear controller is validated, providing a satisfactory control of the target tracking, by way of results obtained from simulation, which are presented and discussed in the paper to verify our proposal.},

First, hardware updates in the main body and the perception head of the contestant robot, DRC-Hubo+, were presented by comparison with the previous platform (DRC-Hubo in DRC-Trials). Then, the control system which enabled the full-sized humanoid to drive the off-the-shelf utility vehicle in the competition was provided. For this, the sensor data fusion process and the advanced driving assistant techniques were emphasized. Next, the driving pattern analysis of other type operators (such as human-drivers or pure tele-operation systems) was provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed system. Lastly, test and evaluation of the built robot and control system was provided via experimentation which DRC-Hubo+ drove the vehicle in a real-world setting. The presented approach was also verified in DRC-Finals as the author’s team was placed in the top record at the driving task in the competition.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a model-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) method is proposed, with the objective to ensure a fault-tolerant autonomous mobile robot navigation. The proposed solution uses an informational framework, which is able to detect and isolate both sensor and actuator faults, including the case of multiple faults occurrence. An information filter with a prediction model based on encoders data is adopted. For the diagnosis layer, a bank of filters are used. Residuals are generated by computing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between the probability distribution of the predicted estimation with updated estimation obtained from sensors measurements. In order to isolate encoder and actuator faults, a secondary information filter with a prediction model based on a closed-loop controller is added. An additional bank of filters is developed, and extra residuals based on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence are generated. In the proposed method, the two designed filters supervise each other, which improves fault diagnosis, by taking into account all available information of the system, from control objective to multi-sensor data fusion. Actuator and sensor faults are treated within the same frame during the fusion process, and multiple faults occurrence is considered. A real-time experimentation on a real differential mobile robot is performed and demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method.},

Inspired by the encirclement behavior of dolphins to entrap the fishes, the encirclement control is mainly to enforce the robots to achieve a capturing formation pattern around a target, and can be widely applied in many areas such as coverage, patrolling, escorting, etc. Different from traditional methods, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for multi-robot target encirclement formation control, combining the advantages of the deep neural network and deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which is free from the complicated work of building the control model and designing the control law. Our method provides a distributed control architecture for each robot in continuous action space, relying only on local teammate information. Besides, the behavioral output at each time step is determined by its own independent network. In addition, both the robots and the moving target can be trained simultaneously. In that way, both cooperation and competition can be contained, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Accurate self-localisation is a fundamental ability of any mobile robot. In Monte Carlo localisation, a probability distribution over a space of possible hypotheses accommodates the inherent uncertainty in the position estimate, whereas bounded-error localisation provides a region that is guaranteed to contain the robot. However, this guarantee is accompanied by a constant probability over the confined region and therefore the information yield may not be sufficient for certain practical applications. Four hybrid localisation algorithms are proposed, combining probabilistic filtering with non-linear bounded-error state estimation based on interval analysis. A forward-backward contractor and the Set Inverter via Interval Analysis are hybridised with a bootstrap filter and an unscented particle filter, respectively. The four algorithms are applied to global localisation of an underwater robot, using simulated distance measurements to distinguishable landmarks. As opposed to previous hybrid methods found in the literature, the bounded-error state estimate is not maintained throughout the whole estimation process. Instead, it is only computed once in the beginning, when solving the wake-up robot problem, and after kidnapping of the robot, which drastically reduces the computational cost when compared to the existing algorithms. It is shown that the novel algorithms can solve the wake-up robot problem as well as the kidnapped robot problem more accurately than the two conventional probabilistic filters.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an active real-time capable 3D graph based simultaneous localization and mapping (Graph SLAM) approach, which actively estimates the state of an autonomous spacecraft relative to a simultaneously established map estimate. The graph is constructed in a tightly-coupled fashion, where an Extended Kalman Filter estimates the relative offset between two of its vertices. An additional relative measurement is derived by matching point clouds obtained by a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system. In order to yield a significant speed-up, scan matching is implemented on the GPU. To reduce the uncertainty of either the state or the map estimate, we present an approach to actively control the system resting on an extended representation of uncertainty in the map. Furthermore, it adapts its behavior depending on the current uncertainty distribution in order to find a dynamic trade-off between exploitation (improve localization performance) and exploration (improve knowledge about the environment). Finally, we present a post-processing approach to discover landing sites in the map estimate without prior knowledge. The evaluation is conducted in a numerical simulation, where the spacecraft explores the real 3D model of Itokawa in its actual dynamic environment. Within that simulation, we use a shader-based GPU implementation for simulating LiDAR measurements. We evaluate the performance of the active SLAM approach and demonstrate that the use of the adaptive approach improves navigation and exploration performance at the same time.},

Two innovative functions, crawling function and cascade connection between Core Module Manipulator (CMM) and Experimental Module Manipulator (EMM) are studied and provided with mathematical solutions. Their purposes are to broaden the workspace while requiring higher demands on the planning method. Collision prediction including collision against the environment and against the robot itself is then analyzed to eliminate the tunneling problem and enhance efficiency. Finally, an improved trajectory planning method based on Lazy Theta* which is an algorithm of any-angle-path planning is proposed and adjusted to different planning conditions. Simulation results prove the comprehensive validity of this method. The collision-free trajectory is reasonable and optimized for shorter length and less turns. This method has preferable efficiency and utility to complex environment and changing free configuration space.},

However, available robots are not able to communicate in this multimodal way, being just able to perform predefined gesture sequences, handcrafted to accompany specific utterances. In the current paper, we propose a model based on three different approaches to extend humanoid robots communication behaviour with upper body gestures synchronized with the speech for novel utterances, exploiting part-of-speech grammatical information, prosody cues, and a combination of both. User studies confirm that our methods are able to produce natural, appropriate and good timed gesture sequences synchronized with speech, using both beat and emblematic gestures.},

The classified task parameters are used to construct a cost function, responsible for describing the demonstration data. For reproduction we propose a novel trajectory optimization that is able to generate a simplified version of the trajectory for different configurations of the task parameters. As the last step before reproduction on a real robotic arm we approximate this trajectory with a Dynamic movement primitive (DMP) - based system to retrieve a smooth trajectory.

  abstract     = {Time-optimal control of robotic manipulators along specified paths is a well-known problem in robotics. It concerns the minimization of the trajectory-tracking time subject to a constrained path and actuator torque limits. Calculus of variations reveals that time-optimal control is of bang-bang type, meaning that at least one actuator is in saturation for every point on the path. Unfortunately, this rule is broken at singular points, where the enforcement of the maximal and/or minimal torque at the bounding actuator would cause the violation of the path constraint. At these particular points, and, sometimes, at critical ones too, the selection of the torques is cumbersome and may introduce jitters in the control references. In this paper, the time-optimal control is addressed in the phase plane with a genetic approach. Results of calculus of variations are ignored and bang-bang control is re-found for the most of the trajectory, while in the neighborhoods of singular points, torques are automatically selected in order to minimize the trajectory-tracking time. Compared to other techniques, the problem is solved directly, without intermediate steps requiring, for example, the explicit computation of the switching points and the management of torques at critical points. The algorithm is validated in simulation on a canonical 2R planar robot in order to ease the comparison with previous works.},

An important feature of this method is that the avoidance control input of an agent depends not only on its proximity to other agents/obstacles but also on their relative motions. For instance, agents approaching at high speeds might be more critical than slow moving yet physically closer agents. The main advantage of using this additional velocity information is that the collision avoidance maneuvers of agents are smoother, and less conservative in the sense that the agents do not spread out as much while avoiding collisions with one another. A Lyapunov-based analysis is adopted to guarantee that the agents meet their desired objectives without colliding. Finally, simulation results on three different systems are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

The Hooke joint-like two degree-of-freedom joint design and the full actuation mode enhanced the rigidity of the robot. The modular link design increased the local flexibility of the robot. Because the cable tension cannot be ignored under high load on the basis of the kinematics model, a cable tension model is established based on rigid body static equilibrium to describe the relationship between posture and cable tension. This provided a foundation for follow-up studies on obstacle avoidance path planning with optimized tension. At the same time, in order to improve the response speed of the motor position controller to the tension change, this study introduces both the tension as the reference model input and the system state variable into the adaptive control method based on model identification and reinforcement learning. The kinematics model and the cable tension model were validated by experiments on the prototype. The practical results of the two adaptive control methods were compared and the result shows that the method based on model identification has a better effect.},

  abstract     = {Bounding volume based approaches in velocity obstacle (VO) provide a good solution for collision avoidance of mobile robots with uncertainty. However, the VO built with the bounding footprint always has over-constraining problems which may lead to conservative maneuvers of the mobile robots. Addressing this problem, a vertical ellipse based velocity obstacle (VEVO) collision avoidance method is proposed in this paper. The method mitigates the over-constraining situation by building the footprint probability ellipse whose minor axis is vertical to the direction of the obstacle to minimize the VO area. Based on VEVO, a DWA (Dynamic Window Approach) integrated method is proposed to provide a set of available velocities in speed selection. According to different collision avoidance objectives like collision safety, shortest time consumption and shortest trajectory length, a multi-objective velocity selecting strategy is proposed to provide optimal velocities for motion planning. Furthermore, a dynamic local path adjustment method is proposed to help robots react to the closest obstacle (dynamic or static) according to different collision safety requirements. We validate our methods in a simulated workspace with different numbers of robots going to their goal points. Experimental results show VEVO method could improve the collision avoidance performance in crowded multi-robot environment and robots could achieve their different objectives when suitable parameters are set in the velocity evaluation function. The proposed dynamic local path adjustment method only affects the trajectories in local areas and could ensure collision avoidance safety and performance at the same time.},

  abstract     = {Circumnavigation is the process whereby a single agent or multiple agents rotate around a target while preserving a circular formation, which has promising potential in real-world applications such as entrapping a malicious target or escorting an important member. For the multi-robot circumnavigation problem, spacing (i.e., the angle differences) among robots plays an important role in forming a desirable circular formation. The spacing is usually assumed to be a unified constant in most of the studies. However, when robots have different or even time-varying kinematic capabilities, a fixed and equal spacing is probably not effective for accomplishing such task as preventing an enclosed target from fleeing, and thus dynamic spacing is naturally proposed and preferred. The variations of spacing are caused by the “weights” (termed utilities) of robots. This paper relaxes the condition of piecewise constant utilities and provides the ultimate bound and the input-to-state (ISS) stability conditions for the spacing error and its dynamics respectively. In addition, since time delay is ubiquitous in practical engineering systems while seldom considered in the current studies on circumnavigation, the maximum allowable time delay within which the circumnavigation remains stable is derived using both the frequency domain method and the Lambert-W function. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by a practical simulation system.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed for a wide range of applications. Their use in wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR), in particular, has been investigated for fast search-area coverage from a high vantage point. The probability of success in such searches, however, can be further improved utilizing cooperative systems that employ both UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In this paper, we present a new coordinated-search planning method, for collaborative UAV-UGV teams. The proposed method, particularly developed for WiSAR, considers the search area to be continuously growing and that the search is sparse. It is also assumed that targets detected by UAVs must be identified by a ground-level searcher. The UAV/UGV motion-planning method presented herein, therefore, has two major components: (i) coordinated search and (ii) joint target identification. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its use of (i) time-dependent target-location iso-probability curves, and (ii) an effective and efficient coordinated target-identification algorithm. The method has been validated via numerous simulated WiSAR searches for varying scenarios. Furthermore, extensive comparative experiments with other methods have shown that our method has higher rates of target detection and shorter search times, significantly outperforming alternative techniques by 75% – 255% in terms of target detection probability.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have important applications in several areas such as data collection, geological survey and exploration in underwater environment. The hydrodynamic forces acting on AUVs are highly nonlinear and the higher-order hydrodynamic coefficients should be taken into account to represent these nonlinear behaviors. Therefore, developing a suitable dynamic model of the AUV and also an accurate knowledge about the hydrodynamic parameters are important for proper design of the navigation and control system. The main goal of the present paper is to investigate the role of proper dynamic model for an AUV which includes different hydrodynamic stability derivatives coefficients. Design of proper actuator is also significant for the global performance of the system and the expenses of the plan. It is tried in the present paper to investigate the effect of full hydrodynamic coefficients on the design of actuators and control system performance analysis for an AUV which was ignored in the previous works. For this purpose, the effect of these parameters on the open loop characteristics of the AUV, its role in the control system design and the interaction of control system and actuator dynamics are considered in nonlinear time domain and frequency domain. It is shown that in a full hydrodynamic consideration for design of the AUV, the effect of control gains, system bandwidth and damping can be different in comparison with the cases which are not fully considered them. Finally, the design of optimum actuator and the effect of actuator natural frequency on the flight performance in the presence of full hydrodynamic coefficients are studied.},

Landmark-based methods that combine local image regions and features from a convolution neural network (CNN) have shown state-of-the-art performance. This paper focuses on improving the performance of landmark-based methods for place recognition. To save time in landmark matching, a novel method is presented to extract landmarks based directly on the lower layer of CNN features instead of using object proposals or superpixels. The centers of landmarks are projected onto the feature maps of the higher layer of the CNN to generate compact descriptors. We then extract potential images through similarities computed by direct matching. In the refinement stage, we exploit the Markov random field (MRF), combined with Bayes filters, to perform robust matchings. This stage integrates the spatial information of landmarks and introduces a new method for similarity measurements. We present extensive experiments using challenging datasets and compare the results to state-of-the-art methods to evaluate our approach. The results show that our approach ensures a remarkable performance under severe condition changes and significantly improves efficiency.},

This paper proposes an improving method based on reduced approximated GVG (RAGVG), which provides a topological representation of the explored space with a smaller graph. Additionally, a fast and robust image thinning algorithm for constructing RAGVGs from metric maps is presented, and an autonomous robotic exploration framework using RAGVGs is designed. The proposed method is validated with three known common data sets and two simulations of autonomous exploration tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in constructing RAGVGs, and the simulations indicate that the mobile robot controlled by the RAGVG-based exploration method reduced the total time by approximately 20% for the given tasks.},

  abstract     = {Compliance control is required in the applications of robots for assembling, grinding, polishing and human-robot interface, which needs both position control and force control of robots. The impedance control based on joint torque servo is a promising and practical method to realize compliance control in industrial applications. The performance of a joint torque servo controller is thus crucial to the success of compliance control. However, both nonlinear friction torque of the joint motor and varied dynamics of environmental contact during manipulation increase control difficulty greatly. This paper focuses on the compliance control problem and presents a new joint torque servo controller which is a cascading structure including an inner velocity feedback loop and an outer torque control loop. Due to the high signal-to-noise ratio of the motor velocity, an extended state observer is designed to effectively estimate and compensate for the motor friction torque, varied dynamics of environmental contact and other unknown disturbance. And benefiting from the introduction of the efficient and powerful velocity inner loop, the new torque controller performs very well not only in the rigid but also elastic contact environment. Then a standard PD controller is designed in the outer torque loop to produce the control law. Based on the satisfactory joint torque controller, a simplified impedance control algorithm is designed to achieve the force control. Experiments with three other joint torque controllers on a robot manipulator are conducted to demonstrate the proposed joint torque method and the overall force control framework. These results show the proposed joint torque controller can reduce the steady-state error from 3.07 Nm to 0.21 Nm which indicates the joint actuator friction can be eliminated by more than 99%. And a substantial improvement can also be observed in the experiments of force control based on the new joint torque controller.},

Aim at the correlation problem in distributed SLAM system, a decorrelated distributed EKF (DDEKF) was developed to estimate the robot pose and landmarks. DDEKF reconstructs and extends the maximum allocation covariance (MAC) method so that it can be applied to the distributed structure where the number of local filters is dynamically changed. Then, the local filter estimation results are weighted and fused in the main filter to obtain the estimation result. Finally, the experimental tests were performed in an outdoor environment, and the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed novel distributed EKF-SLAM system has a better performance than the existing SLAM system.},

  abstract     = {Altitude information is one of the most important data pieces to realize unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous flight. At present, the barometers equipped in the UAVs were used to measure the atmospheric pressure and convert the data to the altitude of UAVs. But the pressure will change drastically when the propeller of the UAV rotate and lead to inaccurate measurement values. In this paper, a UAV height information acquisition method based on the information fusion of monocular vision and a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) is designed, which can obtain accurate height information in the indoor environment and low-altitude outdoor environment. The parallax is obtained by using two images taken in a short time during UAV flight in this method, and the acceleration data measured by the MEMS are used to compute the displacements of the UAV in this time as the baseline. The angle information measured by the MEMS is used to calibrate the images taken by the monocular camera of the UAV. Finally, the altitude information of the UAV is obtained with the theory of binocular stereo vision. Experiments have proven that the altitude information errors obtained by this method at 2 m is approximately 4%, which is less than barometer errors. A new image crop method was proposed to reduce computation, which meets the steady, fast and accurate requirements for practical application. The experiments show that our proposed method can obtain satisfactory results with respect to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the obstacle avoidance problem of multiple mobile robots. We propose a method to address this problem, using a distributed robotic cooperative obstacle avoidance method with independent virtual center points which are set based on the current state of nearby robots and itself. Mobile robots use two different control modes: an obstacle-free mode, and an obstacle-avoidance mode. The control mode is switched on-line, based on the robot’s states which are shared information. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of mobile robots in the system of the proposed method. A control law is designed to guide the mobile robots to away from potential collisions and avoid congestion with other robots. The stability of the system is proved using a Lyapunov function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using simulation studies and also real-world experimental verification. Experimental results show that the proposed method enables mobile robots to not only avoid collision with each other, but also significantly reduces the travel time and travel distance for situations with irregular distributions of multiple robots.},

  abstract     = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is becoming a growing concern worldwide. Parents are often not aware of the different nature of children with ASD and attempt to treat him/her the same way as other children. However, that causes more and more isolation of such children from the social interactions around them, resulting in more secluded and people-phobic behaviors. Nevertheless, similar to other children, children with ASD also like to play with toys. This observation has led to the use of toys in a way that mere playful activities could become sources of learning and skill-building, somewhat serving or assisting in the role of a human teacher. Robots have been observed to be fascinating for all children and compensating for a human companion to a certain extent. In this paper, a short study has been presented involving a humanoid robot programmed for a number of teaching and therapeutic behaviors, such as exercises, singing, explaining, and playing with children. Tests were performed on a small group of 15 children with ASD (ages 7–11) using these activities at a local school for children with special needs for a number of weeks. The objective of the study was to quantify the improvement in a number of behavior and learning parameters when children performed the activities with NAO robot present with the teacher, as opposed to the same type of activities performed by the teacher alone. The performance improvement was quantified in terms of the NAO robot activity as independent variable, and following dependent behavioral variables observed from the responses of children: (a) number of trials, (b) activity response time, (c) response type, and (d) behavior retention. Quantified findings from these tests are reported in this paper against average performance values (based on teachers and psychologists’ evaluation). The results of the study have been found to be very encouraging which demonstrates the capability of robotic toys to improve the learning process for children with ASD. The results of this study also encourage the low-cost development and usage of such robotic toy systems for teaching and therapeutic applications that help such children to become better members of society.},

Secondly, an adaptive extended state observer (ESO) is developed not only to estimate the unmeasured states but also to eliminate the impact of the unknown disturbances and parameter uncertainties. Moreover, the problem of stochastic stability analysis for the estimated error system is also discussed. An adaptive ESO-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode control(NTSMC) is then presented by using Lyapunov synthesis.

This work presents a technique that guarantees collision avoidance in an environment containing multiple agents. These agents can be of different types such as static, dynamic obstacles and other robots. The technique supports parallel implementation and is appropriate for real-time applications. In this work, the theory of interval arithmetic is used to represent the pose of agents as intervals in a fixed time period. Geometrically, the intervals correspond to finite-length arcs and line-segments. Theoretical results on the inclusion of one interval, in another interval, in terms of sub-intervals are derived. Breaking down the problem in sub-intervals supports parallelism in performing multiple interval inclusion tests and in handling multiple agents. The proposed interval-arithmetic based framework leads directly to a hardware-efficient collision detection scheme. In particular, the proposed strategy admits a solution even for a dynamic environment using just shift and add capability, an important aspect for embedded implementation. The solution of interval inclusion is also used to find a set of solutions for guaranteed collision avoidance with multiple agents with known or unknown trajectories. Simulation results in MATLAB and experiments with an FPGA-driven differential drive mobile robot demonstrate the versatility of the proposed approach.},

Such a system is expected to be advantageous over manual operation in fuel consumption, tire wear, road surface damage and ease of taking off on slippery surfaces. An auto lift/drop algorithm in the form of a State Transition Diagram (STM) was developed to meet these requirements and has been implemented in the developed HIL simulation system that contains mechanical, pneumatic, electrical and control elements and a TruckMaker simulation model. In the HIL simulator, the electronic control unit (ECU) operated as if it is working in the real truck. Comprehensive scenarios can be generated and executed in this HIL simulation environment to test the algorithm and the set-up itself before the more expensive and time consuming experimental verification with a real truck. This approach allowed the lift axle automation algorithm and hardware to be tested fully in a safe lab environment where the algorithm could be improved and optimized Results of the HIL simulation verified the advantages of such an automated lift axle lifting and dropping system over manually operated axle dropping systems.

Demonstrated positional and force skills are learned to both discriminate the skill levels of users and produce LbG forces. Force information is obtained from virtual forces, which developed based on real computed tomography (CT) data, rather than force sensors. A femur bone drilling simulation is developed to provide a practice environment for orthopaedic residents. The residents are provided with haptic feedback that enable them to feel the variable stiffness of bone layers. The X-ray views of the bone are also presented to them for better tracking of a pre-defined path inside the bone. The simulation is capable of planning a drill path, generating X-rays based on user defined orientation, and recording motion data for user assessment and skill modeling. The knowledge of expert surgeons is also incorporated into the simulation to provide LbG forces for improving the unpredictable motions of the residents. To discriminate the skill level of users, machine learning tools are used to develop surgical expert and resident models. In addition, to improve residents performance, the expert HCRF is used to generate adaptive LbG forces regarding the similarities between residents motions and the expert model. Experimental results show that the learning-based approach is able to assess the skill of users and improve residents performance.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle lane-changing and overtaking are fundamental technology in autonomous driving. This paper proposes an approach that combines guidance navigation and image based visual detection for road following and overtaking maneuver. Two critical issues are considered: Firstly, it is suggested to design a robust constrained road following based line of sight guidance in the presence of unknown time-varying sideslip angle and under unknown dynamic model. Secondly, to trigger the autonomous overtaking manoeuvre. An overtaking procedure is defined as a high-priority task while the road following as a low-priority task. The objective is then to properly switching between the two guidance modes according to the camera vision reading. The adopted control strategy consists of a constrained along and cross-track control law and a nonlinear RISE control law. The closed-loop dynamics of both kinematic errors and the dynamical errors are analyzed in detail using nonlinear interconnected systems theory and the overall system is shown to be input to state stable (ISS). The proposed approach for road following and overtaking are validated in simulations.},

  abstract     = {Dealing with the physical interaction between humans and robots, Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) are identified as one solution to overcome many limits, such as reducing contact forces or detect collisions. Nevertheless, the low-damping dynamic of a SEA can lead to undesired behaviours, especially during particular applications where a high level of precision is required. In this paper, a linear control architecture to enhance the damping performance of a SEA is presented. The proposed structure consists in a cascade control where loops are regulated using three types of controllers: PI, PD and a generalized controller specifically designed to damp oscillations. A frequency-domain approach with related constraints could not satisfy the time-domain goal in term of oscillation damping, for this reason an optimization problem able to consider them both is taken into account. A robust design is mandatory to the model mismatch introduced by neglecting coupling between motor. Therefore, robustness constraints are introduced in the optimization procedure. Indeed, the effectiveness of the control architecture is tested on a real compliant robot with six degrees of freedom equipped with as many SEAs. Each test aims to highlight the damping performance of the controlled system while the robot performs various tasks or it is subject to external disturbances.},

We show that the trained stochastic kinetic model gives equally good results as the trained Hodgkin-Huxley model, while we gain on more concise mathematical description of the training procedure. The trained stochastic kinetic model of neuron is tested in solving the problem of approximation, where for the approximated function the membrane potential obtained using different models of a biological neuron was chosen. Additionally, we present a simple application, in which the trained models of neuron connected with the outputs of a recurrent neural network form a system, which is used to calculate the Euler angles of an object’s position in space, based on linear and angular acceleration, direction and the magnitude of Earth’s magnetic field.},

However, when the camera is far from the wall-climbing robot (e.g., 20 m), these markers become extremely blurred and difficult to detect. In this paper, a convolutional neural network-based positioning scheme comprised of a global bounding box detector and local wheel detector is proposed. The light-weight local wheel detector can quickly and accurately detect the four wheel points of a distant wall-climbing robot, and the detected wheel points can be used for calculating its position and direction angle. Our wheel detector has a single-frame processing time of 72.2 ms on a CPU and 7.1 ms on a GPU, where the latter meets the real-time positioning requirements of the wall-climbing robot. We also developed an efficient cost function for wheel matching between video frames. Simulation results and multiple test videos confirmed that the proposed cost function can match wheels between video frames perfectly. The high performance of this positioning system indicates that it may be used in a variety of industrial applications.},

This ability is called Navigation and is performed in a two- or three-dimensional fashion, except for cases where the robot is neither a ground vehicle nor articulated (e.g. robotics arms). The planning part of navigation comprises a global planner, suitable for generating a path from an initial to a target pose, and a local planner tasked with traversing the aforementioned path while dealing with environmental, sensorial and motion uncertainties. However, the task of selecting the optimal global and/or local planner combination is quite hard since no research provides insight on which is best regarding the domain and planner limitations. In this context, current work performs a comparative analysis on qualitative and quantitative aspects of the most common ROS-enabled global and local planners for robots operating in two-dimensional static environments, on the basis of mission-centered and planner-related metrics, optimality and traversability aspects, as well as non-measurable aspects, such as documentation quality, parameterisability, ease of use, etc.},

With the advent of Machine Learning (ML), recent advancements in intelligent techniques for the domain of robot communications have led to improved functionality in robot assemblies, ability to take informed and coordinated decisions, and an overall improvement in efficiency of the entire swarm. This survey is targeted towards a comprehensive study of the convergence of ML and communication for collaborative assemblies of robots operating in the space, on the ground and in underwater environments. We identify the pertinent issues that arise in the case of robot swarms like preventing collisions, keeping connectivity between robots, maintaining the communication quality, and ensuring collaboration between robots. ML techniques that have been applied for improving different criteria such as mobility, connectivity, Quality of Service (QoS) and efficient data collection for energy efficiency are then discussed from the viewpoint of their importance in the case of collaborative robot assemblies.

  abstract     = {In the kinematic design of wearable exoskeletons, the issue of axis misalignments between the human and the exoskeleton joints should be well dealt with. Otherwise, large physical human-robot interaction (p-HRI) forces may occur at the human-robot interfaces, which makes the p-HRI uncomfortable or even unsafe. To cope with this issue, a kinematically compatible design approach of wearable exoskeletons has been investigated by researchers, and great development has been made in recent years. Moreover, the influence of such a design on the exoskeleton’s p-HRI performance should be evaluated to determine if the design is feasible. In this paper, a self-adapting lower-limb exoskeleton mechanism for three degrees of freedom gait training is proposed, and the mechanical structure of the exoskeleton mechanism is designed in detail. Then, based on the presented exoskeleton mechanism and the use of suitable force/torque sensors, a p-HRI force measurement system is developed. Subsequently, the p-HRI forces of the human-robot closed chain under the static and motion modes are detected, and the influence of the self-adapting design on the lower-limb exoskeleton mechanism’s p-HRI force feature is evaluated. The results indicate that additional human-robot connective joints could reduce the p-HRI force significantly, the compatible design of the exoskeleton mechanism is effective, and is thus applied to human lower-limb gait training.},

In comparison with the typical foraging tasks, our work focuses on the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem in the exploration and destruction domain, where a team of robots is required to cooperatively search for targets hidden in the environment and attempt to destroy them. As usual, robots have the prior knowledge about the suspicious locations they need to explore but they don’t know the distribution of interested targets. So the destruction task is dynamically generated along with the execution of exploration task. Each robot has different strike ability and each target has uncertain anti-strike ability, which means either the robot or target is likely to be damaged in the destruction task according to that whose ability is higher. The above setting significantly increases the complexity of exploration and destruction problem. The auction-based approach, vacancy chain approach and a deep Q-learning approach based on strategy-level selection are employed in this paper to deal with this problem. A new simulation system based on Robot Operating System and Gazebo is specially built for this MRTA problem. Subsequently, extensive simulation results are provided to show that all proposed approaches are able to solve the MRTA problem in exploration and destruction domain. In addition, experimental results are further analyzed to show that each method has its own advantages and disadvantages.},

Firstly, a kinematics model with constraint relationship of the FM-OMR is established. On the basis of the kinematics model, the kinematics trajectory tracking error model of the FM-OMR is further formulated. Then, it is transformed into a constrained quadratic programming(QP) problem by the method of MPC. In addition, aiming at the speed deficiencies of conventional neural networks in QP solving, a delayed neural network (DNN) is applied to solve the optimal solution of the QP problem, and compared with the Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN) to show the rapidity of the DNN. Finally, two simulation cases considering bounded random disturbance are provided to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel technique is presented to test the flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle autonomously in a real-world scenario using a data-driven technique without intervening with its onboard software. With the growing applications of such vehicles, testing of autonomous flight is a very important task for rapid deployment. There are different tools for modeling and simulating unmanned vehicles in virtual worlds such as Gazebo, MATLAB, Simulink, and Webots to name a few. None of these simulation tools are able to model all possible physical parameters of a real-world environment. Hence, the flight controller or mission planning software has to be tested in the physical world in the presence of an expert before deployment for a specific task. A Perception Inference Engine evaluation tool is presented that can infer internal states of the autonomous system from external observations only. The Gazebo simulation platform is used to collect data to develop the perception model. For real-time data collection, a VICON motion capture system is used to observe the autonomous flight of a small unmanned aerial vehicle. A state-of-the-art decision tree algorithm is used to implement the data-driven approach. The technique was tested using simulation data and verified with real-time data from Intel Aero Ready to Fly and Parrot AR. 2.0 drones. Moreover, we analyzed the robustness of the proposed system by introducing noise in sensor measurement and ambiguity in the testing scenario. We compared the performance of the decision tree classifier with Naïve bayes and support vector machine classifiers. It is shown that the developed system can be used for the performance evaluation of a UAV operating in the physical world by significantly reducing uncertainty in mission failure due to environmental parameters.},

The first contribution extends the authors’ prior work in single-robot exact occupancy grid mapping and autonomous exploration in a 2D environment to mapping and exploring in a 3D environment. The proposed 3D occupancy grid map is computed efficiently using an inverse sensor model that accounts for the sensor uncertainty, where we propose how several measurement sources may be fused together by considering depth readings individually. This approach is scalable to larger and more complex scenarios for real-time mapping. Furthermore, this paper shows how important aspects of a 3D map representing a structured environment are projected onto a 2D occupancy grid map, where an autonomous exploration algorithm is designed to select robotic motions that maximize map information gain. The mapping and exploration algorithms are demonstrated with an experiment where a quadrotor autonomously maps and explores an initially-uncertain environment. The second contribution is a novel approach to multi-vehicle cooperative patrol of environments based on map uncertainty. We propose a cooperative autonomous exploration algorithm, which applies a bidding-based framework to coordinate robotic efforts for improving occupancy grid map information gain. Since these exploration approaches are based on probabilistic knowledge about the map, the 3D occupancy grid map is systematically degraded over time to encourage the robots to revisit regions as time passes, thereby patrolling the environment. Furthermore, using a Bayesian framework and receding horizons, the algorithm is robust to dynamic obstacles within the mapping space. The efficacy of the proposed multi-vehicle cooperative patrol is illustrated with a simulation involving three robots patrolling a large floor plan with a non-cooperative person walking around the space.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we design an optimal control system for a quadrotor to carry a cable-suspended load flying through a window. As the window is narrower than the length of the cable, it is very challenging to design a practical control system to pass through it. Our solution includes a system identification component, a trajectory generation component, and a trajectory tracking control component. The exact dynamic model that usually derived from the first principles is assumed to be unavailable. Instead, a model identification approach is adopted, which relies on a simple but effective low order equivalent system (LOES) to describe the core dynamical characteristics of the system. After being excited by some specifically designed manoeuvres, the unknown parameters in the LOES are obtained by using a frequency based least square estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated LOES, a numerical optimization algorithm is then utilized for aggressive trajectory generation when relevant constraints are given. The generated trajectory can lead to the quadrotor and load system passing through a narrow window with a cascade PD trajectory tracking controller. Finally, a practical flight test based on an Astec Hummingbird quadrotor is demonstrated and the result validates the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {In the context of multi-robot system and more generally for Technological System-of-Systems, this paper proposes a multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) framework for SLAM-based cooperative exploration under limited communication bandwidth. The exploration strategy, based on RGB-D grid mapping and group leader decision making, uses a new utility function that takes into account each robot distance in the group from the unexplored set of targets, and allows to simultaneously explore the environment and to get a detailed grid map of specific areas in an optimized manner. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the main novelty is to exchange only the frontier points of the computed local grid map to reduce the shared data volume, and consequently the memory consumption. Moreover, communications constraints are taken into account within a SLAM-based multi-robot collective exploration. In that way, the proposed strategy is also designed to cope with communications drop-out or failures. The multi-UAV system is implemented into ROS and GAZEBO simulators on multiple computers provided with network facilities. Results show that the proposed cooperative exploration strategy minimizes the global exploration time by 25% for 2 UAVs and by 30% for 3 UAVs, while outperforming state-of-the-art exploration strategies based on both random and closest frontiers, and minimizing the average travelled distance by each UAV by 55% for 2 UAVs and by 62% for 3 UAVs. Furthermore, the system performance is also evaluated in a realistic test-bed comprising an infrastructure-less network, which is used to support limited communications. The results of the test-bed show that the proposed exploration strategy uses 10 times less data than a strategy that makes the robots exchanging their whole local maps.},

In this paper, we propose a technique for estimating NLOS biases and measurement noise in distances under multidimensional scaling (MDS) based positioning with fixed nodes. An ideal matrix of pairwise distance measurements exhibits a symmetry that allows to compute mobile node positions from those of fixed ones, and then recompute exactly the fixed node positions from the earlier computed mobile node positions. In a NLOS environment, this symmetry is lost; fixed node positions can not be reproduced exactly. This work exploits the error in the recomputation of fixed node positions for the correction of NLOS biases and noise in the pairwise distances. A constrained-optimization problem is formulated to estimate biases for each measured distance and final mobile node positions under the MDS scheme. A supplementary approach is presented for special cases where the number of mobile nodes is less than 3. Experimental results show that position errors can be reduced by up to 28% for a set up of 4 fixed and 3 mobile nodes. Simulations are used to further validate the results for larger deployments of nodes.},

Differently from typical industrial scenarios, with highly controlled environments, service robots must show an additional robustness to task perturbations and changes in the characteristics of their sensory feedback. In this paper, a robot is taught to perform two different cleaning tasks over a table, using a learning from demonstration paradigm. However, differently from other approaches, a convolutional neural network is used to generalize the demonstrations to different, not yet seen dirt or stain patterns on the same table using only visual feedback, and to perform cleaning movements accordingly. Robustness to robot posture and illumination changes is achieved using data augmentation techniques and camera images transformation. This robustness allows the transfer of knowledge regarding execution of cleaning tasks between heterogeneous robots operating in different environmental settings. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, a network trained in Lisbon to perform cleaning tasks, using the iCub robot, is successfully employed by the DoRo robot in Peccioli, Italy.},

  abstract     = {Many real-world robotic scenarios require performing task planning to decide courses of actions to be executed by (possibly heterogeneous) robots. A classical centralized planning approach has to find a solution inside a search space that contains every possible combination of robots and goals. This leads to inefficient solutions that do not scale well. Multi-Agent Planning (MAP) provides a new way to solve this kind of tasks efficiently. Previous works on MAP have proposed to factorize the problem to decrease the planning effort i.e. dividing the goals among the agents (robots). However, these techniques do not scale when the number of agents and goals grow. Also, in most real world scenarios with big maps, goals might not be reached by every robot so it has a computational cost associated. In this paper we propose a combination of robotics and planning techniques to alleviate and boost the computation of the goal assignment process. We use Actuation Maps (AMs). Given a map, AMs can determine the regions each agent can actuate on. Thus, specific information can be extracted to know which goals can be tackled by each agent, as well as cheaply estimating the cost of using each agent to achieve every goal. Experiments show that when information extracted from AMs is provided to a multi-agent planning algorithm, the goal assignment is significantly faster, speeding-up the planning process considerably. Experiments also show that this approach greatly outperforms classical centralized planning.},

  abstract     = {When model-based controllers are used for carrying out precise tasks, the estimation of model parameters is key for a better trajectory tracking performance. We consider the scenario of a free-flying space robot with limited actuation that has grasped an object of unknown properties. The inertial parameters - mass, centre of mass and the inertia tensor - of the robot-object system are to be determined. In our previous works, we used a parameter estimation algorithm where truncated Fourier series were used to represent both the reference excitation trajectory and the executed one. That algorithm is the focus of this paper, along with a study of the factors that could contribute to a loss of accuracy in the obtained estimates. Simulation results with the Space CoBot free-flyer robot are used to find the causes of the latter: first, a modified version of the minimum condition number criterion is used to generate feasible excitatory trajectories. The results are compared with those given by the maximum information criterion to check for better excitation. Next, an appropriate number of harmonics has to be found for the Fourier series, which will be used to fit the measured data. This is done autonomously, based on the least squares residual. Finally, the relation between input saturation while executing the excitation trajectory and the errors in the resulting parameter estimates is studied.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the design and dynamic simulation of a jumping mechanism for flight initiation in flapping wing aerial vehicles to enhance their autonomous mobility. It is inspired by avian flyers that start flight by jumping using their hind limbs. A 4-bar linkage that performs the prescribed take-off maneuvers has been geometrically designed using dimensional synthesis by motion generation. The kinematic dimensions obtained thereof have been ascertained analytically. A magnetic latching solenoid actuator and its corresponding transmission mechanism has been proposed for jumping actuation due to its compact structure, and low power consumption with no heat nor electrical noise generation. After take-off, the necessity to sustain the aerial vehicle airborne by providing adequate supportive forces at low air speeds has been demonstrated by the prospect of unsteady aerodynamics. Fluid-structure interaction has been analyzed by co-simulation between ADAMSⓇ and MATLABⓇ/Simulink. The designed legs give an inclined take-off of about 64° and an initial speed of almost 2m/s with an angular deflection of 110° between the leg segments. Flight performance indicates an increase in lift/drag ratios with in both flapping rate and forward velocity up to some limit. The results also compared favorably with those from wind tunnel tests and previous analysis of related work. They all exhibited an increase in wing efficiency with decreasing mean angles of attack as the air vehicle approaches stable flight.},

Using our system, caregivers can evaluate and elevate their care levels by themselves. From the FPVs of care sessions taken by wearable cameras worn by caregivers, we obtained the 3D facial distance, pose and eye-contact states between caregivers and receivers by using facial landmark detection and deep neural network (DNN)-based eye contact detection. We applied statistical analysis to these features and developed algorithms that provide scores for tender-care skill. In experiments, we first evaluated the performance of our DNN-based eye contact detection by using eye contact datasets prepared from YouTube videos and FPVs that assume conversational scenes. We then performed skill evaluations by using Humanitude training scenes involving three novice caregivers, two Humanitude experts and seven middle-level students. The results showed that our eye contact detection outperformed existing methods and that our skill evaluations can estimate the care skill levels.},

However vision-based re- identification systems are subject to limitations due to human pose and poor lighting conditions. This paper presents a new re-identification method for service robots using thermal images. In robotic applications, as the number and size of thermal datasets is limited, it is hard to use approaches that require huge amount of training samples. We propose a re-identification system that can work using only a small amount of data. During training, we perform entropy-based sampling to obtain a thermal dictionary for each person. Then, a symbolic representation is produced by converting each video into sequences of dictionary elements. Finally, we train a classifier using this symbolic representation and geometric distribution within the new representation domain. The experiments are performed on a new thermal dataset for human re-identification, which includes various situations of human motion, poses and occlusion, and which is made publicly available for research purposes. The proposed approach has been tested on this dataset and its improvements over standard approaches have been demonstrated.},

Experiments were performed with four distinct user groups (including residents and care staff at a retirement community) to explore the first impressions that the robot created, its perceived usefulness, and the potential for acceptance of the platform. Overall, the robot was positively perceived by each user group, and user feedback from testing generated insights regarding the design, usability and envisioned use-cases of the technology.

The advancement of robotic technologies, especially, in cognitive robotics and sociable human-robot interaction offers a great opportunity for meeting such demand. This paper presents the design and implementation of a next generation of elderly care robot, named as “HomeMate,” based on an innovative undertaking in its sociability and dependability with extensive user studies. The elderlies taken care of by Senior Welfare Centers are chosen as the target sector, for which the following five service scenarios are designed: infotainment, video chatting, game playing, medicine alarm and, in particular, errand services. Unlike conventional approaches, the scenarios are designed here to ensure the overall quality of service by maximizing the synergy under an elderly-caregiver-service robot ecosystem. The unique features implemented in HomeMate include 1) the principle of affordance in appearance design by matching functionality and anthropomorphism indices, 2) the sociability implemented by balancing between autonomy and user controllability as well as by integrating multimodal interactions into HomeMate avatar, and 3) the emphasis on dependability to inspire confidence on HomeMate as a trusted assistant, for which the principle of dependability is proposed and implemented with a cognitive framework. Experiments and user studies strongly support the proposed design principles and verify the dependability in performance.},

  abstract     = {Controlling a drone using head-mounted display induces virtual reality (VR) sickness. From previous research, it is known that angular velocity is one of the contributing factors to induce VR sickness, however for drones, linear motion and the interaction between linear and angular motion often occur during operation. In this research, we investigate the effect of each conditions experimentally and proposes a method of controlling a drone to reduce VR sickness. We designed a system that does not make user’s head fixed at one point but allows to move the head freely. At the same time, the head orientation and direction are synced with the drone’s attitude to reduce sensory conflict. Two controllers were compared: joystick control and head control. We tested with a real system and conducted experiments on subjects to verify its effect. The proposed controller reduced angular velocity in the frequency range 0.1 to 10 Hz where a vestibular system becomes most sensitive, and it is demonstrated that reducing sensory conflict contributes to the reduction of VR sickness.},

  abstract     = {Package delivery services by deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have received considerable attention due to their significant potential benefits. One of the scenarios making the concept more attractive is to deploy large numbers of UAVs to properly handle increasing demands for the service by the units. However, it is challenging because it increases the difficulty of UAV control as well as the complexity of the scheduling problems involved in the service. To tackle the issues, we propose a systematic approach that decomposes a service area into several disjoint zones. Within a zone, a single UAV at most can be operated. To verify the advantages and performance of the proposed approach, we first optimize the zoning, i.e. a service area decomposition, applying Genetic Algorithm (GA). We then evaluate the service level of the package deliveries by UAVs under the proposed approach using a simulation model.},

The new platform composed of four proposed wheels is specified to avoid halting, to increase traction force and to adjust body orientation while interacting soft or composite terrains. The soil contact model (SCM), extended from Bekker’s theory is implemented to derive the wheel-soil interaction formulations. Furthermore, the Lagrange approach is used to derive the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) dynamics including interaction forces. The best configurations of adjustable wheel are tabulated according to the terrain properties and the motion types. Finally, the proposed UGV is compared with a typical ordinary UGV to investigate traction forces and halting avoidance. Based on the simulation results and primary tests of the experimental setup, it can be inferred that this new mechanism can effectively adapt itself to different terrain conditions in order to pass the soft concave regions, climb the soft obstacles and move on the composite terrains.},

As the strategy for each state is implemented by a corresponding formation control, a synergy control law is also designed for multiple underwater robots. In the design of the pursuit strategy, the definition of encirclement is put forward for the underwater robots. Furthermore, the proof that a point is encircled by other points on the plane is given. To solve the problem of the concealment in the tracking and the pursuit, a semicircular pursuit strategy and a circular pursuit strategy are also proposed. Finally, based on this pursuit strategy, the simulation of whole process is carried out with the MOOS(Mission Oriented Operating Suite) platform, and the effectiveness of the semicircular and circular pursuit strategy are verified by lake experiment with practical robots. The results of simulation and lake experiment prove that this pursuit strategy can realize synergy tracking and pursuit for a single moving target under the given conditions.},

The considered system is an underwater manipulator with n-degrees of freedom. The approximation capability of an adaptive neural network is exploited to estimate uncertainties in system dynamics. Drag and lift forces are considered as an external disturbance, and a disturbance observer approach which has been proved to be effective with on-land robotic systems, is applied to compensate for it. The objective of the controller designed is to track a desired trajectory. To find the optimal gain parameters of this controller, a classical Genetic Algorithm is employed. Extensive simulation studies carried out on a two degrees of freedom manipulator indicate the efficacy of the proposed approach, proving that the disturbance observer originally developed for on-land systems can also be used effectively for underwater robotic systems. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller, tuned by the Genetic Algorithm is compared with that of a controller, tuned manually. The results show that the reliance on a well-known classic Genetic Algorithm for the tuning of the controller parameters not only saves time, but also provides better values of the parameters.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the design of a Fault Tolerant Control scheme for an omni-directional mobile robot with four mecanum wheels. We consider actuation faults in which the wheels are not able to receive commands, but still can rotate freely due to the friction with the ground. A Non-linear Model Predictive Controller is employed, in order to appropriately exploit the inherited actuation redundancy of the omni-directional robot, and provide on the fly a unified accommodation solution for multiple combinations of actuation faults. A basic Fault Detection and Isolation scheme is responsible for identifying and isolate the faulty wheels. Accordingly, the control input vector and consequently the dynamic model of the vehicle are reformulated depending on the identified faults. Hence, the predictive control scheme is dynamically updated and calculates the optimal actuation solution, given the faults occurred. The proposed scheme, is able to guide the vehicle to any goal configuration within the workspace, while simultaneously satisfying state (e.g obstacle avoidance) and input (e.g motor limits) constraints. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is evaluated via a set of realistic simulation scenarios, where an omni-directional mobile robot executes a way point tracking mission with obstacle avoidance, inside a restricted workspace and in the presence of different combinations of actuation faults.},

The information on the signal is only based on noisy measurements of its strength collected during the mission and the signal is considered to be weak and indistinguishable from the noise in a large portion of the environment. The goal of the team is thus to search for a reliable signal and finally converge to the source location. An accurate estimation of the signal gradient is obtained by fusing the data gathered by the robots while moving in a circular formation. The algorithm proposed to steer the formation, called Gradient-biased Correlated Random Walk (GCRW), exploits the gradient estimation to bias a correlated random walk, which ensures an efficient non-oriented search motion when far from the source. The resulting strategy is so able to obtain a suitable trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Results obtained in simulated experiments, including comparisons with possible alternatives, are presented to analyze and evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.},

The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform this activity reduces soil compaction, compared to the use of heavy machinery, and helps to reduce the waste of these artificial substances through a punctual and self-regulating application. This work proposes an entire guiding system for use on UAVs (hardware and software) based on image processing techniques. The software part consists of two algorithms. The first algorithm is the Crop Row Detection which is responsible for the correct identification of the crop rows. The second algorithm is the Line Filter that is responsible for generating the driving parameters sent to the flight controller. In the field experiments performed on the proposed hardware, the algorithm achieved a detection rate of 100% of the crop rows for images with resolutions above 320 × 240. The system performance was measured in laboratory experiments and reached 31.22 FPS for images with small resolution, 320 × 240, and 1.63 FPS for the highest resolution, 1920 × 1080. The main contribution of this work is the design and development of an entire embedded guidance system composed of a hardware and software architectures. Other contributions are: the proposed filter for the image pretreatment; the filter to remove the false positive lines; and the algorithm for generating the guiding parameters based on detected crop rows.},

The algorithm increases the ability of aircraft operations to complete mission goals by enabling fast collision avoidance of multiple obstacles. The new algorithm, which we have named Fast Geometric Avoidance algorithm (FGA), combines geometric avoidance of obstacles and selection of a critical avoidance start time based on kinematic considerations, collision likelihood, and navigation constraints. In comparison to a current way-point generation method, FGA showed a 90% of reduction in computational time for the same obstacle avoidance scenario. Using this algorithm, the UAS is able to avoid static and dynamic obstacles while still being able to recover its original trajectory after successful collision avoidance. Simulations for different mission scenarios show that this method is much more efficient at avoiding multiple obstacles than previous methods. Algorithm effectiveness validation is provided with Monte Carlo simulations and flight missions in an aircraft simulator. FGA was also tested on a fixed-wing aircraft with successful results. Because this algorithm does not have specific requirements on the sensor data types it can be applied to cooperative and non-cooperative intruders.},

Traditionally, run-time technical reliability assessment is not considered for risk areas determination. Run-time definition and online control of risk areas based on current technical reliability may be used as a function to assure safe behavior of autonomous or semi-autonomous aerial systems. This contribution introduces a novel technique for the definition and control of risk areas considering system’s behavior as well as it’s technical reliability during run-time. The technique is used to separate the space around an autonomous aerial system into risk-related areas. On this basis, the safety unit can realize emergency actions to ensure system’s safe behavior if necessary. The introduction of the novel technique is realized in the context of the safety unit description and run-time technical reliability assessment. For the run-time technical reliability assessment, a novel technique is introduced, inspired by the functional safety standard IEC 61508.

It is a two-dimensional location-based map that quantifies the risk to the population on ground of flight operations over a specified area. The risk map is generated through a probabilistic approach and combines several layers, including population density, sheltering factor, no-fly zones, and obstacles. Each element of the risk map has associated a risk value that quantifies the risk of flying over a specific location. Risk values are defined by a risk assessment process using different uncontrolled descent events, drone parameters, environmental characteristics, as well as uncertainties on parameters. The risk map is able to quantify the risk of large areas, such as urban environments, and allows for easy identification of high and low-risk locations. The map is a tool for informed decision making, and our results report some examples of risk map with different aircraft in a realistic urban environment.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the design of a parcel delivery system using drones, which includes the strategic planning of the system and operational planning for a given region. The amount of payload affects the battery consumption rate (BCR), which can cause a disruption in delivery of goods if the BCR was under-estimated in the planning stage or cause unnecessarily higher expenses if it was over-estimated. Hence, a reliable parcel delivery schedule using drones is proposed to consider the BCR as a function of payload in the operational planning optimization. A minimum set covering approach is used to model the strategic planning and a mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP) is used for operational planning. A variable preprocessing algorithm and primal and dual bound generation methods are developed to improve the computational time for solving the operational planning model. The optimal solution provides the least number of drones and their flight paths to deliver parcels while ensuring the safe return of the drones with respect to the battery charge level. Experimental data show that the BCR is a linear function of the payload amount. The results indicate the impact of including the BCR in drone scheduling, 3 out of 5 (60%) flight paths are not feasible if the BCR is not considered. The numerical results show that the sequence of visiting customers impacts the remaining charge.},

The designed control system rejects the disturbances to the attitude dynamics of the hexacopter which are mainly caused by the motion of the robot arm. For this purpose, Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) is implemented and its disturbance rejection capabilities are investigated. The equations of motion of the hexacopter with a two degree-of-freedom robot arm are derived by using the Newton-Euler approach. Flight tests are utilized to compare the performance of the third order ADRC with that of the cascaded PID (P-PID) controller which is one of the mostly used controllers in commercial multicopter systems. In addition, second and the third order ADRC performances are compared as well. Regulatory and disturbance rejection characteristics of the hexacopter are compared using several performance criteria. It is shown that third order ADRC has a better performance when disturbance acts in both the roll and pitch axes.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel mechanism for the control of a wheeled robot maneuvering with a single actuator. Elements of snakeboard and two-wheeled skateboard propulsion are applied to the design. Two passive wheels, i.e., casters whose orientation can be controlled, are attached in the back and front of the robot body, and a rotor rotates above the body to induce body propulsion using its counter torque. Three degrees of freedom of motion, i.e., the orientation of the rotor and each of the two casters, are mechanically coupled to the single actuator via a torque limiter. The stoppers are set to restrict the angle of the caster orientation, and a torque limiter allows the rotor to continue rotating without being affected by the stopper’s restriction to the range of motion. Experiments demonstrate that the sinusoidal rotor rotation can propel this robot forward and that adding the increasing or decreasing offset to the sinusoidal rotor rotation can curve the robot’s motion. Next, a method to position the robot at a specified goal position is proposed, assuming that the current position of the robot is detectable in every control cycle. This method adjusts the rate of increase or decrease of the offset in sinusoidal rotor rotation depending on the direction of the goal position. Introducing the motion capture system enables the robot to successfully reach the specified goal positions.},

  abstract     = {Patrolling an environment with multiple robots is a problem with applicability to both military activities and other areas requiring security. In an adversarial environment, wireless communication between the robots may be jammed, and their sensor ranges may be limited to visibility. This increases the difficulty of the problem, but solutions will be widely applicable regardless of the environment. Robot paths that are deterministic can be observed and predicted by an adversary, permitting exploitation of known gaps in coverage. We also wish to avoid requirements for synchronization or a particular form of the environment. We, therefore, propose a method of finding patrolling policies for multiple robots that monitor any polygonal environment using limited visibility regions and non-deterministic patrolling paths. First, visibility regions are calculated for a subset of locations that cover the whole environment or a part of the environment. Then, we find distributed patrolling policies in the form of Markov chains, using convex optimization to minimize the average expected commute time for the subset of the locations permitting each robot to cover the whole environment independently. We also find centralized and Markov chain based patrolling policies that minimize the average expected commute time for the subset of locations permitting each robot to cover a part of the environment while communicating with a central base station. Finally, we evaluate the vulnerability of our patrolling policies by finding the probability of capturing an adversary and the maximum unguarded time for a location in our proposed patrolling scenarios. We present multiple simulation results and a physical implementation to show the effectiveness of our visibility-based non-deterministic patrolling method.},

One of the major challenges facing such technology is the existence of a high level of uncertainty in moving objects. In this research study, we chose to work with object’s classification and probabilistic models to deal with the system’s uncertainty. First, a classification takes place through detecting an object, identifying it using a trained convolutional neural network, and analyzing its velocity. Afterwards, a Bayesian probabilistic model takes inputs of the detected object’s type, orientation, and velocity along with the host unmanned aerial vehicle’s velocity. It gives an output of the detected object’s space occupancy. The simulation results show that the space occupancy clearly changes with respect to the available inputs of the Bayesian model as a function of time; hence, optimizing the space occupancy around the detected object.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a learning model-free control method is proposed for accurate trajectory tracking and safe landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). A realistic scenario is considered where the UAV commutes between stations at high-speeds, experiences a single motor failure while surveying an area, and thus requires to land safely at a designated secure location. The proposed challenge is viewed solely as a control problem. A hybrid control architecture – an artificial neural network (ANN)-assisted proportional-derivative controller – is able to learn the system dynamics online and compensate for the error generated during different phases of the considered scenario: fast and agile flight, motor failure, and safe landing. Firstly, it deals with unmodelled dynamics and operational uncertainties and demonstrates superior performance compared to a conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller during fast and agile flight. Secondly, it behaves as a fault-tolerant controller for a single motor failure case in a coaxial hexacopter thanks to its proposed sliding mode control theory-based learning architecture. Lastly, it yields reliable performance for a safe landing at a secure location in case of an emergency condition. The tuning of weights is not required as the structure of the ANN controller starts to learn online, each time it is initialised, even when the scenario changes – thus, making it completely model-free. Moreover, the simplicity of the neural network-based controller allows for the implementation on a low-cost low-power onboard computer. Overall, the real-time experiments show that the proposed controller outperforms the conventional controller.},

  abstract     = {Target location using UAV equipped with vision system has played an important role in many applications but there remain challenges. One of the principal difficulties is to position a target with a high accuracy, particularly in some specific conditions. There are many factors impacting location accuracies, such as turret setup process, sensors intrinsic properties, movement noise and GPS data precision. The most common and notable factors are the movement noise and sensors noise, which are tricky to be eliminated or compensated. Solutions to dealing with noise are mainly from methods such as recursive least square method, least square and Kalman filtering methods. But these routine methods will meet their bottlenecks when locating some plane based targets, a common scenario in target location applications. In this case, the usual methods are subject to target pointing bias of line of sight owing to the specific geometric condition. To eliminate this kind of location bias, an improved Monte Carlo method is proposed in this paper which first estimates the bias of pointing deviation for each measurement with statistical methods and then subtracts the estimated biases in a variance optimization process. Relevant experiments are conducted showing an obvious advantage of the proposed method over the other methods.},

In this regard, the velocity obstacle concept is considered as avoiding constraint for the employed receding horizon method in the motion planning unite and the proposed optimization problem is solved by the mixed integer linear programming approach. Along with the aforementioned unite, the impedance methodology is employed in order to control the Haptic device as the master controller. For the sake of tuning the controller parameters and alleviating the plausible oscillations in the control states, the oscillation number index is utilized. The obtained experimental and simulation results reveal the fact that the proposed algorithm in the fully autonomous manner outperforms its prior counterparts such as conventional potential field with genetic algorithm.

  abstract     = {Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has been popularly utilized for solving Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. Essentially, it requires the accurate system model and known noise statistic. Nevertheless, this condition can be satisfied in simulation case. Hence, EKF has to be enhanced when it is applied in the real-application. Mainly, this improvement is known as adaptive-based approach. In many different cases, it is indicated by some manners of estimating for either part or full noise statistic. This paper present a proposed method based on the adaptive-based solution used for improving classical EKF namely An Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter. Initially, the classical EKF was improved based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) Creation. It aims to equips the conventional EKF with ability of approximating noise statistic and its covariance matrices recursively. Moreover, EKF was modified and improved to tune the estimated values given by MLE and EM creation. Besides that, the recursive noise statistic estimators were also estimated based on the unbiased estimation. Although it results high quality solution but it is followed with some risks of non-positive definite matrices of the process and measurement noise statistic covariances. Thus, an addition of Innovation Covariance Estimation (ICE) was also utilized to depress this possibilities. The proposed method is applied for solving SLAM problem of autonomous wheeled mobile robot. Henceforth, it is termed as AEKF-SLAM Algorithm. In order to validate the effectiveness of proposed method, some different SLAM-Based algorithm were compared and analyzed. The different simulation has been showing that the proposed method has better stability and accuracy compared to the conventional filter in term of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Estimated Map Coordinate (EMC) and Estimated Path Coordinate (EPC).},

In this work we focus on the categorization of real-world object point clouds to particular shape types. Therein surface description and representation of object shape structure have significant influence on shape categorization accuracy, when dealing with real-world scenes featuring noisy, partial and occluded object observations. An unsupervised hierarchical learning procedure is utilized here to symbolically describe surface characteristics on multiple semantic levels. Furthermore, a constellation model is proposed that hierarchically decomposes objects. The decompositions are described as constellations of symbols (shape motifs) in a gradual order, hence reflecting shape structure from local to global, i.e., from parts over groups of parts to entire objects. The combination of this multi-level description of surfaces and the hierarchical decomposition of shapes leads to a representation which allows to conceptualize shapes. An object discrimination has been observed in experiments with seven categories featuring instances with sensor noise, occlusions as well as inter-category and intra-category similarities. Experiments include the evaluation of the proposed description and shape decomposition approach, and comparisons to Fast Point Feature Histograms, a Vocabulary Tree and a neural network-based Deep Learning method. Furthermore, experiments are conducted with alternative datasets which analyze the generalization capability of the proposed approach.},

Normally it is difficult to be applied in outdoor situations due to variability and complexity of the environment. In this paper, we propose an approach in which an agent is trained by hybrid-supervised deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to perform a person following task in end-to-end manner. The approach enables the robot to learn features autonomously from monocular images and to enhance performance via robot-environment interaction. Experiments show that the proposed approach is adaptive to complex situations with significant illumination variation, object occlusion, target disappearance, pose change, and pedestrian interference. In order to speed up the training process to ensure easy application of DRL to real-world robotic follower controls, we apply an integration method through which the agent receives prior knowledge from a supervised learning (SL) policy network and reinforces its performance with a value-based or policy-based (including actor-critic method) DRL model. We also utilize an efficient data collection approach for supervised learning in the context of person following. Experimental results not only verify the robustness of the proposed DRL-based person following robot system, but also indicate how easily the robot can learn from mistakes and improve performance.},

A control strategy for load-carrying exoskeleton was presented in this paper, which maintained the consistency of body ZMP and exoskeleton ZMP. This control strategy could reduce body-exoskeleton interference while maintaining the stability of walking. In this paper, we firstly introduced the experimental environment and the ZMP detection method, and then designed a computational model of the body-exoskeleton interaction force and evaluation criterion for gait stability.

When humans are in the control loop, we can linearize the Euler angles such that they have direct relation with the joint angles and they are also decoupled. So the Jacobian matrix and the inverse kinematics are not needed. We simplify the admittance control using the Euler angles. The stability of those controllers is proven. The experiments, with a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) pan and tilt robot and a four-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton, show that our Euler angles based controllers are simple and effective.},

It offers wide range of applications in civilian and military environment, carrying out dangerous missions that manned aircraft cannot offer. Currently, an important challenge is the collision avoidance algorithm. The idea is to use the collision avoidance algorithm to control the multi-UAV systems. This will guarantee the safety of the UAVs. The UAVs will complete the missions without colliding with any moving or static obstacles. This topic has motivated the development of various collision avoidance algorithms. In this paper, we proposed some improvements on the three-dimensional velocity obstacle algorithm proposed in Jenie et al. (J. Guid. Control Dyn. 39(10), 2312–2323 25). Our improvements are threefold. First, we indicate the limitations of the original 3D collision avoidance method and present the modifications on the algorithm. Second, we develop the velocity obstacle method to be capable of handling cube obstacles in 3D space. Third, a real flight test is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed three-dimensional velocity obstacle method.},

This work presents robust navigation algorithms for multi-agent fixed-wing aircraft based on an adaptive moving mesh partial differential equations controlled by the free energy heat flow equation. Guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for control of multi-agent unmanned aerial system (UASs) were validated through actual flight tests, and the robustness of these algorithms were also investigated using different aircraft platforms. The verification and validation flight tests were conducted using two different fixed-wing platforms: A DG808 sail-plane with a 4m wingspan T-tail configuration and a Skyhunter aircraft utilizing a 2.4m wingspan and a twin-boom configuration. The developed swarm navigation algorithm uses a virtual leader guidance scheme and has been implemented and optimized using optimal control theory. Multi-scale moving point guidance has been developed and complimented by a linear quadratic regulator controller. Several flight tests have been successfully conducted and a system of systems including software and hardware was successfully validated and verified.},

  abstract     = {Safety in the operations of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) depends on the current and future reduction of technical barriers and on the improvements related to their autonomous capabilities. Since the early stages, aviation has been based on pilots and Air Traffic Controllers that take decisions to make aircraft follow their routes while avoiding collisions. RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) can still involve pilots as they are UAVs controlled from ground, but need the definition of common rules, of a dedicated Traffic Controller and exit strategies in the case of lack of communication between the Ground Control Station and the aircraft. On the other hand, completely autonomous aircraft are currently banned from civil airspace, but researchers and engineers are spending great effort in developing methodologies and technologies to increase the reliability of fully autonomous flight in view of a safe and efficient integration of UAVs in the civil airspace. This paper deals with the design of a collision avoidance system based on a Distributed Model Predictive Controller (DMPC) for trajectory tracking, where anticollision constraints are defined in accordance with the Right of Way rules, as prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for human piloted flights. To reduce the computational burden, the DMPC is formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming optimization problem. Simulation results are shown to prove the effectiveness of the approach, also in the presence of a densely populated airspace.},

The developed decentralized adaptive controller employs a consensus algorithm based on connected graphs to ensure that the estimated mass from every agent adds up-to the actual mass of the payload and each agent gets an equal share of the payload’s mass. Our controller ensures that all quadcopters asymptotically converge to a constant reference velocity. It also ensures that all of the forces applied to the payload converges to desired set-points. Desired thrusts and attitude angles are computed from the control algorithms and a low-level PD controller is implemented to track the desired commands for each quadcopter.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new decentralized algorithm for the deployment and reconfiguration of a multi-agent formation in a convex bounded polygonal area when considering several outgoing agents. The system is deployed over a two-dimensional convex bounded area, each agent being driven by its own linear model predictive controller. At each time instant, the area is partitioned into Voronoi cells associated with each agent. Due to the movement of the agents, this partition is time-varying. The objective of the proposed algorithm is to drive the agents into a static configuration based on the Chebyshev center of each Voronoi cell. When some agents present a non-cooperating behavior (e.g. agents required for a different mission, faulty agents, etc.), they have to leave the formation by tracking a reference outside the system’s workspace. The outgoing agents and their objective positions partition the convex bounded polygonal area into working regions. Each remaining agent will track a new objective point allowing it to avoid the trajectory of the outgoing agents. The computation of this objective position is based on the agent’s safety region (i.e. the intersection of the contracted Voronoi cell and the contracted working region). When the outgoing agents have left the workspace, the remaining agents resume their deployment objective. Simulation results on a formation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles are finally presented to validate the algorithm proposed in this paper when several agents leave the formation.},

The proposed framework consists of terrain modeling and multi-UAV trajectory optimization. The terrain modeling process employs a Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surface fitting method based on point cloud information resulting from an airborne LiDAR sensor or other sensor systems. The NURBS-based surface model represents a computationally efficient terrain topology. In the trajectory optimization method, the framework introduces a multi-UAV vehicle routing problem enabling UAV to scan an entire area of interest, and obtains feasible trajectories based on given vehicle performance characteristics, and sensor specifications, and the approximated terrain model. The proposed multi-UAV trajectory optimization algorithm is tested by representative numerical simulations in a realistic aerial imaging environment, namely, San Diego and Death Valley, California.},

The traditional arc-based optimization approaches for the CPP problem cannot accurately estimate actual energy consumption to complete a given mission because they cannot account for turning phases in their model, which may cause non-feasible routes. To solve the limitation of the traditional approaches, this paper introduces a new route-based optimization model with column generation that can trace the amount of energy required for all different mission phases.

In the proposed approach, the design of key UAV parameters including both aerodynamic configurations, (e.g. wing span, sweep angle, chord, taper ratio, cruise speed and angle of attack) and the propulsion systems (e.g. propeller, motor and battery) are cast into an unified optimization problem, where the optimization objective is the design goal (e.g. flight range, endurance). Moreover, practical constraints are naturally incorporated into the design procedures as constraints of the optimization problem. These constraints may arise from the preliminary UAV shape and layout determined by industrial design, weight constraints, etc. The backend of the optimization based UAV design framework are highly accurate aerodynamic models and propulsion system models proposed in this paper and verified by actual experiment data. The optimization framework is inherently non-convex and involves both continuous variables (e.g. the aerodynamic configuration parameters) and discrete variables (e.g. propulsion system combinations). To solve this problem, a novel coordinate descent method is proposed. Trial designs show that the proposed method works rather efficiently, converging in a few iterations. And the returned solution is rather stable with different initial conditions. Finally, the entire approach is applied to design a quadrotor tail-sitter VTOL UAV. The designed UAV is validated by both CFD simulations and intensive real-world flight tests.},

  abstract     = {A key technical issue for human intention prediction from observed human actions is how to discover and utilize the spatio-temporal patterns behind those actions. Inspired by the well-known two-stream architecture for action recognition, this paper proposes an approach for human intention prediction based on a two-stream architecture using RGB images and optical flow. Firstly, the action-start frame of each trial of a human action is determined by calculating the L2 distance of the positions of the human joints between frames of the skeleton data. Secondly, a spatial network and a temporal network are trained separately to predict human intentions using RGB images and optical flow, respectively. Both early concatenation fusion methods in the spatial network and sampling methods in the temporal network are optimized based on experiments. Finally, average fusion is used to fuse the prediction results from the spatial network and the temporal network. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a new dataset of human intentions behind human actions is introduced. This dataset contains RGB images, RGB-D images, and skeleton data of human actions of pitching a ball. Experiments show that the proposed approach can predict human intentions behind human actions with a prediction accuracy of 74% on the proposed dataset. The proposed approach is further evaluated on the Intention from Motion (IfM) dataset, a dataset of human intentions behind human actions of grasping a bottle. The proposed approach achieves a prediction accuracy of 77% on the IfM dataset. The proposed approach is effective in predicting human intentions behind human actions in different applications.},

To fully automatize the surveying missions it is essential to solve the coverage path planning problem defined as the task of computing a path for a robot so that all the points of a region of interest will be observed. State-of-the-art planners define as the optimal path the one with the minimum number of flight lines. However, the connection path, composed by the path from the starting point to the region of interest plus the path from it to the ending point, is underestimated. We propose an efficient planner for computing the optimal edge-vertex back-and-forth path. Unlike previous approaches, we take into account the starting and ending points. In this article, we demonstrate the vertex-edge path optimality along with in-field experiments using a multirotor vehicle validating the applicability of the planner.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of service robots, research on cooperation between two-arm robots has become increasingly important. In this paper, two NAO two-armed robots are used as the experimental platform and are combined with projective geometry, vision, robotics and other knowledge to carry out theoretical derivation and experiments on the coordinated movements of dual-arm robots. From the aspect of visual information processing, we analyse and solve the detailed target recognition process. Then, on this basis, we propose a set of complete coordinated motion control schemes. For object recognition, in this paper, we propose a highly adaptable linear stick recognition method. To solve the control flow of coordinated movement, we calculate the inverse kinematics of the unreachable pose of a single NAO manipulator by ignoring the degree of freedom of rotation around an end axis, and propose a trajectory planning method for the vertical constraint relationship between the tool and the workpiece plane in the coordinated manipulator movement. A comparison of the results of a simulation and a real experiment reveals that the trajectories of a workpiece clamped at the ends of the two robots’ mechanical arms are roughly the same; consequently, the coordinated control scheme proposed in this paper is feasible. Moreover, the scheme proposed in this paper is sufficiently accurate to meet service robot applications in daily life. Because the joint active clearance of the NAO robot arm is large and its sensor sensitivity is high, clearance change can be used in the future to replace the force sensor for hybrid control.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel posterior active walker designed for disabled children. The active walker adapts an existing posterior passive walker by motorising its back wheels and propelling them in accordance with intention of walking gait of the user. The gait intention of the user is determined from the position of user’s trunk with respect to the walker frame using an array of sensors. The principle of working of the active walker is explained in this paper. A mathematical model for the active walker is developed and the same has been simulated for a control algorithm developed, which controls the walker in different possible conditions to achieve a comfortable and efficient propulsion. The simulation results present performance of the active walker. The walker has been practically implemented and the details of the same have been presented. The experimental functional evaluation of the walker has been done in the lab which matches the simulation result. Later the developed walker was assessed for its ability to track the user. Three healthy children are made to walk with the active walker on different surfaces and the test results show that the walker is able to effectively track the children. The developed walker was subjected to clinical evaluation which involved ten disabled children who were prescribed use of walker. Clinical study involved relative evaluation of effectiveness of passive and the active walkers. It was concluded from the clinical trials that the use of the developed active walker significantly reduces the energy spent by the user compared to the conventional passive walker.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays haptic devices have lots of applications in virtual reality systems. While using a haptic device, one of the main requirements is the stable behavior of the system. An unstable behavior of a haptic device may damage itself and even may hurt its operator. Stability of haptic devices in the presence of inevitable time delay in addition to a suitable zero-order hold is studied in the presented paper, using two different methods. Both presented methods are based on Lyapunov-Krazuvskii functional. In the first method, a model transform is performed to determine the stability boundary, while the second approach is based on Free Weighing Matrices (FWMs). Delay-dependent stability criteria are determined by solving Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Results of these two methods are compared with each other and verified by simulations as well as experiments on a KUKA Light Weight Robot 4 (LWR4). It is concluded that using free weighing matrices leads to more unknown parameters and needs more calculation, but its results are less conservative.},

  abstract     = {Surgery is an effective means of treating cataracts and restoring vision. However, cataract surgery rate (CSR) in developing countries and regions is relatively low due to the lack of experienced high-level surgeons. In this paper, to reduce the reliance of surgery on physician experience and thereby increase CSR, a master-slave robotic system and safety control strategies with a virtual fixture and virtual force feedback are proposed to assist cataract surgery. First, the surgery is divided into four different stages with different robot control modes. Secondly, the virtual constraint area with virtual spring model in the operating stage is established, so that the doctor can distinguish the operation area where the end of the surgical instrument is located by feedback force. Thirdly, safety control algorithm guarantees that the surgical instrument strictly moves around the surgical incision point, which is regarded as a remote centre of motion, so that the cornea outside the incision point is not injured. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed safety control strategy allows the robotic system to perform the procedure safely.},

  abstract     = {We consider a consensus control problem for a set of three-link manipulators connected by digraphs. Assume that the control inputs of each manipulator are the torques on its links and they are generated by adjusting the weighted difference between the manipulator’s states and those of its neighbor agents. Then, we propose a condition for adjusting the weighting coefficients in the control inputs, so that full consensus is achieved among the manipulators. By designing complex Hurwitz polynomials, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the consensus. Moreover, the discussion is extended to the case of designing convergence rate of consensus. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the condition and the design conditions.},
