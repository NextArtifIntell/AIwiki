  abstract     = {Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems gathers attention in several applications; in conjunction with model predictive control, novel different identification techniques that merge machine learning and optimization are presented and compared with the purpose of reducing seismic response of frame structures and minimize control effort. Performance of neural network-, random forest- and regression tree-based identification algorithms in producing reliable models exploiting historical data coming from a real structure is shown. Peculiarities of each data-driven-based model emphasizing the strong potentialities of such approaches are highlighted, and it is shown in a simulative environment how, by slightly increasing the complexity of a model via random forests, we can reduce by half the active control effort with respect to the control computed exploiting regression trees-based models.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, long-term monitoring systems rely on the efficient implementation of automated methodologies to extract the modal parameters of buildings and bridges to assess their structural integrity. However, modal parameter estimation, usually, requires a certain level of user interaction, mainly when parametric system identification methods are used. Such procedures generally depend on the selection of a set of parameters, defined according to heuristic criteria, and kept constant during long monitoring campaigns. The main objective of this paper is to prove the necessity of abandoning identification approaches based on a single set of parameters for long-term monitoring campaigns and to propose a semi-automated modal identification tool, where the user-defined parameters vary within an established range of values, that can be set independently of the user’s expertise. The proposed method is validated with an application in the operational modal analysis of a historic civic tower, and its excellent results demonstrate the importance of considering multiple sets of parameters, mainly when dealing with complex structures and challenging monitoring conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a structural optimisation problem, addressed through a stochastic multi-objective approach, is formulated and solved. The problem deals with the optimal design of exoskeleton structures, conceived as vibration control systems under seismic loading. The exoskeleton structure is assumed to be coupled to an existing primary inner structure for seismic retrofit: the aim is to limit the dynamic response of the primary structure to prevent structural damage. A non-stationary filtered Gaussian white noise stochastic process is taken as the seismic input. Design variables pertain to the mechanical properties (stiffness, damping) of the exoskeleton structure. Two concurrent and competing objective functions are introduced, in order to take into account not only safety performance but also economic cost considerations. The resulting trade-off is solved searching the Pareto front by way of a controlled elitist genetic algorithm, derived from the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. Sensitivities of Pareto fronts and Pareto optimal sets to different system parameters are finally investigated by way of a numerical application.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a multi-scale optimization strategy for lightweight structures, based on a global-local modelling approach is presented. The approach is applied to a realistic wing structure of a civil aircraft. The preliminary design of the wing can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem, involving several requirements at the different scales of the structure. The proposed strategy is characterized by two main features. Firstly, the problem is formulated in the most general sense, by including all design variables involved at each problem scale. Secondly, two scales are considered: (i) the structure macroscopic scale, where low-fidelity numerical models are used; (ii) the structure mesoscopic scale (or component-level), where enhanced models are involved. In particular, the structural responses are evaluated at both global and local scales, avoiding the use of approximated analytical methods. To this end, fully parametric global and local finite element models are interfaced with an in-house genetic algorithm. Refined models are created only for the most critical regions of the structure, and linked to the global one by means of a dedicated sub-modelling approach.},

In this context, we focus our attention on the identification of the dynamic response of beam-like structures with uncertain damages. In particular, the non-localized damage is described using a Gaussian distributed random damage parameter. Furthermore, a procedure for selecting an optimal number of sensor placements has been presented based on the comparison among the probability of damage occurrence and the probability to detect the damage, where the former can be evaluated from the known distribution of the random parameter, whereas the latter is evaluated exploiting the closed-form asymptotic solution provided by a perturbation approach. The presented case study shows the capability and reliability of the proposed procedure for detecting the minimum number of sensors such that the monitoring accuracy (estimated by an error function measuring the differences among the two probabilities) is not greater than a control small value.},

First, typical underlying solutions are independently re-derived, by a static upper/lower horizontal thrust and a kinematic work balance, stationary approaches, based on a complete analytical treatment; then, illustrated and commented.

Additive manufacturing of reinforced polymers allows the tow to be placed along a curvilinear path in each lamina. Accordingly, optimised solutions with enhanced properties can be manufactured. In this work, the multi-scale two-level optimisation strategy for composites is exploited to optimise the strength of variable angle-tow composites subject to mechanical and manufacturing constraints. At the first step of the strategy, the laminate strength is described through a laminate-level failure criterion based on tensor invariants and on the first-order shear deformation theory. The lay-up design phase makes use of quasi-trivial solutions and integrates a check on the first-ply failure in order to ensure the integrity of the whole laminate. The effectiveness of the strategy as well as of the proposed failure criterion is proven on some meaningful test cases.},

  abstract     = {Recently, an increasing research effort has been dedicated to analyze the transmission and dispersion properties of periodic acoustic metamaterials, characterized by the presence of local resonators. Within this context, particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the amplitudes and center frequencies of selected stop and pass bands inside the Floquet–Bloch spectra of the acoustic metamaterials featured by a chiral or antichiral microstructure. Novel functional applications of such research are expected in the optimal parametric design of smart tunable mechanical filters and directional waveguides. The present paper deals with the maximization of the amplitude of low-frequency band gaps, by proposing suitable numerical techniques to solve the associated optimization problems. Specifically, the feasibility and effectiveness of Radial Basis Function networks and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for the interpolation of the objective functions of such optimization problems are discussed, and their numerical application to a specific acoustic metamaterial with tetrachiral microstructure is presented. The discussion is motivated theoretically by the high computational effort often needed for an exact evaluation of the objective functions arising in band gap optimization problems, when iterative algorithms are used for their approximate solution. By replacing such functions with suitable surrogate objective functions constructed applying machine-learning techniques, well-performing suboptimal solutions can be obtained with a smaller computational effort. Numerical results demonstrate the effective potential of the proposed approach. Current directions of research involving the use of additional machine-learning techniques are also presented.},

The analyzed systems of forces describe pair interactions between lumped masses in ‘atomistic’ models of 2D elastic bodies and 3D membrane shells based on non-conforming finite element methods. We derive such force networks from polyhedral stress functions defined over arbitrary triangulations of 2D domains. The stress function associated with an unstructured force network is projected onto a structured triangulation, producing a new force network with ordered structure. The latter is employed to formulate a ‘microscopic’ definition of the Cauchy stress of the system in the continuum limit. The convergence order of such a stress measure to its continuum limit is given, as the mesh size approaches zero. Benchmark examples illustrate the application of the proposed regularization procedure to the prediction of the stress field exhibited by a variety of 2D and 3D membrane networks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a nonzero-sum stochastic differential reinsurance game is studied. A model including controls for the market share (advertising), investment, and reinsurance policies is considered. A jump–diffusion process is used to represent insurance claims. Necessary conditions that would lead to the Nash equilibrium can be found in the duopoly game we consider. Cases with and without controls on the reinsurance are discussed separately. Closed-form solutions for optimal strategies are derived by applying the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Numerical examples are given to validate the correctness of our results.},

  abstract     = {We consider an optimal dividend and capital structure problem for a firm, which holds a certain amount of debt to which is associated a financial ratio covenant between the firm and its creditors. We study optimal policies under a bankruptcy framework, using a mixed reduced and structural approach in modeling default and liquidation times. Once in default, the firm is given a grace period during which it may inject more capital to correct the situation. The firm is liquidated if, by the end of the grace period, assets do not exceed the debt. Under this setup, we maximize the discounted amount of dividends distributed minus the capital injected up to the time of liquidation. It gives rise to a two-dimensional singular control problem leading to a non-standard system of variational inequalities. Beyond the usual viscosity characterization, we completely solve this problem and obtain a description of the continuation, dividend and capital injection regions enabling us to fully characterize the optimal policies. We conclude the paper with numerical results and illustrations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish strong duality between affinely adjustable two-stage robust linear programs and their dual semidefinite programs under a general uncertainty set, that covers most of the commonly used uncertainty sets of robust optimization. This is achieved by first deriving a new version of Farkas’ lemma for a parametric linear inequality system with affinely adjustable variables. Our strong duality theorem not only shows that the primal and dual program values are equal, but also allows one to find the value of a two-stage robust linear program by solving a semidefinite linear program. In the case of an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, it yields a corresponding strong duality result with a second-order cone program as its dual. To illustrate the efficacy of our results, we show how optimal storage cost of an adjustable two-stage lot-sizing problem under a ball uncertainty set can be found by solving its dual semidefinite program, using a commonly available software.},

We reformulate this problem into quadratic programming problems. For each problem, we study the intersection between a sphere and a Voronoi-like polyhedron. That way, we get information about a possible overlap between the frontier of the union and the intersection of balls. If the polyhedra are non-degenerate, the initial nonconvex geometric problem, which is NP-hard in general, is tractable in polynomial time by convex optimization tools and vertex enumeration. Under some mild conditions, the vertex enumeration can be skipped. Simulations highlight the accuracy and efficiency of our approach compared with competing algorithms in Python for nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming. This work is motivated by an application in statistics to the problem of multidimensional changepoint detection using pruned dynamic programming algorithms.},

Our results concern the recovering of a representation of convex Hamiltonians under a relaxed assumption on the Fenchel transform of the Hamiltonian with respect to the fiber. We apply them to investigate the uniqueness of weak solutions, vanishing at infinity, of a class of time-dependent Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations.

Existence, uniqueness, and continuation of solutions are shown, followed by lexicographically smooth (implying Lipschitzian) parametric dependence. The sensitivity theory found here accurately characterizes sensitivity jumps resulting from active set changes via an auxiliary nonsmooth sensitivity system obtained by lexicographic directional differentiation. The results in this article hold under easily verifiable regularity conditions (linear independence of constraints and strong second-order sufficiency), which are shown to imply generalized differentiation index one of a nonsmooth differential-algebraic equation system obtained by replacing the optimization problem with its optimality conditions and recasting the complementarity conditions as nonsmooth algebraic equations. The theory in this article is computationally relevant, allowing for implementation of dynamic optimization strategies (i.e., open-loop optimal control), and recovers (and rigorously formalizes) classical results in the absence of active set changes. Along the way, contributions are made to the theory of piecewise differentiable functions.},

One computational component in the gradient sampling method is the need to solve a quadratic optimization problem at each iteration, which may result in a time-consuming process, especially for large-scale objectives. To resolve this difficulty, this study proposes a new descent direction, for which there is no need to consider any quadratic or linear subproblem. It is shown that this direction satisfies the Armijo step size condition. We also prove that under proposed modifications, the global convergence of the gradient sampling method is preserved. Moreover, under some moderate assumptions, an upper bound for the number of serious iterations is presented. Using this upper bound, we develop a different strategy to study the convergence of the method. We also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method using small-, medium- and large-scale problems in our numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a convex optimization-based method is proposed for numerically solving dynamic programs in continuous state and action spaces. The key idea is to approximate the output of the Bellman operator at a particular state by the optimal value of a convex program. The approximate Bellman operator has a computational advantage because it involves a convex optimization problem in the case of control-affine systems and convex costs. Using this feature, we propose a simple dynamic programming algorithm to evaluate the approximate value function at pre-specified grid points by solving convex optimization problems in each iteration. We show that the proposed method approximates the optimal value function with a uniform convergence property in the case of convex optimal value functions. We also propose an interpolation-free design method for a control policy, of which performance converges uniformly to the optimum as the grid resolution becomes finer. When a nonlinear control-affine system is considered, the convex optimization approach provides an approximate policy with a provable suboptimality bound. For general cases, the proposed convex formulation of dynamic programming operators can be modified as a nonconvex bilevel program, in which the inner problem is a linear program, without losing the uniform convergence properties.},

We first give necessary optimality conditions for these problems, by means of convex analysis tools, and then extend the last method to solve such programs. The method is based on solving a sequence of parametric convex problems.

Various sufficient conditions and examples are introduced. Moreover, we compare the proximity operator with the identity operator with respect to the orders. As applications, we study the solvability and approximation results for the nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem by the order approaches. By establishing the increasing sequences, we, respectively, discuss the region of the solutions and the convergence rate, which vary with combinations of the mappings, and hence, one can choose the proper combination of the mappings under specific conditions.

For probabilities on the real line, consistent tests of fit to a contamination neighbourhood of a fixed model can be based on the minimal Kolmogorov distance between the model and the set of trimmings of the underlying random generator. We provide some alternative formulations for this functional in terms of a variational problem. As a consequence, a test of fit to contamination neighbourhoods can be effectively implemented.

  abstract     = {This paper suggests a procedure to construct the Pareto frontier and efficiently computes the strong Nash equilibrium for a class of time-discrete ergodic controllable Markov chain games. The procedure finds the strong Nash equilibrium, using the Newton optimization method presenting a potential advantage for ill-conditioned problems. We formulate the solution of the problem based on the Lagrange principle, adding a Tikhonov’s regularization parameter for ensuring both the strict convexity of the Pareto frontier and the existence of a unique strong Nash equilibrium. Then, any welfare optimum arises as a strong Nash equilibrium of the game. We prove the existence and characterization of the strong Nash equilibrium, which is one of the main results of this paper. The method is validated theoretically and illustrated with an application example.},

  abstract     = {Two main results (A) and (B) are presented in algebraic closed forms. (A) Regarding the convex quadratic equation, an analytical equivalent solvability condition and parameterization of all solutions are formulated, for the first time in the literature and in a unified framework. The philosophy is based on the matrix algebra, while facilitated by a novel equivalence/coordinate transformation (with respect to the much more challenging case of rank-deficient Hessian matrix). In addition, the parameter-solution bijection is verified. From the perspective via (A), a major application is re-examined that accounts for the other main result (B), which deals with both the infinite and finite-time horizon nonlinear optimal control. By virtue of (A), the underlying convex quadratic equations associated with the Hamilton–Jacobi equation, Hamilton–Jacobi inequality, and Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation are explicitly solved, respectively. Therefore, the long quest for the constituent of the optimal controller, gradient of the associated value function, can be captured in each solution set. Moving forward, a preliminary to exactly locate the optimality using the state-dependent (resp., differential) Riccati equation scheme is prepared for the remaining symmetry condition.},

  abstract     = {Optimization methods for difference-of-convex programs iteratively solve convex subproblems to define iterates. Although convex, depending on the problem’s structure, these subproblems are very often challenging and require specialized solvers. This work investigates a new methodology that defines iterates as approximate critical points of significantly easier difference-of-convex subproblems approximating the original one. Since there is considerable freedom to choose such more accessible subproblems, several algorithms can be designed from the given approach. In some cases, the resulting algorithm boils down to a straightforward process with iterates given in an analytic form. In other situations, decomposable subproblems can be chosen, opening the way for parallel computing even when the original program is not decomposable. Depending on the problem’s assumptions, a possible variant of the given approach is the Josephy–Newton method applied to the system of (necessary) optimality conditions of the original difference-of-convex program. In such a setting, local convergence with superlinear and even quadratic rates can be achieved under certain conditions.},

We reformulate this geometrically as the problem of finding a hyperplane which minimizes the distance to the given point. A characterization of the existence of optimal solutions is given. If the constraints are given by polynomial functions, we show that it is possible to approximate the minimal distance by solving a hierarchy of sum of squares programs. Furthermore, using a result from real algebraic geometry, we show that the hierarchy converges if the relaxed feasible set is bounded.

This problem has been introduced recently as a generalization of the Linear Complementarity Problem with modified complementarity equation, where zero on the right-hand side is replaced with the nonnegative weight vector. With a zero weight vector, the problem reduces to a linear complementarity problem. The importance of Weighted Linear Complementarity Problem lies in the fact that it can be used for modelling a large class of problems from science, engineering and economics. Because the algorithm takes only full-Newton steps, the calculation of the step size is avoided. Under a suitable condition, the algorithm has a quadratic rate of convergence to the target point on the central path. The iteration bound for the algorithm coincides with the best iteration bound obtained for these types of problems.},

  abstract     = {We study a two-player nonzero-sum stochastic differential game, where one player controls the state variable via additive impulses, while the other player can stop the game at any time. The main goal of this work is to characterize Nash equilibria through a verification theorem, which identifies a new system of quasivariational inequalities, whose solution gives equilibrium payoffs with the correspondent strategies. Moreover, we apply the verification theorem to a game with a one-dimensional state variable, evolving as a scaled Brownian motion, and with linear payoff and costs for both players. Two types of Nash equilibrium are fully characterized, i.e. semi-explicit expressions for the equilibrium strategies and associated payoffs are provided. Both equilibria are of threshold type: in one equilibrium players’ intervention are not simultaneous, while in the other one the first player induces her competitor to stop the game. Finally, we provide some numerical results describing the qualitative properties of both types of equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {The computation of subgame perfect equilibrium in stationary strategies is an important but challenging problem in applications of stochastic games. In 2004, Herings and Peeters developed a homotopy method called stochastic linear tracing procedure to solve this problem. However, the starting point of their method requires to be explicitly calculated. To remedy this issue, we formulate an arbitrary starting linear tracing procedure in this paper. By introducing a homotopy variable ranging from two to zero, an artificial penalty game is developed, whose solutions construct a differentiable path after a well-chosen transformation of variables. The starting point of the path can be arbitrarily chosen, so that there is no need to employ additional algorithms to obtain it. Following the path, one can readily attain the “starting point” of the stochastic tracing procedure coined by Herings and Peeters. Then, as the homotopy variable changes from one to zero, the path essentially resumes to the stochastic tracing procedure. We prove that our method globally converges to a subgame perfect equilibrium in stationary strategies for the stochastic game of interest. Numerical results further illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

Economic activity is spatially distributed following the AK model with the output being split into consumption, investment, transport costs and military (for defense and expansion). The emperor controls the military force subject to the constraints imposed by the economy but also the geography (transport costs, border length) and the necessity to satisfy the needs of the population. The border changes depending on how much pressure the emperor can muster to counter the pressure of neighboring countries. The resulting dynamic process determines a country’s size over time. The model leads to multiple steady states, large empires and small countries being separated by a threshold and collapse. The resulting patterns can be linked to historical observations.},

The first one is the global convergence of the Polak–Ribière–Polyak conjugate gradient algorithm and the second is the global convergence of the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno quasi-Newton method. Many scholars have proven that the two problems do not converge, even under an exact line search. Two circle counterexamples were proposed to generate the nonconvergence of the Polak–Ribière–Polyak algorithm for the nonconvex functions under the exact line search, which inspired us to define a new technique to jump out of the circle point and obtain the global convergence. Thus, a new Polak–Ribière–Polyak algorithm is designed by the following steps. (i) Given the current point and a parabolic surface is designed; (ii) An assistant point is defined based on the current point; (iii) The assistant point is projected onto the surface to generate the next point; (iv) The presented algorithm has the global convergence for nonconvex functions with the weak Wolfe–Powell line search. A similar technique is used for the quasi-Newton method to get a new quasi-Newton algorithm and to establish its global convergence. Numerical results show that the given algorithms are more competitive than other similar algorithms. Meanwhile, the well-known hydrologic engineering application problem, called parameter estimation problem of nonlinear Muskingum model, is also done by the proposed algorithms.},

We show that to the latter purpose, we can fruitfully couple the conjugate gradient (CG) method with a recently introduced approach involving the use of the numeral called Grossone. In particular, recalling that in principle the CG method is well posed only when solving positive definite linear systems, our proposal exploits the use of grossone to enhance the performance of the CG, allowing the computation of negative curvature directions in the indefinite case, too. Our overall method could be used to significantly generalize the theory in state-of-the-art literature. Moreover, it straightforwardly allows the solution of Newton’s equation in optimization frameworks, even in nonconvex problems. We remark that our iterative procedure to compute a negative curvature direction does not require the storage of any matrix, simply needing to store a couple of vectors. This definitely represents an advance with respect to current results in the literature.},

These are linearly constrained optimization problems with piecewise linear-quadratic objective functions. We first summarize some local properties of a piecewise linear-quadratic function in terms of their first- and second-order directional derivatives. We next extend some well-known necessary and sufficient second-order conditions for local optimality of a quadratic program to a piecewise linear-quadratic program and provide a dozen such equivalent conditions for strong, strict, and isolated local optimality, showing in particular that a piecewise linear-quadratic program has the same characterizations for local minimality as a standard quadratic program. As a consequence of one such condition, we show that the number of strong, strict, or isolated local minima of a piecewise linear-quadratic program is finite; this result supplements a recent result about the finite number of directional stationary objective values. We also consider a special class of unconstrained composite programs involving a non-differentiable norm function, for which we show that the task of verifying the second-order stationary condition can be converted to the problem of checking the copositivity of certain Schur complement on the nonnegative orthant.},

  abstract     = {We consider the stochastic target problem of finding the collection of initial laws of a mean-field stochastic differential equation such that we can control its evolution to ensure that it reaches a prescribed set of terminal probability distributions, at a fixed time horizon. Here, laws are considered conditionally to the path of the Brownian motion that drives the system. This kind of problems is motivated by limiting behavior of interacting particles systems with applications in, for example, agricultural crop management. We establish a version of the geometric dynamic programming principle for the associated reachability sets and prove that the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution of a geometric partial differential equation. This provides a characterization of the initial masses that can be almost surely transported toward a given target, along the paths of a stochastic differential equation. Our results extend those of Soner and Touzi, Journal of the European Mathematical Society (2002) to our setting.},

This generates less demanding targets from a benchmarking point of view. The model also makes it possible to account for the existence of slacks in all the considered dimensions (sub-indicators), playing with the notion of Pareto efficiency. Additionally, our approach satisfies units invariance, translation invariance and strong monotonicity and ensures that the weights used for the aggregation of the sub-indicators are always strictly positive. All previous approaches based on data envelopment analysis have failed to satisfy at least one of these properties. We also implement a new version of the Russell output measure of technical efficiency working with full-dimensional efficient facets. Finally, the new approach is illustrated by an application to the sphere of corporate social responsibility, showing the main empirical implications of the theoretical properties.},

First, the idea of the splitting algorithm is embedded in the method for solving the quadratic optimization approximation subproblem of the discussed problem, and then, the subproblem is decomposed into two independent low-dimension quadratic optimization subproblems to generate a search direction for the primal variable. Second, a deflection of the steepest descent direction of the augmented Lagrangian function with respect to the dual variable is considered as the search direction of the dual variable. Third, using the augmented Lagrangian function as the merit function, a new primal–dual iterative point is generated by Armijo line search. Under mild conditions, the global convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to solve a series of mid-to-large-scale economic dispatch problems for power systems. Comparing the numerical results demonstrates that the proposed algorithm possesses superior numerical effects and good robustness.},

These findings are used to obtain a number of consequences on: the structure of the set of Pareto optima of a decomposably antichain-convex set; the separation of two decomposably antichain-convex sets; the convexity of the set of maximals of an antichain-convex relation; the convexity of the set of maximizers of an antichain-quasiconcave function.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces the notion of state constraints for optimal control problems governed by fractional elliptic partial differential equations. Several mathematical tools are developed during the process to study these problems, for instance, the characterization of the dual of fractional-order Sobolev spaces and the well-posedness of fractional elliptic equations with measure-valued data. These tools are widely applicable. We show well-posedness of the optimal control problem and derive the first- order optimality conditions. Notice that the adjoint equation is a fractional partial differential equation with a measure as the right-hand-side datum. We use the characterization of the fractional- order dual spaces to study the regularity of solutions of the state and adjoint equations. We emphasize that the classical case was considered by E. Casas, but almost none of the existing results are applicable to our fractional case. As an application of the regularity result of the adjoint equation, we establish the Sobolev regularity of the optimal control. In addition, under this setup, even weaker controls can be used.},

  abstract     = {We propose a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, responsible for the cholera disease in humans. We prove that, when the basic reproduction number is equal to one, a transcritical bifurcation occurs for which the endemic equilibrium emanates from the disease-free point. A control function is introduced into the model, representing the distribution of chlorine water tablets for water purification. An optimal control problem is then proposed and analyzed, where the goal is to determine the fraction of susceptible individuals who should have access to chlorine water tablets in order to minimize the total number of new infections plus the total cost associated with the distribution of chlorine water tablets, over the considered period of time. Finally, we consider real data of the cholera outbreak in Yemen, from April 27, 2017 to April 15, 2018, choosing the values of the parameters of the uncontrolled model that fit the real data. Using our optimal control results, we show, numerically, that the distribution of chlorine water tablets could have stopped, in a fast way, the worst cholera outbreak that ever occurred in human history. Due to the critical situation of Yemen, we also simulate the case where only a small percentage of susceptible individuals has access to chlorine water tablets and obtain an optimal control solution that decreases, substantially, the maximum number of infective individuals affected by the outbreak.},

The presence of the transaction costs implies that the impulse control problem needs to be considered as a control strategy in such a model. An impulse policy which involves reducing the reserves to some fixed level, whenever they are above another, is an important strategy for the impulse control problem. Therefore, we provide sufficient conditions under which the above described impulse policy is optimal. Furthermore, we provide new analytical formulae for the Parisian refracted q-scale functions in the case of the linear Brownian motion and the Crámer–Lundberg process with exponential claims. Using these formulae, we show that, for these models, there exists a unique policy, which is optimal for the impulse control problem. Numerical examples are also provided.},

We prove that there exists a pure stationary strategy that is not overtaken by any pure strategy nor by any stationary strategy, under some condition on the transition structure and respectively under genericity. A strategy that is not overtaken by any other strategy, called an overtaking optimal strategy, does not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for its existence.

We define new boundedness and lower semicontinuity properties for vector-valued functions and study their properties.

  abstract     = {Several iterative methods have been proposed in the literature for solving the variational inequalities in Hilbert or Banach spaces, where the underlying operator A is monotone and Lipschitz continuous. However, there are very few methods known for solving the variational inequalities, when the Lipschitz continuity of A is dispensed with. In this article, we introduce a projection-type algorithm for finding a common solution of the variational inequalities and fixed point problem in a reflexive Banach space, where A is pseudo-monotone and not necessarily Lipschitz continuous. Also, we present an application of our result to approximating solution of pseudo-monotone equilibrium problem in a reflexive Banach space. Finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate the performance of our method as well as comparing it with related method in the literature.},

Both reformulations can be exploited by algorithms, and their convergence to solutions usually relies on the nonsingularity of the Jacobian, or the fact that the merit function has no nonoptimal stationary points. We prove new sufficient conditions for the absence of nonoptimal constrained or unconstrained stationary points that are weaker than some known ones. All these conditions exploit some properties of a certain matrix, but do not require the nonsingularity of the Jacobian. Further, we present new necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonsingularity of the Jacobian that are based on the signs of certain determinants. Additionally, we consider generalized Nash equilibrium problems that are a special class of quasi-variational inequalities. Exploiting their structure, we also prove some new sufficient conditions for stationarity and nonsingularity results.},

This problem is closely related to expected utility maximization and two-moment decision models. We show that most known risk measures, such as mean–variance, expected shortfall, Sharpe ratio, generalized Sharpe ratio and the recently introduced tail mean variance, are special cases of this functional. The new results essentially generalize previous results by the authors concerning the maximization of combination of expected portfolio return and a function of the variance of portfolio return. Our general mean–variance functional is not restricted to a concave function with a single optimal solution. Thus, we also provide optimal solutions to a fractional programming problem, that is arising in portfolio theory. The obtained analytic solution of the optimization problem allows us to conclude that all the optimization problems corresponding to the general functional have efficient frontiers belonged to the efficient frontier obtained for the mean–variance portfolio.},

Motivated by this, to achieve the improved convergence, we ensure the sufficiently accurate consensus via approximate consensus steps. The accuracy is controlled by a predefined sequence of consensus error bounds. It is shown that one can achieve exact convergence when the sequence decays to zero; furthermore, a linear convergence rate can be obtained when the sequence decays to zero linearly. To implement the approximate consensus step with given error bounds, an inexact average consensus scheme is proposed in a distributed manner.

  abstract     = {We consider the optimal control problem associated with a general version of the well known Shallow Lake model, and we prove the existence of an optimum in the class of all positive, locally integrable functions with finite discounted integral. Any direct proof seems to be missing in the literature. In order to represent properly the concrete optimization problem, locally unbounded controls must be admitted. In an infinite horizon setting, the non-compactness of the control space can make the existence problem quite hard to treat, because of the lack of good a priori estimates. To face the technical difficulties, we develop an original method, which is in a way opposite to the classical control theoretic approach used to solve finite horizon Mayer or Bolza problems. Synthetically, our method is based on the following scheme: (i) a couple of uniform localization lemmas providing, for any given finite time interval, a maximizing sequence of controls, which is uniformly essentially bounded in that interval; (ii) a special diagonal procedure dealing with sequences not extracted one from the other; (iii) a “standard” diagonal procedure. Further, this approach does not require any concavity assumption on the state equation. The optimum turns out to be locally bounded by construction.},

  abstract     = {The Moreau envelope, also known as Moreau–Yosida regularization, and the associated proximal mapping have been widely used in Hilbert and Banach spaces. They have been objects of great interest for optimizers since their conception more than half a century ago. They were generalized by the notion of the D-Moreau envelope and D-proximal mapping by replacing the usual square of the Euclidean distance with the conception of Bregman distance for a convex function. Recently, the D-Moreau envelope has been developed in a very general setting. In this article, we present a regularizing and smoothing technique for convex functions defined in Banach spaces. We also investigate several properties of the D-Moreau envelope function and its related D-proximal mapping in Banach spaces. For technical reasons, we restrict our attention to the Lipschitz continuity property of the D-proximal mapping and differentiability properties of the D-Moreau envelope function. In particular, we prove the Fréchet differentiability property of the envelope and the Lipschitz continuity property of its derivative.},

Due to their clarity and low memory requirements, they are more desirable for solving large-scale smooth problems. Conjugate gradient methods make use of gradient and the previous direction information to determine the next search direction, and they require no numerical linear algebra. However, the utility of nonlinear conjugate gradient methods has not been widely employed in solving nonsmooth optimization problems. In this paper, a modified nonlinear conjugate gradient method, which achieves the global convergence property and numerical efficiency, is proposed to solve large-scale nonsmooth convex problems. The new method owns the search direction, which generates sufficient descent property and belongs to a trust region. Under some suitable conditions, the global convergence of the proposed algorithm is analyzed for nonsmooth convex problems. The numerical efficiency of the proposed algorithm is tested and compared with some existing methods on some large-scale nonsmooth academic test problems. The numerical results show that the new algorithm has a very good performance in solving large-scale nonsmooth problems.},

  abstract     = {Block-coordinate descent is a popular framework for large-scale regularized optimization problems with block-separable structure. Existing methods have several limitations. They often assume that subproblems can be solved exactly at each iteration, which in practical terms usually restricts the quadratic term in the subproblem to be diagonal, thus losing most of the benefits of higher-order derivative information. Moreover, in contrast to the smooth case, non-uniform sampling of the blocks has not yet been shown to improve the convergence rate bounds for regularized problems. This work proposes an inexact randomized block-coordinate descent method based on a regularized quadratic subproblem, in which the quadratic term can vary from iteration to iteration: a “variable metric.” We provide a detailed convergence analysis for both convex and non-convex problems. Our analysis generalizes, to the regularized case, Nesterov’s proposal for improving convergence of block-coordinate descent by sampling proportional to the blockwise Lipschitz constants. We improve the convergence rate in the convex case by weakening the dependency on the initial objective value. Empirical results also show that significant benefits accrue from the use of a variable metric.},

Furthermore, with respect to the tensor complementarity problem with a nonnegative such structured tensor, we obtain the upper and lower bounds of its solution set, and by the way, we show that the eigenvalues of such a tensor are closely related to this solution set.},

Based on the analysis on two structured tensor pairs located in the heading items of polynomials involved, and by using the degree theory, we achieve several results on the nonemptiness and compactness of solution sets. When generalized polynomial complementarity problems reduce to polynomial complementarity problems (or tensor complementarity problems), our results reduce to the existing ones. In particular, one of our results broadens the one proposed in a very recent paper to guarantee the nonemptiness and compactness of solution sets to generalized polynomial complementarity problems. Furthermore, we establish several existence and uniqueness results, which enrich the theory of generalized complementarity problems with the observation that some known conditions to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of solutions may not hold for a lot of generalized polynomial complementarity problems.},

We particularly concentrate on the so-called relaxed one-sided Lipschitz property of set-valued mappings with negative Lipschitz constants. This property has been much less investigated than more conventional Lipschitzian behavior, while being well recognized in a variety of applications. Recent work has revealed that set-valued mappings satisfying the relaxed one-sided Lipschitz condition with negative Lipschitz constant possess a localization property, that is stronger than uniform metric regularity, but does not imply strong metric regularity. The present paper complements this fact by providing a characterization, not only of one specific single point of a preimage, but of entire preimages of such mappings. Developing a geometric approach, we derive an explicit formula to calculate preimages of relaxed one-sided Lipschitz mappings between finite-dimensional spaces and obtain a further specification of this formula via extreme points of image sets.},

In the present work, we use this method to derive second-order necessary conditions for a strong local minimum on the base of such conditions for a weak local minimum. For simplicity, we confine ourselves to the consideration of the Mayer problem with endpoint equality and inequality constraints and control inequality constraints given by a finite number of twice smooth functions. Assuming that the gradients of active control constraints are linearly independent, we provide a rather short proof of second-order necessary conditions for a strong local minimum.},

We consider a system, whose state integrates the discrepancy between the unknown but bounded disturbance and control. The control aims at keeping the state within a target set, whereas the disturbance aims at pushing the state outside of the target set by opposing the control action. The literature often solves this kind of problems via a linear-saturated control policy. We show how this policy is an approximation for the optimal control policy by reframing the problem in the context of quadratic zero-sum differential games. We prove that the considered approximation ratio is asymptotically bounded by 2, and it is upper bounded by 2 in the case of 1-dimensional system. In this last case, we also discuss how the approximation ratio may apparently change, when the system’s demand is subject to uncertainty. In conclusion, we compare the approximation ratio of the linear-saturated policy with the one of a family of control policies which generalize the bang–bang one.},

We find that leveraging the risky asset is worse for negative wealth when minimizing the probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin than when minimizing the probability of lifetime ruin. Moreover, when wealth is negative, the optimal amount invested in the risky asset increases as the hazard rate of the exponential “excursion clock” increases. In view of the heavy leveraging when wealth is negative, we also compute the minimum probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin under a constraint on investment. Finally, we derive an asymptotic expansion of the minimum probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin for small values of the hazard rate of the excursion clock. It is interesting to find that for small values of this hazard rate, the minimum probability of lifetime exponential Parisian ruin is proportional to the minimum occupation time studied in Bayraktar and Young, and the proportion equals the hazard rate. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to control the probability of Parisian ruin.},

In this paper, we expand this algorithm to incorporating the negative curvature method to update even at unsuccessful iterations. We call this new method Stochastic Adaptive cubic regularization with Negative Curvature (SANC). Unlike the previous method, in order to attain stochastic gradient and Hessian estimators, the SANC algorithm uses independent sets of data points of consistent size over all iterations. It makes the SANC algorithm more practical to apply for solving large-scale machine learning problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines the negative curvature method with the adaptive cubic-regularized Newton method.

  abstract     = {Inspired by recent work on safe feature elimination for 1-norm regularized least-squares, we develop strategies to eliminate features from convex optimization problems with non-negativity constraints. Our strategy is safe in the sense that it will only remove features/coordinates from the problem when they are guaranteed to be zero at a solution. To perform feature elimination, we use an accurate, but not optimal, primal–dual feasible pair, making our methods robust and able to be used on ill-conditioned problems. We supplement our feature elimination problem with a method to construct an accurate dual feasible point from an accurate primal feasible point; this allows us to use a first-order method to find an accurate primal feasible point and then use that point to construct an accurate dual feasible point and perform feature elimination. Under reasonable conditions, our feature elimination strategy will eventually eliminate all zero features from the problem. As an application of our methods, we show how safe feature elimination can be used to robustly certify the uniqueness of nonnegative least-squares problems. We give numerical examples on a well-conditioned synthetic nonnegative least-squares problem and on a set of 40,000 extremely ill-conditioned problems arising in a microscopy application.},

The vibration problem leads to a SLP with the spectral parameter in both the equation and the boundary conditions. Our main method is to incorporate this problem into the framework of classical SLPs with weights in an appropriate space by transforming it into the one with distribution weight, which provides a different idea for the investigation of the SLPs with spectral parameter in boundary condition.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the Mayer problem for third-order evolution differential inclusions; to this end, first we use auxiliary problems with third-order discrete and discrete-approximate inclusions. In the form of Euler–Lagrange-type inclusions and transversality conditions, necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are derived. The principal idea of obtaining optimal conditions is locally adjoint mappings. Then, applying infimal convolution concept of convex functions, step by step, we construct the dual problems for third-order discrete, discrete-approximate and differential inclusions and prove duality results. It appears that the Euler–Lagrange-type inclusions are duality relations for both primary and dual problems and that the dual problem for discrete-approximate problem makes a bridge between the dual problems of discrete and continuous problems. As a result, the passage to the limit in the dual problem with discrete approximations plays a substantial role in the next investigations, without which it is hardly ever possible to establish any duality to continuous problem. In this way, relying to the described method for computation of the conjugate and support functions of discrete-approximate problems, a Pascal triangle with binomial coefficients can be successfully used for any “higher order” calculations. Thus, to demonstrate this approach, some semilinear problems with discrete and differential inclusions of third order are considered. These problems show that maximization in the dual problems is realized over the set of solutions of the Euler–Lagrange-type discrete/differential inclusions.},

With the absence of a least element for dimensions $$d\ge 3$$, the set of all minimal elements in the collection of all copulas turns out to be a natural and quite important extreme negative dependence concept. We investigate several sufficient conditions, and we provide a necessary condition for a copula to be minimal. The sufficient conditions are related to the extreme negative dependence concept of d-countermonotonicity and the necessary condition is related to the collection of all copulas minimizing multivariate Kendall’s tau. The concept of minimal copulas has already been proved to be useful in various continuous and concordance order preserving optimization problems including variance minimization and the detection of lower bounds for certain measures of concordance. We substantiate this key role of minimal copulas by showing that every continuous and concordance order preserving functional on copulas is minimized by some minimal copula, and, in the case the continuous functional is even strictly concordance order preserving, it is minimized by minimal copulas only. Applying the above results, we may conclude that every minimizer of Spearman’s rho is also a minimizer of Kendall’s tau.},

As Bregman distances are asymmetric in general, in accordance with Bauschke et al., it is natural to consider two variants of the Bregman proximal mapping, which, depending on the order of the arguments, are called left and right Bregman proximal mapping. We consider the left Bregman proximal mapping first. Then, via translation result, we obtain analogue (and partially sharp) results for the right Bregman proximal mapping. The class of relatively prox-regular functions significantly extends the recently considered class of relatively hypoconvex functions. In particular, relative prox-regularity allows for functions with a possibly nonconvex domain. Moreover, as a main source of examples and analogously to the classical setting, we introduce relatively amenable functions, i.e. convexly composite functions, for which the inner nonlinear mapping is component-wise smooth adaptable, a recently introduced extension of Lipschitz differentiability. By way of example, we apply our theory to locally interpret joint alternating Bregman minimization with proximal regularization as a Bregman proximal gradient algorithm, applied to a smooth adaptable function.},

Depending on its instantaneous consumption and production rate as well as its storage management decision, each node may either buy or sell electricity, impacting the electricity spot price. The objective at each node is to minimize energy and storage costs by optimally controlling the storage device. In a noncooperative game setting, we are led to the analysis of a nonzero sum stochastic game with N players where the interaction takes place through the spot price mechanism. For an infinite number of agents, our model corresponds to an extended mean field game.

In this model, there is no constant restriction on the dividend rates, i.e., the optimization problem is of singular type. In this case, the value function is no longer bounded and the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is a variational inequality involving a first-order integro-differential operator and a gradient constraint. We prove the regularity properties for the value function by constructing strategies and show that the value function is a constrained viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. In addition, we prove that the value function is the upper semicontinuous envelope of the supremum for a class of subsolutions.},

Using the fact that functional electrical stimulations are modeled as Dirac pulses, our problem is rewritten as an optimal sampled-data control problem, where the control parameters are the pulses amplitudes and the pulses times. We establish the corresponding Pontryagin first-order necessary optimality conditions and we show how they can be used in view of numerical simulations.},

To this end, we generalize results for the mixed-integer linear case from Neumann et al. (Comput Optim Appl 72:309–337, 2019). We study some additional issues caused by nonlinearity and show how to overcome them by extending the standard granularity concept to an advanced version, which we call pseudo-granularity. In a computational study on instances from a standard test library, we demonstrate that pseudo-granularity can be expected in many nonlinear applications from practice, and that its explicit use can be beneficial.},

Each one or two of these parts may be empty or degenerate into a single point. The proof of this property is easy, when the function is differentiable. We consider functions, which are pseudoconvex with respect to the lower Dini directional derivative. This result follows from some known claims, but our theorem is a shot, directed to the target. We apply this characterization to obtain a complete characterization of strictly pseudoconvex functions. We also derive the respective results, when the function is radially lower semicontinuous in a real linear space. Several applications of the characterization are provided.

We propose a new definition of the marginal pricing rule through a new tangent cone to the production set at a point of its (non-smooth) boundary. The major contribution is the unification of many previous works with convex or non-convex production sets, smooth or non-smooth, for the competitive equilibria and for the marginal pricing equilibria, with or without external effects, in finite-dimensional spaces as well as in infinite-dimensional spaces.

  abstract     = {In this paper, an equilibrium problem for 2D non-homogeneous anisotropic elastic body is considered. It is assumed that the body has a thin elastic inclusion and a thin rigid inclusion. A connection between the inclusions at a given point is characterized by a junction stiffness parameter. The elastic inclusion is delaminated, thus forming an interfacial crack with the matrix. Inequality-type boundary conditions are imposed at the crack faces to prevent interpenetration. Existence of solutions is proved; different equivalent formulations of the problem are discussed; junction conditions at the connection point are found. A convergence of solutions as the junction stiffness parameter tends to zero and to infinity as well as the rigidity parameter of the elastic inclusion tends to infinity is investigated. An analysis of limit models is provided. An optimal control problem is analyzed with the cost functional equal to the derivative of the energy functional with respect to the crack length. A solution existence of an inverse problem for finding the junction stiffness and rigidity parameters is proved.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new method for the computation of an optimal semi-active feedback of a plant, which is controlled by multiple semi-active control dampers and subjected to external, a priori known deterministic disturbance input. The control force is written in bilinear form in equivalent damping gains and a linear combination of the states. This form leads to a bilinear state-space model with corresponding damping gain constraints. An optimal control problem, denoted as constrained bilinear quadratic regulator, is formulated with a performance index, which is quadratic in the states and the equivalent damping gains. The methodology, which is used for solving this problem, is Krotov’s method. In this study, the sequence of improving functions, which enables the use of Krotov’s method in this case, is formulated. Its incorporation in Krotov’s algorithm leads to the suggested novel algorithm for solution of the constrained bilinear quadratic regulator problem for excited optimal semi-active control design. The results are demonstrated numerically by constrained bilinear quadratic regulator control design of controlled structure with seismic disturbance input.},

The algorithm makes use of non-uniform rational basis spline hyper-surfaces to represent the pseudo-density field describing the part topology and of the well-known solid isotropic material with penalization approach. The proposed formulation efficiently exploits the properties of the isogeometric basis functions, which allow defining an implicit filter. In particular, the structural displacement requirement is formulated in the most general sense, by considering displacements on loaded and non-loaded regions. The gradient of the structural displacement is evaluated in closed form by using the principle of virtual work. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the optimized topology to the integer parameters, involved in the definition of the hyper-surface, is carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proven through meaningful 2D and 3D benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The variational approach to shape optimization in linearized elasticity is used in order to improve convergence of a known heuristic algorithm. The speed method of shape optimization is applied to obtain necessary optimality conditions for representative test examples. The algorithm originates from the biomimetic approach to compliance optimization. The trabecular bone adapts its form to mechanical loads and is able to form structures that are lightweight and very stiff at the same time. In this sense, it is a problem pertaining to both the nature or living entities which is similar to structural optimization, especially topology optimization. The paper presents the biomimetic approach, based on the trabecular bone remodeling phenomenon, with the aim of minimizing the compliance in multiple load cases. The method employed aims at minimizing the energy and combines structural evolution inspired by trabecular bone remodeling and the shape gradient framework, with strict analysis based on functionals in the 3-dimensional elasticity model. The method is enhanced to handle the problem of structural optimization under multiple loads. The new biomimetic approach does not require volume constraints. Instead of imposing volume constraints, shapes are parameterized by the assumed strain energy density on the structural surface. The stiffest design is obtained by adding or removing material on the structural surface in virtual space. Structural evolution is based on shape gradient approximation by the speed method, and it is separated from the finite element method of the model solution. Numerical examples confirm that the heuristic algorithm for structural optimization is efficient.},

According to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, the diffusion behavior can be isotropic or orthotropic: for many materials, due to the complexity of the microscopic texture, the principal directions of orthotropy are not known a priori and enter the identification issue. After reviewing some identification methods (proper generalized decomposition) for isotropic and orthotropic material whose orthotropy directions are known, the paper proposes an experimental protocol and an identification algorithm for the full three-dimensional diffusion case, aiming at establishing the 3 coefficients of diffusion along the principal directions of orthotropy and the orientation of the orthotropic reference frame with respect to the sample frame. The identification of the physical properties is done through the minimization of a distance in the space of the physical parameters. The problem being non-convex, the numerical strategy used for the search of the global minimum is a particle swarm optimization, the code adaptive local evolution-particle swarm optimization with adaptive coefficients.},

In this setup, the center of the obstacle, which satisfies the property of dihedral symmetry, and the center of the disk are non-concentric with each other. Such a problem finds important applications in the design of liquid crystal devices, musical instruments and optimal accelerator cavities. We show that the extremal configurations correspond to the cases, where an axis of symmetry of the obstacle coincides with an axis of symmetry of the disk. We also characterize the local and global maximizing and minimizing configurations for the case, when the obstacle has a dihedral symmetry of even order. For the case of odd order symmetry, we have partial results. We highlight the difficulties faced in characterizing the optimal configurations completely. We state our conjectures about such configurations. Finally, various numerical experiments validate the theoretical results obtained as well as the stated conjectures.},

Three internal variables are used: reversible and irreversible volume fractions for the crystallographic phases and Euler angles for parametrization of the martensite strain orientation. The evolution of the volume fractions is modeled in a rate-independent manner, whereas a viscous approach is employed for the Euler angles, which account for the materials’ polycrystalline structure. For the case of a cyclically loaded wire, we calibrate our model using experimental data. The calibration serves as input for the simulation of two more complex boundary value problems to demonstrate the functionality of our material model for localized phase transformations.},

The focus lies on deformation theory of plasticity, which corresponds to a single time step in the variational formulation of the incremental problem. The formation of microstructures in different regions of phase space is analyzed, and it is shown that first-order laminates play an important role in the regime, where both dissipation and hardening are relevant, with second- and third-order laminates reducing the energy even further. No numerical evidence for laminates of order four or higher is found. For large shear and bulk modulus, numerical convergence to the rigid-plastic regime is verified. The main tool is an algorithm for the efficient search for optimal microstructures, which are determined by minimization of the condensed energy. The presently used algorithm and code are extensions of those previously developed for the study of relaxation in sheets of nematic elastomers.},

The Neumann (traction-free) boundary condition and the requirement of decay at infinity are imposed. The condition of solvability of the boundary value problem determines the dispersion spectrum in the wave number/frequency plane for the corresponding surface wave. We establish the criteria for non-existence of surface waves and for the existence of a finite number of surface wave solutions; the number grows and tends to infinity with the wave number. The most intriguing result is a possibility of the existence of infinite number of solutions for any given wave number.
