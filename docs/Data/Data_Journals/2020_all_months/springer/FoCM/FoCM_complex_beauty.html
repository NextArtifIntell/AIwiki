It was shown in 2012 that if finitely many firmly nonexpansive mappings have or “almost have” fixed points, then the same is true for compositions and convex combinations. More recently, sharp information about the minimal displacement vector of compositions and of convex combinations of firmly nonexpansive mappings was obtained in terms of the displacement vectors of the underlying operators. Using a new proof technique based on the Brezis–Haraux theorem and reflected resolvents, we extend these results from firmly nonexpansive to general averaged nonexpansive mappings.

  abstract     = {In this paper we study a class of fast geometric image inpainting methods based on the idea of filling the inpainting domain in successive shells from its boundary inwards. Image pixels are filled by assigning them a color equal to a weighted average of their already filled neighbors. However, there is flexibility in terms of the order in which pixels are filled, the weights used for averaging, and the neighborhood that is averaged over. Varying these degrees of freedom leads to different algorithms, and indeed the literature contains several methods falling into this general class. All of them are very fast, but at the same time all of them leave undesirable artifacts such as “kinking” (bending) or blurring of extrapolated isophotes. Our objective in this paper is to build a theoretical model in order to understand why these artifacts occur and what, if anything, can be done about them. Our model is based on two distinct limits: a continuum limit in which the pixel width $$h \rightarrow 0$$ and an asymptotic limit in which $$h &gt; 0$$ but $$h \ll 1$$ . The former will allow us to explain “kinking” artifacts (and what to do about them) while the latter will allow us to understand blur. Both limits are derived based on a connection between the class of algorithms under consideration and stopped random walks. At the same time, we consider a semi-implicit extension in which pixels in a given shell are solved for simultaneously by solving a linear system. We prove (within the continuum limit) that this extension is able to completely eliminate kinking artifacts, which we also prove must always be present in the direct method. Finally, we show that although our results are derived in the context of inpainting, they are in fact abstract results that apply more generally. As an example, we show how our theory can also be applied to a problem in numerical linear algebra.},

In particular, we present a new relation between the correctors of arbitrary order, which allows to substantially reduce the computational cost of the effective tensors of arbitrary order.

In a companion paper by Bartłomiej Siudeja it was shown that eigenfunctions which are strictly positive on the boundary exist on regular polygons with at least 6 sides, while on equilateral triangles and cubes it is not even possible to find an eigenfunction which is nonnegative on the boundary. The case for the regular pentagon is more challenging, and has resisted a completely analytic attack. In this paper, we present a validated numerical method to prove this case, which involves iteratively bounding eigenvalues for a sequence of subdomains of the triangle. We use a learning algorithm to find and optimize this sequence of subdomains, making it straightforward to check our computations with standard software. Our proof has a short proof certificate, is checkable without specialized software and is adaptable to other situations.},

Stimulated by the failure of classical and stochastic perturbation theory in capturing such phenomena, we define and analyse a weak worst-case and a weak stochastic condition number. This new theory is a more powerful predictor of the accuracy of computations than existing tools, especially when the worst-case and the expected sensitivity of a problem to perturbations of the input is not finite. We apply our analysis to the computation of simple eigenvalues of matrix polynomials, including the more difficult case of singular matrix polynomials. In addition, we show how the weak condition numbers can be estimated in practice.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the propagation properties of the numerical versions of one- and two-dimensional wave equations, semi-discretized in space by finite difference schemes. We focus on high-frequency solutions whose propagation can be described, both at the continuous and at the semi-discrete levels, by micro-local tools. We consider uniform and non-uniform numerical grids as well as constant and variable coefficients. The energy of continuous and semi-discrete high-frequency solutions propagates along bi-characteristic rays, but their dynamics are different in the continuous and the semi-discrete setting, because of the nature of the corresponding Hamiltonians. One of the main objectives of this paper is to illustrate through accurate numerical simulations that, in agreement with micro-local theory, numerical high-frequency solutions can bend in an unexpected manner, as a result of the accumulation of the local effects introduced by the heterogeneity of the numerical grid. These effects are enhanced in the multi-dimensional case where the interaction and combination of such behaviors in the various space directions may produce, for instance, the rodeo effect, i.e., waves that are trapped by the numerical grid in closed loops, without ever getting to the exterior boundary. Our analysis allows to explain all such pathological behaviors. Moreover, the discussion in this paper also contributes to the existing theory about the necessity of filtering high-frequency numerical components when dealing with control and inversion problems for waves, which is based very much on the theory of rays and, in particular, on the fact that they can be observed when reaching the exterior boundary of the domain, a key property that can be lost through numerical discretization.},

Our proof is based on previous work showing that a constrained matrix invertibility problem can be reduced to the interleaving distance computation of a special type of persistence modules. We show that this matrix invertibility problem is NP-complete. We also give a slight improvement in the above reduction, showing that also the approximation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard for any approximation factor smaller than 3. Additionally, we obtain corresponding hardness results for the case that the modules are indecomposable, and in the setting of one-sided stability. Furthermore, we show that checking for injections (resp. surjections) between persistence modules is NP-hard. In conjunction with earlier results from computational algebra this gives a complete characterization of the computational complexity of one-sided stability. Lastly, we show that it is in general NP-hard to approximate distances induced by noise systems within a factor of 2.},

These include solutions of elliptic PDEs on nonsmooth domains or with oscillatory data. This tensor-structured approach is attractive because it leads to highly compressed, adaptive approximations based on simple discretizations. Standard choices of the underlying bases, such as piecewise multilinear finite elements on uniform tensor product grids, entail the well-known matrix ill-conditioning of discrete operators. We demonstrate that, for low-rank representations, the use of tensor structure itself additionally introduces representation ill-conditioning, a new effect specific to computations in tensor networks. We analyze the tensor structure of a BPX preconditioner for a second-order linear elliptic operator and construct an explicit tensor-structured representation of the preconditioner, with ranks independent of the number L of discretization levels. The straightforward application of the preconditioner yields discrete operators whose matrix conditioning is uniform with respect to the discretization parameter, but in decompositions that suffer from representation ill-conditioning. By additionally eliminating certain redundancies in the representations of the preconditioned discrete operators, we obtain reduced-rank decompositions that are free of both matrix and representation ill-conditioning. For an iterative solver based on soft thresholding of low-rank tensors, we obtain convergence and complexity estimates and demonstrate its reliability and efficiency for discretizations with up to $$2^{50}$$ nodes in each dimension.},

  abstract     = {We show that there is a unique hypersurface of minimal degree passing through the non-faces of a polytope which is defined by a simple hyperplane arrangement. This generalizes the construction of the adjoint curve of a polygon by Wachspress (A rational finite element basis, Academic Press, New York, 1975). The defining polynomial of our adjoint hypersurface is the adjoint polynomial introduced by Warren (Adv Comput Math 6:97–108, 1996). This is a key ingredient for the definition of Wachspress coordinates, which are barycentric coordinates on an arbitrary convex polytope. The adjoint polynomial also appears both in algebraic statistics, when studying the moments of uniform probability distributions on polytopes, and in intersection theory, when computing Segre classes of monomial schemes. We describe the Wachspress map, the rational map defined by the Wachspress coordinates, and the Wachspress variety, the image of this map. The inverse of the Wachspress map is the projection from the linear span of the image of the adjoint hypersurface. To relate adjoints of polytopes to classical adjoints of divisors in algebraic geometry, we study irreducible hypersurfaces that have the same degree and multiplicity along the non-faces of a polytope as its defining hyperplane arrangement. We list all finitely many combinatorial types of polytopes in dimensions two and three for which such irreducible hypersurfaces exist. In the case of polygons, the general such curves are elliptic. In the three-dimensional case, the general such surfaces are either K3 or elliptic.},

  abstract     = {We study the geometric Whitney problem on how a Riemannian manifold (M, g) can be constructed to approximate a metric space $$(X,d_X)$$ . This problem is closely related to manifold interpolation (or manifold reconstruction) where a smooth n-dimensional submanifold $$S\subset {{\mathbb {R}}}^m$$ , $$m&gt;n$$ needs to be constructed to approximate a point cloud in $${{\mathbb {R}}}^m$$ . These questions are encountered in differential geometry, machine learning, and in many inverse problems encountered in applications. The determination of a Riemannian manifold includes the construction of its topology, differentiable structure, and metric. We give constructive solutions to the above problems. Moreover, we characterize the metric spaces that can be approximated, by Riemannian manifolds with bounded geometry: We give sufficient conditions to ensure that a metric space can be approximated, in the Gromov–Hausdorff or quasi-isometric sense, by a Riemannian manifold of a fixed dimension and with bounded diameter, sectional curvature, and injectivity radius. Also, we show that similar conditions, with modified values of parameters, are necessary. As an application of the main results, we give a new characterization of Alexandrov spaces with two-sided curvature bounds. Moreover, we characterize the subsets of Euclidean spaces that can be approximated in the Hausdorff metric by submanifolds of a fixed dimension and with bounded principal curvatures and normal injectivity radius. We develop algorithmic procedures that solve the geometric Whitney problem for a metric space and the manifold reconstruction problem in Euclidean space, and estimate the computational complexity of these procedures. The above interpolation problems are also studied for unbounded metric sets and manifolds. The results for Riemannian manifolds are based on a generalization of the Whitney embedding construction where approximative coordinate charts are embedded in $${{\mathbb {R}}}^m$$ and interpolated to a smooth submanifold.},

This is, to our knowledge, the first parameterised algorithm in computational 3-manifold topology using a topological parameter. The computation of $$\mathrm {TV}_{4,q}$$ is known to be #P-hard in general; using a topological parameter provides an algorithm polynomial in the size of the input triangulation for the family of 3-manifolds with first $$\mathbb {Z}_2$$ -homology group of bounded dimension. Our algorithm is easy to implement, and running times are comparable with running times to compute integral homology groups for standard libraries of triangulated 3-manifolds. The invariants we can compute this way are powerful: in combination with integral homology and using standard data sets, we are able to almost double the pairs of 3-manifolds we can distinguish. We hope this qualifies $$\mathrm {TV}_{4,q}$$ to be added to the short list of standard properties (such as orientability, connectedness and Betti numbers) that can be computed ad hoc when first investigating an unknown triangulation.},

We study the convergence of a class of entropy stable finite volume schemes for the barotropic and complete compressible Euler equations in the multidimensional case. We establish suitable stability and consistency estimates and show that the Young measure generated by numerical solutions represents a dissipative measure-valued solution of the Euler system. Here dissipative means that a suitable form of the second law of thermodynamics is incorporated in the definition of the measure-valued solutions. In particular, using the recently established weak-strong uniqueness principle, we show that the numerical solutions converge pointwise to the regular solution of the limit systems at least on the lifespan of the latter.},

Their discretization is a classical problem in numerical analysis. Preserving the spectrum in the discrete flow requires the conservation of high order polynomials, which is hard to come by. Existing methods achieving this are complicated and usually fail to preserve the underlying Lie–Poisson structure. Here, we present a class of numerical methods of arbitrary order for Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian isospectral flows, which preserve both the spectra and the Lie–Poisson structure. The methods are surprisingly simple and avoid the use of constraints or exponential maps. Furthermore, due to preservation of the Lie–Poisson structure, they exhibit near conservation of the Hamiltonian function. As an illustration, we apply the methods to several classical isospectral flows.},

Among its key ingredients is the use of nonlocal integral relaxations to local differentiations. Mathematical analysis of the corresponding nonlocal models on the continuum level can provide further theoretical understanding of SPH. We present, in this part of a series of works on the mathematics of SPH, a nonlocal relaxation to the conventional linear steady-state Stokes system for incompressible viscous flows. The nonlocal continuum model is characterized by a smoothing length $$\delta $$ which measures the range of nonlocal interactions. It serves as a bridge between the discrete approximation schemes that involve a nonlocal integral relaxation and the local continuum models. We show that for a class of carefully chosen nonlocal operators, the resulting nonlocal Stokes equation is well-posed and recovers the original Stokes equation in the local limit when $$\delta $$ approaches zero. For some other commonly used smooth kernels, there are risks in getting ill-posed continuum models that could lead to computational difficulties in practice. This leads us to discuss the implications of our finding on the design of numerical methods.},

Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude.

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a flurry of activities in designing provably efficient nonconvex procedures for solving statistical estimation problems. Due to the highly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures often require proper regularization (e.g., trimming, regularized cost, projection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such as gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly conservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks performance guarantees. This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in the absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper regularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient descent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry, consisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This “implicit regularization” feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more aggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial computational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation problems, i.e., phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind deconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal statistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In particular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory, we develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative algorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a by-product, for noisy matrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal error control—measured entrywise and by the spectral norm—which might be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Spectral clustering has become one of the most widely used clustering techniques when the structure of the individual clusters is non-convex or highly anisotropic. Yet, despite its immense popularity, there exists fairly little theory about performance guarantees for spectral clustering. This issue is partly due to the fact that spectral clustering typically involves two steps which complicated its theoretical analysis: First, the eigenvectors of the associated graph Laplacian are used to embed the dataset, and second, k-means clustering algorithm is applied to the embedded dataset to get the labels. This paper is devoted to the theoretical foundations of spectral clustering and graph cuts. We consider a convex relaxation of graph cuts, namely ratio cuts and normalized cuts, that makes the usual two-step approach of spectral clustering obsolete and at the same time gives rise to a rigorous theoretical analysis of graph cuts and spectral clustering. We derive deterministic bounds for successful spectral clustering via a spectral proximity condition that naturally depends on the algebraic connectivity of each cluster and the inter-cluster connectivity. Moreover, we demonstrate by means of some popular examples that our bounds can achieve near optimality. Our findings are also fundamental to the theoretical understanding of kernel k-means. Numerical simulations confirm and complement our analysis.},

  abstract     = {Differential (Ore) type polynomials with “approximate” polynomial coefficients are introduced. These provide an effective notion of approximate differential operators, with a strong algebraic structure. We introduce the approximate greatest common right divisor problem (GCRD) of differential polynomials, as a non-commutative generalization of the well-studied approximate GCD problem. Given two differential polynomials, we present an algorithm to find nearby differential polynomials with a non-trivial GCRD, where nearby is defined with respect to a suitable coefficient norm. Intuitively, given two linear differential polynomials as input, the (approximate) GCRD problem corresponds to finding the (approximate) differential polynomial whose solution space is the intersection of the solution spaces of the two inputs. The approximate GCRD problem is proven to be locally well posed. A method based on the singular value decomposition of a differential Sylvester matrix is developed to produce an initial approximation of the GCRD. With a sufficiently good initial approximation, Newton iteration is shown to converge quadratically to an optimal solution. Finally, sufficient conditions for existence of a solution to the global problem are presented along with examples demonstrating that no solution exists when these conditions are not satisfied.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a symbolic matrix in non-commuting variables over $${\mathbb {Q}}$$ is invertible or not. The analogous question for commuting variables is the celebrated polynomial identity testing (PIT) for symbolic determinants. In contrast to the commutative case, which has an efficient probabilistic algorithm, the best previous algorithm for the non-commutative setting required exponential time (Ivanyos et al. in Comput Complex 26(3):717–763, 2017) (whether or not randomization is allowed). The algorithm efficiently solves the “word problem” for the free skew field, and the identity testing problem for arithmetic formulae with division over non-commuting variables, two problems which had only exponential time algorithms prior to this work. The main contribution of this paper is a complexity analysis of an existing algorithm due to Gurvits (J Comput Syst Sci 69(3):448–484, 2004), who proved it was polynomial time for certain classes of inputs. We prove it always runs in polynomial time. The main component of our analysis is a simple (given the necessary known tools) lower bound on central notion of capacity of operators (introduced by Gurvits 2004). We extend the algorithm to actually approximate capacity to any accuracy in polynomial time, and use this analysis to give quantitative bounds on the continuity of capacity (the latter is used in a subsequent paper on Brascamp–Lieb inequalities). We also extend the algorithm to compute not only singularity, but actually the (non-commutative) rank of a symbolic matrix, yielding a factor 2 approximation of the commutative rank. This naturally raises a relaxation of the commutative PIT problem to achieving better deterministic approximation of the commutative rank. Symbolic matrices in non-commuting variables, and the related structural and algorithmic questions, have a remarkable number of diverse origins and motivations. They arise independently in (commutative) invariant theory and representation theory, linear algebra, optimization, linear system theory, quantum information theory, approximation of the permanent and naturally in non-commutative algebra. We provide a detailed account of some of these sources and their interconnections. In particular, we explain how some of these sources played an important role in the development of Gurvits’ algorithm and in our analysis of it here.},

The result is a nested sequence of categories, each containing all the cells as its set of objects, with the property that two cells are isomorphic in the last category if and only if they lie in the same canonical stratum.

In particular, we deal with misspecified settings where a test integrand is less smooth than a Sobolev RKHS based on which a quadrature rule is constructed. We provide convergence guarantees based on two different assumptions on a quadrature rule: one on quadrature weights and the other on design points. More precisely, we show that convergence rates can be derived (i) if the sum of absolute weights remains constant (or does not increase quickly), or (ii) if the minimum distance between design points does not decrease very quickly. As a consequence of the latter result, we derive a rate of convergence for Bayesian quadrature in misspecified settings. We reveal a condition on design points to make Bayesian quadrature robust to misspecification, and show that, under this condition, it may adaptively achieve the optimal rate of convergence in the Sobolev space of a lesser order (i.e., of the unknown smoothness of a test integrand), under a slightly stronger regularity condition on the integrand.},

(Interestingly, for the continuous Galerkin method in dimension greater than one, we show that multisymplecticity only holds in a weaker sense.) Consequently, these general-purpose finite element methods may be used for structure-preserving discretization (or semidiscretization) of canonical Hamiltonian systems of ODEs or PDEs. This establishes multisymplecticity for a large class of arbitrarily high-order methods on unstructured meshes.},
