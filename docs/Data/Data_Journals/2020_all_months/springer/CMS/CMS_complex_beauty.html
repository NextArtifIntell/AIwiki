Due to its importance, in this study, we are aiming to estimate the parameters of this model based on progressive type-II censored observations. To do this, we applied the stochastic expectation maximization method and Newton–Raphson techniques for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates. We also considered the estimation based on Bayesian method using several approximate: MCMC samples, Lindely approximation and Metropolis–Hasting algorithm. In addition, we considered the shrinkage estimators based on Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimators. Then, the HPD intervals for the parameters are constructed based on the posterior samples from the Metropolis–Hasting algorithm. In the sequel, we obtained the performance of different estimators in terms of biases, estimated risks and Pitman closeness via Monte Carlo simulation study. This paper will be ended up with a real data set example for illustration of our purpose.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we derive new closed-form valuations to European options under three-factor hybrid models that include stochastic interest rates and stochastic volatility and incorporate a nonzero covariance structure between factors. We make novel use of the empirically proven 3/2 stochastic volatility model with a time-dependent drift in which we are free to choose the moving reversion target. This model has been shown by many authors to empirically outperform other volatility models in maximising model fit. We also improve the valuation of European options under the Heston volatility and Cox, Ingersoll, Ross interest rate model, recently published in the literature, by replacing open-form infinite series with closed-form analytic expressions. For completeness, we also add a fuller covariance structure in this setting and detail closed-form valuations for options. The inclusion of nonzero covariances amongst the factors can significantly improve option pricing by allowing for a wider variety of market behaviour. The solutions are derived by firstly formulating the price of a European call option in terms of the corresponding characteristic function of the underlying price and then determining a partial differential equation for the characteristic function. By including empirically proven models into our analysis, the options formulae could provide more realistic prices for investors and practitioners.},

We first classify a target class by excluding the possibility of labeling as any other classes using a forward step of sequential SVM; we then exclude the already classified classes and repeat the same procedure for the remaining classes in a backward step. The proposed algorithm relies on SVM for each binary classification and utilizes only feasible data in each step; therefore, the method guarantees convergence and entails light computational burden. We prove Fisher consistency of the proposed forward–backward SVM (FB-SVM) and obtain a stochastic bound for the predicted misclassification rate. We conduct extensive simulations and analyze real-world data to demonstrate the superior performance of FB-SVM, for example, FB-SVM achieves a classification accuracy much higher than the current standard for predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease.},

In additive parameter approach, an automatic adjustment of the seedling element as the result of angular marginal seed is offered in a particular way for the angular softmax to learn angularly discriminative features.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we will propose a way to accurately model certain naturally occurring collections of data. Through this proposed model, the proportion of d as leading digit, $$d\in \llbracket 1,9\rrbracket $$, in data is more likely to follow a law whose probability distribution is determined by a specific upper bound, rather than Benford’s Law, as one might have expected. These probability distributions fluctuate nevertheless around Benford’s values. These peculiar fluctuations have often been observed in the literature in such data sets (where the physical, biological or economical quantities considered are upper bounded). Knowing beforehand the value of this upper bound enables to find, through the developed model, a better adjusted law than Benford’s one.},

  abstract     = {Some of the spherical distributions can be constructed through proper transformation of the densities on plane. Since the logistic density on the Euclidean space has similar behavior to the normal distribution, it is of interest to extend it for spherical data. In this paper, we introduce spherical logistic distribution on the unit sphere and then study relevant statistical inferences including parameters estimation through method of moments and maximum likelihood techniques. It is shown that the spherical logistic distribution is a multimodal distribution with the marginal logistic density function. Proposed density has rotational symmetry property and this plays a key role to drive some important results related to first two moments. To investigate the proposed density in more details, some simulation studies along with analyzing real-life data are also considered.},

In this paper, a new lifetime distribution is introduced which is obtained by compounding exponential and gamma distributions (named as Lindley distribution). Hazard rates, mean time to failure and estimation of single parameter Lindley distribution by maximum likelihood estimator have been discussed. It is observed that when the load and the area of the cross section increase, failure of the column also increases at two intensity stresses. It is observed from the results that reliability decreases when scale parameter increases.},

Moreover, an adaptive refinement process is formulated and discussed with details. The constructed basis functions with cubic polynomials and only $$C^{1}$$ continuity are enough to produce a higher continuous field approximation while maintaining the computational cost for the matrices as low as possible. A numerical implementation for the adaptive method is performed on Schrödinger eigenvalue problem with double-well potential using 3 examples on different implicit domains. The convergence and performance results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the approach.},

The sparsity means that a small fraction of regression coefficients is nonzero, and the homogeneity means that regression coefficients are grouped and have exactly the same value in each group. A general pairwise fusion approach is proposed to deal with the sparsity and homogeneity detection when combining prior convex constraints. We develop a modified alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to obtain the estimators and demonstrate its convergence. The efficiency of both sparsity and homogeneity detection can be improved by combining the prior information. Our proposed method is further illustrated by simulation studies and analysis of an ozone dataset.},

This idea of re-scrambling already scrambled responses seems completely new in the field of randomized response sampling.

  abstract     = {If the population is rare and clustered, then simple random sampling gives a poor estimate of the population total. For such type of populations, adaptive cluster sampling is useful. But it loses control on the final sample size. Hence, the cost of sampling increases substantially. To overcome this problem, the surveyors often use auxiliary information which is easy to obtain and inexpensive. An attempt is made through the auxiliary information to control the final sample size. In this article, we have proposed two-stage negative adaptive cluster sampling design. It is a new design, which is a combination of two-stage sampling and negative adaptive cluster sampling designs. In this design, we consider an auxiliary variable which is highly negatively correlated with the variable of interest and auxiliary information is completely known. In the first stage of this design, an initial random sample is drawn by using the auxiliary information. Further, using Thompson’s (J Am Stat Assoc 85:1050–1059, 1990) adaptive procedure networks in the population are discovered. These networks serve as the primary-stage units (PSUs). In the second stage, random samples of unequal sizes are drawn from the PSUs to get the secondary-stage units (SSUs). The values of the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest are recorded for these SSUs. Regression estimator is proposed to estimate the population total of the variable of interest. A new estimator, Composite Horwitz–Thompson (CHT)-type estimator, is also proposed. It is based on only the information on the variable of interest. Variances of the above two estimators along with their unbiased estimators are derived. Using this proposed methodology, sample survey was conducted at Western Ghat of Maharashtra, India. The comparison of the performance of these estimators and methodology is presented and compared with other existing methods. The cost–benefit analysis is given.},
