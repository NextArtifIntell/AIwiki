  abstract     = {In this paper, we deal with a penalized least-squares (PLS) method for a linear regression model with orthogonal explanatory variables. The used penalties are an adaptive Lasso (AL)-type $$\ell _1$$ penalty (AL penalty) and a generalized ridge (GR)-type $$\ell _2$$ penalty (GR penalty). Since the estimators obtained by minimizing the PLS methods strongly depend on the regularization parameters, we optimize them by a model selection criterion (MSC) minimization method. The estimators based on the AL penalty and the GR penalty have different properties, and it is universally recognized that these are completely different estimators. However, in this paper, we show an interesting result that the two estimators are exactly equal when the explanatory variables are orthogonal after optimizing the regularization parameters by the MSC minimization method.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in multivariate count time series. However, existing models restrict the dependence structures imposed by the way they constructed. In this paper, we consider a class of flexible bivariate Poisson INGARCH(1,1) model whose dependence is established by a special multiplicative factor. Stationarity and ergodicity of the process are discussed. The maximization by parts algorithm and its modified version together with the alternative method by using R package Template Model Builder are employed to estimate the parameters of interest. The consistency and asymptotic normality for estimates are obtained, and the finite sample performance of estimators is given via simulations. A real data example is also provided to illustrate the model.},

The backfitting algorithm is a powerful tool to estimate the additive components. However, due to complexity of the estimators, the asymptotic p value of the associated test is difficult to calculate without a Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, the conventional tests assume that the predictor variables are strictly continuous. In this paper, a new test is introduced for the additive components with discrete or categorical predictors, where the model may contain continuous covariates. This method is also applied to the semiparametric regression to test the goodness of fit of the model. These tests are asymptotically optimal in terms of the rate of convergence, as they can detect a specific class of contiguous alternatives at a rate of $$n^{-1/2}$$ . An extensive simulation study and a real data example are presented to support the theoretical results.},

Next, by making use of the obtained oracle inequalities, we provide an asymptotic efficiency property for the developed estimation methods in an adaptive setting when the signal/noise ratio goes to infinity.

Moreover, the wavelet representation permits the use of several bootstrap procedures, and it results in faster computing algorithms.

This study examines the Bartlett correction for the frequency domain empirical likelihood (FDEL), based on the Whittle likelihood of linear time series models. Nordman and Lahiri (Ann Stat 34:3019–3050, 2006) showed that the FDEL does not have an ordinary Chi-squared limit when the innovation is non-Gaussian with unknown variance, which restricts the use of the FDEL inference in time series. We show that, by profiling the innovation variance out of the Whittle likelihood function, the FDEL is Chi-squared-distributed and Bartlett correctable. In particular, the order of the coverage error of the confidence region can be reduced from $$O(n^{-1})$$ to $$O(n^{-2})$$ .},

  abstract     = {Scoring functions are commonly used to evaluate a point forecast of a particular statistical functional. This scoring function should be consistent, meaning the correct value of the functional is the Bayes act, in which case we say the scoring function elicits the functional. Recent results show that the mode functional is not elicitable. In this work, we ask whether it is at least possible to indirectly elicit the mode, wherein one elicits a low-dimensional functional from which the mode can be computed. We show that this cannot be done: Neither the mode nor a modal interval is indirectly elicitable with respect to the class of identifiable functionals.},

It is, however, neither robust against change in units nor meaningful for ordinal data. Thus, we propose a novel nonparametric MANOVA. Contrary to existing rank-based procedures, we infer hypotheses formulated in terms of meaningful Mann–Whitney-type effects in lieu of distribution functions. The tests are based on a quadratic form in multivariate rank effect estimators, and critical values are obtained by bootstrap techniques. The newly developed procedures provide asymptotically exact and consistent inference for general models such as the nonparametric Behrens–Fisher problem and multivariate one-, two-, and higher-way crossed layouts. Computer simulations in small samples confirm the reliability of the developed method for ordinal and metric data with covariance heterogeneity. Finally, an analysis of a real data example illustrates the applicability and correct interpretation of the results.},

A popular approach to deal with partially observed covariates is multiple imputation, where a number of completed data sets, that can be analyzed by standard complete data methods, are obtained by imputing missing values from an appropriate distribution. We show how the combination of multiple imputations from a compatible model with suitably estimated parameters and the usual Cox regression estimators leads to consistent and asymptotically Gaussian estimators of both the finite-dimensional regression parameter and the infinite-dimensional cumulative baseline hazard parameter. We also derive a consistent estimator of the covariance operator. Simulation studies and an application to a study on survival after treatment for liver cirrhosis show that the estimators perform well with moderate sample sizes and indicate that iterating the multiple-imputation estimator increases the precision.},

However, a major drawback associated with them is that the number of model parameters grows exponentially in the order of the model, and thus only very low-order models are considered in applications. Another drawback is lack of flexibility, in that Markov models give relatively few choices for the number of model parameters. Sparse Markov models are Markov models with conditioning histories that are grouped into classes such that the conditional probability distribution for members of each class is constant. The model gives a better handling of the trade-off between bias associated with having too few model parameters and variance from having too many. In this paper, methodology for efficient computation of pattern distributions through Markov chains with minimal state spaces is extended to the sparse Markov framework.},

In this paper, we propose a novel and easily implemented approach to do variable selection in nonparametric models without parameterized approximation, enabling selection consistency to be achieved. The proposed method is applied to do variable selection for additive models. A two-stage procedure with selection and adaptive estimation is proposed, and the properties of this method are investigated. This two-stage algorithm is adaptive to the smoothness of the underlying components, and the estimation consistency can reach a parametric rate if the underlying model is really parametric.

We propose a new semiparametric Bayes multiple imputation approach that can deal with continuous and discrete variables. This enables us to overcome the shortcomings of MICE; they must satisfy strong conditions (known as compatibility) to guarantee obtained estimators are consistent. Our simulation studies show the coverage probability of 95\% interval calculated using MICE can be less than 1\%, while the MSE of the proposed can be less than one-fiftieth. We applied our method to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the results are consistent with those of the previous works that used panel data other than ADNI database, whereas the existing methods, such as MICE, resulted in inconsistent results.},

We consider simulations to study the finite sample performance of our estimator for copulas with different types of local dependency.

  abstract     = {Scoring rules serve to quantify predictive performance. A scoring rule is proper if truth telling is an optimal strategy in expectation. Subject to customary regularity conditions, every scoring rule can be made proper, by applying a special case of the Bayes act construction studied by Grünwald and Dawid (Ann Stat 32:1367–1433, 2004) and Dawid (Ann Inst Stat Math 59:77–93, 2007), to which we refer as properization. We discuss examples from the recent literature and apply the construction to create new types, and reinterpret existing forms, of proper scoring rules and consistent scoring functions. In an abstract setting, we formulate sufficient conditions under which Bayes acts exist and scoring rules can be made proper.},

The parallels with the monotone and $$\alpha $$-monotone distributions of $$ Y \times U$$ and $$Y_\alpha \times U^{1/\alpha }$$, respectively, are striking. I also introduce discrete uniform slash and $$\alpha $$-slash distributions which arise from a notion of negative binomial thinning/fattening.

A common estimation procedure consists in maximizing the corresponding empirical criterion, in which the nuisance parameter is replaced by a nonparametric estimator. In the literature, this research topic, commonly referred to as semiparametric M-estimation, has received a lot of attention in the case where the criterion function satisfies certain smoothness properties. In certain applications, these smoothness conditions are, however, not satisfied. The aim of this paper is therefore to extend the existing theory on semiparametric M-estimators, in order to cover non-smooth M-estimators as well. In particular, we develop ‘high-level’ conditions under which the proposed M-estimator is consistent and has an asymptotic limit. We also check these conditions for a specific example of a semiparametric M-estimator coming from the area of classification with missing data.},

The conditional distributions studied here lead to runs and patterns-type distribution-free tests whose applications are widespread. Two applications are considered. First, a distribution-free test for randomness is applied to rainfall data at Oxford from 1858 to 1952. The second application is to develop runs and patterns-type distribution-free control charts which can be used as Phase I and/or Phase II control charts.

The small ball probability in the covariate space plays a critical role in determining the asymptotic variance of kernel estimates. Unlike the case of finite-dimensional covariates, we show that the asymptotic orders of the bias and the variance of the estimate achieving the optimum convergence rate may be different for infinite-dimensional covariates. Also, the bandwidth, which balances the bias and the variance, may lead to an estimate with suboptimal mean square error for infinite-dimensional covariates.

Under reasonable regularity conditions, we show that different empirically acceptable models can give rise to non-overlapping confidence intervals for the same parameter. Application papers need to recognize that the validity of conventional statistical results rests on the assumption that the underlying model is known to be correct, and that this is a much stronger requirement than merely confirming that the model gives a good fit to the data. The problem of model dependence is only partially resolved by using formal methods of model selection or model averaging.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers estimation and inference in semiparametric quantile regression models when the response variable is subject to random censoring. The paper considers both the cases of independent and dependent censoring and proposes three iterative estimators based on inverse probability weighting, where the weights are estimated from the censoring distribution using the Kaplan–Meier, a fully parametric and the conditional Kaplan–Meier estimators. The paper proposes a computationally simple resampling technique that can be used to approximate the finite sample distribution of the parametric estimator. The paper also considers inference for both the parametric and nonparametric components of the quantile regression model. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed estimators and test statistics have good finite sample properties. Finally, the paper contains a real data application, which illustrates the usefulness of the proposed methods.},

The sequential estimates use p stopping rules for collecting the data and presumes a special modification the sample Fisher information matrix in the LS estimates. In case of Gaussian disturbances, the proposed estimates have non-asymptotic normal joint distribution for any values of unknown autoregressive parameters. It is shown that in the i.i.d. case with unspecified error distributions, the new estimates have the property of uniform asymptotic normality for unstable autoregressive processes under some general condition on the parameters. Examples of unstable autoregressive models satisfying this condition are considered.},

The theoretical properties of the resulting estimators are established, and they achieve the optimal convergence rate for the nonparametric functions. Since the objective function is non-smooth, an estimation procedure is proposed that uses induced smoothing and we prove that the smoothed estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the original estimator. Moreover, we propose a variable selection procedure based on the regularization method, which can simultaneously estimate and select important nonparametric components and has the asymptotic oracle property. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis show the usefulness of the proposed method.},

A naive nonparametric estimator is Watson and Leadbetter (Sankhyā: Indian J Stat Ser A 26(1):101–116, 1964)’s one, which is naturally given by the kernel density estimator and the empirical distribution estimator. We compare the asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) of the hazard estimators, and then, it is shown that the asymptotic variance of the new estimator is usually smaller than that of the naive one. We also discuss bias reduction of the proposed estimator and derived some modified estimators. While the modified estimators do not lose nonnegativity, their AMSE is small both theoretically and numerically.},

Such observation schemes are well known from ranked set sampling and judgment post-stratification. Within a general, not necessarily balanced setting we derive and compare the asymptotic distributions of three different estimators of the distribution function F: a stratified estimator, a nonparametric maximum-likelihood estimator and a moment-based estimator. Our functional central limit theorems generalize and refine previous asymptotic analyses. In addition, we discuss briefly pointwise and simultaneous confidence intervals for the distribution function with guaranteed coverage probability for finite sample sizes. The methods are illustrated with a real data example, and the potential impact of imperfect rankings is investigated in a small simulation experiment.},

The distribution of the outcome of the technical system is estimated in a regression model, where the distribution of the residuals is estimated on the basis of a conditional density estimate. It is shown how Monte Carlo can be used to estimate quantiles of the outcome of the technical system on the basis of the above estimates, and the rate of convergence of the quantile estimate is analyzed. Under suitable assumptions, it is shown that this rate of convergence is faster than the rate of convergence of standard estimates which ignore either the (imperfect) simulation model or the data from the technical system; hence, it is crucial to combine both kinds of information. The results are illustrated by applying the estimates to simulated and real data.},

  abstract     = {The parameter of interest considered is the unique solution to a set of estimating equations, such as regression parameters of generalised linear models. We consider a design-based approach; that is, the sampling distribution is specified by stratification, cluster (multi-stage) sampling, unequal selection probabilities, side information and a response mechanism. The proposed empirical likelihood approach takes into account of these features. Empirical likelihood has been mostly developed under more restrictive settings, such as independent and identically distributed assumption, which is violated under a design-based framework. A proper empirical likelihood approach which deals with cluster sampling, missing data and multidimensional parameters is absent in the literature. This paper shows that a cluster-level empirical log-likelihood ratio statistic is pivotal. The main contribution of the paper is to provide the rigorous asymptotic theory and underlining regularity conditions which imply $${\surd {n}}$$-consistency and the Wilks’s theorem or self-normalisation property. Negligible and large sampling fractions are considered.},

The models distinguish themselves from ordinary multivariate regression models in two aspects: (1) the dimension of the response vector and the number of covariates diverge to infinity; (2) the nonzero entries of the coefficient matrix and the precision matrix are sparse. We develop a two-stage sequential conditional selection (TSCS) approach to the identification and estimation of the nonzeros of the coefficient matrix and the precision matrix. It is established that the TSCS is selection consistent for the identification of the nonzeros of both the coefficient matrix and the precision matrix. Simulation studies are carried out to compare TSCS with the existing state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates that the TSCS approach outperforms the existing methods. As an illustration, the TSCS approach is also applied to a real dataset.},

The proposed method is formulated in a framework of gradient learning, equipped with a flexible reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The resultant optimization task is solved by an efficient proximal gradient descent algorithm. More importantly, the asymptotic estimation and selection consistencies of the proposed method are established without specifying any explicit model assumption, which assure that the true model structure in the PLMs can be correctly identified with high probability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also supported by a variety of simulated and real-life examples.},
