  abstract     = {The nature of supply chains presents a variety of issues related to uncertainties. Under various uncertainties, risk management plays a crucial role in an effective supply chain decision-making. The uncertainty involved in the risk assessment process can be divided into two types: random uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Fuzzy theory has been applied to deal with uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role and contribution of the fuzzy logic in the treatment of epistemic uncertainty into supply chain risk management approaches. A literature review process was performed, followed by analysis and discussions on the examined topic. The results revealed that the integration with multicriteria decision-making and disruptive analysis methods are the most common types adopted, with trend to petri nets and multicriteria decision-making approaches. Supply risks are the most studied type and identification and assessment are the most developed processes in supply chain risk management. Although the publications on the subject has been highlighted, they present some limitations related to the holistic complexity of risks in supply chains, the dynamic nature of the environment and the reliability of the background knowledge in the assessment. In that sense, these remarks reveal interesting future researches lines.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the portfolio optimization problem is approached. It is a NP-hard problem that consists in periodically creating an instance of the problem, using the time series of the shares value of a stock exchange. The instance is solved to determine the shares set that maximize the return, minimize the risk and minimize the number of selected shares. As far as we know, only three algorithms of the state-of-the-art of the portfolio selection problem with three objectives have been assessed. In this work, we propose a Fuzzy Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (FOMOPSO) that uses an auto-Tuning Fuzzy Controller. To validate our approach, a series of experiments with the realistic instances and the performance of the proposed algorithm were compared with three state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms using six commonly used metrics. To support the conclusions, two hypothesis tests were applied. The results show that the Fuzzy Rules auto-configuration contributes to that the proposed algorithm performance clearly outperforms three of the algorithms in comparison, for four of the metrics used.},

  abstract     = {In decision-making, the multiobjective portfolio selection problem (MPSP) consists of the selection of alternatives based on preferences of a particular decision-maker (DM). In real-world applications, MPSP has several conflicting criteria that DMs must consider to determine an appropriate solution. So far, only fuzzy outranking relations have been used in a relational system of preferences to guide the search process of genetic algorithms (NOSGAII), and ant colony optimization (NOACO) to approximate the region of interest (RoI) of MPSP involving DM’s preferences. The NOSGAII and NOACO strategies are sequential, and they face a real challenge when solving high-dimensional instances which is a decrement in the computational efficiency due to the increment in the number of objectives. The present research proposes to use parallelism to tackle the efficiency situation in metaheuristics. The study first identifies which approach approximates better the RoI, and then, it analyzes the effect of parallelism in the performance. The results showed that NOACO found more best compromises in almost all the instances than NOSGAII. Hence, it can be concluded that NOACO approximates better the RoI. Also, the results showed a better average speedup with coarse-grained parallelism in NOACO than with data-flow parallelism, suggesting the conclusion that ants independently working are faster than ants working collaboratively. Finally, the main contributions are (1) the analysis of the performance of the two approaches for MPSP, (2) the five parallel designs for NOACO, and (3) the parallel NOACO that speedups up to 2× the sequential version when solving MPSP.},

Another feature of human judgments that must be considered in these comparisons is their uncertainty in expressing the preference of elements. Combining these two features of human mind, a method is developed for pairwise comparisons, using trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In this paper, decision-makers are allowed to express their preferences and then determine their beliefs and hesitancy regarding these judgments. The application of the proposed method is demonstrated by a real world case about choosing strategic priorities of chain stores.

  abstract     = {Currently, there are many types of conversational agents whose goal is to emulate human behavior. These agents offer more believable conversations when their responses come from a deliberative process that mimics individuals’ character. Conversational agents are mainly used for response selection linguistics and context situated strategies. These approaches usually build rules to find answers in dialogues; however, this is not the best alternative when the communicative intentions are not literal and context dependent. Deliberative Agents can solve these issues and improve their selection process through the integration of preferences and personality in their cognitive process. Hence, this work investigates how to drive the expression of dialogues of a Conversational Deliberative Agent (CDA) through personality and fuzzy outranking relations; for this, it proposes the characterization of context, and corpus through speech acts theory, and also a selection process based on fuzzy outranking relations to compare corpus phrases and context to choose the best response. The main contributions of this work are (1) the agent architecture that integrates preferences and personality of an individual in the response selection cognitive process; (2) a characterization model of speech acting through criteria based on belief, desires, and intentions to define a more human behavior expression; and (3) the use of fuzzy outranking relations to select phrases from a corpus to match dialogue intentions. An experimental design demonstrated the aptitude of the developed CDA to offer quality responses on a tutor application. Also, the results showed the capacity of speech acts to handle contexts in dialogues.},

However, there is epistemic uncertainty in the assessment of investment projects, hence the hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) are appropriate tool for characterizing the revenue functions and cost functions. To get a more reasonable result in the three-way investment decisions, we introduce HFSs to DTRSs and explore a new three-way investment decision model. Firstly, we take into account the revenue and cost of DTRSs with hesitant fuzzy elements and propose a hesitant fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets (HFDTRSs) model. Then, we calculate the revenue functions and cost functions by aggregating hesitant fuzzy elements with the Bayesian decision procedure. Considering the differences in the personalities and attitudes of decision-makers, we propose optimistic strategy and pessimistic strategy to aggregate revenue functions and cost functions. Finally, based on the score of profit maximization, we make three-way investment decisions. A case study of coal investment was used to demonstrate the proposed methods.},

It argues that a combination of marketing decision support systems, multicriteria and multiobjective methodologies, fuzzy models, and agent technologies could be a valuable tool to assist marketing managers in new product design applications. In the multi-agent system architecture, software agents were classified into types and organized in teams. The first includes interface, task, and information agents. The second reflects Simon’s decision-making process, including intelligence, design, and choice teams. The communication between agents is carried out using an ontology.

  abstract     = {The preference values in group decision-making (GDM) process can differ significantly between different experts, which may yield a low level of group consensus. Therefore, different consensus models have been developed for the modification of preference values to assist experts in improving their consensus degrees. However, most consensus models do not consider collective intelligence (CI) that may decrease as the consensus degree increases under certain circumstances. From the perspective of CI, the distrust relationship allows the group to better explore the decision space, rather than prematurely converge on an agreed suboptimal solution. Inspired by this idea, a theoretical framework of solving intuitionistic fuzzy GDM problems with low group consensus is proposed in this paper, which mainly includes two steps: (1) building the trust/distrust relationships and (2) establishing a consensus model. For two experts with a direct relationship, the trust/distrust relationships between them are constructed by fusing their knowledge levels and representativeness levels. For two experts with an indirect relationship, a new operator is designed to construct the trust/distrust relationships between them, which can describe the information attenuation of the decreasing trust along with the increasing distrust. Additionally, a consensus model based on the social network relationships density and trust/distrust relationships is proposed, which improves consensus degree and CI level conducively. Finally, a ranking of alternatives is constructed to select the optimal alternative. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.},

To assess the lecturers’ research capacity, many quantitative and qualitative criteria are needed in the evaluation process. Therefore, lecturer’s research capacity evaluation can be viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem in vague environment. In 1985, Chen proposed arithmetic operations to deal with the generalized fuzzy numbers. However, there were some shortcomings associated with Chen’s arithmetic operations. In 2013, Dat et al. proposed an improved arithmetical operation of generalized fuzzy numbers to overcome the shortcomings of Chen’s arithmetic operations. This study aims to propose an extension of generalized fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate the lecturer’s research capacity. In the proposed approach, the improved arithmetical operation of generalized fuzzy numbers is used to aggregate weights of criteria and ratings of alternatives versus criteria. The membership functions of the weighted fuzzy decision matrix of lecturers are further developed based on linguistic expressions. Then, a simplified centroid-index ranking approach is applied to evaluate and rank the lecturer’s research capacity. Finally, a case study is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed MCDM approach.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally in supply chain management suppliers and customers are evaluated independently. This is in spite of the fact that supplier performance has direct impact on the performance of the customer. This research develops a mechanism for simultaneous evaluation and prioritization of supplier and customer using the sustainability metrics comprising economic, environment and social measures. In order to quantify the qualitative factors, priority index is introduced to measure the prioritization of customers and suppliers simultaneously. To get the priority index for each customer and supplier, a novel analytical hierarchical process-based fuzzy inference decision support system (AHP-FIDSS) has been introduced. An AHP-FIDSS involves the factor screening, hierarchical structure modeling, quantification of qualitative factors, and their conversion to quantitative values. AHP-FIDSS is knowledge-based system involving expert’s decision alternatives or logical rules. The number of input variables and their levels are proportional to the number of logical rules and rule size. In order to reduce the numbers of rules, a Taguchi orthogonal array is used that reduces the numbers of rules, thereby substantially simplifying the evaluation process A case study of a supply chain of surgical instruments has been presented for the real-time application of the proposed model. The results exhibited the simultaneous classification of customers and suppliers with respect to their priority index. Higher value of priority index indicates higher importance and vice versa. This research is useful for the supply chain mangers in procurement, sales and production to develop an importance classification for customers and suppliers in a supply chain.},

  abstract     = {Transshipment problems are special type of transportation problems in which goods are transported from a source to a destination through various intermediate nodes (sources/destinations), possibly to change the modes of transportation or consolidation of smaller shipments into larger or deconsolidation of shipments. These problems have found great applications in the era of e-commerce. The formulation of transshipment problems involves knowledge of parameters like demand, available supply, related cost, time, warehouse space, budget, etc. However, several types of uncertainties are encountered in formulating transshipment problem mathematically due to factors like lack of exact information, hesitation in defining parameters, unobtainable information or whether conditions. These types of uncertainty can be handled amicably by representing the related parameters as intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In this article, a fully fuzzy transshipment problem is considered in which the related parameters (supply, demand and cost) are assumed to be represented as trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The proposed method is based on ambiguity and vagueness indices, thereby taking into account hesitation margin in defining the values precisely. These indices are then used to rank fuzzy numbers to derive a fuzzy optimal solution. The technique described in this paper has an edge as it directly produces a fuzzy optimal solution without finding an initial basic feasible solution. The method can easily be employed to fuzzy transshipment problems involving trapezoidal intuitionistic, triangular intuitionistic, trapezoidal, triangular, interval valued fuzzy numbers and real numbers. The proposed technique is supported by numerical illustrations and it has been shown that the method described in the paper is computationally much more efficient than already existing method and is applicable to a larger set of problems.},

  abstract     = {Medical images may be corrupted by noise. This noise affects the image quality and can obscure important information required for accurate diagnosis. Effectively apply filtering techniques can facilitate diagnosis or reduce radiation exposure. In this paper, we introduce a parallel method designed to reduce mixed Gaussian-impulse noise from digital images. The method uses fuzzy logic and the fuzzy peer group concept. Implementations of the method on multi-core interface using the open multi-processing (OpenMP) and on graphics processing units (GPUs) using CUDA are presented. Efficiency is measured in terms of execution time and in terms of MAE, PSNR and SSIM over medical images from the mini-MIAS database and over computed radiography (CR) images generated at different exposure levels. These images have been contaminated with impulsive and/or Gaussian noise. Experiments show that the proposed method obtains good performance in terms of the above mentioned objective quality measures. After applying multi-core and GPUs optimization strategies, the observed time shows that the new filter allows to remove mixed Gaussian-impulse noise in real-time.},

  abstract     = {Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems are playing a major role in the present electrical energy systems. The solar PV gives nonlinear I–V and P–V characteristics. As a result, it is difficult to extract the maximum power of the solar PV. Under Partial Shading Conditions (PSCs), the solar PV characteristics consist of multiple local Maximum Power Points (MPPs) and one global MPP. The classical Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques cannot track the global MPP under PSCs. Accordingly, this work aims to study the performance of five soft computing MPPT techniques. The studied five soft computing MPPT techniques are Modified Variable Step Size-Radial Basis Functional Network (MVSS-RBFN), Modified Hill-Climb with Fuzzy Logic Controller (MHC-FLC), Artificial Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Perturb and Observe with Practical Swarm Optimization (P&amp;O-PSO), and Adaptive Cuckoo Search (ACS). The comparative performance analysis of five soft computing techniques has been carried out against the Variable Step Size-Incremental Resistance (VSS-INR), and Variable Step Size-Feedback Controller (VSS-FC)-based MPPT techniques. The performance analysis of seven MPPT techniques has been done by considering the parameters are steady-state settling time, MPP tracking speed, algorithm complexity, PV array dependency, handling of partial shading, and efficiency.},

However, due to the mechanism flexibility, the system dynamics have high nonlinearity and complexity, which make controller design pretty challenging. Moreover, in real production, electromechanical systems, including flexible manipulators, usually suffer from nonlinear input dead-zones and unknown system parameters/structures. Considering the above problems, an adaptive fuzzy control method is proposed, which can make the flexible link reach a desired rotation angle within finite time and simultaneously suppress the vibration of the manipulator. In the meantime, the system uncertainties are compensated, and the effect of input dead-zones is eliminated. In addition, the stability of the equilibrium point for the single-link flexible manipulator system is proven by rigorous theoretical analysis.

Tan-type time-varying Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is applied to address the output constraints. Next, in the formation control design, bioinspired models are combined with backstepping techniques to achieve less calculation.

In this paper, based on the clustering by competitive agglomeration (CA), the idea of the “Competitive Learning Mechanism” is introduced to picture fuzzy clustering to obtain the competitive agglomeration picture fuzzy clustering (CAPFCM). The competitive learning regular term of the CAPFCM objective function is reinterpreted from the perspective of minimizing the entropy, and the general framework of the entropy competitive clustering algorithm is constructed. Moreover, the competitive learning regular term of the objective function is replaced by quadratic entropy, Renyi entropy or Shannon entropy to obtain different entropy competitive clustering. To improve the efficiency of the CAPFCM algorithm, the suppressed factor is introduced to appropriately increase the maximum value of the picture fuzzy partition information for different clusters and suppress all others. In addition, this paper proposes a robust adaptive entropy competitive picture fuzzy clustering segmentation algorithm with neighborhood spatial information constraints to enhance the anti-noise ability of the picture fuzzy clustering algorithm for noise image.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multitasking is an emerging subject in the field of evolutionary computation. By adopting methods to effectively discover and implicitly transfer useful genetic materials from one task to another, it can process multiple optimization tasks simultaneously using one evolutionary calculation. Inspired by the idea of evolutionary multitasking, it can be also used in optimization problems of fuzzy systems (FSs). By exchanging optimization experience and knowledge between different FSs, it is expected to enhance the speed and efficiency of FS optimization and be applied to FS optimization tasks with higher requirement for running time and accuracy of results. Moreover, using the experience and knowledge of simple FSs optimization tasks to facilitate the optimization of complex FSs, it can resolve high time consuming and high cost that triggered by large, complex FSs optimization problems and improve the feasibility of its application in large complex fuzzy control optimization problems. Different from the general multi-task learning, the multi-task learning of FS optimization has its own features. Consequently, based on the thought of evolutionary multitasking and the traits of multi-task learning of FS optimization, a general framework of multitasking genetic fuzzy system (MTGFS) is proposed to effectively solve the multi-task optimization problems of fuzzy systems. A multitasking evolutionary optimization algorithm for Mamdani fuzzy systems with fully overlapping triangle membership functions (FOTMF-M-MTGFS) is also designed and implemented. Comparative studies with genetic fuzzy system (GFS), a single-task optimization algorithm of FSs, indicate that the evolution speed and result of the MTGFS are superior than GFS on average.},

  abstract     = {Most patients have more than one disease, and these diseases are able to affect one another. In modern medicine, the etiology and pathophysiology of diseases are well known in detail. However, inter-disease relationships are still mysterious. Physicians’ knowledge and experience have great importance in such a multi-criteria case. Because medical doctors in internal medicine clinics deal with large numbers of patients with multiple diseases, they have quite a complex approach in treating illness. In this context, exposing the cause-and-effect relationships among diseases frequently seen in internal medicine will contribute to physicians’ ability to blend profound theoretical knowledge with experiential results. Therefore, this study presents a fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial-and-Evaluation Laboratory) method to assess the most common diseases in internal medicine outpatient clinics. The DEMATEL method allows one to identify and analyze significant diseases in internal medicine by considering the cause-and-effect relationship diagram. Likewise, fuzzy sets in DEMATEL overcome the uncertainty in making decisions about disease relationships and internal medicine experts’ judgments. When investigating the results, we have found dyspepsia, hyperlipidemia, and anemia to be crucial in terms of causes. When evaluating the effects, the most notable diseases are understood to be renal failure, malignancy, and hepatitis. The results indicate that in the presented study, we could successfully apply these methods to reveal the cause–effect of diseases. The results of this study will contribute to understanding the complex multi-criteria relationship among internal diseases using internists’ opinions.},

  abstract     = {Hospitals’ daily operations have become increasingly dependent on medical devices. However, the occurrence of faults is inevitable. Therefore, it is crucial for hospitals to make timely fault diagnoses and enact the corresponding measures and improvements. This paper proposes a novel concept lattice method for the intelligent diagnosis of medical device faults. To minimize the influence of uncertain factors, fuzzy sets are used to accurately express relationships between concepts. First, the occurrence frequency and severity of each fault type are extracted based on the collected information. Then, the fuzzy formal context of occurrent faults and known faults can be constructed. Next, the corresponding fuzzy concept lattice is established and visualized using a Hasse diagram. Finally, the similarity between the concept lattices is calculated and used for fault diagnosis. Here, the weight factors are determined using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. A comparative analysis is performed to show that the proposed method uses simple calculations and is highly accurate.},

  abstract     = {Comparing probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) is quite essential in solving PLTS-expressed multi-attribute group decision-making problems (PLTS-MAGDM). Researchers have designed various comparison measures to obtain the rank of PLTSs. However, most of the existing PLTS comparison measures need additional tedious adjustments before conducting a specific computation. Besides, these measures do not adequately consider the effects of the semantics of the basic linguistic term set and the probabilistic distributions. This paper proposes a new preference degree for g-granularity probabilistic term sets (g-GPLTSs) to overcome the two shortcomings simultaneously by integrating the effect from basic linguistic terms and probabilistic distributions without any adjustment. Moreover, the g-GPLTS preference degree also shows the extended adaptability for comparing PLTSs with unbalanced semantics. Based on the newly proposed preference degree, we construct a useful min-conflict model to solve PLTS-MAGDM with a large number of experts expressing the three-way primary grading. Finally, an illustrative example concerning software supplier selections, followed by the comparative analysis, is presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In group decision-making (GDM) problems, it is quite common for decision-makers (DMs) to elicit their knowledge with probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preference relations (PHFPRs), in which consistency adjustment and alternatives’ weight vector determination play a key role in the decision-making process. This study aims at constructing a decision-making model with PHFPRs. First, several new concepts are introduced, including the multiplicative consistency and consistency index of PHFPRs. Then, we present a construction approach for the multiplicative consistent PHFPRs, and a convergent local consistency improvement process for PHFPRs is designed to detect and improve their consistency when the PHFPRs do not meet the consistency level. The local adjustment strategy is utilized to retain the preference evaluation of DMs as much as possible. Afterwards, based on the obtained efficiency score values, we propose a new data envelopment analysis model to derive the weight values of alternatives. Furthermore, we explore a decision-making method with PHFPRs to obtain the optimal selection from the alternatives. Finally, an applied case about logistics company assessment is presented, and the effectiveness and rationality of the explored method are verified by the comparison with the various approaches.},

The analytical and closed form expressions of the fuzzy additions of the generalized fuzzy numbers and the interval type 2 fuzzy numbers (IT2FS) are developed. The generalized fuzzy numbers is a non-flat and subnormal fuzzy number with different left and right shape functions. Classical fuzzy operations based on the minimum t-norm could lead to uncontrollable fuzziness. Fuzzy addition based on generalized t-norm can better control ambiguity. In order to control the ambiguity of fuzzy addition, this paper is to develop a general type 1 fuzzy set and interval type 2 fuzzy set (IT2FS) additions based on t-norm. The closed forms of the generalized IT2FS additions based on some popular t-norms are formulated. The specific analytical and closed form expressions based on Archimedean t-norms: e.g. drastic, Łukasiewicz, product and the families of Schweizer-Sklar and Yager t-norms are derived. The IT2FS are widely used to characterize the natural words, e.g. the decision making linguistic judgments, the fuzzy real time control systems with linguistic rules. Furthermore, based on the analytical T1FS additions results, the application to the linguistic multiple criteria decision making aggregation of the IT2FS additions based on t-norms is introduced. A comparative MCDM numerical example is demonstrated for the verification of the developed closed form expressions.},

On the basis of a modified version of NTSM, a category of saturated NTSM controller is first constructed to ensure that the states can reach the sliding surface and finite-time converge to the origin. On this basis, a fuzzy logic controller including two fuzzy input variables and a fuzzy output variable is developed to adaptively adjust the control gain such that the gain of the NTSM controller can be automatically minimized. This also implies that the chattering phenomenon encountered by most conventional sliding mode control (SMC) schemes can be significantly attenuated without sacrificing inherent properties. Finally, in comparison with a traditional SMC method, the superiority of the presented algorithm is confirmed by the comparative simulation results in terms of chattering alleviation and robustness.},

Besides, by introducing an adaptive mechanism to estimate the norm of weight vectors in the FLS, the developed controller can not only reduce the number of adaptive parameters but also is effective to compensate for unknown nonlinearity under the influence of actuator faults. Furthermore, it can be shown that the consensus errors are uniformly ultimately bounded by utilizing the proposed method.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel robust model-free adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy sliding mode control (MF-AIT2FSMC) for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system using nonlinear disturbance observer. The main control objective is to adjust the oxygen stoichiometry at its reference trajectory under load disturbances and parameter uncertainties, to avert the oxygen starvation problem and to obtain maximum net power. The referred MF-AIT2FSMC control strategy is composed of three parts: first, a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed to estimate both oxygen and nitrogen partial pressures which are considered as unmeasurable variables. Second, a nonlinear disturbance observer-based intelligent proportional-integral (NDBO-iPI) control is derived, whereas the NDBO is used to estimate the unmodeled system dynamics via the knowledge of input and output signals. Third, adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control is inserted to NDBO-iPI control to compensate the NDBO estimation error, enhance the control performance and ensure the global controlled system stability. Furthermore, the entire controlled system stability is verified via the Lyapunov approach. Finally, the corresponding numerical simulation on the PEMFC system is obtained to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed MF-AIT2FSMC technique by comparing with the NDBO-iPI and standard PID controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an intelligent adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control method using fuzzy broad learning system (FBLS) and investigates how the method can be applied to control a tool-grinding servo control (TGSC) system. Due to accuracy, quality and geometric errors which are often difficult to capture the dynamics of the controlled plants or systems, fixed-gain PID controllers without good three-term parameters cannot meet the stringent control performance specifications of nonlinear industrial systems and servomechanisms. To accomplish better control, an adaptive PID control strategy based on the FBLS, or abbreviated as FBLS-APPID, is rigorously proposed by integrating an online parameter learning FBLS identifier together with an adaptive predictive PID control law using FBLS, to eliminate tracking error and achieve fast-tracking and disturbance rejection. Numerical simulations on the two existing discrete-time nonlinear time-delay processes are performed to show the merits and superiority of the constructed FBLS-APPID by comparing to three existing adaptive PID methods. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is well exemplified by conducting comparatively experimental results on a servo control loop of a real TGSC machine with fixed PID gains tuned by the proposed FBLS-APPID method.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a freight routing problem considering both soft delivery time windows and demand and capacity uncertainty in a road–rail intermodal transportation system is investigated. According to fuzzy set theory, uncertain demands and capacities are formulated as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Soft delivery time windows under a fuzzy environment is established, in which fuzzy periods caused by early and late deliveries that lead to penalty are modeled based on maximum functions. To solve the routing problem yielding the above characteristics, this study designs a fuzzy mixed-integer nonlinear programming model whose objective is to minimize the total costs created in the road–rail intermodal transportation activities. After using the fuzzy expected value method to address the fuzzy objective, two fuzzy approaches, i.e., fuzzy chance-constrained programming method and fuzzy ranking method, are separately adopted to undertake the defuzzification of the fuzzy constraints. Improved linear formulations of the model are then produced to make it easier to solve. A simulation-based reliability modeling is developed to quantify the reliability of the optimization results given by different fuzzy approaches under different parameter settings in a simulation environment. Finally, an empirical case is presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed methods. The effects of demand and capacity fuzziness on the routing optimization are revealed, and an optimization procedure that helps decision-makers to select a more suitable fuzzy approach and determine the best parameter setting for a given case is demonstrated. Some insights that are helpful for organizing a reliable transportation are also drawn.},

Utilizing the special properties of graphene, which has excellent thermal conductivity, it is found that it successfully lowers the cutting temperature generated during processing, reduces tool wear, and improves the quality of micromilling products. Using a self-developed ultrasonic atomization system effectively improves the agglomeration of nanoparticles in nanofluids and increases the lubrication efficiency of nanoparticles. The experimental plot is robustly designed, and the L18(21 × 37) orthogonal table is used to find the optimal combination of parameters. The control factors are the average thickness of the nanographene, density of nanofluid, spindle speed, distance of nozzle, feed rate, amount ultrasonic atomization, air pressure, nozzle angle, and using gray correlation analysis with fuzzy inference to find more heavy quality characteristics. Finally, the optimal parameter combination of multi-quality characteristics enhanced by nanofluid (graphene)/ultrasonic atomization MQL is compared with the base fluid/ultrasonic atomization MQL, nanofluid (MWCNTs)/ultrasonic atomization MQL, whereas the differences in micromilling force, temperature, tool wear, and workpiece burr are discussed. The results indicate that the use of nanofluid (graphene)/ultrasonic atomization MQL has better results than other lubrication methods.},

The algorithm uses our proposed Euclidean random comprehensive absolute distance (ERCAD for short) as a measurement, under the fuzzy measure, the lower bound, the principal value and the upper bound of the triangular fuzzy normal random variables are iterated, respectively, by means, and then the cluster center is updated until it becomes stable and unchanged. Then we analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithm, and test the algorithm under different sample sets by random simulation experiments. We get the highest clustering accuracy of 99.00% and the maximum Kappa coefficient of 0.9850, and draw the conclusion that TFNRV-k-means clustering algorithm has good clustering effect.

Aiming at this problem, GA is used to optimize the initial center positions and width of the activation function and weight of FCMNN. After obtaining the optimal initial parameters, the internal parameters of FCMNN can approach the convergence value of minimum error more quickly and accurately through further training of the network, so as to obtain better network learning performance.

We propose a rough set-based gained and lost dominance score method in which experts are supposed to use linguistic terms to express their information. First, we combine rough numbers with linguistic scale functions to depict the semantics of linguistic terms and convert the formal expression information of linguistic terms into numerical information, which has an advantage of expressing imprecision and subjective judgments of experts. In addition, given that different experts often have different emphases on different attributes, we investigate a rough set-based gained and lost dominance score method in which experts have different weights for different criteria. Finally, an illustrative example of selecting the optimal third-party cold chain medicine logistics is given with comparative analysis, showing the efficiency of the proposed method. This method provides a new way to solve the selection problem of third-party logistics suppliers.},

Based on the minimum cost consensus model, this paper proposes a new minimum cost consensus model with distributionally robust chance constraints (DRO-MCC). Firstly, Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is used to approximate the chance constraints in the cost model. Secondly, when the information of the first and second moments of random variables affecting the unit adjustment cost are known, the min-max problem is obtained based on the moment method and dual theory, and a tractable semidefinite programming problem can be easily processed through further transformation. Finally, in order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model, the results of different parameters are compared, and the DRO-MCC is compared with the robust optimization model (RO-MCC) and the minimum cost consensus model (MCC). The example proves that MCC is too optimistic and RO-MCC is too conservative. In contrast, DRO-MCC overcomes the conservatism of robust optimization and considers the probability information of data, so the result is more ideal.},

  abstract     = {Plant location selection (PLS) is a typical and complex multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem, which requires consideration of several alternatives and multiple attributes. However, existing research results on PLS lack sufficient consideration of complex relationship patterns between attributes, which often leads to inaccurate decision results. Thus, in this paper, a new MAGDM technique is proposed to solve the problem of PLS, in which complex interrelationship structures exist between multi-inputs and attribute values are represented as interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic variables (IVIULVs). First, to solve the shortcomings of the existing operations, some new operational rules are redefined for IVIULVs based on linguistic scale functions and Archimedean T-conorms and T-norms. These new rules of operation hold the closedness, and are flexible for semantic transformation processing. Then, to more accurately reflect the partition structure and the complex interrelationship pattern among multi-input arguments, we extend the traditional Hamy mean and propose the partitioned Hamy mean (PHAM), which can eliminate the impact of unrelated attributes on the results and meet the semantic conversion needs of different decision makers. Furthermore, we develop two new fuzzy linguistic aggregation operators: interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic PHAM (IVIULPHAM) and its weighted version (IVIULWPHAM). Finally, a novel MAGDM technique (IVIUL-MAGDM) based on the IVIULWPHAM operator is proposed to solve the problem of PLS. Several examples of PLS are also illustrated to show the validity and advantages of the IVIUL-MAGDM method by comparing with the other existing MAGDM methods.},

DE solves nonlinear optimization problems, and a successful control mechanism for population diversity enhances the performance of DE. This study proposed a control mechanism that contains a novel mutation strategy and FIS because FIS is suitable for consecutive and hard classified inputs. The proposed control mechanism does not fix the target vector and controls the ratio of mutating toward the whole best individual by FIS. The FIS decides the F values for this novel mutation strategy. The experiments compared the winner of each evaluated functions among four uniform diversity goals (UDGs) with conventional strategies. From experimental results, the proposed method finds superior solutions to conventional mutation strategies at least 11 out of 15 evaluated functions in 10, 30, and 50 dimensions. Furthermore, not only the diversity curves confirm the control ability of FIS, but also different paths of convergence curves indicate the fast convergence and mitigation of evolutionary stagnation.},

The KC is responsible for creating the reference values of velocities transmitted to the robot dynamics. To design the KC, we present a simple and effective way of actualizing the KC based on the extended nonlinear kinematic model of the differential-drive mobile robots. The stability of the tracking system with the proposed KC is proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Moreover, the fuzzy technique is also applied to the KC to enhance the quality of the tracking control when the reference trajectory has rapid changes in terms of coordinates or velocities.

  abstract     = {In the causal relationship, a mediator variable is a variable that causes mediation in the dependent and the independent variables. If x is a predictor and y is a response variable, then w is a moderator variable that influences the causal relationship of x and y. A moderator variable is a variable that affects the strength of the relationship between a dependent and independent variable. When there are many complicated causal relations, a mediation analysis or a moderation analysis can be performed considering the existence of mediators or moderators. Moreover, when both mediators and moderators exist, a mediation–moderation analysis can be performed. The existence of these variables occurs in many fields, including social science, medical science, and natural science, etc. However, the values of such variables used are often observed as fuzzy numbers rather than as crisp numbers (real numbers). So in many cases, fuzzy analysis is required because observations are observed with ambiguous values, but in the meantime, only models that use crisp numbers rather than fuzzy numbers have been used. This paper proposes fuzzy moderation analysis and fuzzy moderated-mediation analysis as the first attempts of the moderation and moderated-mediation analysis using fuzzy data. The proposed models can also be used for science and engineering, medical data, but it can also be applied to the humanities fields, where a lot of ambiguous data are observed. For example, data from the humanities fields such as marketing, education or psychology, the data are observed based on a human’s mind. Nevertheless, they have been analyzed using crisp data so far. In this paper, we define several fuzzy moderation models and fuzzy mediation–moderation models considering various situations based on fuzzy least squares estimation (FLSE). In addition, the validity of the proposed model is shown in some examples; it compares the results with existing analysis using crisp data.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, Decomposed Fuzzy Systems (DFS) structure is applied to design single intersection signal fuzzy controller. The DFS structure is to decompose each fuzzy variable into layers of fuzzy systems and each layer is to characterize one traditional fuzzy set. DFS adjusts the fuzzy membership function, the leading part, and enriches the fuzzy rule base through structural changes, thus provides the system with more adjustable parameters to facilitate possible adaptation in fuzzy rules, but without introducing a learning burden. It also can be found that the function approximation capability of the DFS is much better than that of the traditional fuzzy systems. At the same time, in order to solve possible defects brought by expert experience, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the optimization of DFS rule base in this paper. Taking the four-phase single intersection as a case study, an intersection signal control algorithm is obtained using the proposed DFS based on Genetic Algorithm (G-DFS). Simulation results show that the G-DFS controller reduces average vehicle delay, queuing length, average parking rate, and average vehicle travel time effectively, and the controller can smoothly adapt to different traffic flow changes.},

To resolve the control challenge caused by the quantization effect, a nonlinear decomposition of the quantizer is proposed and applied to the controller design in the last step of the backstepping-based control approach. Combining with fuzzy logic systems, the unknown nonlinear functions contained in the researched nonlinear system is disposed without knowing some restrictive conditions of uncertainties. The developed controller guarantees that the system output converges to a small neighborhood of the desired reference signal and all the signals of the closed-loop system are bounded. Finally, simulation results are depicted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed control algorithm.},

The mainframe of this study is to implement a novel kinematic control structure based on visual sevoing and hybrid algorithms in real-time mobile robot applications. First, the structure of the proposed algorithm based on the visual information extracted from an overhead camera has been addressed. Then, the classification process of robot position and orientation, target, and obstacles has been addressed. Second, the path planning algorithms’ initial parameters and obstacles-free path coordinates have been determined by visual information extracted from images in real time. In this step, the interval type-2 fuzzy inference (IT2FIS) algorithm and various algorithms used in path planning have been compared and their performances have been analyzed. The third stage handled the path-following process using a novel control structure for keeping up the robot on the generated path. In this step, the proposed approach is compared with fuzzy Type-1/Type-2 and fuzzy-PID control algorithms, and their results have been analyzed statistically. The proposed system has been successfully implemented on several maps.

The proposed model is robust to several challenging image conditions like low contrast/illumination, haze/blur, occlusion, camouflage, background clutter, and poses variation. The model is tested on our thermal animal dataset that has 1862 images and 12 different animal species. Experimental results validate the significance of thermal images for animal-based applications.

Furthermore, the improved OWA aggregation method is applied to make the aggregation of historical information more practical. To overcome the deficiency of slow convergence speed and easy to entrap into the local extremum of the wolf pack algorithm (WPA), the chemotactic behavior and elimination–dispersal behavior of bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) are employed to optimize the scouting behavior of WPA. The actual enrollments data of the University of Alabama and Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) are utilized as the benchmark data and the computational results of both training and testing phases all indicate that the new forecasting model outperforms other existing models.

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a new decision analysis method combining quantitative logic and fuzzy soft set theory. Firstly, we transform a fuzzy information system into a fuzzy soft set, and then establish a formal language based on the fuzzy soft set, in which the parameters of fuzzy soft set are regarded as atomic formulas, some atomic formulas are connected by the logical connectives and then a logical formula is formed, and a implicative type of formula is interpreted as a soft decision rule (SDR). Secondly, various types of measures to evaluate the SDR are introduced and then the soft metric between two logical formulas is established. Thirdly, we apply the soft metric to the soft decision analysis, a SDR extraction algorithm for fuzzy decision information system and a corresponding recommendation algorithm are proposed. Finally, some attribute analysis examples, including the example as shown in rough sets and the practical credit card application example, are given to illustrate the newly proposed method and related concepts.},

  abstract     = {The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) method is regarded as one of the most well-known statistical multivariate analysis methods, which is used to discover the underlying structure of a relatively large set of variables. The EFA has a wide range of applications due to its properties such as data reduction. In this paper, the fuzzy EFA (FEFA) method was developed to maintain the uncertain nature of the data related to the variables. The FEFA method is used to construct an e-learning service quality assessment model. Several assignment criteria have been classified to identify the strengths and weaknesses of an e-learning system, to provide an information system for educational institutions, and rank these information systems. The assessment measures of an e-learning service are determined from the students’ and users’ perspectives by exploring previous models and using open questionnaires. In addition, due to the typical uncertainty of assessment indicators, a questionnaire was designed with triangular fuzzy numbers to increase the value of the information collected from evaluating e-learning users. By implementing the developed FEFA, an e-learning assessment model was constructed with 13 latent variables including reliable infrastructure, benefits and financial support, government support, perception and knowledge, educational facilities, quality of holding classes, entrance conditions, meeting the needs of students, process of education, planning, flexibility of courses, professors’ opinion, and information exchange.},

Only then, the D/t ratio is increased and reduced the hoop stress, self-stress in the steel tube. To analyze the D/t ratio, the confinement effect and axial load capacity is determined. After that, the concrete strength is also analyzed according to their statistical measures like output target ratio (OTR), precision, efficiency, mean value (MV), mean square error (MSE), standard deviation (SD), etc. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB platform and compared with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method.

The significant features of the proposed correlation coefficient are that the HFLTSs need not to be extended to the same length and the correlation coefficient lies in $$[-1,1]$$ . Two examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed correlation coefficient. Secondly, based on the proposed correlation coefficient and the collaborative filtering algorithm, we develop a new method to deal with incomplete hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. Furthermore, by analysing the correlation coefficient matrix, we present a new method for determining experts’ weights based on the concept of ‘attenuation’ and ‘how much trust’ they obtained.

However, there are some deficiencies that have been encountered in the pre-processing of video frames before attaining classified video archives. To overcome the drawbacks in pre-processing, feature extraction and classification approaches are considered. Here, video indexing has been anticipated with several features’ extraction with dominant frame generation for the input video frame. Fuzzy-based SVM classifier is utilized to categorize frame set into dominant structures. Multi-dimensional Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and colour feature extraction are used to extract texture features from the video frame. Using the frame sequence, the vector space of structures is captured; dominant frameworks are utilized in video indexing. Shot transitions’ classification is done with a fuzzy system. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that shot boundary detection accuracy increases with an increase in iterations. The simulation was carried out in MATLAB environment. This technique attains an accuracy of about 95.4%, the precision of 100%, and the F1 score of 100% and a recall of 100%. The misclassification rate is 4.6%. The proposed method shows better trade-off than the existing techniques.},

  abstract     = {Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) deriving from big data bring us the perspective in many fields. However, online performing both processing noisy and massive databases (NMDs) and training ANFISs is a challenge. Inspired by this aim, we propose a strategy with two phases, offline and online. The offline discovers an optimal data screening threshold (ODST) which is interpreted as an index to measure the uncertainty of the data in a data cluster. A new algorithm named A-ODST is proposed to estimate the ODST. Using the kernel fuzzy C-means clustering technique, a new filter named FbMU for blurring the ODST-based measured data-uncertainty is presented. An improved algorithm named NMD-ANFIS is presented to build the ANFIS from the NMD filtered by the FbMU. Based on the three main contributions of this paper to be the A-ODST, FbMU, and NMD-ANFIS, processing NMD and training ANFIS can be performed synchronously in the online phase. The combination of the solution to optimize the cluster data space via the NMD-ANFIS to simplify ANFIS’s structure and the filtering strategy of the FbMU for removing all the data points belonging to the data clusters with the highest uncertainty allows both filtering noise and reducing the size of the database to improve the calculating cost. Surveys from two experimental systems were carried out to verify these aspects. The compared results showed that the predicting error and the calculating time of the ANFISs built by the proposed method were better than that from the other surveyed methods.},

If the input, intermediate, and output parameters are available in a two-stage network, DEA and DEA-R models can be used to compute the efficiency. When evaluating decision-making units (DMUs) in two-stage network DEA, the respective programming models are fractional. Meanwhile, in DEA-R, the proposed programming models are linear. Although, it is necessary that the output-to-input ratios (output-orientation) or vice versa (input orientation) be defined and available. Furthermore, DEA-R models can also evaluate DMUs with a network structure when only ratio data are available. Generally, using fuzzy data is necessary for an accurate evaluation of organizations with a two-stage network structure. Therefore, in the present article, using the α-cut approach, an average efficiency model is proposed for the first and second stages of a network structure. At the end, a comparison is made between the mean efficiency scores of a number of airlines by considering fuzzy data in two-stage network DEA and DEA-R.},

This study presents a less labor-intensive method to count mitotic cells in breast cell sections. The proposed algorithm involves two phases: candidate segmentation and detection. During candidate segmentation, images are filtered through a blue ratio threshold to remove unnecessary background information and to increase the color difference between targets and non-targets for an entire digitized image. A fuzzy candidate segmentation method is used to adaptively determine threshold values in order to dichotomize gray-level images and distinguish the images of mitotic candidates from the background. The thresholding scheme integrates the spatial characteristics’ distribution in a histogram to determine an intensity threshold for the processed image, in order to filter insignificant information. During the detection phase, a two-class classification uses an attention mechanism that is realized by a set of fully connected neural networks, instead of convolutional layers, which decreases the computational cost. The validation test using ICPR2012 competition datasets shows that the proposed model outperforms current state-of-art techniques, in terms of the metrics, Accuracy, F1-score, and Precision and Recall.},

Three solution concepts of credibilistic loss aversion Nash equilibria (i.e., expected loss aversion Nash equilibrium, optimistic loss aversion Nash equilibrium and pessimistic loss aversion Nash equilibrium) and their existence theorems are proposed. The sufficient and necessary conditions are presented to find three equilibria. It is found that three credibilistic loss aversion Nash equilibria are equivalent if confidence level is equal to 0.5. Furthermore, an analysis on credibilistic loss aversion equilibria with respect to loss aversion is performed in a 2 × 2 bimatrix game with triangular fuzzy payoffs. It is found that with a higher probability a more loss-averse player receives a preferred payoff in the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in some situations, but receives the second highest payoff in other situations.

  abstract     = {As a typical multiple criteria comprehensive evaluation (MCCE) problem, healthcare insurance audits (HIA) play a vital role in governmental audits. To handle the HIA in an autonomous region in China, a systematic methodology in the framework of MCCE is presented. An evaluation system is constructed at first based on the specific auditing objective. The group of individual preferences is collected by a probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR). Its consistency and prioritization are handled based on the idea of stochastic analysis and the widely acknowledged techniques of linguistic preference relations (LPRs). Specifically, the consistency degree is measured by the probability of stochastically generated LPRs being with acceptable consistency, and then improved by revising the probabilistic distributions involved in the PLPR. The priority is derived by the expected value of priorities of the stochastically generated LPRs. Moreover, the comprehensive evaluation is conducted based on aspiration-based utility functions. The proposed methodology enables decision makers to determine parameters intuitively, and presents interpretable and admissible results. It is effective even if the original individual preferences are with low consistency degree. Finally, the focused HIA problem is solved based on the proposed methodology.},

The proposed multi-criteria group decision-making method first uses analytic hierarchy process to construct decision preference matrix. Then, it uses hesitant probabilistic fuzzy linguistic set to model both types of uncertainties with hesitancy using both qualitative and quantitative terms. The proposed decision-making method is applied to determine the ranking of three Indian states for business climate and potential using real criteria information from State’s investment potential index. Since success or failure of real estate investment decisions depends on the assessment and management of the inherent risk and uncertainty, the proposed method is applied on a real estate investment problem and results are compared with a group consensus model for evaluating real estate investment alternatives.},

For generating more precise level of decision-rules, granular computing (GrC) approach was employed. The proposed 4WIDS method was appropriate for the classification of the multi-attribute information into four different regions as positive IFS, negative IFS, uncertain IFS and gray IFS regions. Detail methodology of the 4WIDS was explained by presenting its representation in a precise way. This study also presented various definitions, properties and theorems in the support of the 4WIDS method. The 4WIDS was applied in benchmark datasets that included Pima Indians diabetes, Thyroid disease, Fisher’s Iris and Spambase datasets. Experimental results including statistical analysis indicated that the proposed 4WIDS outperformed existing classification methods, such as Naive Bayes, Decision tree, PART, J48, logistic model trees (LMT), rough set (RS), gray multi-granulation rough set (GMGRS) and multi-granulation fuzzy rough set (MGFRS).},

  abstract     = {In multi-attribute two-sided matching (MATSM) problems, the attribute weights play an important role. The existing methods usually neglect the interaction and the effect among multiple attributes, resulting in irrational matching results. This paper takes this interaction into consideration. With the complexity of the matching environment, the uncertainties of agents should be considered. The probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a useful tool to describe the uncertainty and the limited cognition of agents. Thus, this paper aims to provide a novel MATSM method under the probabilistic linguistic environment with unknown attribute weights. Firstly, the attribute weights are determined by providing the probabilistic linguistic decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (PL-DEMATEL) method. Besides, this paper constructs the gain and loss (GL) matrices and calculates the agents’ perceived values (PVs) by introducing prospect theory (PT). Then, the PVs are aggregated into the comprehensive PVs (CPVs) based on the obtained attribute weights. Next, this paper also proposes a ranking method, called probabilistic linguistic multi-attribute border approximation area comparison (PL-MABAC) method, to rank the multiple agents, which lay a solid foundation for stable matching constraint of the programming model. The matching results are obtained by solving the programming model. Finally, a case study of matching medical treatment service providers and demanders is presented to validate the proposed method. The comparative analyses and discussions are also provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Air pollution is one of the main environmental issues faced by most countries around the world. Forecasting air pollution occurrences is an essential topic in air quality research due to the increase in awareness of its association with public health effects, and its development is vital to managing air quality. However, most previous studies have focused on enhancing accuracy, while very few have addressed uncertainty analysis, which may lead to insufficient results. The fuzzy time-series model is a better option in air pollution forecasting. Nevertheless, it has a limitation caused by utilizing a random partitioning of the universe of discourse. This study proposes a novel Markov weighted fuzzy time-series model based on the optimum partition method. Fitting the optimum partition method has been done based on five different partition methods via two stages. The proposed model is first applied for forecasting air pollution using air pollution index (API) data collected from an air monitoring station located in Klang city, Malaysia. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated based on three statistical criteria, which are the mean absolute percentage error, mean squared error and Theil’s U statistic, using the daily API data. For further validation of the model, it is also implemented for benchmark enrolment data from the University of Alabama. According to the analysis results, the proposed model greatly improved the performance of air pollution index and enrolment prediction accuracy, for which it outperformed several state-of-the-art fuzzy time-series models and classic time-series models. Thus, the proposed model could be a better option for air quality forecasting for managing air pollution.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the design of an intuitionistic fuzzy controller for synchronization of two non-identical hyperchaotic systems is proposed. Since hyperchaotic systems has high sensitivity to the initial condition, disturbance and parameter variability. Synchronization of hyperchaotic systems is used to test the controller performance. On the other hand, using of fuzzy logic-based controller has an increasing tendency. As known, fuzzy logic control (FLC), only membership functions are used to obtain a realistic model of the systems. But the intuitionistic fuzzy logic control (IFLC) allows us to obtain a more realistic model than FLC because it also takes into account the degree of non-membership and the degree of uncertainty beside of degree of membership to model examined system. Fuzzy logic-based controllers are hybridized with robust control methods such as sliding mode controller to improve the performance of controller. To take advantages of SMC with fuzzy logic-based IFLC, the IFSMC controller obtained by hybridizing these two methods was designed for hyperchaotic systems. To demonstrate the performance of IFSMC, the results obtained from the synchronization of hyperchaotic systems with FSMC (fuzzy sliding mode controller) and IFSMC were compared. The stability of IFSMC is proved by Lyapunov stability condition. The numerical results and analysis show the efficiency of the IFSMC with regards to synchronization control of uncertain chaotic systems having challenging external disturbances in terms of robustness, minimum tracking error.},

First, an adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is proposed, then, to improve the convergence speed of the tracking error in the sense of finite time, a finite-time adaptive fuzzy output feedback controller is also designed to improve the control performance. By employing fuzzy logic system (FLS) to estimate the unknown nonlinear function, an adaptive fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured state. An adaptation auxiliary signal for input saturation is also established to compensate the mismatch between the controller signal and the actuator signal. Combining state observer model with backstepping method, two different adaptive fuzzy output-feedback controllers with composite parameter adaptive laws are constructed, respectively. Based on Lyapunov theory, it is proved that all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Finally, the simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

The dynamical model of the UHTR system with uncertainties is established. The uncertainties are assumed to be bounded and expressed by fuzzy set theory. With this prerequisite, an adaptive robust controller is proposed to drive the system to meet the trajectory requirements approximately. The adaptive law with leakage and dead zone is performance based and flexibly adjustable. By means of Lyapunov stability theorem, the UHTR system is both uniform bounded and uniform ultimate bounded with the proposed controller. The control scheme is deterministic rather than fuzzy if-then rules-based control. Moreover, the fuzzy performance index which contains the steady-state system performance and control cost is presented. In this way, the optimal design problem can be replaced by minimizing the performance index. Overall, the resulting control scheme can guarantee deterministic performance of the UHTR system and minimize the fuzzy performance index simultaneously.},

To this end, the proposed method is developed by unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. In particular, this research relies on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organizing Map, Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (Fuzzy SVM), and two imputation techniques for missing value imputation. Furthermore, we apply the incremental PCA and FSVM for incremental learning of the data to reduce the computation time of disease prediction. Our data analysis on two real-world datasets, Cleveland and Statlog, showed that the use of incremental Fuzzy SVM can significantly improve the accuracy of heart disease classification.

At the first stage, hand pose estimation is developed to locate the hand keypoints using the convolutional pose machine, which can effectively localize hand keypoints even in a complex background. At the second stage, the Fuzzy Gaussian mixture models (FGMMs) are tailored to reject the nongesture patterns and classify the gestures based on the estimated hand keypoints. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is effective, robust, and satisfactory in real-time scenarios.},

The TSFNN is a combination of the fuzzy-logic system and neural network; thus, it has the capability of approximating the nonlinear mapping function and self-adjustment and is suitable for hysteresis modeling. The MBFA, which can obtain better optimization values, is employed for the parameter identification procedure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a TSFNN based on the gradient descent algorithm (GDA) is used for comparison.

Firstly, the parameters of the PI controller are adjusted online by the fuzzy control rule of the FPCC to eliminate the overshoot of the DC side voltage and contribute to faster dynamic responses, which thereby could correct the reference active power. Secondly, the static error between the reference and system active powers is reduced by accumulative predictive errors in the PPC. The simulation is carried out under ideal and unbalanced grid conditions. The result shows that the proposed control scheme can effectively eliminate the overshoot of DC voltage, reduce the static error of active power, and improve the dynamic response and anti-interference ability of the rectifier.},

  abstract     = {Ontology-based similarity measures have received much importance in recent years. In many real-world cases, the domain considered in the ontological similarity assessment consists of uncertainty or incomplete information. Such vagueness has led to the successful implementation of fuzzy ontology (FO)-based similarity measures. Despite various applications of FO-based similarity measures, limited methods have so far been proposed for this purpose. Accordingly, this paper presents a generic model for semantic similarity assessment based on a fuzzy ontology. The proposed approach relies on the broad literature of Crisp Ontology-based Structural Semantic Similarity Measures (CO-SSSM). It provides an approach for mapping CO-SSSMs to fuzzy context. Consequently, the proposed generic model can be applied to various CO-SSSMs to develop their corresponding FO-SSSMs. In this regard, as an empirical investigation, four of the common CO-SSSMs were selected, their equivalent FO-SSSMs were developed by means of the proposed approach, and the accuracy of their similarity assessment was compared with each other. The results show the power of FO-SSSMs in describing the relations between concepts and their superiority over CO-SSSMs.},

  abstract     = {Effort estimation is a fairly researched field in the area of software engineering. Algorithmic and non-algorithmic methods are the two popular ways of estimating software development efforts. Various machine learning techniques are also being used to determine project efforts based on the historical project-related dataset. These techniques consume an array of project characteristics to estimate the project cost. The selection of the right technique to correctly determine the project cost is a significant challenge that the software industry is facing. This paper presents a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach to recommend the best machine learning-based software estimation technique for Web applications. FCM shows synergistic interactions between system variables, and this property is used in the context of Web application estimation for suggesting an estimation technique based on the Web project configuration. To counter the ambiguity in defining abstract relationships between system variables, this article also proposes to incorporate fuzzy numbers. The current analysis involves using five different estimation techniques on 125 student project records. The mean square error (MSE) was taken as a performance metric to declare the supremacy of one estimation technique over others. The experimental results show that the selection of an effort estimation technique should not ignore the presence of project characteristics in the input vector. The achievement of this work is that the proposed technique is capable of recommending the suitable most Web estimation model based on project credentials for a specific Web project; it refrains from suggesting an estimation model optimum for the most project configurations. The FCM approach on software estimation technique recommendation results in a probability of success equals to 70%.},

The main contribution of this work is using the concepts of fuzzy logic in a method for dynamically adapting the main parameters of the harmony search algorithm during execution. Dynamical adaptation of parameters in metaheuristics has been shown to improve performance and accuracy in a wide range of applications. For this reason, we propose and approach for fuzzy adaptation of parameters in harmony search. Two case studies are considered for testing the proposed approach, the optimization of mathematical functions, which are unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, and composite functions and a control problem without noise and when noise is considered. A statistical comparison between the harmony search algorithm and the fuzzy harmony search algorithm is presented to verify the advantages of the proposed approach.},

This research resulted in a new completion method by utilizing definitions and arithmetic on the triangular fuzzy numbers. The resulted method is by changing a single fuzzy quadratic program becomes a simple quadratic multiobjective program. By using Sum of Objective Method, the multiobjective problem can be changed into single optimization problem. This single optimization problem is then completed using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker method, resulting in three optimal values which will form optimal values in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers.},

Since there are more than one criteria, this study focuses on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods in selecting laptops. This study aims to determine the interaction between criteria, and the criteria priorities in laptop selection problem that can be added/changing new features every day and to present the findings/results to the researcher/decision-makers. DEMATEL method is used for determining the interactions which are not observed in laptop literature, and fuzzy AHP is for criteria priorities. The price and brand image of a laptop have more interrelated action than the other main criteria. According to results, the brand image is determined as the most important criteria. Along with the brand image, other/peripheral properties and price criteria have totally two-thirds priority among six main criteria. The brand image along with the price had a dominant effect on other criteria according to the interaction matrices/diagrams. This study also shows that criteria priority results should be considered along with interaction matrices/diagrams that may produce such following information: speed, storage, monitor and other/peripheral properties criteria have overall effecting feature but not strongly, while brand image is a transition criterion along with having the highest priority, and the price criterion is obviously being affected by all criteria.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays innovation is a key issue in all business sectors, maintaining a positive correlation with the countries’ economic development. The banking sector stands out among the different economic sectors, as globalization has pushed banks into tough competition. Hence, banks within this competitive framework must innovate by developing new products to be competitive and survive. The innovation in banking products is usually sorted as incremental or disruptive. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the innovation policies for the European Banking Sector by analyzing incremental and disruptive innovation policies. The novelty of the paper is to propose a set of dimensions and criteria for the innovation policies of European banking industry and to construct a hybrid decision-making model based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Accordingly, a comparative analysis of the top five GDP European countries has been carried out using a multiple criteria decision model (MCDM). The MCDM defines different criteria for incremental and disruptive innovations according to the specialized literature. Interval type-2 fuzzy DEMATEL (IT2 FDEMATEL) is used for weighting factors, and interval type-2 fuzzy VIKOR (IT2 FVIKOR) and interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS (IT2 FTOPSIS) are considered for ranking alternatives in the integrated modeling. Eventually, the findings highlight the most important criteria in this analysis and the results demonstrate that the comparative analysis of IT2 FVIKOR and IT2 FTOPSIS provides comprehensive and coherent results to select the best country in the innovation policies. In addition, the need to redesign the European banking system with necessary regulations to contribute to the development of the innovations is pointed out.},

On many occasions, assessment experts cannot give crisp scores even if there are scoring standards because of limitation and uncertainty. It is reasonable that the assessment data are expressed in the form of interval numbers with self-confidence. A fuzzy risk assessment model based on interval numbers with self-confidence is proposed in this paper. First, a multi-expert interval numbers with self-confidence fusion model is constructed. In the model, experts weights are determined based on subjective weights and objective weights, and the objective weights are calculated based on the length of the base of interval number and self-confidence simultaneously. Second, a novel method determining the symbolic proportion in an assessment distribution is proposed. This method integrates the concept of similarity measure between generalized fuzzy numbers and the length of the base of intersection of fuzzy numbers. Some properties of the proposed symbolic proportion measure are proved. Third, a fuzzy risk assessment model is proposed based on the fuzzy inference system. The output of the model is a distribution with the possible risk ranks and corresponding symbolic proportions. Finally, an illustrative example which shows the proposed fuzzy risk assessment model effective is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {In risk investment, investors have to rely on uncertain information when it is difficult to obtain enough precise data. Dual hesitant fuzzy set (DHFS) is more applicable to deal with uncertain information because it involves membership degrees and non-membership degrees, which can validly describe positive and negative information, respectively. Although there has been research on decision-making based on the DHFS, the focus still remains on ranking the alternatives and choosing the best one, which cannot help investors to find the optimal portfolios. Therefore, to solve this problem, we mainly propose two novel portfolio selection models based on the DHFS in this paper. Firstly, we propose a Max-score dual hesitant fuzzy portfolio selection model with information preference (Model 3) for investors focusing on returns regardless of risks. Secondly, to consider the risks of portfolios, we improve Model 3 and develop a score-deviation dual hesitant fuzzy portfolio selection model with information preference and risk appetite (Model 5). Finally, a case study is conducted to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed models. A detailed sensitivity analysis and an efficient frontier analysis show that Model 5 can validly capture investors’ information preferences and risk appetites. Furthermore, compared with the hesitant fuzzy portfolio model, Model 5 can offer more options to the investors with different information preferences.},

Therefore, we propose an interval-valued hesitant fuzzy stochastic decision-making approach based on group satisfaction degree and regret theory. Firstly, based on the score and variance function, a novel group satisfaction degree is defined, which can fully reflect the overall level and group divergence. Secondly, the attribute weights optimization model based on the group satisfaction degree and the deviation of attribute values is constructed to obtain the weight vector of attributes. Then, the regret value and the rejoice value are obtained by the novel regret-rejoice function, and the alternatives are ranked according to the total psychological perception values of the decision maker. Finally, we illustrated the application of the developed method with an emergency decision-making problem. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are implemented to demonstrate the superiority, stability, and validity of the proposed method based on regret theory.},

  abstract     = {The study proposes a novel, convenient and dimensionless model of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), hereby referred to as Grey Absolute Decision Analysis (GADA) method. The foundation of the GADA method rests upon the Absolute Grey Relational Analysis (Absolute GRA) model and the system that the method follows to produce GADA Indexes and GADA Weights. The GADA Weights represent the relative weights of decision alternatives under given criteria. The method can handle both positive (“higher the better”) and negative (“lower the better”) criteria simultaneously in its algorithm. The method can deal with problems involving uncertainty and incomplete data. Two practical cases have been presented in the study to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. Furthermore, the GADA Weights obtained for the cases show that these values are comparable to the relative weights obtained through the traditional methods like AHP and SAW thus signifying the feasibility of the method. However, the conventional methods do not consider the mutual association between the judgments of the members of decision-making group (experts’ opinions), a weakness that the proposed method overwhelms. Therefore, the overall ranking obtained from the proposed method is acceptable, especially under the uncertain environment where the nature of mutual association between the judgments is not precise. The key benefit of the method lies in its adaptability to different scales of measurement. Also, it can provide relative weights and rankings of experts, criterion and alternatives. These benefits make the GADA method significant among the class of MCDM methods.},

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric methodology for efficiency assessment. This paper proposes a new radial, input-oriented and fully fuzzy DEA approach, based on an LU-fuzzy partial order (L for lower, U for upper), for assessing the relative efficiency of a set of Decision-Making Units (DMUs). The proposed approach involves a radial input contraction, Phase I, and an additive slacks maximization, Phase II. Each phase is first formulated as a fully fuzzy linear programming (FFLP), and then it is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem. The latter is solved using the lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff method. The proposed fully fuzzy DEA approach provides, for each unit, a fuzzy efficiency measure and a fuzzy target operating point. A classification of the efficiency status of the units is also presented. Computational experiences and comparison with other fuzzy DEA approaches are reported.},

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a prominent technique to make decisions and improve alternatives based on non-parameter modeling and ratio calculation. However, an obvious difficulty to use this method is how to obtain accurate input and output data in the real application. To address this issue, the fuzzy DEAs (FDEAs) are proposed which have been successfully applied in many real fields. The FDEAs hold two aforementioned advantages; meanwhile, it can conveniently present uncertain evaluation information. Therefore, the FDEAs have received much attention from researchers. To summarize the current status, development trends, and further studies of the FDEA research, this paper investigates the related publications from two perspectives of description analysis and literature review, which includes the following details: (1) the literature retrospective analysis of the FDEA with bibliometric technique. Based on it, the publication overview, the cluster network, the emerging trend, and the burst detection are demonstrated in detail. (2) The method review of the basic FDEAs and two kinds of extended FDEAs. These FDEAs are proposed by introducing different fuzzy inputs and outputs, developing different theoretical DEAs, and integrating different mathematical models, respectively. (3) The application review of the FDEAs in some real-life situations. The obtained results provide some clues for researchers who are interested in the FDEA research to do further investigations on theory development and practical applications.},

In marine application, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) made standards to determine the gas emission limits and specify the air circulation in IAQ in addition to employing in energy-efficient and energy management system which leads to reduce emission and enhance the environmental condition by efficient and economical way. Applying advanced energy management policies and control could be achieved by energy consumption. In this paper, an intelligent neuro-fuzzy controller has been designed to model and control carbon monoxide (CO) concentration for a real case study of a high-speed craft passenger ship with a vehicle garage onboard for a liner between Egypt and Saudi Arabia ports. The relation between emitted CO and the number of cars and their positions has been modelled using artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN model has been built and validated based on real measurements of CO at different ventilation conditions of the case study. Different fuzzy controllers, fixed and adaptive, are designed to control CO during loading and unloading states. Scaling factors of fuzzy controller are adapted using two different ways namely Supervisor Fuzzy Controller (SFC) and Particle Swamp Optimization (PSO). Simulation results have analysed the proposed control system at different conditions. The obtained outcomes manifest the fact that the controller tends to work robustly and efficiently to maintain CO at the permissible allowed range.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a comparative evaluation of interval type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy logic system using three derivative-based learning algorithms on noisy regression problems. The motivation for this study is to manage uncertainty in noisy regression problems for the first time using both membership and non-membership functions that are fuzzy. The proposed models are able to handle ‘neither this nor that state’ in the noisy regression data with the aim of enabling hesitation and handling more uncertainty in the data. The gradient descent-backpropagation (first-order derivative), decoupled extended Kalman filter (second-order derivative) and hybrid approach (where the decoupled extended Kalman filter is used to learn the consequent parameters and gradient descent is used to optimise the antecedent parameters) are applied for the adaptation of the model parameters. The experiments are conducted using two artificially generated and one real-world datasets, namely Mackey–Glass time series, Lorenz time series and US stock datasets. Experimental analyses show that the extended Kalman filter-based learning approaches of interval type-2 intuitionistic fuzzy logic exhibit superior prediction accuracies to gradient descent approach especially at high noise level. The decoupled extended Kalman filter model however converges faster but incurs more computational overhead in terms of the running time.},

The proposed lemma is referred to hereafter as Extended Affine Wirtinger inequality. The novelty of the lemma is twofold, it has the ability to integrate uncertain delay information utilizing the convex combination of certain and uncertain delay intervals involved in the proposed LKF, and it is compatible to derive delay-range-dependent (DRD) stability conditions for continuous time Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy time-delay system. One noteworthy advantage of the proposed stability condition in a linear matrix inequality (LMI) framework is that it requires less number of matrix variables compared to the existing integral inequalities of the similar type, thus reducing the computational burden too. The efficacy of the proposed DRD stability condition over existing conditions is validated numerically by solving three examples related to fuzzy time-delay system.},

The uncertainty is described with fuzzy set theory. We aim at optimal controller to drive the constraint-following error of the concerned fuzzy system to lie within a desired (possibly asymmetric) bound all the time and get to be sufficiently small eventually. For deterministic performance, we transform the fuzzy original system into a constructed fuzzy system, for which a deterministic (not the usual if-then rules-based) adaptive robust control is designed for uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. For optimal performance, a performance index is proposed based on the fuzzy information, by minimizing which an optimal control gain design problem is formulated and solved. When the constructed fuzzy system is uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness, the constraint-following error of the original fuzzy system is proved to be bounded. As a result, the control design can render out deterministic performance and minimum performance index.},

Thereby, to design a highly effective training scheme becomes the main problem on the weights of the BP-NNs. To realize better weights training, the combined filtering technology is fully adopted by fusing adaptive filtering methods based on observable degree (OD) analysis, Sage–Husa adaptive technology, and variational Bayesian method.

Third, a novel fuzzy controller is designed, containing a state feedback controller and a fault compensator to achieve the fault-tolerant synchronization, which is formulated to study the global asymptotical stability of the error system. As a results, applying Lyapunov theory and inequality technique, new sufficient condition is obtained to guarantee the stability of the error system. Further, the controller gain and the weight of event-triggering condition are designed through linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approach.

The non-parametric Lorentzian Redescending M-estimator is used both at initialization and iterative stages of the clustering algorithm; since, it behaves such as a robust location estimator when the centroid vector is computed, and as a weighting when the membership matrix is updated. With the fusion of both techniques, we can guarantee that the introduced clustering algorithm can efficiently develop the task of segmentation of color images and pattern recognition processes.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider interval multi-objective linear programming (IMOLP) models which are used to deal with uncertainties of real-world problems. So far, a variety of approaches for obtaining efficient solutions (ESs) of these problems have been developed. In this paper, we propose a new and two generalized methods. In the new method, converting IMOLP into an interval linear programming (ILP) and then obtaining its optimal solutions (OSs), ESs of the IMOLP are determined. This method has several advantages: (i) This method is the only method which obtains a solution box for IMOLP models. (ii) The solving process is not time consuming. (iii) The number of ESs is higher than for other methods. (V) The method is applicable for large-scale problems. Also, we generalize the $$\varepsilon$$-constraint and lexicographic methods which are used for obtaining ESs of the multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) models which do not have any problems such as lengthy and time-consuming and are applicable for large-scale problems. Some examples were solved to show the efficiency of the proposed methods. Finally, by the proposed method, we solve the IMOLP model corresponding to the problem of the facilities and non-return funds in a bank.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a new approach based on fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and neuro-fuzzy inference system (NFIS), called the neuro-fuzzy cognitive map (NFCM), is proposed. Here, the NFCM is used for diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). AIH is a chronic inflammatory liver disease. AIH primarily affects women and typically responds to immunosuppressive therapy with clinical, biochemical, and histological remission. An untreated AIH can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to liver failure. If rapidly diagnosed, AIH can often be controlled by medication. NFCM is a new extension of FCM, which employs a NFIS to determine the causal relationships between concepts. In the proposed approach, weights are calculated using the knowledge and experience of experts as well as the advantages of NFIS. This makes the presented model more accurate. Having a high convergence speed, the proposed NFCM model performs well by achieving an AIH diagnosis accuracy of 89.81%. The superiority of the proposed NFCM model over the conventional FCM is that, it uses the NFIS to determine the link weights which train system parameters.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy uncertainty (FU) exists widely in engineering applications, but there lack design optimization methods under FU, thus a credibility-based design optimization (CBDO) is focused to obtain the safety design under FU in this paper. Firstly, the concepts of credibility index and most credible point (MCP) are presented to measure the safety degree under FU, where the credibility index and the MCP, respectively, show similar properties as the reliability index and the most probable point under random uncertainty. Secondly, the inverse MCP (IMCP) is defined with respect to the required credibility, and the detailed method is established for searching IMCP, on which the performance measure approach (PMA) can be combined to solve the CBDO. Since the PMA combined with the IMCP includes a time-consuming double-loop strategy, the sequential optimization and credibility assessment (SOCA) is proposed to decouple the double-loop strategy thirdly. In the SOCA, a shifting vector constructed by the IMCP is used to transform the credibility constraint into an equivalent deterministic one, on which the double-loop strategy can be avoided to reduce the computational cost for solving the CBDO. One numerical example and two engineering examples fully illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the SOCA.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based portfolio efficiency evaluation approach integrated with a rebalancing method to help investors acquire efficient portfolios. Two fuzzy portfolio selection models with value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) as objectives are proposed under the credibilistic framework. The models are constrained by realistic constraints of short selling/no short selling, capital budget, bounds on investment in an asset, and minimum return desired by the investor. These models are used to compute the benchmark portfolios, which constitute the portfolio efficient frontier. Furthermore, random sample portfolios are generated individually for each model in compliance with their constraints. These random sample portfolios are evaluated in terms of their relative efficiency with risk (VaR or CVaR) as an input and return as an output using DEA. Bearing in mind the volatile nature of the investment market, negative returns are also considered for portfolio efficiency evaluation using the range directional model. Moreover, an efficiency frontier improvement algorithm is used to rebalance the inefficient random portfolios to make them efficient. The proposed approach provides an alternative to the investors to acquire benchmark portfolios using the traditional portfolio selection models. A detailed numerical illustration and an out of sample analysis with the Nifty 50 index from the National Stock Exchange, India, are presented to substantiate the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) have been extensively studied in recent years. However, the traditional operational rules (ORs) of the IFNs still have some drawbacks in solving the practical decision-making problems. Einstein t-conorm and t-norm (TAT) are an important and typical class of the TAT, but the ORs for the IFNs based on the Einstein TAT (ETAT) cannot consider the interaction between the membership degree (MD) and the non-membership degree (N-MD), they may get the unreasonable evaluation results in some realistic decision-making situations. So this paper proposes some new Einstein interactive ORs for the IFNs, then, it further presents the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted averaging (IFEIWA) operator to overcome above existing drawbacks, and some properties of this operator are proved. Simultaneously, in order to eliminate the effects of the existing biases of some decision experts in the process of evaluating attributes, this paper proposes the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein interactive power averaging (IFEIPA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein interactive weighted power averaging (IFEIWPA) operator based on the revised power weighted averaging operator, and then gives their some desirable properties. Further, by using the IFEIPA operator and the IFEIWPA operator, this paper presents a novel method for the multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems to solve practical decision-making problems. Lastly, this paper uses some actual application examples to verify the applicability and validity of the proposed MAGDM method, and then demonstrates the superiority of novel method by detailed comparison analysis with other typical methods.},

  abstract     = {Online customer reviews (OCRs) provide much information about products or service, but the mass of information increases the difficulty for customers to make decisions. Thus, we establish a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model to evaluate products or service. To analyze OCRs, the sentiment analysis (SA) is introduced to identify the sentiment orientation of reviews. Considering that the textual information in OCRs is linguistic information, probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) are applied to present the results of the SA. A process of extracting probabilistic linguistic information based on SA from OCRs is also presented. Then, for the MCDM problems with unknown criteria weights, we combine the PP (projection pursuit) method and the MULTIMOORA (multiplicative multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis) method, and develop an extended method (named as the PP-MULTIMOORA method). The projection pursuit (PP) method is developed to derive objective criteria weights and the MULTIMOORA method is to derive final rankings of products or service. Finally, we apply the proposed model to a case of evaluating doctors’ service quality and further conduct a comparative analysis to illustrate the effectiveness of our work.},

The incomplete and unreliable information may also affect the selection maker to earn inaccurate decisions, ensuing in monetary losses and wastes of resources. Thus, it is vital to describe the reliability of the facts. To cope with it entirely, a notion of Z-number, i.e., a pair of fuzzy sets modeling a probability-qualified fuzzy statement, is the most suitable medium to access it. In this paper, we spout a new technique to measure the uncertainty of discrete Z-numbers based on Shannon entropy. In the given approach, by using characteristics of Z-number, all the potential probability distributions are estimated by the maximum entropy method. Then, a new fuzzy subset of the Z-number is formed based on the probability distributions and the membership functions of the fuzzy number. Finally, the centroid of the formulated set is determined to rank the degree of the uncertainty of Z-number. The applicability of the delivered approach is read with some numerical examples related to the decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {Traceability is the ability to verify the history and location of a food product, thus providing information on each supply-chain actor, who the immediate supplier is, and to whom the product was sent. The information system approach has been used to manage and integrate all such information by collecting, storing, then retrieving data and information about the product from earlier stages of the production process. Besides documentation and information sharing, such traceability information systems can also support timely resolution of customer complaints. This paper presents modelling of routing and handling time prediction using a fuzzy associative memory (FAM) method. As a first response to customers, information about the time required to resolve an issue can be provided after the source of a product defect has been traced. With regards to handling, traceability can assist with several issues, e.g., product replacement, product recalls based on retrieval of the contact numbers of affected customers on a recall list , and inspections at each production unit to ensure food safety standards. Based on such activities, it is assumed that the handling time will be affected by the size of the product inventory that can be used to replace a defective product, the amount of product that must be recalled from the market, and the time required internally for the inspection process, which is set as the FAM input variable. A FAM is a set of fuzzy-set pairs (A, B) that maps an input vector fuzzy set A to an output vector fuzzy set B. Our experiments show that, from such a FAM formulation, one can obtain 27 rules. The FAM will encode a fuzzy-set pair (A, B) to obtain matrix memories, denoted by M. As the prediction result, the matrix B can be obtained from the computational matrix A and the matrix M; For instance, in case of a contamination incident in a fish product with inventory conditions of as much as 4 tonnes, the product recall amounts to 21 tonnes and the inspection will take 25 h, while the results of the computational experiment show that the total handling time for this case will be 66 h with low error rates.},

Carbon management is a new branch of green supplier selection which focuses on other aspects of environmental issues. This study integrates a new fuzzy modification of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) known as Fuzzy Preference Programming (FPP) with Fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) to assess suppliers’ performance with respect to carbon management criteria. Four dimensions and twelve criteria have been selected based on previous studies and experts’ opinions. Linguistic variables are employed to gather the experts’ opinions about the importance degree of the dimensions and corresponding attributes. Subsequently, the importance weights of each dimension and its corresponding criteria are computed by using FPP. The performance ratings of the suppliers based on the determined criteria are collected under a fuzzy environment using linguistic variables. Then, FVIKOR is applied to obtain the overall environmental performance with respect to carbon management attributes. Through a case study in a textile company, the performance scores of its suppliers were elicited in accordance with this procedure.

  abstract     = {Evidential reasoning (ER) approach is a representative method for analyzing uncertain multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems. Its core is ER algorithm used to combine belief distributions on criteria, which is developed based on Dempster’s rule of combination and probability theory. The ER algorithm is nonlinear and more computationally complex than linear combination of belief distributions. To address the necessity of the ER algorithm in MCDM and MCGDM, it is compared with linear combination from three perspectives by simulation. The first is to examine differences between the aggregated assessments derived from the ER algorithm and linear combination. The second is to examine error rates of best alternatives derived from two combination ways. The third is to examine alternative ranking differences derived from two combination ways. To facilitate the comparison, difference between aggregated assessments is designed and score function of alternative is developed from the expected utilities of alternative. Simulation experiments show that differences between the aggregated assessments are influenced by the number of assessment grades, and error rates of best alternatives and alternative ranking differences are influenced by the numbers of criteria and alternatives.},

First, we propose the linear operations and limitation approaches of the HFEs. Next, we construct the hesitant fuzzy additive integral and hesitant fuzzy multiplicative integral and discuss their properties. Based on the two hesitant fuzzy integrals, we derive the hesitant fuzzy additive integral operator and hesitant fuzzy multiplicative integral operator to aggregate the continuous HFEs. Moreover, the useful properties of these operators are also investigated. Finally, we apply the hesitant fuzzy additive integral and hesitant fuzzy multiplicative integral operators to fuse the massive discrete HFEs which will be turned into the continuous form in advance to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multiple integrals operators.

Intuitionistic uncertain linguistic variables (IULVs) combine the advantages of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and uncertain linguistic variables (ULVs), IULV is more flexible in dealing with uncertain information in decision-making process, and provides a novel means for obtaining loss function (LF) of DTRSs. To get more comprehensive results, a new 3WD model is proposed to solve the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. First, we gave the LF of DTRSs with IULVs, combined the IULVs and the generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean (GMSM), and proposed the IULGMSM and WIULGMSM operators to aggregate decision information; further, we proposed an intuitionistic uncertain linguistic DTRS model. Then, a method for deducing a new DTRS model is constructed, which can give the corresponding semantic interpretation of the decision results of each alternative. Finally, an example is applied to elaborate the proposed method in detail, and the effects of different conditional probabilities on decision results are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Most existing forecasting models abstract logical rules that are based on historical discrete states in time series, and inconsistencies between these discrete states are rarely described quantitatively. In this paper, a multi-attribute fuzzy fluctuation time series-forecasting model based on neutrosophic soft sets (NSSs) and information entropy is proposed, which describes the complex changes of the logical rule training stage from the two characteristics of the state and volatility. The innovation and advantages of the model are mainly as follows: (1) The NSSs which have multi-attribute mapping and multi-dimensional expression functions can depict the complex state of multiple attributes in a specific period of time and thus characterise the state of the stock market clearly. (2) Using information entropy to quantify the degree of inconsistency of stock market fluctuations at a certain time which reflect the characteristics of volatility in the stock market effectively. (3) The similarity measure is used to find the optimal rule from the dimensions of state and volatility. To verify the validity of this model, this paper takes the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) as an example. Experiments show that the model has a stable prediction performance for different data sets. Meanwhile, the prediction error is compared with other methods, which proves that the model has better prediction accuracy and versatility.},

Proposed framework overcome the limitations of previous investigations such as the possibility of aggregation of expert opinions using group decision-making and modeling the hesitancy of the experts (due to the incompleteness of their knowledge or their doubts in evaluating different aspects of the model) through hesitant fuzzy sets. The designed framework was used in Iran to evaluate e-government websites. In this regard, after a careful and systematic review of previous researches, a list of dimensions and evaluation criteria was presented in the form of a comprehensive model. Then, an expert-based process was proposed to localize the model according to the conditions of the case study.

It is observed that the Hamacher aggregation operators of intuitionistic fuzzy set, Pythagorean fuzzy set and that of picture fuzzy set has some limitations in their applicability. To serve the purpose, in this paper, some Hamacher aggregation operators based on T-spherical fuzzy numbers are introduced. The concepts of T-spherical fuzzy Hamacher-weighted averaging and T-spherical fuzzy Hamacher-weighted geometric aggregation operators are proposed which described four aspects of human opinion including yes, no, abstinence and refusal with no limitations. Such type of aggregation operators efficiently describes the cases that left unsolved by the existing aggregation operators.

  abstract     = {The use of fuzzy decision-making in datapath selection extends the sensor network lifetime with a uniform distribution of routing load among network nodes. Fuzzy-logic based routing protocols are mostly designed for general wireless sensor networks (WSN). However, such protocols are not compatible with a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) comprised of biosensor nodes. WBAN nodes carry inferior computational, communication and energy resources as compared to general WSN nodes. A WBAN routing protocol needs to be designed as per IEEE 802.15.6 WBAN standards to meet high-end QoS requirements of medical applications. This paper presents a fuzzy-logic-based clustering protocol for data routing in WBANs. Nodes are grouped into clusters and cluster head nodes are selected through a Fuzzy-Genetic Algorithm termed as EB-fg-MADM. EB-fg-MADM makes an assessment of dual attributes of each cluster node in terms of node residual energy and CH selection cost. CH selection cost of a node is the forecasted value of network energy consumption if the node acts as a cluster head. EB-fg-MADM utilizes a fuzzy-TOPSIS function which makes a quantitative comparison of cluster nodes and selects the cluster head node possessing the aforementioned attributes closest to their ideally desired values. A Genetic Algorithm-based optimization process adapts the attribute weights for cluster head selection. EB-fg-MADM provides enhanced network lifetime with a uniform distribution of routing load. Protocol performance is obtained in terms of network lifetime, throughput and latency. Results are compared with existing WBAN routing protocols and are found to be better.},

However, a non-trivial problem exists in how to construct the most appropriate MF that has the best-fit representation of the analysed problem. Therefore, many authors propose their own ways to construct MF using a certain technique in a particular application domain. Consequently, the need for a general approach for constructing MF led us to systematise and to generalise the analysed approaches into a general methodological framework (GMF) of constructing MF. The novelty of this paper is that the proposed GMF is general, domain independent and free of a chosen understanding of fuzziness (i.e., similarity (imprecision), preference (vagueness), and uncertainty). To verify the proposed GMF, it was applied for the enterprise business service quality (QoSEBS) planning problem. The obtained results showed that a semi-automatic MF construction for QoSEBS planning was more sensitive, less subjective and more precise than a manual construction. Moreover, illustrative examples showed that our proposed GMF is applicable and implementable. The reliability of the results was assessed using experts and users’ experience, which is based on general guidelines of the “acceptable” response time limits for various activities.},

Finally, the fuzzy controller is reconstructed with the optimal fuzzy rules to estimate the auto insurance rate accurately.

  abstract     = {Recently, novel approaches have been developed for simulating bubbly flow as well as distributed and constant phase evolution by means of a two-phase reactor. Among these approaches, the Eulerian–Eulerian method and soft computing approaches can be mentioned. Since complex numerical methods (for example, multidimensional Eulerian–Eulerian method) require several runs for fluid conditions optimization, a method which can decrease these runs can be very useful and practical. This method is provided by joining computational fluid dynamic (CFD) to the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). In this technique, valuable information is provided for a careful analysis of fluid conditions. Also, it can facilitate a vast amount of data categorization in synthetic neural network nodes, which eliminates the need for a complex nonstructured CFD mesh. Moreover, a neural geometry can be provided, in which no limitation of mesh numbers in the fluid domain would exist. The key CFD parameters in the scale-up of the reactorstaken into consideration in the current research are gas and liquid circulations. These factors are applied as output factors for prediction tool in various dimensions in the ANFIS method. The results obtained in this study show appropriate conformity concerning ANFIS and CFD results depending on multiple dimensions. In this study, the grouping of CFD and multifunction the ANFIS method delivers the nondiscrete domain in different dimensions and presents an intelligent instrument for the local prediction of multiphase flow. The result shows that three inputs, which represent the dimension of the reactor, and learning stage of the ANFIS method provide a better understanding of flow characteristics in the two-phase reactor, while the two-dimensional ANFIS method even with multistructured functions cannot predict well the multiphase flow in the reactor.},

  abstract     = {Prediction of electricity demand is made using Load forecasting technique to meet the ever-growing demand. In this paper, future electricity demand forecasted for the whole state of Uttar Pradesh (India), using the dataset collected from the Central Electricity Authority. This dataset consists of electricity demand for the whole state of UP for every 15-min block. Different models were used to forecast future demand. XGradientBoost (XGBoost), a machine learning algorithm was used to forecast demand first. Further forecasting was performed using deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using neural networks as they are considered to be more efficient and accurate than XGBoost. Fuzzy time series (FTS) models were considered to incorporate trend and seasonality present in our dataset. From various FTS models, the best mean absolute percentage error achieved (MAPE) was 2.34%. A new method KmFuzz is proposed in this paper that uses modified K-Means clustering for finding an optimal number of partitions on which fuzzy logic is applied. Fuzzy sets are obtained by applying fuzzification on the dataset and the total number of sets generated are equal to the number of optimal partitions. Then the weighted average method is used for defuzzification and forecasting the next hour demand using the demand data of previous hours with MAPE of 1.94%, thus improving the accuracy further.},

  abstract     = {A novel deep feature mapping method self-growing net (SG-Net) is proposed, and its combination with classical fuzzy c-means (FCM) called SG-Net-FCM is further developed. SG-Net is a feedforward learning structure for nonlinear explicit feature mapping and includes four types of layers, i.e., input, fuzzy mapping, hybrid, and output layers. The fuzzy mapping layer maps the data from input layer to a high-dimensional feature space using TSK fuzzy mapping, i.e. the fuzzy mapping of Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS). Afterward, each layer in SG-Net accepts additional inputs from all preceding layers and provides its own distinguished features by using principal component analysis to all subsequent layers. The final output of SG-Net is fed to FCM. Since SG-Net-FCM is developed based on the TSK fuzzy mapping, it is more interpretable than classical kernelized fuzzy clustering methods. The effectiveness of the proposed clustering algorithm is experimentally verified on UCI datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on linguistic classification of scene texts in natural scene images. In this paper, an attempt is made to localize texts based on multi-level thresholding by fuzzy-based Renyi entropy. Complex natural scene images with diversified challenges are considered. A set of heuristic rules comprising geometric filters and stroke width transform govern the process of locating potential text regions. The scene images may contain more than one language, where text recognition by optical character recognition system becomes challenging. Manual intervention is needed to specify the language of each text. To overcome this hurdle, linguistic classification of text regions is suggested in this paper. The proposed method is validated using publicly available dataset—MSRA-TD500. Results show that fuzzy-based Renyi entropy thresholding is able to segment the foreground text from complex natural scene images. Geometric filters could capture the inherent uniformity of the text. Stroke width transform eliminates the non-text regions. The performance measures such as precision, recall and F-measures are 78%, 77% and 76%, respectively. This shows the ability of the algorithm to extract the text from the scenes. The geometric feature such as area and corner shows better variation in discriminating the linguistic texts. Further, the first three Hu moment features also contribute remarkable role in analyzing the shape of extracted text regions. The classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) yields classification accuracy of 85.45% in discriminating English and Chinese alphabets. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.851 for SVM classifier. The proposed methodology has proved its robustness against common degradations, such as uneven illumination, varying font characteristics and blurring effects. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance in linguistic classification.},

  abstract     = {The main contribution in this paper is the use of a new type-reduction method to improve the processing speed of Type-2 fuzzy systems for dynamic parameter adaptation in the Differential Evolution algorithm. The proposed type-reduction is an approximation to the Continuous Karnik–Mendel (CEK) method, which is the equivalent to using a traditional Interval Type-2 fuzzy system, but with lower computational cost. The motivation of this work is to verify that the proposed methodology is equivalent in performance to an Interval Type-2 fuzzy system. The first type-reduction method was proposed by Karnik and Mendel (KM), and then was followed by its enhanced version called EKM, and the continuous versions were called CKM and CEKM. In addition, there were variations of these and also other types of variations that eliminate the type-reduction process reducing the computational cost to a Type-1 defuzzification. The concept of approximation to the Continuous Karnik–Mendel (CEK) method is new in the area of metaheuristic algorithms and this is why it is in our interest to work with this methodology. We propose to use this methodology to achieve a dynamic crossover (CR) parameter adaptation in the Differential Evolution algorithm, and the objective is to use the type-reduction process and also provide a continuous solution to the defuzzification. This proposed methodology is applied to a set of mathematical functions and a control problem, for verifying the efficiency of the proposed methodology compared to the original algorithm and other existing methods in the literature.},

  abstract     = {A linear permanent magnet synchronous motor (LPMSM) drive system is keeping in many nonlinear effects such as the external load force, the flux saturation, the cogging force, the column friction and Stribeck force, and the parameters variations. Due to the uncertainty effects the existing linear controllers can not achieve better control performances for the LPMSM drive system. To raise robustness under occurrence of uncertainty, the integral backstepping control system with hitting function is proposed for controlling the LPMSM drive system in accordance with the Lyapunov function. To improve larger chattering phenomenon under uncertainties effects, the integral backstepping control system with revised recurrent fuzzy neural network (RRFNN) and mended particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is proposed to operate the LPMSM drive system to raise robustness of system. The RRFNN is used to estimate the value of the external lumped force uncertainty. Moreover, the error compensation control with the error compensation mechanism is proposed to compensate the minimum reconstructed error of the error estimation law. Besides, four variable learning rates in the weights of the RRFNN are regulated by virtue of MPSO with segment regulation to speed-up parameter’s convergence. Finally, comparative performances through some tentative upshots are verified that the integral backstepping control system by virtue of RRFNN with MPSO has better control performances than those of the proposed methods for the LPMSM drive system.},

  abstract     = {One of the popular area of research for the past decade in the academia as well as in the industry is networked control systems (NCS). Variable time delays induced by the network and data packet dropout during transmission of data are among the problems encountered in these type of systems. Researchers proposed and developed various control strategies over the past years to deal with the above-mentioned problem. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) is a widely used technique for dealing with control problems, and the most commonly used one is type-1 FLC. However, the interval type-2 (IT2) is proven to be better at handling uncertainties compared to the type-1 FLC. In this paper, a nonlinear NCS with delays is considered, and an observer-based IT2 FLC is designed in order to improve the control of NCS due to the presence of uncertainties and delays. The developed scheme includes the design of a state feedback controller based on IT2 FLC, and an observer-based IT2 FLC using Lyapunov–Krasovskii theory. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, simulations are performed considering various network delays. Firstly, the results of IT2 FLCs are compared with that of type-1 FLCs and improvement is observed. Secondly, the newly developed observer-based IT2 FLC is compared with the IT2 state feedback FLC developed in the literature. Results show faster and more effective response using the newly developed technique.},

To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel identification model based on recurrent interval type-2 fuzzy wavelet neural network (RIT2FWNN) with new learning algorithm. The model benefits from both advantages of recurrent and wavelet neural networks such as use of temporal data and fast convergence properties. The proposed antecedent and consequent parameters update rules are derived using sliding-mode-control-theory. To evaluate the proposed fuzzy model, it is utilized to design a nonlinear model-based predictive controller and is applied for the synchronization of fractional-order time-delay chaotic systems. Using Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that all update rules of the parameters are uniformly ultimately bounded. The adaptation laws obtained in this method are very simple and have closed forms. Some stability conditions are derived to prove learning dynamics and asymptotic stability of the network by using an appropriate Lyapunov function. The efficacy and performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation examples.},

However, sometimes it is much more reasonable to express the data using fuzzy theory when the variables are not clearly defined. For example, it is better to express the mood of a person “bad”, “moderate”, “good” using fuzzy numbers than using real numbers (crisp numbers).

  abstract     = {Previous theories have suggested that Bonferroni mean (BM) and its extensions can fulfil the desired properties to become a good aggregation operator in managing interrelationship between arguments under fuzzy decision-making environment. However, along with this growth, there are concerns regarding the limitation of the BM and its extensions where interrelationship between arguments is limited to a pair of input arguments. In contrast to previous works, a novel normalized weighted Bonferroni mean aggregation operator considering Shapley fuzzy measure has been introduced, where the overall interactions of input arguments are combined. Unlike other extensions of BM that are mostly considered under fuzzy environment, this aggregation operation introduces the Shapley fuzzy measure to deal with interactions of all arguments under the interval-valued neutrosophic environment. Specifically, the interval-valued neutrosophic Shapley normalized weighted Bonferroni mean (INSNWBM) is proposed in this paper. The properties of INSNWBM such as reducibility, idempotency, monotonicity, commutativity, and boundedness are also presented as to reflect the interrelationship among multiple input arguments. In addition, we have also proposed successive steps of a decision-making procedure in which the proposed INSNWBM is included. Together included is a numerical example as to illustrate the applicability of the INSNWBM in decision-making. The consistency of the ranking results is confirmed by variations of parameters of INSNWBM. It is shown that the ranking results are almost consistent despite the different usages of parameter values. Results obtained appear to support the idea that the proposed aggregation operator is able to address the interrelationship between arguments in decision-making.},

  abstract     = {The linguistic picture fuzzy set (LPFS) is an extension of the linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy set (LIFS), and can contain more information than the LIFS. In this paper, the degrees of positive, neutral and non-membership of PFSs are expressed in linguistic terms, which can more easily describe the uncertain and vague information existing in the real world. By combining the PFS and the linguistic term, we define the LPFS and propose operational rules for linguistic picture fuzzy numbers (LPFNs). We further propose weighted averaging and weighted geometric operators and discuss their properties. Additionally, we propose an approach to deal with a multiple-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem based on the developed aggregation operators. Finally, we present an illustrative example to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed method by comparing it with existing methods. In addition, our method can be utilized not only to solve problems with linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIFNs), but also to deal with problems with LPFNs, and is a generalization of a number of existing methods.},

In this paper, we propose an extension of the TOPSIS method with trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) using the concept of α-cut. We first propose a new method to calculate the distance between two trapezoidal IT2 FSs with the tool of α-cut and ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator. Next, based on the distance method, we extend the TOPSIS method to the context of trapezoidal IT2 FSs and utilize it to solve FMCDM problems. Finally, an illustrative example is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, and some comparisons with other existing works are presented to show the highlights of the proposed method. The proposed method provides a flexible solution for the FMCDM problems by taking the decision-makers’ attitudes into consideration.},

In this sense, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) provides an important procedural outline for the evaluation of public transportation alternatives. This paper presents an application of MCDM method to assess the public transportation alternatives designed for a public university in a large-sized metropolitan area. Two alternatives of MCDM methods, named Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process &amp; COmbinative Distance-based Assessment (IVIF-AHP &amp; CODAS), are integrated in the evaluation process. The proposed method ensures consistent and reasonable results and provides suggestions for the forthcoming progresses of public transportation service quality. In order to validate robustness of the proposed method, sensitivity analyses are implemented. Also, at the end of the study, to prove the superiority of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis is employed.},

Decision-makers’ risk preference information and the amount of useful information given by attributes are both considered to effectively address dynamic multi-attribute decision-making problems in intuitionistic fuzzy. Then, a value function is designed to accurately describe the decision-makers’ risk preference information and a multi-stage dynamic reference point setting method for intuitionistic fuzzy environment is proposed.

Then, the self-constructing fuzzy UKF system was designed in order to obtain the fault information. According to fault information obtained using the proposed scheme, fault detection experiments based on fuzzy clustering were performed and the fault feature parameters required for fault isolation were determined.

As the PLI robot system is an under-actuated nonlinear system, obtaining the full information of the four-state variables is necessary to balance the PLI robot. However, as the number of input variables increases, the number of control rules increases exponentially, making the design of the fuzzy controller extremely complex. Therefore, the proposed controller prevents the problem of rule explosion using information fusion and then simplifies the control design. Moreover, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to select improved controller parameters and make the controller achievable. In this paper, the control performance and anti-interference ability of the traditional PID control, type-1 fuzzy control, interval type-2 fuzzy control, and general type-2 fuzzy control methods are compared.

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting and scientific analysis of building electrical load can improve the level of building energy management to meet the requirements of energy saving. To further strengthen the forecasting accuracy, this study presents a hybrid model for building electrical load forecasting. The proposed method combines the fuzzy inference system and the periodicity knowledge together to generate accurate forecasting results. In this method, in order to better reflect the actual characteristic of the electrical load, the wavelet transform method is firstly utilized to filter the original building electrical load data. Then, the daily periodic pattern is extracted from such filtered electrical load data, and the residual data are obtained through removing the daily periodic pattern. Further, the residual data-driven forecasting model is constructed by the functionally weighted single-input-rule-modules connected fuzzy inference system (FWSIRM-FIS). This FWSIRM-FIS model is used to provide the compensation to the periodic component. In other words, the daily periodic component and the residual forecasting are combined to achieve the final forecasting result. Specifically, in order to assure the forecasting performance of the FWSIRM-FIS model, the subtraction clustering method is employed to construct the SIRMs while the least square estimation is utilized to optimize the parameters in the functional weights of the FWSIRM-FIS. Finally, in this paper, two real-world experiments are made and detailed comparisons with four traditional models are given. Experimental and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model has the smallest forecasting errors and can achieve the best performance.},

Owing to the presence of qualitative indicators in the index system, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and improved gray relational analysis (IGRA) approaches are combined to determine the indicator weights so as to ensure the credibility of the weights. Considering the non-compensatory principle among primary indicators, the improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (IFCEM) based on multiplicative synthesis technique is applied to evaluate the alternatives. The empirical results indicate that “Return on Investment” and “Bilateral Relationship” are the main perspectives that greatly affect the regulatory environment of OEPM, and that UK and Greece are the best and worst alternatives in terms of the regulatory environment of OEPM in the analyzed countries. Totally, the proposed hybrid framework expressed great capacity to evaluate and rank the regulatory environment of OEPM and can be also popularized in other fields to support enterprises in making decisions by evaluating the alternatives with ambiguity and uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {This article discusses a Whale Optimization (WO) controller for design analysis, stability management, application, and performance analysis of a deregulated two-area multi-source energy system. Within the power grid, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) maintains the power balance and strengthens the sudden frequency disturbance of the grid. Various researchers are targeted many kinds of fast-acting energy-storing devices to dampen space frequency oscillations and diversion of the tie line because of unexpected load variation. To regulate the power flow between multi-areas, load frequency control (LFC) is used by keeping frequency constant. But, to design a controller for minimizing the issues of LFC remains a challenge within the deregulated atmosphere. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to design a controller for minimizing the issues in LFC within the deregulated atmosphere. A two-area deregulated hydrothermal power system is employed to analyze many LFC problems in the deregulated power grid. During this modeling, the Thyristor-Controlled Phase Shifters (TCPS) and Capacitive Energy Storage unit (CES) are placed in the tie line and its control space. To mitigate the various issues of LFC in a two-area deregulated hydrothermal power system, the CES–TCPS combination is placed between the two control areas and the transient performance of constant is evaluated. The WO controller will increase the system power size to focus on the better performance of low-frequency management tasks. In addition, the effectiveness of the WO algorithm in tuning the proportional integral controller is also compared in a different contract (unilateral, bilateral and contract violation cases) scenarios of the proposed deregulated power system. Finally, the simulation is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform and the results obtained for the WO controller is compared with the normal and fuzzy PI controllers.},

The fuzzy $$H_{\infty }$$ controller is designed to make the resulting T–S fuzzy system asymptotically stable and satisfy $$H_{\infty }$$ performance under given constraints.

Since the inherent nonlinear dynamics and stochastic disturbances in multi-agent systems are completely unknown, the existing finite-time stability criterion becomes unavailable. To handle this difficulty, by applying the mean value theorem of integrals, a key finite-time stability criterion in integral form is first established. Then, based on the approximation property of the fuzzy logic systems, a distributed adaptive fuzzy control scheme is presented. Under the presented control strategy, the finite-time consensus of the stochastic nonlinear multi-agent systems is achieved. By applying Jessen’s inequality and Theorem 1, the finite-time stability of the closed system is proved. Finally, the simulation result shows the validity of the distributed controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with piecewise constant set-points tracking control of nonlinear discrete-time systems represented by Takagi-Sugeno models under actuators’ saturation. To this end, a fuzzy Proportional Integral-like (PI-like) discrete-time control scheme is considered, which consists of a proportional state feedback, an integral action over the tracking error, and an anti-windup action. All the control gains are obtained through a convex optimization procedure formulated in term of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). The proposed method yields a Parameter Distributed Compensation (PDC) PI-like control and a non-PDC anti-windup action structure. Due to the actuators’ saturation, a local approach is considered with a fuzzy Lyapunov function to ensure the local closed-loop stability, to provide an estimate of the region of attraction, and to compute the amplitude bounds of set-points changes. This latter issue allows delivering operational security by providing a bounded range for the set-points variation. To validate and illustrate the performance of the proposed tracking control approach, real-time experiments has been performed on an industrial oriented process consisting on the nonlinear level control of two interactive tanks.},

An unknown function of the system is approximated by an adaptive fuzzy system. According to a semi-global practical finite-time stability criterion, a novel adaptive fuzzy finite-time controller is presented. In the interest of saving resources, an event-triggered approach is developed where the controller is updated under the respective triggering conditions. Based on the special structure of Hamiltonian systems and Lyapunov theory, a sufficient condition is obtained so that the states of original systems converge to a small neighborhood containing the origin in a finite time. Meanwhile, with the proposed controller, there exists a positive lower bound for the interexecution time, and the Zeno phenomenon is avoided. The design processes of the proposed controller, adaptive law and event-triggered conditions are also proved by a circuit system simulation example.},

In the first method, the BLS determines the polynomials in a system in which the fuzzy sets are known. In the second method, the PSO algorithm determines the fuzzy sets, whereas the BLS determines the polynomials. In this paper, the ridge regression is used to stabilize the solution when the problem is close to the singularity. Thanks to this, the proposed methods can be applied when the number of observations is less than the number of predictors. Moreover, the leave-one-out cross-validation is used to avoid overfitting and this way to choose the structure of a fuzzy model. A method of obtaining piecewise linear regression by means of the zero-order T-S system is also presented.},

By reconstructing the Laplacian matrix with different similarity measurements, a new fuzzy smooth equilibrium clustering (FSEC) model is proposed. This model combines MMC with spectral clustering, but there is no need to solve the eigenvalue decomposition problem. Using the equilibrium regularization term can avoid degenerate solutions.
