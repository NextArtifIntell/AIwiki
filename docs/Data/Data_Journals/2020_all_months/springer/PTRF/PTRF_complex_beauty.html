  abstract     = {Random graphs with latent geometric structure are popular models of social and biological networks, with applications ranging from network user profiling to circuit design. These graphs are also of purely theoretical interest within computer science, probability and statistics. A fundamental initial question regarding these models is: when are these random graphs affected by their latent geometry and when are they indistinguishable from simpler models without latent structure, such as the Erdős–Rényi graph $${\mathcal {G}}(n, p)$$ ? We address this question for two of the most well-studied models of random graphs with latent geometry—the random intersection and random geometric graph. Our results are as follows: (a) The random intersection graph is defined by sampling n random sets $$S_1, S_2, \ldots , S_n$$ by including each element of a set of size d in each $$S_i$$ independently with probability $$\delta $$ , and including the edge $$\{i, j\}$$ if $$S_i \cap S_j \ne \emptyset $$ . We prove that the random intersection graph converges in total variation to an Erdős–Rényi graph if $$d = {\tilde{\omega }}(n^3)$$ , and does not if $$d = o(n^3)$$ , for both dense and sparse edge densities p. This resolves an open problem in Fill et al. (Random Struct Algorithms 16(2):156–176, 2000), Rybarczyk (Random Struct Algorithms 38(1–2):205–234, 2011) and Kim et al. (Random Struct Algorithms 52(4):662–679, 2018). The same result was obtained simultaneously and independently by Bubeck et al. (When random intersection graphs lose geometry. Manuscript, 2019). (b) We strengthen the preceding argument to show that the matrix of random intersection sizes $$|S_i \cap S_j|$$ converges in total variation to a symmetric matrix with independent Poisson entries. This yields the first total variation convergence result for $$\tau $$ -random intersection graphs, where the edge $$\{i, j\}$$ is included if $$|S_i \cap S_j| \ge \tau $$ . More precisely, our results imply that, if p is bounded away from 1, then the $$\tau $$ -random intersection graph with edge density p converges to $${\mathcal {G}}(n, p)$$ if $$d = \omega (\tau ^3 n^3)$$ . (c) The random geometric graph on $${\mathbb {S}}^{d - 1}$$ is defined by sampling $$X_1, X_2, \dots , X_n$$ uniformly at random from $${\mathbb {S}}^{d - 1}$$ and including the edge $$\{i, j\}$$ if $$\Vert X_i - X_j \Vert _2 \le \tau $$ . A result of Bubeck et al. (Random Struct Algorithms 49:503–532, 2016) showed that this model converges to $${\mathcal {G}}(n, p)$$ in total variation, where p is chosen so that the models have matching edge densities, as long as $$d = \omega (n^3)$$ . It was conjectured in Bubeck et al. (2016) that this threshold decreases drastically for p small. We make the first progress towards this conjecture by showing convergence if $$d = {\tilde{\omega }}\left( \min \{ pn^3, p^2 n^{7/2} \} \right) $$ . Our proofs are a hybrid of combinatorial arguments, direct couplings and applications of information inequalities. Previous upper bounds on the total variation distance between random graphs with latent geometry and $${\mathcal {G}}(n, p)$$ have typically not been both combinatorial and information-theoretic, while this interplay is essential to the sharpness of our bounds.},

At each step, with a fixed probability $$p\in (0,1)$$ , $${\hat{U}}_{n+1}$$ is sampled uniformly from $${\hat{U}}_1, \ldots , {\hat{U}}_n$$ , and with complementary probability $$1-p$$ , $${\hat{U}}_{n+1}$$ is a new independent uniform variable. The Glivenko–Cantelli theorem remains valid for the reinforced empirical measure, but not the Donsker theorem. Specifically, we show that the sequence of empirical processes converges in law to a Brownian bridge only up to a constant factor when $$p&lt;1/2$$ , and that a further rescaling is needed when $$p&gt;1/2$$ and the limit is then a bridge with exchangeable increments and discontinuous paths. This is related to earlier limit theorems for correlated Bernoulli processes, the so-called elephant random walk, and more generally step reinforced random walks.},

  abstract     = {A number of researchers have introduced topological structures on the set of laws of stochastic processes. A unifying goal of these authors is to strengthen the usual weak topology in order to adequately capture the temporal structure of stochastic processes. Aldous defines an extended weak topology based on the weak convergence of prediction processes. In the economic literature, Hellwig introduced the information topology to study the stability of equilibrium problems. Bion–Nadal and Talay introduce a version of the Wasserstein distance between the laws of diffusion processes. Pflug and Pichler consider the nested distance (and the weak nested topology) to obtain continuity of stochastic multistage programming problems. These distances can be seen as a symmetrization of Lassalle’s causal transport problem, but there are also further natural ways to derive a topology from causal transport. Our main result is that all of these seemingly independent approaches define the same topology in finite discrete time. Moreover we show that this ‘weak adapted topology’ is characterized as the coarsest topology that guarantees continuity of optimal stopping problems for continuous bounded reward functions.},

Using the new domain, we are able to prove existence and uniqueness for the Kolmogorov backward equation and the martingale problem. We also extend the uniqueness result for “energy solutions” of the stochastic Burgers equation of Gubinelli and Perkowski (J Am Math Soc 31(2):427–471, 2018) to a wider class of equations.

The results are obtained by analysing the extremal values of the stationary distribution of the digraph. In particular, we show that the stationary distribution $$\pi $$ is uniform up to a poly-logarithmic factor, and that for a large class of degree sequences the minimal values of $$\pi $$ have the form $$\frac{1}{n}\log ^{1-\gamma }(n)$$ , while the maximal values of $$\pi $$ behave as $$\frac{1}{n}\log ^{1-\kappa }(n)$$ for some other exponent $$\kappa \in [0,1]$$ .

  abstract     = {We study the phenomenon of intransitivity in models of dice and voting. First, we follow a recent thread of research for n-sided dice with pairwise ordering induced by the probability, relative to 1/2, that a throw from one die is higher than the other. We build on a recent result of Polymath showing that three dice with i.i.d. faces drawn from the uniform distribution on $$\{1,\ldots ,n\}$$ and conditioned on the average of faces equal to $$(n+1)/2$$ are intransitive with asymptotic probability 1/4. We show that if dice faces are drawn from a non-uniform continuous mean zero distribution conditioned on the average of faces equal to 0, then three dice are transitive with high probability. We also extend our results to stationary Gaussian dice, whose faces, for example, can be the fractional Brownian increments with Hurst index $$H\in (0,1)$$ . Second, we pose an analogous model in the context of Condorcet voting. We consider n voters who rank k alternatives independently and uniformly at random. The winner between each two alternatives is decided by a majority vote based on the preferences. We show that in this model, if all pairwise elections are close to tied, then the asymptotic probability of obtaining any tournament on the k alternatives is equal to $$2^{-k(k-1)/2}$$ , which markedly differs from known results in the model without conditioning. We also explore the Condorcet voting model where methods other than simple majority are used for pairwise elections. We investigate some natural definitions of “close to tied” for general functions and exhibit an example where the distribution over tournaments is not uniform under those definitions.},

We prove that there are no outliers outside $$\mathrm{spec} \, T({{\varvec{a}}})$$ , the spectrum of the limiting Toeplitz operator, with probability approaching one, as $$N \rightarrow \infty $$ .

  abstract     = {We consider an optimal transport problem on the unit simplex whose solutions are given by gradients of exponentially concave functions and prove two main results. First, we show that the optimal transport is the large deviation limit of a particle system of Dirichlet processes transporting one probability measure on the unit simplex to another by coordinatewise multiplication and normalizing. The structure of our Lagrangian and the appearance of the Dirichlet process relate our problem closely to the entropic measure on the Wasserstein space as defined by von-Renesse and Sturm in the context of Wasserstein diffusion. The limiting procedure is a triangular limit where we allow simultaneously the number of particles to grow to infinity while the ‘noise’ tends to zero. The method, which generalizes easily to many other cost functions, including the squared Euclidean distance, provides a novel combination of the Schrödinger problem approach due to C. Léonard and the related Brownian particle systems by Adams et al. which does not require gamma convergence. Second, we analyze the behavior of entropy along the paths of transport. The reference measure on the simplex is taken to be the Dirichlet measure with all zero parameters which relates to the finite-dimensional distributions of the entropic measure. The interpolating curves are not the usual McCann lines. Nevertheless we show that entropy plus a multiple of the transport cost remains convex, which is reminiscent of the semiconvexity of entropy along lines of McCann interpolations in negative curvature spaces. We also obtain, under suitable conditions, dimension-free bounds of the optimal transport cost in terms of entropy.},

Together with the complementary lower bound proven by Gwynne and Miller (2017) this shows that the typical graph distance displacement of the walk after n steps is $$n^{1/4 + o_n(1)}$$ , as conjectured by Benjamini and Curien (Geom Funct Anal 2(2):501–531, 2013. arXiv:1202.5454 ). More generally, we show that the simple random walks on a certain family of random planar maps in the $$\gamma $$ -Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) universality class for $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ —including spanning tree-weighted maps, bipolar-oriented maps, and mated-CRT maps—typically travels graph distance $$n^{1/d_\gamma + o_n(1)}$$ in n units of time, where $$d_\gamma $$ is the growth exponent for the volume of a metric ball on the map, which was shown to exist and depend only on $$\gamma $$ by Ding and Gwynne (Commun Math Phys 374:1877–1934, 2018. arXiv:1807.01072 ). Since $$d_\gamma &gt; 2$$ , this shows that the simple random walk on each of these maps is subdiffusive. Our proofs are based on an embedding of the random planar maps under consideration into $${\mathbb {C}}$$ wherein graph distance balls can be compared to Euclidean balls modulo subpolynomial errors. This embedding arises from a coupling of the given random planar map with a mated-CRT map together with the relationship of the latter map to SLE-decorated LQG.},

  abstract     = {We consider a linear elliptic system in divergence form with random coefficients and study the random fluctuations of large-scale averages of the field and the flux of the solution operator. In the context of the random conductance model, we developed in a previous work a theory of fluctuations based on the notion of homogenization commutator: we proved that the two-scale expansion of this special quantity is accurate at leading order in the fluctuation scaling when averaged on large scales (as opposed to the two-scale expansion of the solution operator taken separately) and that the large-scale fluctuations of the field and the flux of the solution operator can be recovered from those of the commutator. This implies that the large-scale fluctuations of the commutator of the corrector drive all other large-scale fluctuations to leading order, which we refer to as the pathwise structure of fluctuations in stochastic homogenization. In the present contribution we extend this result in two directions: we treat continuum elliptic (possibly non-symmetric) systems and allow for strongly correlated coefficient fields (Gaussian-like with a covariance function that can display an arbitrarily slow algebraic decay at infinity). Our main result shows in this general setting that the two-scale expansion of the homogenization commutator is still accurate to leading order when averaged on large scales, which illustrates the robustness of the pathwise structure of fluctuations.},

We undertake a fine study of the dynamics of its solutions, including quantitative energy dissipation estimates yielding the exponential convergence to equilibrium as the time between observations grows larger and larger, as well as a novel class of functional inequalities involving the mean field entropic cost (i.e. the optimal value in (MFSP)). Our strategy unveils an interesting connection between forward backward stochastic differential equations and the Riemannian calculus on the space of probability measures introduced by Otto, which is of independent interest.},

We show that these axioms are satisfied for any subsequential limits of Liouville first passage percolation. Such subsequential limits were proven to exist by Ding et al. (Tightness of Liouville first passage percolation for $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ , 2019. ArXiv e-prints, arXiv:1904.08021 ). It is also known that these axioms are satisfied for the $$\sqrt{8/3}$$ -LQG metric constructed by Miller and Sheffield (2013–2016). For any weak $$\gamma $$ -LQG metric, we obtain moment bounds for diameters of sets as well as point-to-point, set-to-set, and point-to-set distances. We also show that any such metric is locally bi-Hölder continuous with respect to the Euclidean metric and compute the optimal Hölder exponents in both directions. Finally, we show that LQG geodesics cannot spend a long time near a straight line or the boundary of a metric ball. These results are used in subsequent work by Gwynne and Miller which proves that the weak $$\gamma $$ -LQG metric is unique for each $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ , which in turn gives the uniqueness of the subsequential limit of Liouville first passage percolation. However, most of our results are new even in the special case when $$\gamma =\sqrt{8/3}$$ .},

  abstract     = {Kinetically constrained models (KCM) are reversible interacting particle systems on $${{\mathbb {Z}}} ^d$$ with continuous-time constrained Glauber dynamics. They are a natural non-monotone stochastic version of the family of cellular automata with random initial state known as $${{\mathscr {U}}}$$ -bootstrap percolation. KCM have an interest in their own right, owing to their use for modelling the liquid-glass transition in condensed matter physics. In two dimensions there are three classes of models with qualitatively different scaling of the infection time of the origin as the density of infected sites vanishes. Here we study in full generality the class termed ‘critical’. Together with the companion paper by Hartarsky et al. (Universality for critical KCM: finite number of stable directions. arXiv e-prints arXiv:1910.06782 , 2019) we establish the universality classes of critical KCM and determine within each class the critical exponent of the infection time as well as of the spectral gap. In this work we prove that for critical models with an infinite number of stable directions this exponent is twice the one of their bootstrap percolation counterpart. This is due to the occurrence of ‘energy barriers’, which determine the dominant behaviour for these KCM but which do not matter for the monotone bootstrap dynamics. Our result confirms the conjecture of Martinelli et al. (Commun Math Phys 369(2):761–809. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-018-3280-z , 2019), who proved a matching upper bound.},

The purpose of this article is to systematically investigate dimension independent properties of vector valued functions $$f:\{-1,1\}^n\rightarrow X$$ on the Hamming cube whose spectrum is bounded above or below. Our proofs exploit contractivity properties of the heat flow, induced by the geometry of the target space $$(X,\Vert \cdot \Vert _X)$$ , combined with duality arguments and suitable tools from approximation theory and complex analysis. We obtain a series of improvements of various well-studied estimates for functions with bounded spectrum, including moment comparison results for low degree Walsh polynomials and Bernstein–Markov type inequalities, which constitute discrete vector valued analogues of Freud’s inequality in Gauss space (1971). Many of these inequalities are new even for scalar valued functions. Furthermore, we provide a short proof of Mendel and Naor’s heat smoothing theorem (2014) for functions in tail spaces with values in spaces of nontrivial type and we also prove a dual lower bound on the decay of the heat semigroup acting on functions with spectrum bounded from above. Finally, we improve the reverse Bernstein–Markov inequalities of Meyer (in: Seminar on probability, XVIII, Lecture notes in mathematics.

A consequence describes the distribution of the all-time supremum of Dyson Brownian motion with drift. A finite temperature version relates the point-to-line partition functions of two directed polymers, with an inverse-gamma and a Brownian environment, and generalises Dufresne’s identity. Our proof introduces an interacting system of Brownian motions with an invariant measure given by a field of point-to-line log partition functions for the log-gamma polymer.},

For general initial data of the minimal $$L^2$$ regularity, we prove the existence and first order Lagrange condition of an open loop control. In particular, these results apply to the stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equations with the critical quintic and cubic nonlinearities in dimensions one and two, respectively. Furthermore, we obtain uniform estimates of (backward) stochastic solutions in new spaces of type $$U^2$$ and $$V^2$$ , adapted to evolution operators related to linear Schrödinger equations with lower order perturbations. These estimates yield a new temporal regularity of (backward) stochastic solutions, which is crucial for the tightness of approximating controls induced by Ekeland’s variational principle.},

We study this process on the 3-regular tree $${\mathbb {T}}_3$$ , where it is known that the critical threshold $$p_c$$ , below which $${\mathbb {P}}_p$$ -a.s. all spins fixate to $$-1$$ , is strictly less than 1/2. Defining $$\theta (p)$$ to be the $${\mathbb {P}}_p$$ -probability that a vertex fixates to $$+1$$ , we show that $$\theta $$ is a continuous function on [0, 1], so that, in particular, $$\theta (p_c)=0$$ . To do this, we introduce a new continuous-spin process we call the median process, which gives a coupling of all the measures $${\mathbb {P}}_p$$ . Along the way, we study the time-infinity agreement clusters of the median process, show that they are a.s. finite, and deduce that all continuous spins flip finitely often. In the second half of the paper, we show a correlation decay statement for the discrete spins under $${\mathbb {P}}_p$$ for a.e. value of p. The proof relies on finiteness of a vertex’s “trace” in the median process to derive a stability of discrete spins under finite resampling. Last, we use our methods to answer a question of Howard (J Appl Probab 37:736–747, 2000) on the emergence of spin chains in $${\mathbb {T}}_3$$ in finite time.},

  abstract     = {Let G be a Cayley graph of a nonamenable group with spectral radius $$\rho &lt; 1$$ . It is known that branching random walk on G with offspring distribution $$\mu $$ is transient, i.e., visits the origin at most finitely often almost surely, if and only if the expected number of offspring $${\overline{\mu }}$$ satisfies $$\overline{\mu }\le \rho ^{-1}$$ . Benjamini and Müller (Groups Geom Dyn, 6:231–247, 2012) conjectured that throughout the transient supercritical phase $$1&lt;\overline{\mu } \le \rho ^{-1}$$ , and in particular at the recurrence threshold $${\overline{\mu }} = \rho ^{-1}$$ , the trace of the branching random walk is tree-like in the sense that it is infinitely-ended almost surely on the event that the walk survives forever. This is essentially equivalent to the assertion that two independent copies of the branching random walk intersect at most finitely often almost surely. We prove this conjecture, along with several other related conjectures made by the same authors. A central contribution of this work is the introduction of the notion of local unimodularity, which we expect to have several further applications in the future.},

We apply the theorems to essentially all interaction potentials of Ruelle’s class such as the Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential and Riesz potentials, and to logarithmic potentials appearing in random matrix theory. We solve ISDEs of the Ginibre interacting Brownian motion and the sine $$_{\beta }$$ interacting Brownian motion with $$ \beta = 1,2,4$$ . We also use the theorems in separate papers for the Airy and Bessel interacting Brownian motions. One of the critical points for proving the general theorems is to establish a new formulation of solutions of ISDEs in terms of tail $$ \sigma $$ -fields of labeled path spaces consisting of trajectories of infinitely-many particles. These formulations are equivalent to the original notions of solutions of ISDEs, and more feasible to treat in infinite dimensions.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a general technique for proving estimates for certain random planar maps which belong to the $$\gamma $$ -Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) universality class for $$\gamma \in (0,2)$$ . The family of random planar maps we consider are those which can be encoded by a two-dimensional random walk with i.i.d. increments via a mating-of-trees bijection, and includes the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT; $$\gamma =\sqrt{8/3}$$ ); and planar maps weighted by the number of different spanning trees ( $$\gamma =\sqrt{2}$$ ), bipolar orientations ( $$\gamma =\sqrt{4/3}$$ ), or Schnyder woods ( $$\gamma =1$$ ) that can be put on the map. Using our technique, we prove estimates for graph distances in the above family of random planar maps. In particular, we obtain non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cardinality of a graph distance ball consistent with the Watabiki (Prog Theor Phys Suppl 114:1–17, 1993) prediction for the Hausdorff dimension of $$\gamma $$ -LQG and we establish the existence of an exponent for certain distances in the map. The basic idea of our approach is to compare a given random planar map M to a mated-CRT map—a random planar map constructed from a correlated two-dimensional Brownian motion—using a strong coupling (Zaitsev in ESAIM Probab Stat 2:41–108, 1998) of the encoding walk for M and the Brownian motion used to construct the mated-CRT map. This allows us to deduce estimates for graph distances in M from the estimates for graph distances in the mated-CRT map which we proved (using continuum theory) in a previous work. In the special case when $$\gamma =\sqrt{8/3}$$ , we instead deduce estimates for the $$\sqrt{8/3}$$ -mated-CRT map from known results for the UIPT. The arguments of this paper do not directly use SLE/LQG, and can be read without any knowledge of these objects.},

With the novel use of a Tauberian argument and Goldie’s implicit renewal theorem, we provide a unified approach to general log-correlated Gaussian fields in arbitrary dimension and derive precise first order asymptotics of the tail probability, resolving a conjecture of Rhodes and Vargas. The leading order is described by a universal constant that captures the generic property of Gaussian multiplicative chaos, and may be seen as the analogue of the Liouville unit volume reflection coefficients in higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic point processes with Coulomb interactions arise in various natural examples of statistical mechanics, random matrices and optimization problems. Often such systems due to their natural repulsion exhibit remarkable hyperuniformity properties, that is, the number of points landing in any given region fluctuates at a much smaller scale compared to that of a set of i.i.d. random points. A well known conjecture from physics appearing in the works of Jancovici, Lebowitz, Manificat, Martin, and Yalcin (see Jancovici et al. in J Stat Phys 72(3–4):773–787, 1993, Lebowitz in Phys Rev A 27:1491–1494, 1983, Martin and Yalcin in J Stat Phys 22(4):435–463, 1980), states that the variance of the number of points landing in a set should grow like the surface area instead of the volume unlike i.i.d. random points. In a recent beautiful work (Chatterjee in Rigidity of the three-dimensional hierarchical Coulomb gas, 2017. arXiv preprint. arXiv:1708.01965 , To appear in Probability Theory and Related Fields), Chatterjee gave the first proof of such a result in dimension three for a Coulomb type system, known as the hierarchical Coulomb gas, inspired by Dyson’s hierarchical model of the Ising ferromagnet (Dyson in Phys Rev 92:1331–1338, 1953, Dyson in Commun Math Phys 12(2):91–107, 1969). However the case of dimensions greater than three had remained open. In this paper, we establish the correct fluctuation behavior up to logarithmic factors in all dimensions greater than three, for the hierarchical model. Using similar methods, we also prove sharp variance bounds for smooth linear statistics which were unknown in any dimension bigger than two. A key intermediate step is to obtain precise results about the ground states of such models whose behavior can be interpreted as hierarchical analogues of various crystalline conjectures predicted for energy minimizing systems, and could be of independent interest.},

We consider the event that the level-set of the Gaussian free field below a level $$\alpha $$ disconnects the discrete blow-up of a compact set $$A\subseteq {\mathbb {R}}^d$$ from the boundary of an enclosing box. We derive asymptotic large deviation upper bounds on the probability that the local averages of the Gaussian free field deviate from a specific multiple of the harmonic potential of A, when disconnection occurs. These bounds, combined with the findings of the recent work by Duminil-Copin, Goswami, Rodriguez and Severo, show that conditionally on disconnection, the Gaussian free field experiences an entropic push-down proportional to the harmonic potential of A. In particular, due to the slow decay of correlations, the disconnection event affects the field on the whole lattice. Furthermore, we provide a certain ‘profile’ description for the field in the presence of disconnection. We show that while on a macroscopic scale the field is pinned around a level proportional to the harmonic potential of A, it locally retains the structure of a Gaussian free field shifted by a constant value. Our proofs rely crucially on the ‘solidification estimates’ developed in Nitzschner and Sznitman (to appear in J Eur Math Soc, arXiv:1706.07229).},

Well known work by Chalker and Mehlig calculated the expectation of these overlaps for complex Ginibre matrices. For the same model, we extend their results by deriving the distribution of diagonal overlaps (the condition numbers), and their correlations. We prove: (i) convergence of condition numbers for bulk eigenvalues to an inverse Gamma distribution; more generally, we decompose the quenched overlap (i.e. conditioned on eigenvalues) as a product of independent random variables; (ii) asymptotic expectation of off-diagonal overlaps, both for microscopic or mesoscopic separation of the corresponding eigenvalues; (iii) decorrelation of condition numbers associated to eigenvalues at mesoscopic distance, at polynomial speed in the dimension; (iv) second moment asymptotics to identify the fluctuations order for off-diagonal overlaps, when the related eigenvalues are separated by any mesoscopic scale; (v) a new formula for the correlation between overlaps for eigenvalues at microscopic distance, both diagonal and off-diagonal. These results imply estimates on the extreme condition numbers, the volume of the pseudospectrum and the diffusive evolution of eigenvalues under Dyson-type dynamics, at equilibrium.},

It is well-known that in two or more dimensions solutions of this equation are distribution-valued, and the equation has to be interpreted in a renormalised sense. Formally, this renormalisation corresponds to moving the minima of the potential infinitely far apart and making them infinitely deep. We show that despite this renormalisation, solutions behave like perturbations of the deterministic system without renormalisation: they spend large stretches of time close to the minimisers of the (un-renormalised) potential and the exponential contraction rate of different profiles is given by the second derivative of the potential in these points. As an application we prove an Eyring–Kramers law for the transition times between the stable solutions of the deterministic system for fixed initial conditions.},

To that end, we compute the connected two-point spectral correlation function of a Wigner matrix at two mesoscopically separated points. In the mesoscopic regime, density correlations are much weaker than in the microscopic regime. Our result is an explicit formula for the two-point function. This formula implies that the WGMD statistics are valid to leading order on all mesoscopic scales, that in the real symmetric case there are subleading corrections matching precisely the WGMD statistics, while in the complex Hermitian case these subleading corrections are absent. We also uncover non-universal subleading correlations, which dominate over the universal ones beyond a certain intermediate mesoscopic scale. The proof is based on a hierarchy of Schwinger–Dyson equations for a sufficiently large class of polynomials in the entries of the Green function. The hierarchy is indexed by a tree, whose depth is controlled using stopping rules. A key ingredient in the derivation of the stopping rules is a new estimate on the density of states, which we prove to have bounded derivatives of all order on all mesoscopic scales.},

It is known that conditioned on survival up to time N, the random walk range is asymptotically contained in a ball of radius $$\varrho _N=C N^{1/(d+2)}$$ for any $$d\ge 2$$. For $$d=2$$, it is also known that the range asymptotically contains a ball of radius $$(1-\epsilon )\varrho _N$$ for any $$\epsilon &gt;0$$, while the case $$d\ge 3$$ remains open. We complete the picture by showing that for any $$d\ge 2$$, the random walk range asymptotically contains a ball of radius $$\varrho _N-\varrho _N^\epsilon $$ for some $$\epsilon \in (0,1)$$. Furthermore, we show that its boundary is of size at most $$\varrho _N^{d-1}(\log \varrho _N)^a$$ for some $$a&gt;0$$.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a continuous space limit of the vertex reinforced jump process (VRJP) in dimension one, which we call linearly reinforced motion (LRM) on $$\mathbb {R}$$. It is constructed out of a convergent Bass–Burdzy flow. The proof goes through the representation of the VRJP as a mixture of Markov jump processes. As a by-product this gives a representation in terms of a mixture of diffusions of the LRM and of the Bass–Burdzy flow itself. We also show that our continuous space limit can be obtained out of the edge reinforced random walk (ERRW), since the ERRW and the VRJP are known to be closely related. Compared to the discrete space processes, the LRM has an additional symmetry in the initial local times (initial occupation profile): changing them amounts to a deterministic change of the space and time scales.},

Informally, it is the set of points in the domain that can be connected to the boundary by a path on which the GFF does not go below $$-a$$. It is, thus, the two-dimensional analogue of the first hitting time of $$-a$$ by a one-dimensional Brownian motion. We provide an axiomatic characterization of the FPS, a continuum construction using level lines, and study its properties: it is a fractal set of zero Lebesgue measure and Minkowski dimension 2 that is coupled with the GFF $$\Phi $$ as a local set A so that $$\Phi +a$$ restricted to A is a positive measure. One of the highlights of this paper is identifying this measure as a Minkowski content measure in the non-integer gauge $$r \mapsto \vert \log (r)\vert ^{1/2}r^{2}$$, by using Gaussian multiplicative chaos theory.},

After a reduction through invariance arguments, we derive local asymptotic normality (LAN) results in a general high-dimensional framework where the dimension $$p_n$$ goes to infinity at an arbitrary rate with the sample size n, and where the concentration $$\kappa _n$$ behaves in a completely free way with n, which offers a spectrum of problems ranging from arbitrarily easy to arbitrarily challenging ones. We identify various asymptotic regimes, depending on the convergence/divergence properties of $$(\kappa _n)$$, that yield different contiguity rates and different limiting experiments. In each regime, we derive Le Cam optimal tests under specified $$\kappa _n$$ and we compute, from the Le Cam third lemma, asymptotic powers of the classical Watson test under contiguous alternatives. We further establish LAN results with respect to both spike direction and concentration, which allows us to discuss optimality also under unspecified $$\kappa _n$$. To investigate the non-null behavior of the Watson test outside the parametric framework above, we derive its local asymptotic powers through martingale CLTs in the broader, semiparametric, model of rotationally symmetric distributions. A Monte Carlo study shows that the finite-sample behaviors of the various tests remarkably agree with our asymptotic results.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with finite sample approximations to the supremum of a non-degenerate U-process of a general order indexed by a function class. We are primarily interested in situations where the function class as well as the underlying distribution change with the sample size, and the U-process itself is not weakly convergent as a process. Such situations arise in a variety of modern statistical problems. We first consider Gaussian approximations, namely, approximate the U-process supremum by the supremum of a Gaussian process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds. Such Gaussian approximations are, however, not often directly applicable in statistical problems since the covariance function of the approximating Gaussian process is unknown. This motivates us to study bootstrap-type approximations to the U-process supremum. We propose a novel jackknife multiplier bootstrap (JMB) tailored to the U-process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds for the proposed JMB method. All these results are non-asymptotic, and established under fairly general conditions on function classes and underlying distributions. Key technical tools in the proofs are new local maximal inequalities for U-processes, which may be useful in other problems. We also discuss applications of the general approximation results to testing for qualitative features of nonparametric functions based on generalized local U-processes.},

  abstract     = {The Skorokhod Embedding Problem is one of the classical problems in the theory of stochastic processes, with applications in many different fields [cf.  the surveys (Hobson in: Paris-Princeton lectures on mathematical finance 2010, Volume 2003 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer, Berlin, 2011; Obłój in: Probab Surv 1:321–390, 2004)]. Many of these applications have natural multi-marginal extensions leading to the (optimal) multi-marginal Skorokhod problem. Some of the first papers to consider this problem are Brown et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 119(4):558–578, 2001), Hobson (Séminaire de Probabilités, XXXII, Volume 1686 of Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Springer, Berlin, 1998), Madan and Yor (Bernoulli 8(4):509–536, 2002). However, this turns out to be difficult using existing techniques: only recently a complete solution was be obtained in Cox et al. (Probab Theory Relat Fields 173:211–259, 2018) establishing an extension of the Root construction, while other instances are only partially answered or remain wide open. In this paper, we extend the theory developed in Beiglböck et al. (Invent Math 208(2):327–400, 2017) to the multi-marginal setup which is comparable to the extension of the optimal transport problem to the multi-marginal optimal transport problem. As for the one-marginal case, this viewpoint turns out to be very powerful. In particular, we are able to show that all classical optimal embeddings have natural multi-marginal counterparts. Notably these different constructions are linked through a joint geometric structure and the classical solutions are recovered as particular cases. Moreover, our results also have consequences for the study of the martingale transport problem as well as the peacock problem.},

These hypotheses also give precise asymptotics for the limiting behaviour of the probability of exiting a large ball, that is for the extrinsic one-arm probability. We show that these conditions are satisfied by the voter model in dimensions $$d\ge 2$$, sufficiently spread out critical oriented percolation and critical contact processes in dimensions $$d&gt;4$$, and sufficiently spread out critical lattice trees in dimensions $$d&gt;8$$. The latter result proves Conjecture 1.6 of van der Hofstad et al.

  abstract     = {We obtain estimation and excess risk bounds for Empirical Risk Minimizers (ERM) and minmax Median-Of-Means (MOM) estimators based on loss functions that are both Lipschitz and convex. Results for the ERM are derived under weak assumptions on the outputs and subgaussian assumptions on the design as in Alquier et al. (Estimation bounds and sharp oracle inequalities of regularized procedures with Lipschitz loss functions. arXiv:1702.01402, 2017). The difference with Alquier et al. (2017) is that the global Bernstein condition of this paper is relaxed here into a local assumption. We also obtain estimation and excess risk bounds for minmax MOM estimators under similar assumptions on the output and only moment assumptions on the design. Moreover, the dataset may also contains outliers in both inputs and outputs variables without deteriorating the performance of the minmax MOM estimators. Unlike alternatives based on MOM’s principle (Lecué and Lerasle in Ann Stat, 2017; Lugosi and Mendelson in JEMS, 2016), the analysis of minmax MOM estimators is not based on the small ball assumption (SBA) of Koltchinskii and Mendelson (Int Math Res Not IMRN 23:12991–13008, 2015). In particular, the basic example of non parametric statistics where the learning class is the linear span of localized bases, that does not satisfy SBA (Saumard in Bernoulli 24(3):2176–2203, 2018) can now be handled. Finally, minmax MOM estimators are analysed in a setting where the local Bernstein condition is also dropped out. It is shown to achieve excess risk bounds with exponentially large probability under minimal assumptions insuring only the existence of all objects.},

  abstract     = {We consider dynamical percolation on the d-dimensional discrete torus $${\mathbb {Z}}_n^d$$ of side length n, where each edge refreshes its status at rate $$\mu =\mu _n\le 1/2$$ to be open with probability p. We study random walk on the torus, where the walker moves at rate 1 / (2d) along each open edge. In earlier work of two of the authors with A. Stauffer, it was shown that in the subcritical case $$p&lt;p_c({\mathbb {Z}}^d)$$, the (annealed) mixing time of the walk is $$\Theta (n^2/\mu )$$, and it was conjectured that in the supercritical case $$p&gt;p_c({\mathbb {Z}}^d)$$, the mixing time is $$\Theta (n^2+1/\mu )$$; here the implied constants depend only on d and p. We prove a quenched (and hence annealed) version of this conjecture up to a poly-logarithmic factor under the assumption $$\theta (p)&gt;1/2$$. When $$\theta (p)&gt;0$$, we prove a version of this conjecture for an alternative notion of mixing time involving randomised stopping times. The latter implies sharp (up to poly-logarithmic factors) upper bounds on exit times of large balls throughout the supercritical regime. Our proofs are based on percolation results (e.g., the Grimmett–Marstrand Theorem) and an analysis of the volume-biased evolving set process; the key point is that typically, the evolving set has a substantial intersection with the giant percolation cluster at many times. This allows us to use precise isoperimetric properties of the cluster (due to G. Pete) to infer rapid growth of the evolving set, which in turn yields the upper bound on the mixing time.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of various models in statistical physics relies on the existence of decompositions of measures into mixtures of product-like components, where the goal is to attain a decomposition into measures whose entropy is close to that of the original measure, yet with small correlations between coordinates. We prove a related general result: For every measure $$\mu $$ on $${\mathbb {R}}^n$$ and every $$\varepsilon &gt; 0$$, there exists a decomposition $$\mu = \int \mu _\theta d m(\theta )$$ such that $$H(\mu ) - {\mathbb {E}}_{\theta \sim m} H(\mu _\theta ) \le \mathrm {Tr}(\mathrm {Cov}(\mu )) \varepsilon $$ and $${\mathbb {E}}_{\theta \sim m} \mathrm {Cov}(\mu _\theta ) \preceq \mathrm {Id}/\varepsilon $$. As an application, we derive a general bound for the mean-field approximation of Ising and Potts models, which is in a sense dimension free, in both continuous and discrete settings. In particular, for an Ising model on $$\{\pm \, 1 \}^n$$ or on $$[-\,1,1]^n$$, we show that the deficit between the mean-field approximation and the free energy is at most $$C \frac{1+p}{p} \left( n\Vert J\Vert _{S_p} \right) ^{\frac{p}{1+p}} $$ for all $$p&gt;0$$, where $$\Vert J\Vert _{S_p}$$ denotes the Schatten-p norm of the interaction matrix. For the case $$p=2$$, this recovers the result of Jain et al. (Mean-field approximation, convex hierarchies, and the optimality of correlation rounding: a unified perspective. arXiv:1808.07226, 2018), but for an optimal choice of p it often allows to get almost dimension-free bounds.},

Several of our results are new even in the case of $$\mathbb {Z}^d$$, $$d\ge 5$$. In particular, we prove that every tree in the forest has spectral dimension 4/3 and walk dimension 3 almost surely, and that the critical exponents governing the intrinsic diameter and volume of the past of a vertex in the forest are 1 and 1/2 respectively. (The past of a vertex in the uniform spanning forest is the union of the vertex and the finite components that are disconnected from infinity when that vertex is deleted from the forest.) We obtain as a corollary that the critical exponent governing the extrinsic diameter of the past is 2 on any transitive graph of at least five dimensional polynomial growth, and is 1 on any bounded degree nonamenable graph. We deduce that the critical exponents describing the diameter and total number of topplings in an avalanche in the Abelian sandpile model are 2 and 1/2 respectively for any transitive graph with polynomial growth of dimension at least five, and are 1 and 1/2 respectively for any bounded degree nonamenable graph. In the case of $$\mathbb {Z}^d$$, $$d\ge 5$$, some of our results regarding critical exponents recover earlier results of Bhupatiraju et al. (Electron J Probab 22(85):51, 2017). In this case, we improve upon their results by showing that the tail probabilities in question are described by the appropriate power laws to within constant-order multiplicative errors, rather than the polylogarithmic-order multiplicative errors present in that work.},

  abstract     = {The Schelling model of segregation, introduced by Schelling in 1969 as a model for residential segregation in cities, describes how populations of multiple types self-organize to form homogeneous clusters of one type. In this model, vertices in an N-dimensional lattice are initially assigned types randomly. As time evolves, the type at a vertex v has a tendency to be replaced with the most common type within distance w of v. We present the first mathematical description of the dynamical scaling limit of this model as w tends to infinity and the lattice is correspondingly rescaled. We do this by deriving an integro-differential equation for the limiting Schelling dynamics and proving almost sure existence and uniqueness of the solutions when the initial conditions are described by white noise. The evolving fields are in some sense very “rough” but we are able to make rigorous sense of the evolution. In a key lemma, we show that for certain Gaussian fields h, the supremum of the occupation density of $$h-\phi $$ at zero (taken over all 1-Lipschitz functions $$\phi $$) is almost surely finite, thereby extending a result of Bass and Burdzy. In the one dimensional case, we also describe the scaling limit of the limiting clusters obtained at time infinity, thereby resolving a conjecture of Brandt, Immorlica, Kamath, and Kleinberg.},

  abstract     = {Let $$X=\{ X_n\}_{n\in \mathbb {Z}}$$ be zero-mean stationary Gaussian sequence of random variables with covariance function $$\rho $$ satisfying $$\rho (0)=1$$. Let $$\varphi :{\mathbb {R}}\rightarrow {\mathbb {R}}$$ be a function such that $$\mathbb {E}[\varphi (X_0)^2]&lt;\infty $$ and assume that $$\varphi $$ has Hermite rank $$d \ge 1$$. The celebrated Breuer–Major theorem asserts that, if $$\sum _{r\in {\mathbb {Z}}} |\rho (r)|^d&lt;\infty $$ then the finite dimensional distributions of $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum _{i=0}^{\lfloor n\cdot \rfloor -1} \varphi (X_i)$$ converge to those of $$\sigma \,W$$, where W is a standard Brownian motion and $$\sigma $$ is some (explicit) constant. Surprisingly, and despite the fact this theorem has become over the years a prominent tool in a bunch of different areas, a necessary and sufficient condition implying the weak convergence in the space $$\mathbf{D}([0,1])$$ of càdlàg functions endowed with the Skorohod topology is still missing. Our main goal in this paper is to fill this gap. More precisely, by using suitable boundedness properties satisfied by the generator of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck semigroup, we show that tightness holds under the sufficient (and almost necessary) natural condition that $$\mathbb {E}[|\varphi (X_0)|^{p}]&lt;\infty $$ for some $$p&gt;2$$.},

The jump rate of particles is an arbitrary but bounded nondecreasing function of the number of particles. We prove quenched strong local equilibrium at subcritical and critical hydrodynamic densities, and dynamic local loss of mass at supercritical hydrodynamic densities. Our results do not assume starting from local Gibbs states. As byproducts of these results, we prove convergence of the process from given initial configurations with an asymptotic density of particles to the left of the origin. In particular, we relax the weak convexity assumption of Bahadoran et al.

  abstract     = {The nested Kingman coalescent describes the dynamics of particles (called genes) contained in larger components (called species), where pairs of species coalesce at constant rate and pairs of genes coalesce at constant rate provided they lie within the same species. We prove that starting from rn species, the empirical distribution of species masses (numbers of genes/n) at time t / n converges as $$n\rightarrow \infty $$ to a solution of the deterministic coagulation-transport equation $$\begin{aligned} \partial _t d \ = \ \partial _x ( \psi d ) \ + \ a(t)\left( d\,\star \,d - d \right) , \end{aligned}$$where $$\psi (x) = cx^2$$, $$\star $$ denotes convolution and $$a(t)= 1/(t+\delta )$$ with $$\delta =2/r$$. The most interesting case when $$\delta =0$$ corresponds to an infinite initial number of species. This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of species of mass x, where pairs of species can coalesce and each species’ mass evolves like $$\dot{x} = -\psi (x)$$. We provide two natural probabilistic solutions of the latter IPDE and address in detail the case when $$\delta =0$$. The first solution is expressed in terms of a branching particle system where particles carry masses behaving as independent continuous-state branching processes. The second one is the law of the solution to the following McKean–Vlasov equation $$\begin{aligned} dx_t \ = \ - \psi (x_t) \,dt \ + \ v_t\,\Delta J_t \end{aligned}$$where J is an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate $$1/(t+\delta )$$ and $$(v_t; t\ge 0)$$ is a sequence of independent random variables such that $${{\mathcal {L}}}(v_t) = {{\mathcal {L}}}(x_t)$$. We show that there is a unique solution to this equation and we construct this solution with the help of a marked Brownian coalescent point process. When $$\psi (x)=x^\gamma $$, we show the existence of a self-similar solution for the PDE which relates when $$\gamma =2$$ to the speed of coming down from infinity of the nested Kingman coalescent.},
