  abstract     = {The weapon target assignment (WTA) problem, which has received much attention in the literature and is of continuing relevance, seeks within an air defense context to assign interceptors (weapons) to incoming missiles (targets) to maximize the probability of destroying the missiles. Kline et al. (J Heuristics 25:1–21, 2018) developed a heuristic algorithm based upon the solution to the Quiz Problem to solve the WTA. This heuristic found solutions within 6\% of optimal, on average, for smaller problem instances and, when compared to a leading WTA heuristic from the literature, identified superlative solutions for larger instances within hundredths of a second, in lieu of minutes or hours of computational effort. Herein, we propose and test an improvement to the aforementioned heuristic, wherein a modified implementation iteratively blocks exiting assignments to an initial feasible solution, allowing superior solutions that would otherwise be prevented via a greedy selection process to be found. We compare these results to the optimal solutions as reported by a leading global optimization solver (i.e., BARON) and find solutions that are, at worst, within 2\% of optimality and, at best, up to 64\% better than the solutions reported to be optimal by BARON. To wit, the developed metaheuristic outperformed BARON in 25\% of all instances tested, as BARON reported a suboptimal solution as being optimal for 21.1\% of the instances, and it could not identify an optimal solution for the remaining 6.67\% of the instances within 2 h of CPU time, a liberally imposed time limit that far exceeds practical usage considerations for this application.},

Neutral constraints on industries are included as well as investment styles. To develop fast algorithms for the use in the real financial market, we shall expose the special structure of the problem, whose Hessian is the summation of a diagonal matrix and a low rank modification. Specifically, an interior point algorithm taking use of the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula is designed to solve the problem without any sparsity constraint. The complexity in each iteration of the proposed algorithm is shown to be linear with the problem dimension. In the occurrence of a sparsity constraint, we propose an efficient three-block alternating direction method of multipliers, whose subproblems are easy to solve. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared with some state-of-the-art solvers.},

  abstract     = {The selection and development of high-end weapon equipment is a strategic issue for nations. High-end weapon equipment portfolio selection (HWEPS) has attracted much attention because it is closely related to the production, deployment, and operation of weapons, which is a crucial factor determining the outcome of a war. This paper presents a united framework called capability-oriented weapon system portfolio selection (CWSPS) to solve the HWEPS problem based on a heterogeneous combat network. Specifically, the concept of an operation loop is introduced and a heterogeneous combat network model is proposed, with consideration of the different types of functional entities and information flows of high-end weapon equipment systems. Based on this, a new measure called the operational capability evaluation index (OCEI) is first proposed to assess the operational execution capability of a portfolio of high-end equipment systems. Then, a portfolio selection model is established by maximizing the cost-OCEI efficiency of high-end weapon equipment, with capability demand and the budget restriction as constraints. Finally, both an empirical case of missile defense system and numerical experiments are taken to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of CWSPS, and results show that our method can achieve very good performance in solving the HWEPS problem.},

Some structural properties are identified for the optimal solution in some special cases of the studied problem, which contribute to the optimal solution for the studied problem. Further, based on these properties, a novel hybrid algorithm VNS–NKEA is proposed to solve the studied problem, which integrates neighborhood knowledge-based evolutionary algorithm (NKEA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS). To demonstrate the better performance including solution quality and the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance by comparing with other proposed algorithms. The experiment results show that the hybrid algorithm performs quite better than other compared algorithms for each instance, which reflect that the hybrid algorithm can solve the studied problem effectively.},

Scholars have deeply investigated the problem of parallel-batching scheduling and the problem of scheduling with deteriorating jobs separately. However, the situations where both parallel-batching processing and job deterioration exist simultaneously were seldom considered. This paper studies the parallel-batching scheduling problem with nonlinear processing times on a single machine, and proposes several structural properties and an optimal algorithm to solve it. Based on the above properties and optimal algorithm for the single machine setting, we further study the problem of parallel-batching scheduling with nonlinear processing times under the unrelated parallel machine setting. Since the unrelated parallel machines scheduling problem is NP-hard, a hybrid SFLA-VNS algorithm combining Shuffle Frog Leap Algorithm (SFLA) with Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm (VNS) is proposed. Computational experiments and comparison are finally conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the fact that pay-per-use rentals require firms to be responsible for the the operational costs of products and service support network, we establish a pay-per-use rental model where a firm strategically sets the availability of products for rentals to achieve the trade-off between production quantity and operational costs. Furthermore, based on the traditional sale model, we also propose a combined model of sale and pay-per-use rental. The objective is to maximize firm’s profits under three models: the sale model, the pay-per-use rental model, and the hybrid model of sale and rental. The approach of backward induction is adopted to obtain the firm’s optimal decisions on pricing and production volume. Through comparative analysis, we provide the firm’s global optimal strategic solution, and the corresponding solutions in different market environments are developed, respectively, due to the variance of polling effects and costs. The results show that under the no-pooling case where customers’ requests overlap completely, the hybrid model always show higher profitability than the pay-per-use rental model, and it performs better than the sales model only when the per-unit operational and production costs are low. Under the perfect-pooling case where customers’ requests do not overlap, the hybrid model is always the optimal strategy. Numerical experiments are also conducted to illustrate the results under the general pooling case.},

Moreover, piecewise linear decision rules (PLDRs) are also introduced to improve the upper bound that obtained by the widely-used linear decision rule.

The problem covers the risk minimization problem with an expected return constraint and the expected return maximization problem with a risk constraint, as special cases. For the general case of an arbitrary joint distribution for the asset returns, under certain conditions, we characterize the optimal portfolio as the optimal Lagrange multiplier associated to an equality-constrained dual problem.

By examples, we show that there exist linear fractional vector optimization problems with the efficient solution set being a proper subset of the unbounded constraint set, which have improperly efficient solutions. Then, we establish verifiable sufficient conditions for an efficient solution of a linear fractional vector optimization to be a Geoffrion properly efficient solution by using the recession cone of the constraint set. For bicriteria problems, it is enough to employ a system of two regularity conditions. If the number of criteria exceeds two, a third regularity condition must be added to the system. The obtained results complement the above-mentioned remarkable theorem of Choo and are analyzed through several interesting examples, including those given by Hoa et al.

We provide results that allow for a computationally efficient maximum likelihood estimation of the covariance parameters, with a stochastic approximation of the likelihood gradient. We then extend the classical improvement criterion to our setting of joint classification and regression. We provide an efficient computation procedure for the extended criterion and its gradient. We prove the almost sure convergence of the global optimization algorithm following from this extended criterion. We also study the practical performances of this algorithm, both on simulated data and on a real computer model in the context of automotive fan design.},

We first introduce the auxiliary variables to obtain an equivalent problem of problem LMP. An outer space branch and bound algorithm is then designed, which integrates some basic operations such as the linear relaxation technique, branching rule and region reduction technique. The global convergence of the proposed algorithm is established by means of the subsequent solutions of a series of linear programming problems, and its computational complexity is estimated on the basis of the branching rule. Also, we discuss the relationship between the proposed linear relaxation and existing relaxations for LMP.

Inspired by these results, we develop a heuristic sequential procedure that preserves feasibility and aims to improve the objective value at each iteration.

From IoT provider’s perspective, one of the most significant issues is how to set the price that maximizes its revenue while meeting users’ requirements. In this paper, we focus on revenue maximization of the IoT service provider by applying pay per use pricing within the combinatorial sealed-bid auction. Pay per use pricing option implies that each user is charged per unit of consumption according to the actual usage. We assume that a user pays a threshold price for a unit of consumption, which is determined based on the auction. The auction is conducted with bidding prices set up in advance within service level agreement (SLA). We use variable neighbourhood search (VNS) in order to derive the optimal threshold price that maximizes IoT provider’s revenue, and users’ satisfaction. In addition, the optimization within the auction mechanism is conducted using different metaheuristics, which are compared with two types of VNS algorithms.},

This problem was inspired by a real-case of a bulk port in Morocco. To solve the problem we propose at first a mixed-integer programming model. Then, in view of the limitations of the proposed model, we investigate a set of heuristics based on general variable neighborhood search with three variants of variable neighborhood descent as a local search. To validate the proposed model and the proposed heuristic approach, real-world instances are used. The computational results reveal that CPLEX MIP solver consumes a lot of CPU time to solve this model, even sometimes failing to guarantee the optimality of the provided solution.

  abstract     = {The Online Order Batching Problem (OOBP) is a variant of the well-known Order Batching Problem (OBP). As in the OBP, the goal of this problem is to collect all the orders that arrive at a warehouse, following an order batching picking policy, while minimizing a particular objective function. Therefore, orders are grouped in batches, of a maximum predefined capacity, before being collected. Each batch is assigned to a single picker, who collects all the orders within the batch in a single route. Unlike the OBP, this variant presents the peculiarity that the orders considered in each instance are not fully available in the warehouse at the beginning of the day, but they can arrive at the system once the picking process has already begun. Then, batches have to be dynamically updated and, as a consequence, routes must too. In this paper, the maximum turnover time (maximum time that an order remains in the warehouse) and the maximum completion time (total collecting time of all orders received in the warehouse) are minimized. To that aim, we propose an algorithm based in the combination of a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure and a Variable Neighborhood Descent. The best variant of our method has been tested over a large set of instances and it has been favorably compared with the best previous approach in the state of the art.},

This corresponds to an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, also referred to as minimum quartet tree cost (MQTC) problem. We provide details and formulation of this challenging problem, and propose a basic greedy heuristic that is characterized by some appealing insights and findings for speeding up and simplifying the processes of solution generation and evaluation, such as the use of adjacency-like matrices to represent the topology structures of candidate solutions; fast calculation of coefficients and weights of the solution matrices; shortcuts in the enumeration of all solution permutations for a given configuration; and an iterative distance matrix reduction procedure, which greedily merges together highly connected objects which may bring lower values of the quartet cost function in a given partial solution. It will be shown that this basic greedy heuristic is able to improve consistently the performance of popular quartet clustering algorithms in the literature, namely a reduced variable neighbourhood search and a simulated annealing metaheuristic, producing novel efficient solution approaches to the MQTC problem.},

  abstract     = {The risk parity solution to the asset allocation problem yields portfolios where the risk contribution from each asset is made equal. We consider a generalized approach to this problem. First, we set an objective that seeks to maximize the portfolio expected return while minimizing portfolio risk. Second, we relax the risk parity condition and instead bound the risk dispersion of the constituents within a predefined limit. This allows an investor to prescribe a desired risk dispersion range, yielding a portfolio with an optimal risk–return profile that is still well-diversified from a risk-based standpoint. We add robustness to our framework by introducing an ellipsoidal uncertainty structure around our estimated asset expected returns to mitigate estimation error. Our proposed framework does not impose any restrictions on short selling. A limitation of risk parity is that allowing of short sales leads to a non-convex problem. However, we propose an approach that relaxes our generalized risk parity model into a convex semidefinite program. We proceed to tighten this relaxation sequentially through the alternating direction method of multipliers. This procedure iterates between the convex optimization problem and the non-convex problem with a rank constraint. In addition, we can exploit this structure to solve the non-convex problem analytically and efficiently during every iteration. Numerical results suggest that this algorithm converges to a higher quality optimal solution when compared to the competing non-convex problem, and can also yield a higher ex post risk-adjusted rate of return.},

In this paper we extend RCPLD to a very general feasibility system which may include Lipschitz continuous inequality constraints, complementarity constraints and abstract constraints. We show that this RCPLD for the general system is a constraint qualification for the optimality condition in terms of limiting subdifferential and limiting normal cone and it is a sufficient condition for the error bound property under the strict complementarity condition for the complementarity system and Clarke regularity conditions for the inequality constraints and the abstract constraint set.

  abstract     = {The use of surrogate modeling techniques to efficiently solve a single objective optimization (SOO) problem has proven its worth in the optimization community. However, industrial problems are often characterized by multiple conflicting and constrained objectives. Recently, a number of infill criteria have been formulated to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems using surrogates and to determine the Pareto front. Nonetheless, to accurately resolve the front, a multitude of optimal points must be determined, making MOO problems by nature far more expensive than their SOO counterparts. As of yet, even though access to of high performance computing is widely available, little importance has been attributed to batch optimization and asynchronous infill methodologies, which can further decrease the wall-clock time required to determine the Pareto front with a given resolution. In this paper a novel infill criterion is developed for generalized asynchronous multi-objective constrained optimization, which allows multiple points to be selected for evaluation in an asynchronous manner while the balance between design space exploration and objective exploitation is adapted during the optimization process in a simulated annealing like manner and the constraints are taken into account. The method relies on a formulation of the expected improvement for multi-objective optimization, where the improvement is formulated as the Euclidean distance from the Pareto front taken to a higher power. The infill criterion is tested on a series of test cases and proves the effectiveness of the novel scheme.},

  abstract     = {The split feasibility problem is to find an element in the intersection of a closed set C and the linear preimage of another closed set D, assuming the projections onto C and D are easy to compute. This class of problems arises naturally in many contemporary applications such as compressed sensing. While the sets C and D are typically assumed to be convex in the literature, in this paper, we allow both sets to be possibly nonconvex. We observe that, in this setting, the split feasibility problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with a difference-of-convex objective so that standard majorization-minimization type algorithms can be applied. Here we focus on the nonmonotone proximal gradient algorithm with majorization studied in Liu et al. (Math Program, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-018-1327-8 , Appendix A). We show that, when this algorithm is applied to a split feasibility problem, the sequence generated clusters at a stationary point of the problem under mild assumptions. We also study local convergence property of the sequence under suitable assumptions on the closed sets involved. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of our approach on solving split feasibility problems that arise in completely positive matrix factorization, (uniformly) sparse matrix factorization, and outlier detection.},

In this framework, bi-level optimization problems are approximated as single-level optimization problems by collecting samples of the upper-level objective and solving the lower-level problem to global optimality at those sampling points. This process is done through the integration of the DOMINO framework with a grey-box optimization solver to perform design of experiments on the upper-level objective, and to consecutively approximate and optimize bi-level mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems that are challenging to solve using exact methods. The performance of DOMINO is assessed through solving numerous bi-level benchmark problems, a land allocation problem in Food-Energy-Water Nexus, and through employing different data-driven optimization methodologies, including both local and global methods. Although this data-driven approach cannot provide a theoretical guarantee to global optimality, we present an algorithmic advancement that can guarantee feasibility to large-scale bi-level optimization problems when the lower-level problem is solved to global optimality at convergence.},

Computational experiments show that the numerical results obtained by the proposed heuristic improved upon those obtained by a multistart constructive heuristic.

It is a challenging problem to develop efficient optimization scheme, because each function evaluation can be costly and the derivative information of the function is often not available. We propose a novel global optimization framework using adaptive radial basis functions (RBF) based surrogate model via uncertainty quantification. The framework consists of two iteration steps. It first employs an RBF-based Bayesian surrogate model to approximate the true function, where the parameters of the RBFs can be adaptively estimated and updated each time a new point is explored. Then it utilizes a model-guided selection criterion to identify a new point from a candidate set for function evaluation. The selection criterion adopted here is a sample version of the expected improvement criterion. We conduct simulation studies with standard test functions, which show that the proposed method has some advantages, especially when the true function has many local optima. In addition, we also propose modified approaches to improve the search performance for identifying optimal points.},

  abstract     = {Charged-particle therapy is a rapidly growing precision radiotherapy technique that treats tumors with ion beams. Because ion-beam delivery systems have multiple degrees of freedom (including the beam trajectories, energies and fluences), it can be extremely difficult to find a treatment plan that accurately matches the dose prescribed to the tumor while sparing nearby healthy structures. This inverse problem is called inverse treatment planning (ITP). Many ITP approaches have been proposed for the simpler case of X-ray therapy, but the work dedicated to charged-particle therapy is usually limited to optimizing the beam fluences given the trajectories and energies. To fill this gap, we consider the problem of simultaneously optimizing the beam trajectories, energies, and fluences, which we call full ITP. The solutions are the global minima of an objective function defined on a very large search space and having deep local basins of attraction; because of this difficulty, full ITP has not been studied (except in preliminary work of ours). We provide a proof of concept for full ITP by showing that it can be solved efficiently using simulated annealing (SA). The core of our work is the incremental design of a state exploration mechanism that substantially speeds up SA without altering its global convergence properties. We also propose an original approach to tuning the cooling schedule, a task critical to the performance of SA. Experiments with different irradiation configurations and increasingly sophisticated SA algorithms demonstrate the benefits and potential of the proposed methodology, opening new horizons to charged-particle therapy.},

At each iteration, the resulting algorithm constructs/updates a surrogate model of the objective function and generates trial points using a dynamic coordinate search strategy similar to the one used in the Dynamically Dimensioned Search method. To identify a promising best trial point, a non-dominance concept based on the values of the surrogate model and the constraint violation at the trial points is used. Theoretical results concerning the sufficient conditions for the almost surely convergence of the algorithm are presented.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a Delaunay-based derivative-free optimization algorithm, dubbed $$\varDelta $$ -DOGS( $$\varOmega $$ ), for problems with both (a) a nonconvex, computationally expensive objective function f(x), and (b) nonlinear, computationally expensive constraint functions $$c_\ell (x)$$ which, taken together, define a nonconvex, possibly even disconnected feasible domain $$\varOmega $$ , which is assumed to lie within a known rectangular search domain $$\varOmega _s$$ , everywhere within which the f(x) and $$c_\ell (x)$$ may be evaluated. Approximations of both the objective function f(x) as well as the feasible domain $$\varOmega $$ are developed and refined as the iterations proceed. The approach is practically limited to the problems with less than about ten adjustable parameters. The work is an extension of our original Delaunay-based optimization algorithm (see JOGO DOI: 10.1007/s10898-015-0384-2), and inherits many of the constructions and strengths of that algorithm, including: (1) a surrogate function p(x) interpolating all existing function evaluations and summarizing their trends, (2) a synthetic, piecewise-quadratic uncertainty function e(x) built on the framework of a Delaunay triangulation amongst existing datapoints, (3) a tunable balance between global exploration (large K) and local refinement (small K), (4) provable global convergence for a sufficiently large K, under the assumption that the objective and constraint functions are twice differentiable with bounded Hessians, (5) an Adaptive-K variant of the algorithm that efficiently tunes K automatically based on a target value of the objective function, and (6) remarkably fast global convergence on a variety of benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {This article is dedicated to the weight set decomposition of a multiobjective (mixed-)integer linear problem with three objectives. We propose an algorithm that returns a decomposition of the parameter set of the weighted sum scalarization by solving biobjective subproblems via Dichotomic Search which corresponds to a line exploration in the weight set. Additionally, we present theoretical results regarding the boundary of the weight set components that direct the line exploration. The resulting algorithm runs in output polynomial time, i.e. its running time is polynomial in the encoding length of both the input and output. Also, the proposed approach can be used for each weight set component individually and is able to give intermediate results, which can be seen as an “approximation” of the weight set component. We compare the running time of our method with the one of an existing algorithm and conduct a computational study that shows the competitiveness of our algorithm. Further, we give a state-of-the-art survey of algorithms in the literature.},

We develop a novel interpretation of the logical Benders method as a reversed branch-and-bound search, where the whole exploration procedure starts from the leaf nodes in an enumeration tree. This insight enables us to provide a new framework over which we can combine master problem and cut generation in a single process. It also allows us to diversify the search, leading computationally to stronger cuts. We also present an optimization-based sparsification process which makes the cut generation more efficient. Numerical results are presented to show the effectiveness of this enhanced method. Results are also extended to problems with more complementarity constraints, exceeding those that can be handled by the original method in the cited references.},

We use strong duality and complementary slackness conditions to derive exact algorithms for scheduling stochastic equal-length job sequences on a single machine.

We build mathematical programming models for regression subset selection based on mean square and absolute errors, and minimal-redundancy–maximal-relevance criteria. The proposed models are tested using a linear-program-based branch-and-bound algorithm with tailored valid inequalities and big M values and are compared against the algorithms in the literature. For high dimensional cases, an iterative heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the mathematical programming models and a core set concept, and a randomized version of the algorithm is derived to guarantee convergence to the global optimum. From the computational experiments, we find that our models quickly find a quality solution while the rest of the time is spent to prove optimality; the iterative algorithms find solutions in a relatively short time and are competitive compared to state-of-the-art algorithms; using ad-hoc big M values is not recommended.},

Each subproblem is associated with a node of a clique tree of G. The optimal value can be obtained by applying an algorithm that we propose for solving the subproblems recursively from leaf nodes to the root node of the clique-tree. We establish the equivalence between the QOP and its DNN relaxation from the equivalence between the reduced family of subproblems and their DNN relaxations by applying the known results on: (1) CPP and DNN reformulation of a class of QOPs with linear equality, complementarity and binary constraints in 3 nonnegative variables. (2) DNN reformulation of a class of quadratically constrained convex QOPs with any size. (3) DNN reformulation of LPs with any size.

In this article, a deterministic global optimization method is presented for systems consisting of an objective function and constraints with integral terms and an embedded set of nonlinear parametric ODEs. The method is based on a branch-and-bound algorithm that uses a new class of underestimators recently proposed by Hasan (J Glob Optim 71:735–752, 2018). At each node of the branch-and-bound tree, instead of using a convex relaxation, an edge-concave underestimator or the linear facets of its convex envelope is used to compute a lower bound. The underestimator is constructed by finding valid upper bounds on the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix of the nonconvex terms. Time dependent bounds on the state variables and diagonal elements of the Hessian are obtained by solving an auxiliary set of ODEs that is derived using the notion of differential inequalities. The performance of the edge-concave relaxation is compared to other approaches on several test problems.},

In this work, we propose novel optimality conditions for NLP and MINLP problems and apply them for domain reduction prior to solving a node in branch-and-bound. The conditions apply to nonconvex inequality-constrained problems for which we exploit monotonicity properties of objectives and constraints. We develop three separate reduction algorithms for unconstrained, one-constraint, and multi-constraint problems. We use the optimality conditions to reduce ranges of variables through forward and backward bound propagation of gradients respective to each decision variable. We describe an efficient implementation of these techniques in the branch-and-bound solver BARON. The implementation dynamically recognizes and ignores inactive constraints at each node of the search tree. Our computations demonstrate that the proposed techniques often reduce the solution time and total number of nodes for continuous problems; they are less effective for mixed-integer programs.},

  abstract     = {We study the behavior of the Douglas–Rachford algorithm on the graph vertex-coloring problem. Given a graph and a number of colors, the goal is to find a coloring of the vertices so that all adjacent vertex pairs have different colors. In spite of the combinatorial nature of this problem, the Douglas–Rachford algorithm was recently shown to be a successful heuristic for solving a wide variety of graph coloring instances, when the problem was cast as a feasibility problem on binary indicator variables. In this work we consider a different formulation, based on semidefinite programming. The much improved performance of the Douglas–Rachford algorithm, with this new approach, is demonstrated through various numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {The Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (SKM) algorithm is a generalized method for solving large-scale linear systems of inequalities. Having its root in the relaxation method of Agmon, Schoenberg, and Motzkin and the randomized Kaczmarz method, SKM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in solving large-scale Linear Feasibility (LF) problems. Motivated by SKM’s success, in this work, we propose an Accelerated Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (ASKM) algorithm which achieves better convergence compared to the standard SKM algorithm on ill-conditioned problems. We provide a thorough convergence analysis for the proposed accelerated algorithm and validate the results with various numerical experiments. We compare the performance and effectiveness of ASKM algorithm with SKM, Interior Point Method (IPM) and Active Set Method (ASM) on randomly generated instances as well as Netlib LPs. In most of the test instances, the proposed ASKM algorithm outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.},

Starting from a binary, quadratic formulation in the original space of location and allocation variables that are common in location analysis (L.A.), we prove that there exists a transformation of that formulation, using the same space of variables, that allows us to cast DOMP as a continuous, linear programming problem in the space of completely positive matrices. This is the first positive result that states equivalence between the family of continuous, convex problems and some hard combinatorial problems in L.A. The result is of theoretical interest because it allows us to share the tools from continuous optimization to shed new light into the difficult combinatorial structure of the class of ordered median problems that combines elements of the p-median, quadratic assignment and permutation polytopes.},

In this paper, we consider this problem with capacitated constraint under the $$l_{p}$$-norm, where p is an integer and $$p \in [1,+\,\infty )$$. Firstly, we characterize the feasible solutions of this problem. Then, we present a $$\root p \of {k}$$-approximation algorithm for this problem when the weight function can only be decreased, where k is the number of edges in the given edge set. Finally, when the weight function can be either decreased and increased, we propose an approximation algorithm for the general case and analyse its approximation ratio. Moreover, we remark that these algorithms can be generalized under the weighted $$l_{p}$$-norm and the weighted sum Hamming distance.},

In this paper, we improve the existing sawtooth-curve bounds to new wave-curve bounds, which are used to develop a more efficient branch-and-bound algorithm.

In all these cases, we also show that a linear objective can be optimized in polynomial time over these sets. Towards the application side, we show how these sets relate to commonly occurring substructures of a general quadratically constrained quadratic program. To further illustrate the benefit of studying quadratically constrained quadratic programs from a rank-one perspective, we propose new rank-one formulations for the generalized pooling problem and use our convexification results to obtain several new convex relaxations for the pooling problem. Finally, we run a comprehensive set of computational experiments and show that our convexification results together with discretization significantly help in improving dual bounds for the generalized pooling problem.},

We integrate these within the Branch-and-Sandwich algorithm (Kleniati and Adjiman in J Glob Opt 60:425–458, 2014), which is based on a branch-and-bound framework and enables the solution of a wide range of problems, including those with nonconvex inequalities and equalities in the inner problem. The impact of the proposed modifications is demonstrated on an illustrative example and 10 nonconvex bilevel test problems from the literature. It is found that the performance of the algorithm is improved for all but one problem (where the CPU time is increased by 2\%), with an average reduction in CPU time of 39\%. For the two most challenging problems, the CPU time required is decreased by factors of over 3 and 10.},

Then, we investigate on the approximation of solutions to tensor variational inequalities by using suitable perturbed tensor variational inequalities. We establish the convergence of solutions to the regularized tensor variational inequalities to a solution of the original tensor variational inequality making use of the set convergence in Kuratowski’s sense.

In the first phase, a sequence of linear integer relaxed sub-problems (LP phase) is solved in order to rapidly generate a good linear relaxation of the original MINLP problem. In the second phase, the algorithm solves a sequence of mixed integer linear programming sub-problems (MIP phase). In both phases the outer approximation is improved iteratively by adding new supporting hyperplanes by solving many easier sub-problems in parallel. DECOA is implemented as a part of Decogo (Decomposition-based Global Optimizer), a parallel decomposition-based MINLP solver implemented in Python and Pyomo. Preliminary numerical results based on 70 convex MINLP instances up to 2700 variables show that due to the generated cuts in the LP phase, on average only 2–3 MIP problems have to be solved in the MIP phase.},

  abstract     = {Distributed and parallel algorithms have been frequently investigated in the recent years, in particular in applications like machine learning. Nonetheless, only a small subclass of the optimization algorithms in the literature can be easily distributed, for the presence, e.g., of coupling constraints that make all the variables dependent from each other with respect to the feasible set. Augmented Lagrangian methods are among the most used techniques to get rid of the coupling constraints issue, namely by moving such constraints to the objective function in a structured, well-studied manner. Unfortunately, standard augmented Lagrangian methods need the solution of a nested problem by needing to (at least inexactly) solve a subproblem at each iteration, therefore leading to potential inefficiency of the algorithm. To fill this gap, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method to solve convex problems with linear coupling constraints that can be distributed and requires a single gradient projection step at every iteration. We give a formal convergence proof to at least $$\varepsilon $$-approximate solutions of the problem and a detailed analysis of how the parameters of the algorithm influence the value of the approximating parameter $$\varepsilon $$. Furthermore, we introduce a distributed version of the algorithm allowing to partition the data and perform the distribution of the computation in a parallel fashion.},

  abstract     = {In real life applications, optimization problems with more than one objective function are often of interest. Next to handling multiple objective functions, another challenge is to deal with uncertainties concerning the realization of the decision variables. One approach to handle these uncertainties is to consider the objectives as set-valued functions. Hence, the image of one decision variable is a whole set, which includes all possible outcomes of this decision variable. We choose a robust approach and thus these sets have to be compared using the so-called upper-type less order relation. We propose a numerical method to calculate a covering of the set of optimal solutions of such an uncertain multiobjective optimization problem. We use a branch-and-bound approach and lower and upper bound sets for being able to compare the arising sets. The calculation of these lower and upper bound sets uses techniques known from global optimization, as convex underestimators, as well as techniques used in convex multiobjective optimization as outer approximation techniques. We also give first numerical results for this algorithm.},

The unit modulus lifting arises in applications such as digital communications and shares similar symmetry properties as the max-cut-polytope. Set-completely positive representations of both sets are derived and the relation of the complex unit modulus lifting to its semidefinite relaxation is investigated in dimensions 3 and 4. It is shown that the unit modulus lifting coincides with its semidefinite relaxation in dimension 3 but not in dimension 4. In dimension 4 a family of deep valid cuts for the unit modulus lifting is derived that could be used to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. It turns out that the deep cuts are also implied by a second lifting that could be used alternatively. Numerical experiments are presented comparing the first lifting, the second lifting, and the unit modulus lifting for $$n=4$$.},

  abstract     = {Unitary symmetric eigenvalues (US-eigenvalues) of symmetric complex tensors and unitary eigenvalues (U-eigenvalues) for non-symmetric complex tensors are very important because of their background of quantum entanglement. US-eigenvalue is a generalization of Z-eigenvalue from the real case to the complex case, which is closely related to the best complex rank-one approximations to higher-order tensors. The problem of finding US-eigenpairs can be converted to an unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem with complex variables, their complex conjugate variables and real variables. However, optimization methods often need a first- or second-order derivative of the objective function, and cannot be applied to real valued functions of complex variables because they are not necessarily analytic in their argument. In this paper, we first establish the first-order complex Taylor series and Wirtinger calculus of complex gradient of real-valued functions with complex variables, their complex conjugate variables and real variables. Based on this theory, we propose a norm descent cautious BFGS method for computing US-eigenpairs of a symmetric complex tensor. Under appropriate conditions, global convergence and superlinear convergence of the proposed method are established. As an application, we give a method to compute U-eigenpairs for a non-symmetric complex tensor by finding the US-eigenpairs of its symmetric embedding. The numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical findings.},

Since the inertial step is performed once the x-subproblem/y-subproblem is updated, the algorithm is a Gauss–Seidel type inertial proximal alternating linearized minimization (GiPALM) algorithm. Under the assumption that the underlying functions satisfy the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) property and some suitable conditions on the parameters, we prove that each bounded sequence generated by GiPALM globally converges to a critical point. We apply the algorithm to signal recovery, image denoising and nonnegative matrix factorization models, and compare it with PALM and the inertial proximal alternating linearized minimization.},

This paper considers the more general and practical case of MSWP called the constrained multi-source Weber problem (CMSWP), i.e., locating multiple facilities with the consideration of the gauge for measuring distances and locational constraints on new facilities. According to the favorable structure of the involved location subproblems after reformulation, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) type method is contributed to solving these subproblems under different distance measures in a uniform framework. Then a new ADMM-based location–allocation algorithm is presented for CMSWP and its local convergence is theoretically proved.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a hybrid Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers for solving the linearly constrained difference-of-convex problems whose objective can be written as the sum of a smooth convex function with Lipschitz gradient, a proper closed convex function and a continuous concave function. At each iteration, we choose either subgradient step or proximal step to evaluate the concave part. Moreover, the extrapolation technique was utilized to compute the nonsmooth convex part. We prove that the sequence generated by the proposed method converges to a critical point of the considered problem under the assumption that the potential function is a Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz function. One notable advantage of the proposed method is that the convergence can be guaranteed without the Lischitz continuity of the gradient function of concave part. Preliminary numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Traffic police faces the problem of enforcing speed limits under restricted budget. Implementing high Enforcement Thresholds (ET) will ease the workload on the police but will also intensify the problem of speeding. We model this as a game between the police, which wish that drivers obey the speed limits and the drivers who wish to speed without getting caught. For the police we construct a multi-stage strategy in which at each stage the ET is randomized between low and high values. This confuses the drivers who now need to consider the worst case of low ET. We establish analytically and by simulations that this strategy gradually reduces the ET until it converges to the desired speed limit without increasing the workload along the process. Importantly, this method works even if the strategy is known to the drivers. We study the effect of several factors on the convergence rate of the process. Interestingly, we find that increasing the frequency of randomization is more effective in expediting the process than raising the average amount of fines.},

This problem is characterized by two main features. First, the dynamical control system to be considered may not possess the so-called well-posedness property. Second, the constraints on the one-sided limits of states are presented. Such constraints are interpreted as multipoint state constraints. For this problem, we derive global optimality conditions based on using of compound Lyapunov type functions which possess strongly monotone properties with respect to the control system. As a motivating case, a model of advertising expenses optimization for mutually complementary products is considered. For this model, we propose four variants of resolving sets of Lyapunov type functions and explain the technique of applying the optimality conditions.},

In this way we fill some gaps in the existing theory. In particular, we prove that the anti-consensus algorithm over the complete graph on $$S^3$$ converges towards a balanced configuration if a certain mild condition on initial positions of agents is satisfied.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate new generalizations of Fritz John (FJ) and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for nonconvex nonsmooth mathematical programming problems with inequality constraints and a geometric constraint set. After defining generalized FJ and KKT conditions, we provide some alternative-type characterizations for them. We present characterizations of KKT optimality conditions without assuming traditional Constraint Qualification (CQ), invoking strong duality for a sublinear approximation of the problem in question. Such characterizations will be helpful when traditional CQs fail. We present the results with more details for a problem with a single-inequality constraint, and address an application of the derived results in mathematical programming problems with equilibrium constraints. The objective function and constraint functions of the dealt with problem are nonsmooth and we establish our results in terms of the Clarke generalized directional derivatives and generalized gradient. The results of the current paper cover classic optimality conditions existing in the literature and extend the outcomes of Flores-Bazan and Mastroeni (SIAM J Optim 25:647–676, 2015).},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the expressive power of completely positive programming to encode hard optimization problems, many approximation schemes for the completely positive cone have been proposed and successfully used. Most schemes are based on outer approximations, with the only inner approximations available being a linear programming based method proposed by Bundfuss and Dür (SIAM J Optim 20(1):30–53, 2009) and also Yıldırım (Optim Methods Softw 27(1):155–173, 2012), and a semidefinite programming based method proposed by Lasserre (Math Program 144(1):265–276, 2014). In this paper, we propose the use of the cone of nonnegative scaled diagonally dominant matrices as a natural inner approximation to the completely positive cone. Using projections of this cone we derive new graph-based second-order cone approximation schemes for completely positive programming, leading to both uniform and problem-dependent hierarchies. This offers a compromise between the expressive power of semidefinite programming and the speed of linear programming based approaches. Numerical results on random problems, standard quadratic programs and the stable set problem are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

We describe in detail an instance of our general model that considers the optimization of three different criteria such as cost, risk and cash balance stability. We claim that cash balance stability is an interesting goal to deal with the inherent uncertainty of expected cash flows. We also provide useful instructions for cash managers to set the main parameters of our model in practice.

  abstract     = {In recent years, thematic exchange-traded funds have arisen and broaden the narrow thinking of purely monetary driven investment decisions. Ethical concerns, a stronger belief in society-shaped trends, or the conformity with personal convictions motivate investors to include non-monetary objectives in so called thematic funds. Thematic investors follow a modified core satellite strategy in which conventional funds ensure diversification. Investors’ non-monetary interests manifest within additional satellite funds. Both portfolios are separately allocated so that inter-portfolio correlation effects are not considered and inefficient core satellite portfolios are allocated. However, in order to reduce the inefficiency of such a core satellite strategy, this study addresses fund providers and develops the idea of tailoring thematic funds to conventional ones. An empirical investigation shows that by easing the efficiency constraint for the satellite portfolio, correlation effects between the portfolios can be exploited. At the expense of an average relative volatility increase of 4.55\%, the inefficiency of core satellite portfolios can be reduced by an average of 11.74\% compared to volatilities of efficient tri-criterion portfolios. Further analysis of these thematic products shows that tailored products can also be more concentrated within a given theme. This opens up new opportunities for fund providers to become more involved in various thematic trends and at the same time achieve better performance for core satellite investors.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new credibility portfolio selection model, in which a measure of loss aversion is introduced as an objective function, joint to the expected value of the returns and the below-mean absolute semi-deviation as a risk measure. The uncertainty of the future returns is directly approximated using the historical returns on the portfolios, so the uncertain return on a given portfolio is modeled as an LR-power fuzzy variable. Quantifying the uncertainty by means of a credibility distribution allows us to measure the investors’ loss aversion as the credibility of achieving a non-positive return, which is better perceived by investors than other measures of risk. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships between the three objective functions, showing that the risk measure and the loss aversion function are practically uncorrelated. Thus, the information provided by these criteria do not overlap each other. In order to generate several non-dominated portfolios taking into account the investor’s preferences and that the problem is non-linear and non-convex, we apply up to three preference-based EMO algorithms. These algorithms allow to approximate a part of the Pareto optimal front called region of interest. We analyze three investor profiles taking into account their loss-adverse attitudes: conservative, cautious and aggressive. A computational study is performed with data of the Spanish stock market, showing the important role played by the loss aversion function to generate a diversified set of non-dominated portfolios fitting the expectations of each investor.},

Motivated by the stability of optimal solutions computed by optimizing only the second moment and applying the robust optimization methodology which allows to incorporate the uncertainty in the optimization model itself, we extend and combine existing methodologies in order to define a method for computing relative-robust and absolute-robust minimum variance portfolios. For the relative robust strategy, where the maximum regret is minimized, regret is defined as the increase in the investment risk resulting from investing in a given portfolio instead of choosing the optimal portfolio of the realized scenario. The absolute robust strategy which minimizes the maximum risk was applied assuming the worst-case scenario over the whole uncertainty set. Across alternate time windows, results provide new evidence that the proposed robust minimum variance portfolios outperform non-robust portfolios. Whether portfolio measurement is based on return, risk, regret or modified Sharpe ratio, results suggest that the robust methodologies are able to optimize the first and second moments without the need to estimate expected returns.},

However, the optimization approach tends to amplify the estimation errors on the parameters required by the model, such as expected returns and covariances. For this reason, the Risk Parity model, a novel risk diversification approach to portfolio selection, has been recently theoretically developed and used in practice, mainly for the case of the volatility risk measure. Here we first provide new theoretical results for the Risk Parity approach for general risk measures. Then we propose a novel framework for portfolio selection that combines the diversification and the optimization approaches through the global solution of a hard nonlinear mixed integer or pseudo Boolean problem. For the latter problem we propose an efficient and accurate Multi-Greedy heuristic that extends the classical single-threaded greedy approach to a multiple-threaded setting. Finally, we provide empirical results on real-world data showing that the diversified optimal portfolios are only slightly suboptimal in-sample with respect to optimal portfolios, and generally show improved out-of-sample performance with respect to their purely diversified or purely optimized counterparts.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a new regularization technique, using what we refer to as the Steklov regularization function, and apply this technique to devise an algorithm that computes a global minimizer of univariate coercive functions. First, we show that the Steklov regularization convexifies a given univariate coercive function. Then, by using the regularization parameter as the independent variable, a trajectory is constructed on the surface generated by the Steklov function. For monic quartic polynomials, we prove that this trajectory does generate a global minimizer. In the process, we derive some properties of quartic polynomials. Comparisons are made with a previous approach which uses a quadratic regularization function. We carry out numerical experiments to illustrate the working of the new method on polynomials of various degree as well as a non-polynomial function.},

  abstract     = {The challenge of taking many variables into account in optimization problems may be overcome under the hypothesis of low effective dimensionality. Then, the search of solutions can be reduced to the random embedding of a low dimensional space into the original one, resulting in a more manageable optimization problem. Specifically, in the case of time consuming black-box functions and when the budget of evaluations is severely limited, global optimization with random embeddings appears as a sound alternative to random search. Yet, in the case of box constraints on the native variables, defining suitable bounds on a low dimensional domain appears to be complex. Indeed, a small search domain does not guarantee to find a solution even under restrictive hypotheses about the function, while a larger one may slow down convergence dramatically. Here we tackle the issue of low-dimensional domain selection based on a detailed study of the properties of the random embedding, giving insight on the aforementioned difficulties. In particular, we describe a minimal low-dimensional set in correspondence with the embedded search space. We additionally show that an alternative equivalent embedding procedure yields simultaneously a simpler definition of the low-dimensional minimal set and better properties in practice. Finally, the performance and robustness gains of the proposed enhancements for Bayesian optimization are illustrated on numerical examples.},

Functions for which such a representation is valid we call exhausterable. This class of functions is quite wide and contains many nonsmooth ones. The set of exhausterable function is also called exhausterable. In the present paper we describe optimality conditions for an exhausterable function on an exhausterable set. These conditions can be used for solving many nondifferentiable optimization problems. An example that illustrate obtained results is provided.},

  abstract     = {In this article we propose a new approach to an analysis of DC optimization problems. This approach was largely inspired by codifferential calculus and the method of codifferential descent and is based on the use of a so-called affine support set of a convex function instead of the Frenchel conjugate function. With the use of affine support sets we define a global codifferential mapping of a DC function and derive new necessary and sufficient global optimality conditions for DC optimization problems. We also provide new simple necessary and sufficient conditions for the global exactness of the $$\ell _1$$ penalty function for DC optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints and present a series of simple examples demonstrating a constructive nature of the new global optimality conditions. These examples show that when the optimality conditions are not satisfied, they can be easily utilised in order to find “global descent” directions of both constrained and unconstrained problems. As an interesting theoretical example, we apply our approach to the analysis of a nonsmooth problem of Bolza.},
