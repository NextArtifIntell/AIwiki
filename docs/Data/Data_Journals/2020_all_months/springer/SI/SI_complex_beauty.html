  abstract     = {Adopting a multi-agent systems paradigm, we developed, tested and exploited a computational testbed that simulates gathering features of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. It features a tailored design and implementation to manage discrete simulations with autonomous agents on a microscopic scale, thus focusing on their social behavior and mutual interactions. Hence, we could assess the behavioral conditions under which decentralized gathering could occur. We investigated the dependence of the model dynamics on the main physical variables, namely density and number of amoebas, gaining indications that the process strongly depends on both. This result integrates previous researches, where density is identified as the sole relevant variable. We determined a high-density and high-numerosity region where assuming a scale-free behavior is safe. We also estimated the systematic uncertainties arising from a number of amoebas off the scale-free region, when coping with limited computational resources. Finally, we probed the robustness of the simulated gathering process against both extrinsic and intrinsic noise sources.},

In this case, the swarm performs a forced move. In this paper, we are interested in how, by counting the forced moves, the swarm can decide for itself to stop its movement because it is improbable to find better candidate solutions than the already-found best solution. We formally prove that when the swarm is close to a (local) optimum, it behaves like a blind-searching cloud and that the frequency of forced moves exceeds a certain, objective function-independent value. Based on this observation, we define stopping criteria and evaluate them experimentally showing that good candidate solutions can be found much faster than setting upper bounds on the iterations and better solutions compared to applying other solutions from the literature.},

  abstract     = {Segregative behaviors, in which individuals with common characteristics are placed together and set apart from other groups, are commonly found in nature. In swarm robotics, these behaviors can be important in different tasks that require a heterogeneous group of robots to be divided in homogeneous sets according to their physical (sensors, actuators) or logical (algorithms) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a controller that can spatially segregate a swarm of robots in two specific ways: clusters and concentric rings. By segregation, we mean that the swarm is partitioned in groups, with similar robots belonging to a same group, and these groups are spatially separated from each other. We achieve this by adapting and extending the differential potential concept, an abstraction of the mechanism by which cells achieve segregation. We present stability analysis and perform simulated experiments in 2D and 3D spaces in order to show the robustness of the proposed controller. Experiments with a limited number of real robots are also presented as a proof of concept. Results show that our approach allows a swarm of heterogeneous robots to segregate in a stable, compact, and collision-free fashion.},

In swarms where agents have differing thresholds, adding a response probability is expected to distribute task experiences among more agents, which can increase the robustness of the swarm. If the lowest threshold agents for a task become unavailable, distributing task experience among more agents increases the chance that there are other agents in the swarm with experience on the task, which reduces performance decline due to the loss of experienced agents. We begin with a mathematical analysis of such a system and show that, for a given swarm and task demand, we can estimate the response probability values that ensure team formation and meet robustness constraints. We then verify the expected behavior on an agent based model of a foraging problem. Results indicate that response probability may be used to tune the tradeoff between system performance and system robustness.},

We validate our approach on two common scenarios for a robot swarm: the election of a leader and the allocation of a set of tasks. With the proposed model, we verify the functional correctness of these consensus-based algorithms, as well as assessing their robustness to communication loss and robot failures.},

  abstract     = {Social insects allocate their workforce in a decentralised fashion, addressing multiple tasks and responding effectively to environmental changes. This process is fundamental to their ecological success, but the mechanisms behind it are not well understood. While most models focus on internal and individual factors, empirical evidence highlights the importance of ecology and social interactions. To address this gap, we propose a game theoretical model of task allocation. Our main findings are twofold: Firstly, the specialisation emerging from self-organised task allocation can be largely determined by the ecology. Weakly specialised colonies in which all individuals perform more than one task emerge when foraging is cheap; in contrast, harsher environments with high foraging costs lead to strong specialisation in which each individual fully engages in a single task. Secondly, social interactions lead to important differences in dynamic environments. Colonies whose individuals rely on their own experience are predicted to be more flexible when dealing with change than colonies relying on social information. We also find that, counter to intuition, strongly specialised colonies may perform suboptimally, whereas the group performance of weakly specialised colonies approaches optimality. Our simulation results fully agree with the predictions of the mathematical model for the regions where the latter is analytically tractable. Our results are useful in framing relevant and important empirical questions, where ecology and interactions are key elements of hypotheses and predictions.},

Some observations of different kinds of flocking birds repositioning within a flock have been reported. This observation is here interpreted in an energetic context as well as its aerodynamic aspects. This paper presents the repositioning aerodynamics analysis of birds that fly in V-shaped flocks and their energy-saving consequences. This analysis demonstrates how Canada Geese can fly very far in a single day through repositioning. Extensive analysis shows that leader and tail position switching of 14 Canada Geese can improve the flight range and endurance of these migrating birds more than 44.6\%.

Several local and global search strategies, and learning and parameter adaptation strategies have been included in particle swarm optimization to improve its performance over the years. Most of these approaches are observed to increase the number of user-defined parameters and algorithmic steps resulting in an increased complexity of the algorithm. This paper presents a simplified multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in which the exploitation (guided) and exploration (random) moves are simplified using a detailed qualitative analysis of similar existing operators present in the real-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The developed algorithm is then tested quantitatively on 30 well-known benchmark problems and compared with a real-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, and its variant with a simulated binary jumping gene operator and multi-objective non-dominated sorting particle swarm optimization algorithm. In the comparison, the developed algorithm is found to be superior in terms of convergence speed. It is also found to be better with respect to four recent multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms and four differential evolution variants in an extended comparative analysis. Finally, it is applied to a newly formulated industrial multi-objective optimization problem of a residue (bottom product from the crude distillation unit) fluid catalytic cracking unit where it shows a better performance than the other compared algorithms.},

We present a generic model and control law for robots cooperatively manipulating an object, for both ground and floating systems. The control method exploits a leader–follower scheme and is based only on implicit communication (i.e., the sensing of contact forces). The control objective mainly consists of steering the object manipulated by the swarm of robots to a desired position and orientation in a cooperative way. For a system with just one leader, we present analytical results on the equilibrium configurations and their stability that are then validated by numerical simulations. The role of object internal forces (induced by the robots through contact forces) is discussed in terms of convergence of the object position and orientation to the desired values. We also present a discussion on additional properties of the controlled system that were investigated using thorough numerical analysis, namely the robustness of the system when the object is subject to external disturbances in non-ideal conditions, and how the number of leaders in the swarm can affect the aforementioned convergence and robustness.},

Here, we present a collective foraging system based on virtual pheromones, tested in simulation and in swarms of up to 200 physical robots. Our individual agent controllers are highly simplified, as they are based on binary pheromone sensors. Despite being simple, our individual controllers are able to reproduce classical foraging experiments conducted with more capable real ants that sense pheromone concentration and follow its gradient. One key feature of our controllers is a control parameter which balances the trade-off between distance selectivity and quality selectivity of individual foragers. We construct an optimal foraging theory model that accounts for distance and quality of resources, as well as overcrowding, and predicts a swarm-size-dependent strategy. We test swarms implementing our controllers against our optimality model and find that, for moderate swarm sizes, they can be parameterised to approximate the optimal foraging strategy.

  abstract     = {The reality gap—the discrepancy between reality and simulation—is a critical issue in the off-line automatic design of control software for robot swarms, as well as for single robots. It is understood that the reality gap manifests itself as a drop in performance: when control software generated in simulation is ported to physical robots, the performance observed is often disappointing compared with the one obtained in simulation. In this paper, we investigate whether, to observe the effects of the reality gap, it is necessary to assume that the control software is designed in a context that is simpler than the one in which it is evaluated. In the first experiment, we show that a performance drop may be observed also in an artificial, simulation-only reality gap: control software is generated on the basis of a simulation model and assessed on a second one. We will call this second model a pseudo-reality. We selected the simulation model to be used as a pseudo-reality by trial and error, so as to qualitatively replicate previously published observations made in experiments with physical robots. The results show that a performance drop occurs even if we can exclude that pseudo-reality is more complex than the simulation model used for the design. In the second experiment, we eliminate the trial-and-error selection of the first experiment by evaluating control software across multiple pseudo-realities, which are sampled around the original simulation model used for the design. The results of the second experiment confirm those of the first one and show that they do not depend on the specific pseudo-reality we previously selected by trial and error. Moreover, they suggest that one could use multiple pseudo-realities to evaluate automatic design methods and, from this simulation-only evaluation, infer their robustness to the reality gap.},
