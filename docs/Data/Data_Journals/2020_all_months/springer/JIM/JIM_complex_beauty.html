  abstract     = {With a high-speed, dynamic and continuous yarn manufacturing process, spinning production suffers from different problems of dynamic disturbances such as yarn breakage, machine breakdown, and yarn quality. Processing real-time tasks is critical for tackling these problems, except for satisfying the requirements of mass production. The existing spinning cyber-physical production systems (CPPS), however, rely on a cloud center for centralized processing of real-time tasks. Thus, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to meet real-time requirements. As such, this paper proposes a novel real-time task processing method for spinning CPPS based on edge computing. First, a new hybrid structure of edge computing nodes (ECN) that consists of both 1-1 and N-1 modes is introduced for different types of tasks in spinning CPPS such as fixed tasks, decision-intensive tasks, and data-intensive tasks. Second, a collaboration mechanism is developed for collaborations between ECNs. The mathematical model and algorithms for real-time task processing are provided for a single ECN. Finally, a case study on a real spinning production is conducted. The results of this case study have demonstrated that the proposed method can significantly reduce the processing time of real-time tasks, as well as improve the production flexibility and production efficiency in spinning CPPS. The proposed method could be applied to continuous and batch manufacturing fields with high real-time requirements, such as weaving, chemical fiber production, and the pharmaceutical industry.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate models have been widely studied for optimization tasks in the domain of engineering design. However, the expensive and time-consuming simulation cycles needed for complex products always result in limited simulation data, which brings a challenge for building high accuracy surrogate models because of the incomplete information contained in the limited simulation data. Therefore, a method that builds a surrogate model and conducts design optimization by integrating limited simulation data and engineering knowledge through Bayesian optimization (BO-DK4DO) is presented. In this method, the shape engineering knowledge is considered and used as derivative information which is integrated with the limited simulation data with a Gaussian process (GP). Then the GP is updated sequentially by sampling new simulation data and the optimal design solutions are found by maximizing the GP. The aim of BO-DK4DO is to significantly reduce the required number of computer simulations for finding optimal design solutions. The BO-DK4DO is verified by using benchmark functions and an engineering design problem: hot rod rolling. In all scenarios, the BO-DK4DO shows faster convergence rate than the general Bayesian optimization without integrating engineering knowledge, which means the required amount of data is decreased.},

  abstract     = {Owing to the complexity of socio-economic environments and the fuzziness of human cognition, information of cognitive preference provided by decision-making organizations composed of many experts is often hesitant and fuzzy. In consequence, for the sake of addressing the hesitance and fuzziness of preference information for the configuration of tasks and resources in cloud manufacturing, a decision-making model of a two-sided matching considering a bidirectional projection under preference information of hesitant fuzzy is put forward. Primarily, this paper describes the problem of two-sided matching and introduces the hesitant fuzzy set. Afterwards, according to preference information given by matching agents using the hesitant fuzzy element, the evaluation matrix is constructed. Meanwhile, the bidirectional projection technology and TOPSIS method are combined to calculate the closeness degree matrix. Further, by introducing the constraint of the stable matching, a decision-making model of a two-sided matching for maximizing the closeness degree of two-sided matching agents is constructed, and the optimal configuration results are obtained by the solving of the model. Subsequently, the illustrative case is provided to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the presented model in solving the configuration for cloud manufacturing tasks and resources. Also, the stability in the proposed configuration results is illustrated by making a sensitivity analysis. Further, the reliability in the given solving process is demonstrated through performing a comparative analysis, as well as the advantages in the proposed model is also discussed. It shows that this developed model can give stable configuration results and also provide a matching approach for different agents under an uncertain environment.},

In this study, we investigate various methodologies to assist with parts classification based on deep learning technologies, including a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) trained using both picture data and CSV files; and a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) trained using voxel data. Additionally, two novel methods are proposed: (1) feature recognition for the processing parts based on syntactic patterns, where their feature quantities are computed and saved to comma-separated variable (CSV) files that are subsequently employed to train the 2D-CNN model; and (2) voxelization of parts, wherein the voxel data of the parts is obtained for training the 3D-CNN model. The two methods are compared with a 2D-CNN model trained with the images of parts to classify. Results indicated that the 2D-CNN model trained with CSV data yielded the best performance and highest accuracy, followed by the 3D-CNN model, which was simpler and easier to implement and utilized better learning ability for the parts’ details. The 2D-CNN model trained with picture files evinced the lowest accuracy and a complex training network.},

With its rapid development, the importance of quality monitoring in AM process has been recognized, which significantly affects the property of the manufactured parts. Since the conventional hand-crafted features for quality identification are generally costly, time-consuming and sensitive to noises, the intelligent data-driven automatic process monitoring methods are becoming more and more popular at present. This paper proposes a deep learning-based quality identification method for metal AM process. To alleviate the requirement for large amounts of high-quality labeled training data by most existing data-driven methods, an identification consistency-based approach is proposed to better explore the semi-supervised training data. The proposed method is able to achieve promising performance using limited supervised samples with low quality, such as noisy and blurred images. Experiments on a real-world metal AM dataset are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which offers a promising tool for real industrial applications.},

Our focus is on the pricing strategies for service providers in bidding for jobs in such a system. A scenario is developed based on cloud additive manufacturing services. A game theoretic approach for pricing simulation is proposed in the research, and a fuzzy algorithm is employed in the pricing decision. Two pricing policies are considered: one is that the information of players is unknown to each other, and the other is that the information of players who are within a limit of Euclidean space is known to each other. The effects of system load and the weight coefficients in KNN recommendation algorithm are also studied. The results show that the pricing policy has significant effect on revenue generation for providers, and the increase of system load helps to grow revenue for providers only when the machine utilization is low and job waiting time is short. In addition, the system seems to be less sensitive to the change of KNN weights in terms of individual provider and system revenues.},

A Naïve Bayes based motion states classifier (i.e., the NB-MSC) is proposed to automatically classify the motion states with knowledge of dynamic characteristics of the feed drive system for constructing the submodels of different motion states (startup state, reverse state, etc.). In addition, a model based multi-objective optimization method is presented to extract samples for the training of the NB-MSC. Then by modifying the basic long-short term memory (LSTM) network, the NAR-LSTM network is proposed to construct those submodels. Compared to the existing modeling methods via dynamic analysis, the proposed method is better because it can achieve higher prediction accuracy on highly nonlinear motion states such as the reverse state.

  abstract     = {As additive manufacturing (AM) continues to mature, an efficient and effective method to identify parts which are eligible for AM as well as gaining insight on what values it may add to a product is needed. Prior methods are naturally developed and highly experience-dependent, which falls short for its objectiveness and transferability. In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) framework for automatically determining the candidacy of a part or assembly for AM applications is proposed based on machine learning (ML) and carefully selected candidacy criteria. With the goal of supporting efficient candidate screening in the early conceptual design stage, these criteria are further individually decoded to decisive parameters which can be extracted from digital models or resource planning databases. Over 200 existing industrial examples are manually collected and labelled as training data; meanwhile, multiple regression algorithms are tested against each AM potential to find better predictive performance. The proposed DSS framework is implemented as a web application with integrated cloud-based database and ML service, which allows advantages of easy maintenance, upgrade, and retraining of ML models. Two case studies of a hip implant and a throttle pedal are used as demonstrating examples. This preliminary work provides a promising solution for lowering the requirements of non-AM experts to find suitable AM candidates.},

In comparison with the existing unsupervised methods, the proposed method does not need to perform statistical features extraction, and directly uses the normalized frequency domain signals as the inputs. Moreover, in the proposed diagnostic model, the input data is passed through layer by layer without fine-tuning, which is completely unsupervised process.

In the production planning process that involves computer component manufacturing, an estimation of the tasks’ cycle time offers an important basis for dispatching control, material purchase, and due date assignment. In this study, a big-data approach was proposed and examined to determine how it could be used to predict cycle time distribution. Also, the research context involved computer components manufacturing systems. Indeed, the motivation was to determine how the proposed mechanism could improve delivery reliability in manufacturing systems.Regarding the implementation and design of the CT forecasting system, with the proposed DP-RBFN framework being a model to be implemented in computer components manufacturing, components of the system constituted three major parts. The first part, being the basic platform, played the role of Hadoop series software installation. This installation had its role lie in enabling the parallel computing of big data. Another part of the framework design and implementation involved data preprocessing. In this case, the role of the data preprocessing procedure lay in the extraction, transformation, and loading of data to CTF. The third part that followed the basic platform design and data preprocessing procedure involved CT forecasting. Results demonstrated that the proposed model performs superiorly than the contrast or other comparative methods on both the computer components manufacturing system dataset and benchmark datasets. From the findings, the proposed framework (DP-RBFN) exhibited superior performance compared to previous performance outcomes that had been reported relative to the use of the RBFN algorithm. These findings held for both MAD and SD—relative to the selected datasets.},

Despite being small-sized, the sensors have paved the way for data collection in the environments where they are applied; including luminosity, gas presence, water content, humidity, pressure, and temperature. This research aims to pragmatically optimize Wireless Sensor Network Localization and Network Coverage issues using nature-inspired algorithms. The specific objective is to establish an optimal nature-inspired algorithm and comparing it with other algorithms regarding the capacity to achieve manufacturing optimization in large WSNs, especially in relation to the parameters of high scalability, data delivery rate, and low-energy consumption. Also, the study seeks to determine the extent to which swarm intelligence (SI)-based centralized clustering solutions (optimal nature-inspired algorithms), compared to other approaches, might optimize the WSN features of localization and network coverage. To determine the solutions’ performance, the study involved three scenarios. In scenario 1, the network operational time and the stability of SI-based algorithms were investigated for large WSNs that had the minimum heterogeneity. Imperative to note is that the WSNs on focus had different numbers of nodes, which included 500, 300, and 100. In scenario 2, the motivation was to investigate the SI-based WSN protocols in relation to the parameters of packet delivery, energy conception, and network lifetime for large WSNs. In scenario 3, the performance of SI-based solutions over large WSNs was compared to that which had been reported previously for other algorithms; with the target parameters of comparison being attributes such as packet delivery, energy conception, and network lifetime. From the findings, this study established that SI-based centralized clustering solutions are not only more recent but also exhibit superior performance compared to other algorithms; with the parameters of the amount of data delivered to the BS, energy consumption and scalability on the focus.},

In this research, we present an image-based wafer map defect pattern classification method. The presented method consists of two main steps: without any specific preprocessing, high-level features are extracted from convolutional neural network and then the extracted features are fed to combination of error-correcting output codes and support vector machines for wafer map defect pattern classification. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has applied the presented method for wafer map defect pattern classification. Experimental results tested on 20,000 wafer maps show the superiority of presented method and the overall classification accuracy is up to 98.43%.},

Because of the wide range of applications and the capacity of manufacturing workpieces flexibly, machine tools are regarded as essential industrial elements. Hence, much research has been concerned with applying various enabling technologies such as cyber-physical systems to machine tools. To realize a machine tool suitable for Industry 4.0, development should be done in a systematic manner rather than the ad-hoc application of enabling technologies. In this paper, we propose a functional architecture for the Industry 4.0 version of machine tools, namely smart machine tool system. To reflect the voices of various stakeholders, stakeholder requirements are identified and transformed into design considerations. The design considerations are incorporated into the conceptual model and functional modeling, both of which are used to derive the functional architecture. The implementation procedure and an illustrative case study are presented for the application of the functional architecture.},

  abstract     = {Roughness prediction of ground surfaces is critical in understanding and optimizing the grinding process. However, it is hitherto difficult to predict accurately the ground surface roughness by theoretical and empirical models due to the complexity of grinding process. BP neural network (BPNN), which can be used to establish the relationship between processing parameters and surface roughness, avoids the difficulty of revealing the complex physical mechanism and thus has unique potential in automatic optimization of grinding process in industrial practice. Activation function is one of the most important factors affecting the efficiency and accuracy of BPNN. Nevertheless, it is often selected arbitrarily or at most by trials or tuning. This paper proposes an activation function selection approach in which virtual data generated from the approximate physical model are employed to evaluate the performance of the BPNN in practice application. The results show that with tansig as the activation function of hidden layer and purelin as the activation function of output layer, the BPNN model can obtain the highest learning efficiency. Moreover, when the activation function of hidden layer is sigmoid, whose shape factor is 1–3, and the output layer activation function is purelin, the model can predict more precisely. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by comparing the performance of BPNN obtained from the virtual data and the experimental data. Obtained results showed that the proposed approach is a simple and effective way to determine the activation function of BPNN.},

  abstract     = {Quality analysis of the polarizer of a production line can be performed using image processing technology. The existing method of detecting defective images based on deep learning can ensure accurate classification; however, its detection speed is low, the model requires a large amount of memory, and it is difficult to meet the real-time requirements of online detection systems when hardware resources are limited. Therefore, in this study a lightweight polarizer defect detection network, called DDN, was developed based on deep learning. First, a parallel module was designed to build the network. This module has two main advantages. First, it mixes different convolution template sizes, and can fuse the features of different scales and extract more defect features than the traditional convolution layer. Second, depthwise separable convolution is used to replace full convolution in this module, which significantly reduces the number of parameters and the multiply-accumulate operations. Finally, a global average pooling (GAP) layer is used instead of a fully connected layer. The GAP layer has no parameters to optimize, which substantially reduces the number of network parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method is better than existing methods in terms of classification speed, precision, and memory consumption for polarizer detection, and can satisfy real-time requirements.},

  abstract     = {A mining complex is an integrated value chain where the materials extracted from a group of mineral deposits are sent to different processing streams to produce sellable products. A major short-term decision in a mining complex is to determine the flow of materials that first includes deciding which handling facilities to send the extracted materials and then determining how to utilize the processing facilities. The flow of materials through the mining complex is significantly dependent on the performance of and interaction between its different components. New digital technologies, including the development of advanced sensors and monitoring devices, have enabled a mining complex to acquire new information about the performance of its different components. This paper proposes a new continuous updating framework that combines policy gradient reinforcement learning and an extended ensemble Kalman filter to adapt the short-term flow of materials in a mining complex with incoming information. The framework first uses a new extended ensemble Kalman filter to update the uncertainty models of the different components of a mining complex with new incoming information. Then, the updated uncertainty models are fed to a neural network trained using a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to adapt the short-term flow of materials in a mining complex. The proposed framework is applied to a copper mining complex and shows its ability to efficiently adapt the short-term flow of materials in an operational mining environment with new incoming information. The framework better meets the different production targets while improving the cumulative cash flow compared to industry standard approaches.},

However, the current approach to printability analysis, determining which components are likely to build unsuccessfully, prior to manufacture, is based on ad-hoc rules and engineering experience. Consequently, to allow full exploitation of the benefits of additive manufacturing, there is a demand for a fully systematic approach to the problem. In this paper we focus on the impact of geometry in printability analysis. For the first time, we detail a machine learning framework for determining the geometric limits of printability in additive manufacturing processes. This framework consists of three main components. First, we detail how to construct strenuous test artefacts capable of pushing an additive manufacturing process to its limits. Secondly, we explain how to measure the printability of an additively manufactured test artefact. Finally, we construct a predictive model capable of estimating the printability of a given artefact before it is additively manufactured. We test all steps of our framework, and show that our predictive model approaches an estimate of the maximum performance obtainable due to inherent stochasticity in the underlying additive manufacturing process.},

It not only manages the vagueness in the semantic expression level using the intuitionistic fuzzy sets, but also adopts the electroencephalogram data as endogenous neural indicators to handle the vagueness in the neurocognitive level. An experimental research integrated with the Kano model is developed to record the EEG data which inherently interpret customers’ psychological states. Benefit from the data mining method, the effect of customer requirements on psychological response can be investigated using the EEG data. Taking the data of initial requirement importance, performance realization levels and customers’ psychological states into consideration, three novel adjusting models are established to acquire the comprehensive importance of each requirement.

An alternative method is to leverage data-driven models to map the degradation. This paper proposes a data-driven method for backlash error predication through Deep Belief Network (DBN). The proposed method focuses on the assessment of both current and future geometric errors for backlash error prediction and subsequent maintenance in machining centers. During the process of prognosis, a DBN via stacking Restricted Boltzmann Machines is constructed for backlash error prediction. Energy-based models enable DBN to mine information hidden behind highly coupled inputs, which makes DBN a feasible method for fault diagnosis and prognosis when the target condition is beyond the historical data. In the experiment, to confirm the effectiveness of deep learning for backlash error prediction, similar popular regression methods, including Support Vector Machine Regression and Back Propagation Neural Network, are employed to present a comprehensive comparison in both diagnosis and prognosis. The experimental results show that the performances of all these regression methods are acceptable in the diagnostic stage. In the prognostic stage, DBN demonstrates its superiority and significantly outperforms the other models for backlash error prediction in machining centers.},

  abstract     = {Scheduling optimization of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) service resources of complex product can help an enterprise improve customer service satisfaction, build value-added products, and enhance the enterprise’s market competitiveness. This paper studies a scheduling optimization method for the MRO service resources of complex product. First, the scheduling problem in service resources is analyzed, a mathematical model for the service scheduling problem is given, and three objective functions to be optimized are proposed, which are to reduce customer waiting time, reduce excessive human resources, and maximize the cost performance index of the resources. Then, three separate objectives for optimizing service resource scheduling are analyzed based on three proposed methods which are improved genetic algorithm method, combined weight coefficient optimization method, and multi-objective optimization method based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Finally, we use the three methods to carry out scheduling optimization of MRO service resources in the case of a large vertical mill. According to the analysis and comparison of results, the multi-objective optimization method based on the NSGA-II algorithm has an advantage in the scheduling optimization of complex product MRO service resources. In the engineering application, the service scheduling of complex products for managers provides theoretical basis, and can reduce the loss caused by subjective judgment.},

However, how to determine the highly related parameters with the engine power from massive captured manufacturing data and effectively discriminated the direct and indirect dependencies between these variables are still challenging. This paper proposed a feature selection algorithm named NMI-ND which uses network deconvolution (ND) to infer causal correlations among various diesel engine manufacturing parameters from the observed correlations based on normalized mutual information (NMI). The proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated through the experimental study by comparing it with other representative feature selection algorithms. The comparison demonstrates that NMI-ND performs better in both effectiveness and efficiency.},

We first systematically consider geographical information, sample set diversity computation and platform context to extend basic Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) similarity and extract neighbourhood information. Then, we integrate neighbourhood information into matrix factorization (MF) and make prediction of missing values. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has the following new features: (1) entropy information is adopted to derive personal weights for different users or services when computing PCC similarity; (2) location information and sample set similarity are considered to enhance PCC similarity; (3) topology information is introduced to address data sparsity issue; (4) neighbourhood information is incorporated with MF to improve prediction accuracy.

It combines the strengths of both the human worker and the assistant robot and allows the implementation of an varying degree of automation in workplaces in order to meet the increasing demand of flexibility of manufacturing systems. Intelligent planning and control algorithms are needed for the organization of the work in hybrid teams of humans and robots. This paper introduces an approach to use standardized work description for automated procedure generation of mobile assistant robots. A simulation tool is developed that implements the procedure model and is therefore capable of calculating different objective parameters like production time or ergonomics during a production cycle as a function of the human–robot task allocation. The simulation is validated with an existing workplace in an assembly line at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany. Furthermore, a new method is presented to optimize the task allocation in human–robot teams for a given workplace, using the simulation as fitness function in a genetic algorithm. The advantage of this new approach is the possibility to evaluate different distributions of the tasks, while considering the dynamics of the interaction between the worker and the robot in their shared workplace. Using the presented approach for a given workplace, an optimized human–robot task allocation is found, in which the tasks are allocated in an intelligent and comprehensible way.},

  abstract     = {In general, fault prognosis research usually leads to the research of remaining useful life prediction and performance prediction (prediction of target feature), which can be regarded as a sequence learning problem. Considering the significant success achieved by the recurrent neural network in sequence learning problems such as precise timing, speech recognition, and so on, this paper proposes a novel approach for fault prognosis with the degradation sequence of equipment based on the recurrent neural network. Long short-term memory (LSTM) network is utilized due to its capability of learning long-term dependencies, which takes the concatenated feature and operation state indicator of the equipment as the input. Note that the indicator is a one-hot vector, and based on it, the remaining useful life can be estimated without any pre-defined threshold. The outputs of the LSTM networks are connected to a fully-connected layer to map the hidden state into the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model and a categorical distribution so that the predicted output sequence can be sampled from them. The performance of the proposed method is verified by the health monitoring data of aircraft turbofan engines. The result shows that the proposed approach is able to achieve significant performance whether in one-step prediction task, in long-term prediction task, or in remaining useful life prediction task.},

In our algorithm, we first extract feature indices of each batch and concatenate them into one feature vector. Then the principal components are extracted by Kernel PCA. Finally, the fault is detected by the reconstruction error in the feature space. Samples with high reconstruction error are identified as faulty. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we evaluate our algorithm on a benchmark dataset for fault detection, and the results show that our algorithm outperforms other fault detection methods.},

Different stakeholders in MBE put forward different quality requirements for MBD models, while any quality defect may hinder the production. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the quality of MBD models adequately before the usage. However, existing quality tools are difficult to apply in MBE. A knowledge-based quality analysis system for MBD part models is presented in this paper. The system utilizes model quality knowledge to analyze model quality from the perspective of various stakeholders in MBE. And it can be extended by adding new MBD part model quality knowledge. In order to judge model quality, a concept of the model definition unit is introduced for converting model information into the description towards model semantics quality, and a quality analysis method based on this description is proposed. For the ease of model quality knowledge representation and maintenance, a knowledge representation framework based on the object chain and parameter table is developed. Finally, a prototype system is implemented to verify the effectiveness and practicality. With 46 knowledge items derived from eight model-used stages, in total 24 potential quality defects are found in two case models. And additional two defects are discovered by extending the system with new model quality knowledge. In this way, the model quality is improved from the perspective of corresponding users.},

With the advent of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0), copious availability of data, high-computing power and large storage capacity have made of Machine Learning (ML) approaches an appealing solution to tackle manufacturing challenges. As such, this paper presents a state-of-the-art of ML-aided PPC (ML-PPC) done through a systematic literature review analyzing 93 recent research application articles. This study has two main objectives: contribute to the definition of a methodology to implement ML-PPC and propose a mapping to classify the scientific literature to identify further research perspectives. To achieve the first objective, ML techniques, tools, activities, and data sources which are required to implement a ML-PPC are reviewed. The second objective is developed through the analysis of the use cases and the addressed characteristics of the I4.0. Results suggest that 75% of the possible research domains in ML-PPC are barely explored or not addressed at all. This lack of research originates from two possible causes: firstly, scientific literature rarely considers customer, environmental, and human-in-the-loop aspects when linking ML to PPC. Secondly, recent applications seldom couple PPC to logistics as well as to design of products and processes. Finally, two key pitfalls are identified in the implementation of ML-PPC models: the complexity of using Internet of Things technologies to collect data and the difficulty of updating the ML model to adapt it to the manufacturing system changes.},

It consists of three modules: quality embedding model pool, temporal-interactive model, and decoding model. Besides, to handle the information transfer and integration problems in the time direction of parallel processes, a novel bidirectional serial–parallel LSTM (Bi-SP-LSTM) is devised as an instantiated model of temporal-interactive model. Bi-SP-LSTM is an extension of bidirectional long short-term memory. Moreover, an unsupervised task and a loss function named adversarial focal loss have been designed to give the framework the ability to assess heteroscedastic uncertainty in classification task due to intrinsic uncertainty in data. Furthermore, experiments are devised based on a subset of a public dataset from Kaggle competition to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework. Compared with other latest methods, the proposed framework is verified to be more accurate and robust. Taking Matthews correlation coefficient as an example, the adversarial Bi-SP-LSTM-based QTD framework is superior to the best existing methods with 95% confidence interval in most cases, and its mean MCC is 4.88% higher than the best existing method. The results suggest that the proposed framework has a broad application prospect for quality prediction in manufacturing and assembly processes.},

First, a stacked LSTM is used to extract the abstract and deep features contained within the multi-sensor time series. Subsequently, the temporal features extracted are combined with process information to form a new input vector. Finally, a nonlinear regression model is designed to predict tool wear based on the new input vector. The proposed method is validated on both NASA Ames milling data set and the 2010 PHM Data Challenge data set. Results show the outstanding performance of the hybrid information model in tool wear prediction, especially when the experiments are run under various operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {In a factory of automobile component primer painting, various automobile parts are attached to overhead hangers in a conveyor line and undergo a series of coating processes. Thereafter, the components are wrapped at a packaging station. The packaging process should be fully balanced by an appropriate sequence of components to prevent the bottleneck effect because each component requires different packaging times and materials. An overhead hanger has a capacity limit and can hold varying numbers of components depending on the component type. Capacity loss can occur if the hanger capacity is not fully utilized. To increase hanger utilization, companies sometimes mix two or more component types on the same hangers, and these hangers are called mixed hangers. However, mixed hangers generally cause heavy workload because different items require additional setup times during hanging and packing processes. Hence, having many mixed hangers is not recommended. A good production schedule requires a small number of mixed hangers and maximizes hanger utilization and packaging workload balance. We show that the scheduling problem is NP-hard and develop a mathematical programming model and efficient solution approaches for the problem. When applying the methods to solve real problems, we also use an initial solution-generating method that minimizes the mixing cost, set a rule for hanging the items on hangers considering eligibility constraint, and decrease the size of tabu list in proportion to the remaining computational time for assuring intensification in the final iterations of the search. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fault diagnosis plays an essential role in rotating machinery manufacturing systems to reduce their maintenance costs. How to improve diagnosis accuracy remains an open issue. To this end, we develop a novel framework through combined use of multi-domain vibration feature extraction, feature selection and cost-sensitive learning method. First, we extract time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency-domain features to make full use of vibration signals. Second, a feature selection technique is employed to obtain a feature subset with good generalization properties, by simultaneously measuring the relevance and redundancy of features. Third, a cost-sensitive learning method is designed for a classifier to effectively learn the discriminating boundaries, with an extremely imbalanced distribution of fault instances. For illustration, a real-world dataset of rotating machinery collected from an oil refinery in China is utilized. The extensive experiments have demonstrated that our multi-domain feature extraction and feature selection can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy. Meanwhile, our cost-sensitive learning method consistently outperforms the traditional classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), etc., and even better than the classification method calibrated by six popular imbalanced data resampling algorithms, such as the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Adaptive Synthetic sampling method (ADASYN), in terms of decreasing missed alarms and reducing the average cost. Owing to its high evaluation scores and low average misclassification cost, cost-sensitive GBDT (CS-GBDT) is preferred for imbalanced fault diagnosis in practice.},

  abstract     = {The classical distributed production scheduling problem (DPSP) assumes that factories are identical, and each factory is composed of just some machines. Inspired by the fact that manufacturers these days typically work across different factories, and each of these factories normally has some workshops, we study an important extension of the DPSP with different factories and workshops (DPFW), where jobs can be processed and transferred between the factories, workshops and machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first time distributed production scheduling with different factories and workshops is studied. We propose a novel memetic algorithm (MA) to solve this DPFW, aiming to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption. The proposed MA is incorporated with a well-designed chromosome encoding method and a balance-transfer initialization method to generate a good initial population. An effective local search operator is also presented to improve the MA’s convergence speed and fully exploit its solution space. A total of 50 DPFW benchmark instances are used to evaluate the performance of our MA. Computational experiments carried out confirm that the MA is able to easily obtain better solutions for the majority of the tested problem instances compared to three other well-known algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance over these algorithms in terms of solution quality. Our proposed method and the results presented here may be helpful for production managers who work with distributed manufacturing systems in scheduling their production activities by considering different factories and workshops. With this DPFW, imbalanced resource loads and unexpected bottlenecks, which regularly arise in traditional DPSP models, can be easily avoided.},

In this paper, a new concept of assembly consistency degree was introduced for defining the fluctuation degree of assembly quality. Based on assembly consistency degree, a hybrid machine learning method, genetic algorithm optimized multi-class support vector machine and improved Kuhn–Munkres (GA-MSVM-I-KM) was proposed for improving assembly consistency of LA-MT. The assembly of linear axis of a three-axis vertical machining center was regarded as an example, and the assembly consistency influence factors on straightness error of Y-axis (SE-YA) were analyzed through the Kruskal–Wallis statistical method. The main factors affected on the assembly consistency of SE-YA turned out to be the machining errors of bed and the assembly team technical levels. Based on this, the assembly consistency improvement model was established. Then, the prediction model of SE-YA based on assembly experiment data and genetic algorithm optimized multi-class support vector machine (GA-MSVM) was constructed, and I-KM method was applied for improving assembly consistency of SE-YA. The results show that the GA-MSVM-I-KM method can effectively enhance the assembly consistency of SE-YA, and the assembly consistency degree is reduced from 0.19 to 0.08.},

  abstract     = {The biggest difference between a disassembly line and an assembly line is that there are many uncertainties in structure and quality of the disassembled products in a disassembly line. The disassembly line balancing problem, considering the effect of end-of-life states caused by the uncertainty of the structure or the quality of the disassembled products, is addressed in this paper. A multi-objective mathematical model for the addressed problem is built with three optimization goals: minimizing the number of workstations, minimizing the idle index and minimizing the number of resources. Then a multi-objective hybrid migrating birds optimization algorithm is proposed, which uses a greedy random search operation based on embedding mechanism to generate neighborhood individuals. To avoid the problem of easily being trapped into a local optimum by a basic migrating birds optimization algorithm, a reset mechanism based on simulated annealing operation is set up to accept other solutions with a certain probability, so that the algorithm can escape out of a local optimum. By solving disassembly examples of different scales in the literature and comparing with the existing algorithms, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed multi-objective hybrid migrating birds optimization algorithm is validated. Finally, the proposed model and algorithm are applied to solving two disassembly instances, and the solving results are compared with the single-objective optimal solution solved by LINGO 11.0 solver and the basic migrating birds optimization algorithm to further identify the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

An important step towards the success of Industry 4.0 is the establishment of practical reference architectures. This paper presents an architecture for such a digital twin, which enables the exchange of data and information between a remote emulation or simulation and the physical twin. The architecture comprises different layers, including a local data layer, an IoT Gateway layer, cloud-based databases and a layer containing emulations and simulations. The architecture can be implemented in new and legacy production facilities, with a minimal disruption of current installations.

Then after, simulation and applicability implementation experiments on the basis of full-sized academic experimental platform have been conducted to validate the proposed control approach. Product and resource entities negotiate considering different key performance measures in order to set best priority-based product sequencing. This has been done with expectations that the applicability of the negotiation-based decision-making will be more adaptable to deal with perturbation(s) than another alternative decision-making approach called pure reactive control approach. The result showed that negotiation among the decisional entities has brought significant improvement in reducing makespan and hence conveyed better global performance of a manufacturing system.},

Finally, the comprehensive cloud expression of each failure mode is synthesized and compared. The proposed evaluation method not only has the advantages of cloud model in dealing with fuzziness and randomness, but also integrates the advantages of BWM, and fully takes into account the differences of experts in assigning weights to different failure modes’ attributes.

  abstract     = {In computer-aided design (CAD) and process planning (CAPP), feature recognition is an essential task which identifies the feature type of a 3D model for computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). In general, traditional rule-based feature recognition methods are computationally expensive, and dependent on surface or feature types. In addition, it is quite challenging to design proper rules to recognise intersecting features. Recently, a learning-based method, named FeatureNet, has been proposed for both single and multi-feature recognition. This is a general purpose algorithm which is capable of dealing with any type of features and surfaces. However, thousands of annotated training samples for each feature are required for training to achieve a high single feature recognition accuracy, which makes this technique difficult to use in practice. In addition, experimental results suggest that multi-feature recognition part in this approach works very well on intersecting features with small overlapping areas, but may fail when recognising highly intersecting features. To address the above issues, a deep learning framework based on multiple sectional view (MSV) representation named MsvNet is proposed for feature recognition. In the MsvNet, MSVs of a 3D model are collected as the input of the deep network, and the information achieved from different views are combined via the neural network for recognition. In addition to MSV representation, some advanced learning strategies (e.g. transfer learning, data augmentation) are also employed to minimise the number of training samples and training time. For multi-feature recognition, a novel view-based feature segmentation and recognition algorithm is presented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve the state-of-the-art single feature performance on the FeatureNet dataset with only a very small number of training samples (e.g. 8–32 samples for each feature), and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based multi-feature recognition method in terms of recognition performances.},

  abstract     = {Bearing defects have been accepted as one of the major causes of failure in rotating machinery. It is important to identify and diagnose the failure behavior of bearings for the reliable operation of equipment. In this paper, a low-cost non-contact vibration sensor has been developed for detecting the faults in bearings. The supervised learning method, support vector machine (SVM), has been employed as a tool to validate the effectiveness of the developed sensor. Experimental vibration data collected for different bearing defects under various loading and running conditions have been analyzed to develop a system for diagnosing the faults for machine health monitoring. Fault diagnosis has been accomplished using discrete wavelet transform for denoising the signal. Mahalanobis distance criteria has been employed for selecting the strongest feature on the extracted relevant features. Finally, these selected features have been passed to the SVM classifier for identifying and classifying the various bearing defects. The results reveal that the vibration signatures obtained from developed non-contact sensor compare well with the accelerometer data obtained under the same conditions. A developed sensor is a promising tool for detecting the bearing damage and identifying its class. SVM results have established the effectiveness of the developed non-contact sensor as a vibration measuring instrument which makes the developed sensor a cost-effective tool for the condition monitoring of rotating machines.},

One of the main contributions of the proposal is the ability to reject the effects that the imbalances in the rest of the chain have on the inventories of raw materials and finished products. For this, an intelligent algorithm will be in charge of the supervision of the plant operation and task-reprogramming to ensure the achievement of the process goals.

  abstract     = {Induced by flexibility of the industrial robot, cutting tool or the workpiece, chatter in robotic machining process has detrimental effects on the surface quality, tool life and machining productivity. Consequently, accurate detection and timely suppression for such undesirable vibration is desperately needed to achieve high performance robotic machining. This paper presents a novel approach combining the notch filter and local maximum synchrosqueezing transform for the timely chatter identification in robotic drilling. The proposed approach is accomplished through the following steps. In the first step, the optimal matrix notch filter is designed to eliminate the interference of the spindle frequency and corresponding harmonic components to the measured acceleration signal. Subsequently, the high-resolution time–frequency information of the non-stationary filtered acceleration signal is acquired by employing local maximum synchrosqueezing transform (LMSST). On this basis, the filtered acceleration signal is divided into a finite number of equal-width frequency bands, and the corresponding sub-signal for each frequency band is obtained by summing the corresponding coefficient of the LMSST. Finally, to accurately depict the non-uniformity of energy distribution during the chatter incubation process, the statistical energy entropy is calculated and utilized as the indicator to detect chatter online. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a large number of robot drilling experiments with different cutting tools, workpiece materials and machining parameters. The results show that the presented local maximum synchrosqueezing-based approach can effectively recognize the chatter at an early stage during its incubation and development process.},

Machine tools in industry 4.0 shall have the ability to identify materials which they handle so that they can make and implement certain decisions on their own as needed. This paper aims to present a generalized methodology for automated material identification using machine vision and machine learning technologies to contribute to the cognitive abilities of machine tools as wells as material handling devices such as robots deployed in industry 4.0. A dataset of the surfaces of four materials (Aluminium, Copper, Medium density fibre board, and Mild steel) that need to be identified and classified is prepared and processed to extract red, green and blue color components of RGB color model. These color components are used as features while training the machine learning algorithm. Support vector machine is used as a classifier and other classification algorithms such as Decision trees, Random forests, Logistic regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor are also applied to the prepared data set. The capability of the proposed methodology to identify the different group of materials is verified with the images available in an open source database. The methodology presented has been validated by conducting four experiments for checking the classification accuracies of the classifier. Its robustness has also been checked for various camera orientations, illumination levels, and focal length of the lens. The results presented show that the proposed scheme can be implemented in an existing manufacturing setup without major modifications.},

  abstract     = {In the field of medical image processing represented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), synthesizing the complementary target contrast of the target patient from the existing contrast has obvious medical significance for assisting doctors in making clinical diagnoses. To satisfy the image translation problem between different MRI contrasts (T1 and T2), a generative adversarial network is proposed that works in an end-to-end manner at image level. The low-frequency and high-frequency information of the image is preserved by using multi-stage optimization learning aided by adversarial loss, the loss of perceptual consistency and the loss of cyclic consistency, as it results in preserving the same contrast anatomical structure of the source domain supervisely when the perceptual pixel distribution of the target contrast is learned perfectly. To integrate different penalties (L1 and L2) organically, adaptive weights are set for the error sensitivity of the penalty function in the present total loss function, the aim being to achieve adaptive optimization of each stage of generating high-resolution images. In addition, a new net structure called multi-skip connection residual net is proposed to refine medical image details step by step with multi-stage optimization. Compared with the existing technology, the present method is more advanced. The contrast conversion of T1 and T2 in MRI is validated, which can help to shorten the imaging time, improve the imaging quality, and effectively assist doctors with diagnoses.},

The metal transfer and pulse current in GMAW-P complicate the identification of weld penetration. In previous studies, the authors found that both the change in arc voltage during the peak current period and the average arc voltage during the peak current period can be used for condition monitoring of weld pool surface and thus for the estimation of GMAW-P penetration depth. In the present work, the relative fluctuation coefficient (CRF) of weld pool surface is proposed by combining these two signals to predict the weld penetration depth. Model predictive control using this coefficient as feedback is employed to control the penetration depth. The experimental results show that uniform weld penetration depth can be obtained by the adaptive control algorithm. The practice attempted in this work can be expected to be a candidate solution for GMAW-P penetration control, which is easy to implement in field applications.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rising technology bringing new opportunities for design and cost of manufacturing, compared to standard processes like casting and machining. Among the AM techniques, direct energy deposition (DED) processes are dedicated to manufacture functional metallic parts. Despite of their promising perspectives, the industrial implementation of DED processes is inhibited by the lack of structural health control. Consequently, non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques can be investigated to inspect DED-manufactured parts, in an online or offline manner. To date, most ultrasonic NDT applications to metallic AM concerned the selective laser melting process; existing studies tackling DED processes mainly compare various ultrasonic techniques and do not propose a comprehensive control method for such processes. Current researches in the GeM laboratory focus on a multi-sensor monitoring method dedicated to DED processes, with a structural health control loop included, in order to track defect formation during manufacturing. In this way, this paper aims to be a proof of concept and proposes a comprehensive control method that opens the way to in situ ultrasonic control for DED. In this paper, a control method using the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) technique is particularly illustrated on wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) components, and its applicability to laser metal deposition (LMD) is also demonstrated. A specific attention is given to the calibration method, towards a quantitative prediction of the size of the detected flaws. PAUT predictions are cross-checked thanks to X-ray radiography, which demonstrates that the PAUT method enables to detect and dimension defects from 0.6 to 1 mm for WAAM aluminum alloy parts. Then, an applicable scenario of inspection of a WAAM industrial and large-scale part is presented. Finally, perspectives for in situ and real-time application of the chosen method are given. This paper shows that real-time monitoring of the WAAM process is possible, as the PAUT method can be integrated in the manufacturing environment, provides relevant in situ data, and runs with computing times compatible with real-time applications.},

  abstract     = {Tool wear is one of the consequences of a machining process. Excessive tool wear can lead to poor surface finish, and result in a defective product. It can also lead to premature tool failure, and may result in process downtime and damaged components. With this in mind, it has long been desired to monitor tool wear/tool condition. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is proposed as an effective and efficient method for monitoring the tool condition in a machining process. The KPCA-based method may be used to identify faults (abnormalities) in a process through the fusion of multi-sensor signals. The method employs a control chart monitoring approach that uses Hotelling’s T2-statistic and Q-statistic to identify the faults in conjunction with control limits, which are computed by kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE is a non-parametric technique to approximate a probability density function. Four performance metrics, abnormality detection rate, false detection rate, detection delay, and prediction accuracy, are employed to test the reliability of the monitoring system and are used to compare the KPCA-based method with PCA-based method. Application of the proposed monitoring system to experimental data shows that the KPCA based method can effectively monitor the tool wear.},

Therefore, we need to eliminate the background pattern of the panel, but this is not an easy task because the brightness and saturation of the background varies, even in a single image. In this paper, we propose an indicator that can distinguish between defect and background area, which is robust to brightness change and minor noises. With this indicator, we got useful defect information and images with patterns eliminated to make a more efficient defect classifier.

IIoT connects the actors, and the physical and cyber resources of industrial systems, manufacturing- or service-based, in a cloud-enabled overall data exchange system. This work outlines a formal model for operational scheduling of cyber-physical resources for different scenarios determined by resource and logistics availability and cost. Information exchange of physical work-in-process, resource failures, alternative resource options, order and logistics information, are used to deliver real-time scheduling to IIoT participants. The model is formalized using discrete state-machine diagrams for resource reliability and availability status, and logistics timing purposes. Low-performance solution invariants are generated and validated through functional requirements test case building. The data exchange network between the processing nodes of the IIoT environment is built on a software-defined network foundation. A simulation is then built for a series of work-in-process orders and their required processing operations, several manufacturing enterprises and associated physical logistics, and the cloud IIoT network cyber infrastructure for data and control information sharing. Both the formalized and the simulation models are run in the IIoT cloud and can be accessed by the participating enterprises. The formalized model provides insights on resource repair or replacement options, part transfer decisions, while the simulation model builds on those decisions and runs only validated scenarios anchored in timing- and cost-based constraints.},

To obtain the optimal overlapping distance, a group of two-bead overlapping experiments was conducted with different overlapping ratio. The cross-section shape was observed and the variation of the bead profile caused by the damming up of the previous bead was investigated. The second bead profile could be fitted by a rotated varying parabola or circular arc function with the decreasing of the overlapping distance from the initial single bead width (w) to 0. A varying cross-section profile overlapping model was developed based on the actual forming characteristics of the overlapping experiment, through which the varying profile of two overlapping beads with arbitrary distance could be predicted. Then, the optimal overlapping distance was calculated under some principles to achieve a relatively flat top surface and stable overlapping process, and the multi-bead overlapping experiments were performed to validate the model. The results showed that the model could achieve an excellent approximation to the actual overlapping experiment, and the good surface evenness and stable overlapping process was obtained, which was significant to the research into the appearance optimization in GMAW-based additive manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {X-ray inspection by control officers is not always consistent when inspecting baggage since this task are monotonous, tedious and tiring for human inspectors. Thus, a semi-automatic inspection makes sense as a solution in this case. In this perspective, the study presents a novel feature learning model for object classification in luggage dual X-ray images in order to detect explosives objects and firearms. We propose to use supervised feature learning by autoencoders approach. Object detection is performed by a modified YOLOv3 to detect all the presented objects without classification. The features learning is carried out by labeled adversarial autoencoders. The classification is performed by a support vector machine to classify a new object as explosive, firearms or non-threatening objects. To show the superiority of our proposed system, a comparative analysis was carried out to several methods of deep learning. The results indicate that the proposed system leads to efficient objects classification in complex environments, achieving an accuracy of 98.00% and 96.50% in detection of firearms and explosive objects respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this research, a hybrid constrained permutation algorithm and genetic algorithm approach is proposed to solve the process planning problem and to facilitate the optimisation process. In this approach, the process planning problem is represented as a graph in which operations are clustered corresponding to their machine, tool, and tool access direction similarities. A constrained permutation algorithm (CPA) developed to generate a set of optimised feasible operations sequences based on the principles of minimising the number of setup changes and the number of tool changes. Due to its strong capability in global search through multiple optima, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for an optimal or near optimal process plan, in which the population is initialised according to the operations sequences generated by CPA. Furthermore, to prevent premature convergence to local optima, a mixed crossover operator is designed and equipped into GA. Four comparative case studies are carried out to evidence the feasibility and robustness of the proposed CPAGA approach against GA, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony optimisation, and particle swarm optimisation based approaches reported in the literature, and the results are promising.},

  abstract     = {In intelligent manufacturing, it is important to schedule orders from customers efficiently. Make-to-order companies may have to reject or postpone orders when the production capacity does not meet the demand. Many such real-world scheduling problems are characterised by processing times being dependent on the start time (time dependency) or on the preceding orders (sequence dependency), and typically have an earliest and latest possible start time. We introduce and analyze four algorithmic ideas for this class of time/sequence-dependent over-subscribed scheduling problems with time windows: a novel hybridization of adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) and tabu search (TS), a new randomization strategy for neighbourhood operators, a partial sequence dominance heuristic, and a fast insertion strategy. Through factor analysis, we demonstrate the performance of these new algorithmic features on problem domains with varying properties. Evaluation of the resulting general purpose algorithm on three domains—an order acceptance and scheduling problem, a real-world multi-orbit agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem, and a time-dependent orienteering problem with time windows—shows that our hybrid algorithm robustly outperforms general algorithms including a mixed integer programming method, a constraint programming method, recent state-of-the-art problem-dependent meta-heuristic methods, and a two-stage hybridization of ALNS and TS.},

  abstract     = {The inspection of conductive particles after Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) bonding is a common and crucial step in the TFT-LCD manufacturing process since the number of high-quality conductive particles is a key indicator of ACF bonding quality. However, manual inspection under microscope is a time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone. Therefore, there is an urgent demand in industry for the automatic conductive particle inspection system. It is challenging for automatic conductive particle quality inspection due to the existence of complex background noise and diversified particle appearance, including shape, size, clustering and overlapping, etc. As a result, it lacks an effective automatic detection method to handle all the complex particle patterns. In this paper, we propose a U-shaped deep residual neural network (i.e., U-ResNet), which can learn features of particle from massively labeled data. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high detection accuracy and recall rate, which exceedingly outperforms the previous work. Also, our system is very efficient and can work in real time.},

  abstract     = {AM, generally known as 3D printing, is a promising technology. Robotic AM enables the direct fabrication of products possessing complex geometry and high performance without extra support structures. Process planning of slicing and tool path generation has been a challenging issue due to geometric complexity, material property, etc. Simple and robust planar slicing has been widely researched and applied. However, support structures usually result in time-consuming and cost-expensive. Notwithstanding multi-direction slicing and non-planar slicing (curved layer slicing) have been proposed respectively to decrease support structures, capture some minute but critical features and improve the surface quality and part strength. There is no slicing method aiming at features of part’s sub-volumes. A comprehensive literature review is given first to illustrate the problems and features of available slicing methods better. Then, in order to combine the merits of planar and non-planar slicing to realize intelligent manufacturing further, this paper reports the concept and implementation of a mixed-layer adaptive slicing method for robotic AM. Different from applying planar slicing in any cases or adopting the decomposing and regrouping based multi-direction planar slicing for finding the optimal slicing directions, the proposed method mainly focuses on how to apply planar and non-planar slicing for each sub-volume according to the geometrical features. Additionally, the requirements for robotic AM equipment in possessing multi-mode of printing and slicing are investigated.},

Although some approaches to milling process optimization have been developed based on analytical model using average cutting parameters, they are not available for complex workpieces when cutting parameters are time-varying and instantaneous cutting conditions need to be considered. In order to automate the optimization process and avoid costly machining tests, in this paper, an effective approach for parameters optimization of complex end milling process based on virtual machining is proposed. A computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) application is integrated for actual tool path generation and feedrate scheduling based on material removal rate. Then, a machining simulator based on octree and instantaneous force model is developed to evaluate feasibility of the given numerical control (NC) program, and the correctness of this simulator is verified by machining tests. The optimization process is controlled by the efficient global optimization method to find global optimal solution with fewer simulations and less computation time. During each iteration of the optimization process, NC programs are generated and evaluated automatically by the CAD/CAM application and the simulator, respectively. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach are proved by comparing the generated optimal solution (has reduced machining time and production cost) with the recommended cutting parameters from machining experts when machining an impeller.},

In this method, multi-domain (including time-domain, frequency domain and time–frequency domain) features are respectively extracted from multisensory signals (e.g. three-dimensional cutting force and vibration) as health indictors of tool wear condition, then the relationship between these features and real-time tool wear is directly established based on the designed DCNN model to combine adaptive feature fusion with automatic continuous prediction.

In this paper, a novel pulse classification method was proposed based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) for high-speed EDM pulse analysis. This study is the first time that an RNN has been applied in high-speed EDM pulse analysis. Different from traditional EDM, discharge pulses of high-speed EDM were classified into five types during the machining process: open, spark, arc, partially short and short. Models based on three different RNNs including the traditional RNN, LSTM (long short-term memory) and IndRNN (independently recurrent neural network) with different activation functions were built to analyze the discharge pulses in the research. A new input data structure based on the minimum signal change period was proposed in the classification method to simplify the model structure and improve accuracy at the same time. Without setting thresholds, the highest classification accuracy of the proposed model is up to 97.85%, which can simultaneously classify discharge pulses based on 10,000 orders of magnitude including various current values. The proposed method was effectively adapted to the complicated machining conditions and the compound power source of the high-speed EDM. The optimal model was used to analyze the distribution of discharge pulses during the machining process under different currents, fluxes and feeding speeds. The proportion of the discharge pulses was clearly predicted. Through analyzing the discharge pulses of long machining time, the regulation of discharge under different machining parameters was revealed more reliably, providing valuable information for the improvement of high-speed EDM servo systems.},

Firstly, an experimental design is done and the L27 orthogonal array with three-level of cutting speed $$ \left( {V_{c} } \right) $$, feed rate (f), depth of cut (ap) and nose radius $$ \left( {N_{r} } \right) $$ is formulated. A CNC turning machine is used to perform experiments with cemented carbide tool at an insert angle of 80° and the response variables known as surface finish and material removal rate are measured. A response surface model is rendered from the experimental results to derive the minimization function of surface roughness $$ \left( {R_{a} } \right) $$ and maximization function of material removal rate (MRR). Both optimization functions are solved simultaneously using NSMTLBO. A fuzzy decision maker is also integrated with NSMTLBO to determine the preferred optimum machining parameters from Pareto-front based on the relative importance level of each objective function. The best responses Ra = 2.2347 µm and MRR = 96.835 cm3/min are predicted at the optimum machining parameters of Vc = 160 mm/min, f = 0.5 mm/rev, ap = 0.98 mm and Nr = 0.8 mm. The proposed NSMTLBO is reported to outperform other six peer algorithms due to its excellent capability in generating the Pareto-fronts which are more uniformly distributed and resulted higher percentage of non-dominated solutions. Furthermore, the prediction results of NSMTLBO are validated experimentally and it is reported that the performance deviations between the predicted and actual results are lower than 3.7%, implying the applicability of proposed work in real-world machining applications.},

  abstract     = {Data-based fault diagnosis is an important technology in modern manufacturing systems. However, most of these diagnosis methods assume that all the data should be identically distributed. In diagnosis tasks, this assumption means that these methods can only handle faults from the same working load. In real-world applications, the working load of the equipment varies for the different productions; if an unknown working load with no prior data available is given, then these traditional methods may be invalid. Zero-shot learning, using known data to diagnose the fault under unknown working loads, provides a transfer approach to solve this problem. In this paper, a zero-shot learning method based on contractive stacked autoencoders is proposed. The proposed method is only trained by the data from the known working load and can diagnose the fault from unknown but related working loads without prior data. The experimental results on the Case Western Reserve University dataset indicate that the proposed method performs better than the traditional methods under unknown working loads and has an accuracy of 97.82%. In addition, the analysis of the singular value and feature space also suggests that the proposed method is more robust and the feature representation is more contractive.},

Deep learning computer vision methods were used to evaluate the quality of lithium-ion battery electrode for automated detection of microstructural defects from light microscopy images of the sectioned cells. The results demonstrate that deep learning models are able to learn accurate representations of the microstructure images well enough to distinguish instances with defects from those without defect. Furthermore, the benefits of using pretrained networks for microstructure classification were also demonstrated, achieving the highest classification accuracies. This method provides an approach to analyse thousands of Li-ion battery micrographs for quality assessment in a very short time and it can also be combined with other common battery characterization methods for further technical analysis.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new machine learning method for fault detection using a reduced kernel partial least squares (RKPLS), in static and online forms, for handling nonlinear dynamic systems. The choice of the fault detection method has a vital role to improve efficiency and safety as well as production. The kernel partial least squares is a nonlinear extension of partial least squares. The present method has been mostly used as a monitoring method for nonlinear processes. Thus, the standard method cannot perform properly and quickly when the training data set is large. The main contributions of the suggested approach are: the approximation of the components retained by the standard method and the reduction in the computation time as well as the false alarm rate. Using the reduced principal, the online suggested method is presented for fault detection of nonlinear dynamic processes. The online reduced method is developed to monitor the dynamic process online and update the reduced reference model. For this reason, the moving window RKPLS is proposed. The general principle is to check if the new useful observation satisfies, in the feature space, the condition of independencies between variables. Thereafter, the relevance of the suggested methods is used to monitor the chemical stirred tank reactor benchmark process, the air quality and the tennessee eastman process. The simulation results of the suggested methods are compared to the standard one.},

Since the occurrence of faults in injection molding is inevitable, process optimization is desirable. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are being successfully used for optimization in different branches of science and technology. In this paper, we review the application of one such method, case-based reasoning (CBR), to injection molding. CBR is an AI approach for knowledge representation and manipulation which considers successful solutions of past problems that are likely to serve as candidate solutions for a given problem. This method is being used increasingly in academic and industrial applications. Here, we review CBR systems that are used in injection molding for different purposes, such as process design, processing parameters, fault diagnose, and enhancement of quality control. In addition, we discuss trends for utilization of CBR in different phases of injection molding. The most significant challenges associated with application of CBR to injection molding are also discussed.

  abstract     = {Because the data generated in the complex industrial manufacturing processes is multi-sourced and heterogeneous, it brings a challenge for addressing decision-making optimization problems embedded in the whole manufacturing processes. Especially, for inconsistent lithium-ion cell screening as such a special problem, it is a tough issue to fuse data from multiple sources in a lithium-ion cell manufacturing process to screen cells for relieving the inconsistency among cells in a battery pack with multiple cells configured in series, parallel, and series-parallel. This paper proposes a data-driven decision-making optimization approach (DDDMO) for inconsistent lithium-ion cell screening, which takes into account three dynamic characteristic curves of cells, thus ensuring that the screened cells have consistent electrochemical characteristics. The DDDMO method uses the convolutional auto-encoder to extract features from different characteristics curves of lithium-ion cells through multi-channels and then the features in different channels are combined into fusion features to build a feature base. It also proposes an effective sample generation approach for imbalanced learning using the conditional generative adversarial networks to enhance the feature base, thereby efficiently training a classifier for inconsistent lithium-ion cell screening. Finally, industrial applications verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the missing rate of inconsistent lithium-ion cells drops by an average of 93.74% compared to the screening performance in the single dynamic characteristic of cells, and the DDDMO approach has greater accuracy for screening cells at lower time costs than the existing methods.},

Implementation of intelligence into the robots will further improve efficiency in handling and reduce manufacturing inaccuracies. In this work, two different novel planners are proposed which do path planning for the heads of the SwarmItFIX agents. The environment of the problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Problem. The first planner uses the Value Iteration and Policy Iteration (PI) algorithms individually and the second planner performs the Monte Carlo control reinforcement learning. Finally, when the simulation is done and parameters of the proposed three algorithms along with existing Constraint Satisfaction Problem algorithm are compared with each other. It is observed that the proposed PI algorithm returns the plan much faster than the other algorithms.

The signals captured by different sensors are analyzed via signal or digital image processing algorithms, and distinct features are extracted from these signals to depict the online welding statuses. A deep learning framework based on stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) is established to model the relationship between the multi-sensor features and their corresponding welding statuses, and Genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize the parameters of the SSAE framework (SSAE-GA).

Deep-learning methods have become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of exemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection. The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small number of samples, which is an important requirement for practical applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of surface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples and on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected surfaces, using only approximately 25–30 defective training samples, instead of hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications. This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the number of available defective samples is limited. The dataset is also made publicly available to encourage the development and evaluation of new methods for surface-defect detection.},

  abstract     = {The costs of preventive maintenance have been extensively studied by scholars across all preventive optimization model disciplines. However, one phenomenon fails to be fully studied: breakdown and breakdown maintenance costs. We set out to fill this gap in this study. This study considered the cost of equipment preventive maintenance, and the breakdown maintenance cost caused by an accidental breakdown. In order to more accurately establish the reliability model of equipment breakdown, the three-parameter Weibull distribution was applied to set up the reliability model of equipment and the differential evolution algorithm was adopted to optimize the parameters. On this basis, preventive maintenance was regarded as imperfect maintenance in the study of preventive maintenance strategies for single equipment. In consideration of the combined influence of preventive maintenance and breakdown maintenance, a maintenance strategy in which preventive maintenance times N served as the decision variable was obtained to build a mathematical model on benefit expectation of single equipment in unit time. Based on the research of single equipment, a further study was performed on the multi-equipment series system. Moreover, two strategies were given, both of which use preventive maintenance times N as the decision variable. The first strategy is to take the average cost rate of the system under long-term operation as the optimization objective, while the second strategy is to apply single component maintenance strategy in series system. In the numerical example study, a series manufacturing system composed of two devices was chosen as the research object. Interestingly, we discussed the effect of initial conditions of two-parameter DE on output results. After acquiring the optimal initialization parameters, the failure rate function was achieved by the DE to estimate the parameters of three-parameter Weibull distribution. Meanwhile, the maintenance times N was optimized according to the two strategies respectively. The best result were selected from the results of both strategies based on availability. Thus, the validity and practicability of the proposed research methods are verified.},

  abstract     = {Unnatural control chart patterns (CCPs) usually correspond to the specific factors in a manufacturing process, so the control charts have become important means of the statistical process control. Therefore, an accurate and automatic control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) is of great significance for manufacturing enterprises. In order to improve the CCPR accuracy, experts have designed various complex features, which undoubtedly increases the workload and difficulty of the quality control. To solve these problems, a CCPR method based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is proposed. The proposed method does not require to extract complex features manually; instead, it uses a 1D-CNN to obtain the optimal feature set from the raw data of the CCPs through the feature learning and completes the CCPR. The dataset for training and validation, containing six typical CCPs, is generated by the Monte-Carlo simulation. Then, the influence of the network structural parameters and activation functions on the recognition performance is analyzed and discussed, and some suggestions for parameter selection are given. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the traditional multi-layer perceptron method using the same dataset. The comparison results show that the proposed 1D-CNN method has obvious advantages in the CCPR tasks. Compared with the related literature, the features extracted by the 1D-CNN are of higher quality. Furthermore, the 1D-CNN trained with simulation dataset still perform well in recognizing the real dataset from the production environment.},

  abstract     = {Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is a new service-oriented manufacturing paradigm in which shared resources are integrated and encapsulated as manufacturing services. When a single service is not able to meet some manufacturing requirement, a composition of multiple services is then required via CMfg. Service composition and optimal selection (SCOS) is a key technique for creating an on-demand quality of service (QoS)-optimal efficient manufacturing service composition to satisfy various user requirements. Given the number of services with the same functionality and a similar level of QoS, SCOS has been seen as a key challenge in CMfg research. One effective approach to solving SCOS problems is to use service domain features (SDF) through investigating the probability of services being used for a specific requirement from multiple perspectives. The approach can result in a division of the service space and then help streamline the service space with large-scale candidate services. The approach can also search for optimal subspaces that most likely contribute to an overall optimal solution. Accordingly, this paper develops an SDF-oriented genetic algorithm to effectively create a manufacturing service composition with large-scale candidate services. Fine-grained SDF definitions are developed to divide the service space. SDF-based optimization strategies are adopted. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is presented based on Bayes’ theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by solving three real-world SCOS problems in a private CMfg.},

Furthermore, product lifecycles are becoming shorter due to unbounded and unpredictable customer requirements, thereby requiring reconfigurable and versatile manufacturing systems that underpin the basic building blocks of smart factories. This study introduces a modular factory testbed, emphasizing transformability and modularity under a distributed shop-floor control architecture. The main technologies and methods, being developed and verified through the testbed, are presented from the four aspects of rapid factory transformation: self-layout recognition, rapid workstation and robot reprogramming, inter-layer information sharing, and configurable software for shop-floor monitoring.},

These problems are addressed separately by the existing literature and refer respectively to the optimization of billing and picking processes in a typical warehouse with low-level picker-to-parts system. Integration literature is, therefore, limited and there is a demand for more robust OBS/OPS optimization methods. This approach will deal with practical dilemmas that have not been addressed by researchers yet to propose an extension to the OBS model by Pinto et al. (J Intell Manuf 29(2):405–422, 2018) along with a specific variation of the Order Batching and Sequencing Problem. The premise is to prove to managers the possibility of making more consistent decisions about the trade-off between the level of customer service and the warehouse efficiency. The proposed tool is formulated by the integration of two Genetic Algorithms called GA-OBS and GA-OPS where GA-OBS maximizes the order portfolio billing and generates the picking order to the OPS, whereas GA-OPS comprises the iteration of batch and routing algorithms to minimize picking total time and cost to the OPS. Experiments with problems with different complexity levels showed that the proposed tool produces solutions of satisfactory quality to OBS/OPS. The approach proposed fills a gap in the literature and makes innovative contributions to the development of more suitable optimization methods to the reality of warehouses.},

The first idea is to use the $$ {\text{A}}^{ *} $$ algorithm to identify the distances between workstations in a more realistic way. $$ {\text{A}}^{ *} $$ determines the shortest path within the facility that contains obstacles and transportation routes. The second idea is to combine a genetic algorithm and the $$ {\text{A}}^{ *} $$ algorithm with a homogenous methodology to improve the quality of the facility layouts. In an iterative way, the layout solution space is explored using the genetic algorithm. We study the impacts of the appropriate crossover and mutation operators and the values of the parameters used in this algorithm on the cost of the proposed arrangements. These operators and parameter values are fine-tuned using Monte Carlo simulations. The facility arrangements are all compared and discussed based on their material handling cost associated with the Euclidean distance, rectilinear distance, and $$ {\text{A}}^{ *} $$ algorithm.

  abstract     = {Owing to the increasing concerns about customer needs in the current competitive market, the identification and incorporation of customer requirements (CRs) into product configuration designs have raised the interest of both researchers and practitioners. Most of the design methodologies focus on explicit technical domains to define CRs into specific design parameters directly. However, the CRs are so complicated that they are usually expressed in vague, ambiguous language containing uncertain information and are not in the form of well-defined specifications of product attributes and components. Kano’s model provides a qualitative way to classify CRs accurately. However, research contributions are seldom found in terms of quantitatively integrating Kano’s model with product designs. This paper identifies a novel approach based on the quantification of Kano’s model for integrating CRs into product engineering characteristics. Kano’s model is quantified by identifying the relationships between the CRs and customer satisfaction to link the requirements mapping phase and product configuration design phase. The quantitative results derived from Kano’s model are formulated as the multi-objective functions in a mixed non-linear programming model to identify the product configuration solution. For illustrative purposes, an example associated with the configuration design of a material-forming configuration production line is presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model.},

In this study, an intelligent model based on support vector machine (SVM) and genetic algorithm (GA) was established to predict the inherent deformations of a fillet-welded joint. The training samples were obtained from numerical experiments conducted by the thermal–elastic–plastic finite element analysis. In the developed SVM model, the welding speed, current, voltage and plate thickness were considered as input parameters, and the longitudinal and transverse inherent deformations were corresponding outputs. The correlation coefficients and percentage errors for all the samples were calculated to evaluate the prediction performance of the SVM model. The research results demonstrate that the SVM model optimized by GA can be used to assess the longitudinal and transverse inherent deformations for the T-joint fillet weld with acceptable accuracy.},

A fourth-order tensor model is proposed to represent the continuous part geometric information, process information, and monitoring information, which is used as the input to the deep learning model. A deep learning framework with a conventional neural network and a recurrent neural network has been constructed and trained by monitored deformation data and process information associated with interim part geometric information. The proposed method can be generalised for different parts with certain similarities and has the potential to provide a reference for an adaptive machining control strategy for reducing part deformation. The proposed method was validated by actual machining experiments, and the results show that the prediction accuracy has been improved compared with existing methods. Furthermore, this paper shifts the difficult problem of residual stress measurement and off-line deformation prediction to the solution of on-line deformation prediction based on deformation monitoring data.},

The work focuses on industrial machining centers with ball-screw driven stages as they are used in metal cutting. The approach uses Internal low-frequency signals from the NC controller to keep the barriers for an industrial application at a minimum. The contribution of this study is twofold: First, it extends conventional analytic friction models so that they incorporate positional dependency of friction, as well as the contribution of the inertia of the axis. Second, it proposes how to model the both effects jointly through support vector regression. This data-driven model outperforms the extended Stribeck and the generalized Maxwell-slip friction models, which serve as a representative benchmark for static and dynamic friction models respectively. However, this comes with the need for a careful selection of the data, on which the support vector machine is trained, in order to obtain an accurate and general model.},

These challenges are difficult to cope when using conventional scheduling with the robotic approach. Currently, automated storage and retrieval system are becoming preferred for warehouse companies with the help of mobile robots. However, when many orders are received simultaneously, the existing scheduling approach might make unreasonable decisions, leading to delayed packaging of entire orders and reducing the performance of the warehouse. Therefore, this paper addresses this problem and proposes a novel scheduling mechanism for multi-robot and tasks allocation problems which may arise in an intelligent warehouse system. This mechanism proposes into the intelligent warehouse troubled with simultaneous multiple customer demands. The mathematical model for the system is developed by considering a multitask robot facing dynamic customer demand. The proposed model’s approach is based on the particle swarm optimization heuristic. The result for this approach then compared with the genetic algorithm (GA). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution is far superior to that of the GA for multi-robot scheduling and tasks allocation problems in the intelligent warehouse.},

The traditional manufacturing process relies on human eye detection which requires a large number of workers without a stable and good detection effect. In order to solve the problem, a visual defect detection method based on multi-spectral deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed in this paper. Firstly, a selected CNN model is established. By adjusting the depth and width of the model, the influence of model depth and kernel size on the recognition result is evaluated. The optimal CNN model structure is selected. Secondly, the light spectrum features of solar cell color image are analyzed. It is found that a variety of defects exhibited different distinguishable characteristics in different spectral bands. Thus, a multi-spectral CNN model is constructed to enhance the discrimination ability of the model to distinguish between complex texture background features and defect features. Finally, some experimental results and K-fold cross validation show that the multi-spectral deep CNN model can effectively detect the solar cell surface defects with higher accuracy and greater adaptability. The accuracy of defect recognition reaches 94.30%. Applying such an algorithm can increase the efficiency of solar cell manufacturing and make the manufacturing process smarter.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent machinery fault diagnosis system has been receiving increasing attention recently due to the potential large benefits of maintenance cost reduction, enhanced operation safety and reliability. This paper proposes a novel deep learning method for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. Since accurately labeled data are usually difficult to obtain in real industries, data augmentation techniques are proposed to artificially create additional valid samples for model training, and the proposed method manages to achieve high diagnosis accuracy with small original training dataset. Two augmentation methods are investigated including sample-based and dataset-based methods, and five augmentation techniques are considered in general, i.e. additional Gaussian noise, masking noise, signal translation, amplitude shifting and time stretching. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by carrying out experiments on two popular rolling bearing datasets. Fairly high diagnosis accuracy up to 99.9% can be obtained using limited training data. By comparing with the latest advanced researches on the same datasets, the superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the deep neural network is extensively evaluated with respect to data augmentation strength, network depth and so forth. The results of this study suggest that the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis method offers a new and promising approach.},

  abstract     = {Given the dynamic and uncertain production environment of job shops, a scheduling strategy with adaptive features must be developed to fit variational production factors. Therefore, a dynamic scheduling system model based on multi-agent technology, including machine, buffer, state, and job agents, was built. A weighted Q-learning algorithm based on clustering and dynamic search was used to determine the most suitable operation and to optimize production. To address the large state space problem caused by changes in the system state, four state features were extracted. The dimension of the system state was decreased through the clustering method. To reduce the error between the actual system states and clustering ones, the state difference degree was defined and integrated with the iteration formula of the Q function. To select the optimal state-action pair, improved search and iteration update strategies were proposed. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm and simulation experiments indicated that the proposed adaptive strategy is well adaptable and effective in different scheduling environments, and shows better performance in complex environments. The two contributions of this research are as follows: (1) a dynamic greedy search strategy was developed to avoid blind searching in traditional strategy. (2) Weighted iteration update of the Q function, including the weighted mean of the maximum fuzzy earning, was designed to improve the speed and accuracy of the improved learning algorithm.},

This technique is used to learn the degradation process of any physical asset, and consequently to predict its failure time (T). It combines the reliability information that is obtained from a classical Kaplan–Meier non-parametric curve to that obtained from online measurements of multiple sensed signals of degradation. An analysis of these signals by the machine learning technique, logical analysis of data (LAD), is performed to exploit the instantaneous knowledge about the state of degradation of the asset studied. The experimental results of the predictions of failure times for cutting tools are reported. The results show that LASC prognostic results are better than the results obtained by well-known machine learning techniques. Other advantages of the proposed techniques are also discussed.},

This issue can be addressed by formulating the faulty wafer detection problem as a predictive modeling task, in which the process parameters/measurements and subsequent inspection results concerning the faults comprise the input and output variables at the wafer level, respectively. To achieve improved predictive performance, this paper presents a joint modeling method that incorporates classification and regression tasks into a single prediction model. Given the output variables in both binary and continuous forms, the prediction model simultaneously considers both the classification and regression tasks to complement each other, where each task predicts the binary and continuous output variables, respectively. The outputs from these two tasks are combined to predict whether a wafer is faulty. The entire model is implemented as a neural network, and is trained by optimizing a single objective function.

In design of such equipment, selection of appropriate modules is a very critical decision factor to effectively and efficiently satisfy manufacturing requirements. However, the selection of appropriate modules is a challenging task because it is a multi-domain mapping process relying heavily on experts’ domain knowledge, which is usually unstructured and implicit. To effectively support RMT designers, an ontology-based RMT module selection method is proposed. First, a knowledge base is built by development of an ontology to formally represent the taxonomy, properties, and causal relationships of/among three domain core concepts, namely, machining feature, machining operation, and RMT module involved in RMT design. Second, a four-step sequential procedure is established to facilitate the utilization of encoded knowledge from a knowledge base to aid in the selection of appropriate RMT modules. The procedure takes a given part family as the input, automatically infers the required machining operations as well as the RMT modules through rule-based reasoning, and eventually forms a set of RMT configurations that are capable of machining the part family as the output. Finally, the efficacy of the ontology-based RMT module selection method is demonstrated using a plate family manufacturing example. Results show that the approach is effective to support designers by appropriately and rapidly selecting modules and generating configurations in RMT design.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is one of the typical structured, systematic and proactive approaches for product or system failure analysis. A critical step in FMEA is identifying potential failure modes for product sub-systems, components, and processes, for which component-failure mode (CF) knowledge is necessarily needed as an important source of knowledge. However, this knowledge is usually acquired manually based on historical documents such as bills of material and failure analysis reports, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, incurring inefficiency and plenty of mistakes. Nevertheless, few existing studies have developed an effective and intelligent approach to acquiring accurate CF knowledge automatically. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a method to construct the CF matrix automatically by mining unstructured and short quality problem texts and mapping as well as representing them as CF knowledge. Starting with mining the frequent itemsets of failure modes through Apriori algorithm, the method uses the semantic dictionary WordNet to find synonyms in the set of failure modes, based on which the standard set of failure modes is finally built. Subsequently, upon the previous work and components set, we design the component-failure mode matrix mining (CFMM) algorithm and apply it to establish the CF matrix from unstructured quality problem texts. Lastly, we examine the quality data of the seat module of an automobile company as a case study in order to validate the proposed method. The result shows that the failure mode extraction method with standardized features can extract failure modes more effectively than the FP-growth and K-means clustering methods. Meanwhile, the devised CFMM algorithm can extract more combinations of CF than the FP-growth method and build a richer CF matrix. Although different industries have distinct domain characteristics, our proposed method can be applicable not only to manufacturing but also to other fields needing FMEA to enhance product and system reliability.},

  abstract     = {Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is increasingly becomes an important material used in the industry for cutting tools of difficult-to-machine materials due to its excellent characteristics such as hardness, toughness and wear resistance. However, its applications are restricted because of the PCD material is difficult to machine. Therefore, electrical discharge machining (EDM) is an ideal method suitable for PCD materials due to its non-contact process nature. The performance of EDM, however, is significantly influenced by its process parameters and type of electrode. In this study, soft computing technique was utilized to optimize the performance of the EDM in roughing condition for eroding PCD with copper tungsten or copper nickel electrode. Central composite design with five levels of three machining parameters viz. peak current, pulse interval and pulse duration has been used to design the experimental matrix. The EDM experiment was conducted based on the design experimental matrix. Subsequently, the effectiveness of EDM on shaping PCD with copper tungsten and copper nickel was evaluated in terms of material removal rate (MRR) and electrode wear rate (EWR). It was found that copper tungsten electrode gave lower EWR, in comparison with the copper nickel electrode. The predictive model of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was developed to predict the MRR and EWR of the EDM process. The prominent predictive ability of RBFNN was confirmed as the prediction errors in terms of mean-squared error were found within the range of 6.47E−05 to 7.29E−06. Response surface plot was drawn to study the influences of machining parameters of EDM for shaping PCD with copper tungsten and copper nickel. Subsequently, moth search algorithm (MSA) was used to determine the optimal machining parameters, such that the MRR was maximized and EWR was minimized. Based on the obtained optimal parameters, confirmation test with the absolute error within the range of 1.41E−06 to 5.10E−05 validated the optimization capability of MSA.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing processes are experiencing extraordinary growth in present years. Concerning the production of goods by using this technology, expertise and know-how are today relevant while process simulation needs to be extensively validated before acquiring the necessary reliability, which is already achieved and established for a number of manufacturing processes. The objective of the present work is the development of a new algorithm for feature recognition, which is the first step towards an application of rules for manufacturability to digital models. The proposed approach was specifically conceived for design for additive manufacturing (DfAM). The method starts from a graph-based representation of geometric models that is the base for the definition of new and original geometrical entities. Then, an algorithm-based process has been identified and proposed for their detection. Eventually, these geometrical entities have been used for comparison with rules and constraints of DfAM in order to point out possible critical issues for manufacturability. A self-developed plugin software was implemented for the application of proposed procedure in Computer Aided Design systems. Several applications of a set of DfAM rules are provided and tested to validate the method by means of case studies. As a conclusion, such an application demonstrated the suitability of the approach for detections of features that are relevant to an early investigation into Stereolithography manufacturability. Presented approach could be helpful during early phases of product development for detecting critical manufacturing issues and thus for realising an assistant-tool that can help designers by displaying potential solutions to overcome them. Since the very first steps of product design, this integration of manufacturing knowledge allows for a reduction of a number of potential errors occurring during product fabrication and then for a decrease of required time for product development.},

Different product-level EOL business strategies and component-level recovery options are suggested in this recovery decision support system. Then, multi-objective optimization models are formulated to identify the age-dependent recovery roadmap that best matches the product condition and meets the business goals. In order to achieve environmentally friendly recovery, both recovery profits and energy performances are optimized in our models.

  abstract     = {Manufacturing industry profoundly impact economic and societal progress. As being a commonly accepted term for research centers and universities, the Industry 4.0 initiative has received a splendid attention of the business and research community. Although the idea is not new and was on the agenda of academic research in many years with different perceptions, the term “Industry 4.0” is just launched and well accepted to some extend not only in academic life but also in the industrial society as well. While academic research focuses on understanding and defining the concept and trying to develop related systems, business models and respective methodologies, industry, on the other hand, focuses its attention on the change of industrial machine suits and intelligent products as well as potential customers on this progress. It is therefore important for the companies to primarily understand the features and content of the Industry 4.0 for potential transformation from machine dominant manufacturing to digital manufacturing. In order to achieve a successful transformation, they should clearly review their positions and respective potentials against basic requirements set forward for Industry 4.0 standard. This will allow them to generate a well-defined road map. There has been several approaches and discussions going on along this line, a several road maps are already proposed. Some of those are reviewed in this paper. However, the literature clearly indicates the lack of respective assessment methodologies. Since the implementation and applications of related theorems and definitions outlined for the 4th industrial revolution is not mature enough for most of the reel life implementations, a systematic approach for making respective assessments and evaluations seems to be urgently required for those who are intending to speed this transformation up. It is now main responsibility of the research community to developed technological infrastructure with physical systems, management models, business models as well as some well-defined Industry 4.0 scenarios in order to make the life for the practitioners easy. It is estimated by the experts that the Industry 4.0 and related progress along this line will have an enormous effect on social life. As outlined in the introduction, some social transformation is also expected. It is assumed that the robots will be more dominant in manufacturing, implanted technologies, cooperating and coordinating machines, self-decision-making systems, autonom problem solvers, learning machines, 3D printing etc. will dominate the production process. Wearable internet, big data analysis, sensor based life, smart city implementations or similar applications will be the main concern of the community. This social transformation will naturally trigger the manufacturing society to improve their manufacturing suits to cope with the customer requirements and sustain competitive advantage. A summary of the potential progress along this line is reviewed in introduction of the paper. It is so obvious that the future manufacturing systems will have a different vision composed of products, intelligence, communications and information network. This will bring about new business models to be dominant in industrial life. Another important issue to take into account is that the time span of this so-called revolution will be so short triggering a continues transformation process to yield some new industrial areas to emerge. This clearly puts a big pressure on manufacturers to learn, understand, design and implement the transformation process. Since the main motivation for finding the best way to follow this transformation, a comprehensive literature review will generate a remarkable support. This paper presents such a review for highlighting the progress and aims to help improve the awareness on the best experiences. It is intended to provide a clear idea for those wishing to generate a road map for digitizing the respective manufacturing suits. By presenting this review it is also intended to provide a hands-on library of Industry 4.0 to both academics as well as industrial practitioners. The top 100 headings, abstracts and key words (i.e. a total of 619 publications of any kind) for each search term were independently analyzed in order to ensure the reliability of the review process. Note that, this exhaustive literature review provides a concrete definition of Industry 4.0 and defines its six design principles such as interoperability, virtualization, local, real-time talent, service orientation and modularity. It seems that these principles have taken the attention of the scientists to carry out more variety of research on the subject and to develop implementable and appropriate scenarios. A comprehensive taxonomy of Industry 4.0 can also be developed through analyzing the results of this review.},

  abstract     = {Machine vision inspection systems are often used for part classification applications to confirm that correct parts are available in manufacturing or assembly operations. Support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are popular choices for classifiers. These supervised classifiers perform well when developed for specific applications and trained with known class images. Their drawback is that they cannot be easily applied to different applications without extensive retuning. Moreover, for the same application, they do not perform well if there are unknown class images. This paper proposes a novel solution to the above limitations of SVMs and ANNs, with the development of a hybrid approach that combines supervised and semi-supervised layers. To illustrate its performance, the system is applied to three different small part identification and sorting applications: (1) solid plastic gears, (2) clear plastic wire connectors and (3) metallic Indian coins. The ability of the system to work with different applications with minimal tuning and user inputs illustrates its flexibility. The robustness of the system is demonstrated by its ability to reject unknown class images. Four hybrid classification methods were developed and tested: (1) SSVM–USVM, (2) USVM–SSVM, (3) USVM–SANN and (4) SANN–USVM. It was found that SANN–USVM gave the best results with an accuracy of over 95% for all three applications. A software package known as FlexMVS for flexible machine vision system was written to illustrate the hybrid approach that enabled easy execution of the image conditioning, feature extraction and classification steps.

  abstract     = {In Mass Customisation (MC), products are intrinsically variable, because they aim at satisfying end-users’ requests. Modular design and flexible manufacturing technologies are useful strategies to guarantee a wide product variability. However, in the eyewear field, the current strategies are not easily implementable, due to some eyewear peculiarities (e.g., the large variability of the frame geometry and material, and the necessity to use specific manufacturing phases). For example, acetate spectacle-frames are bent through a thermoforming process. This particular phase requires dedicated moulds, whose geometry strictly depends on the frame model to be bent; consequently, changes of the frame geometry continuously require new moulds, which have to be designed, manufactured, used, and finally stored. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new strategy to transform a dedicated tool (i.e., a thermoforming mould) into a reconfigurable one, to optimise the tool design, manufacturing and use. First, how the frame features influence the mould geometry has been investigated, creating a map of relations. On the basis of this map, the conventional monolithic-metallic mould was divided into “standard” (re-usable) and “special” (ad-hoc) modules, where the “special” ones are in charge of managing the variability of the product geometry. The mapped relations were formalised as mathematical equations and then, implemented into a Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) system, to automatically design the “special” modules and guarantee the mould assemblability. This paper provides an original example of how a reconfigurable thermoforming mould can be conceived and how a KBE system can be used to this aim.},

  abstract     = {In semiconductor manufacturing, the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process produces higher thickness variability in the edge area of the wafer than that in the center area due to the characteristics of the polishing operation. To address this problem, advanced CMP equipment includes a function that controls the removal rate of each area. However, to take full advantage of this capability, effective advanced process control systems must be implemented with a virtual metrology (VM) model. However, the prediction performance of the VM model often deteriorates due to process drift. Here, we present a deep learning-based VM model that demonstrates high performance in the presence of nonlinear process drift. The proposed model combines a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network to extract time-dependent and time-independent features. A two-stage model training method is proposed that alternately updates the weights of each network to improve prediction performance. In the experiments using on-site CMP process data, the performance of the deep learning models exceeded that of standard machine learning models. The proposed model showed an 8.48% decrease in process variability relative to the best-performing machine learning model, which was elastic nets.},

Well defined interval durations between maintenance inspections provide major support in achieving these targets. However, in order to establish the best interval length, process behavior, cycle times and related costs must be clearly known, and future estimates for these parameters must be established. This paper applies process mining techniques in developing a probabilistic model in Bayesian Networks integrated to predictive models. The probability of a given activity occurring in the probabilistic model output establishes the forecast boundaries for predictive models, responsible for estimating process cycle times. Availability (uptime) and cost functions are mathematically defined and an iterative process is performed in the length of intervals between maintenance inspections until the time and costs wasted are minimized and the best interval duration is found. The probabilistic model enables simulating changes in the event occurrence probability, allowing a number of different scenarios to be visualized and providing better support to managers in scheduling maintenance activities. The results show that production losses can be further reduced through optimally defined intervals between maintenance inspections.},

A hybrid evolutionary algorithm-based simulation optimization approach is proposed for the multi-objective buffer allocation problem (MOBAP) in open serial production lines. As a search methodology, the Pareto optimal set is derived by hybrid approach using elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a special version of a multi-objective simulated annealing. As an evaluative tool, discrete event simulation modeling is used to estimate the performance measures for the production systems. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed hybrid approach, a comparative study is provided for the MOBAP in various serial line configurations. The comparative results show that the hybrid method has a considerable potential to minimize the total buffer space by appropriately allocating space to each buffer while maximizing average production rate.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of information and communication technology enables a promising market of information densely product, i.e. smart, connected product (SCP), and also changes the way of user–designer interaction in the product development process. For SCP, massive data generated by users drives its design innovation and somehow determines its final success. Nevertheless, most existing works only look at the new functionalities or values that are derived in the one-way communication by introducing novel data analytics methods. Few work discusses about an effective and systematic approach to enable individual user innovation in such context, i.e. co-development process, which sets the fundamental basis of the prevailing concept of data-driven design. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper proposes a generic data-driven cyber-physical approach for personalised SCP co-development in a cloud-based environment. A novel concept of smart, connected, open architecture product is hence introduced with a generic cyber-physical model established in a cloud-based environment, of which the interaction processes are enabled by co-development toolkits with smartness and connectedness. Both the personalized SCP modelling method and the establishment of its cyber-physical product model are described in details. To further demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study of a smart wearable device (i.e. i-BRE respiratory mask) development process is given with general discussions.},
