  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning based on the deep neural network has attracted much attention and has been widely used in real-world applications. However, the black-box property limits its usage from applying in high-stake areas, such as manufacture and healthcare. To deal with this problem, some researchers resort to the interpretable control policy generation algorithm. The basic idea is to use an interpretable model, such as tree-based genetic programming, to extract policy from other black box modes, such as neural networks. Following this idea, in this paper, we try yet another form of the genetic programming technique, evolutionary feature synthesis, to extract control policy from the neural network. We also propose an evolutionary method to optimize the operator set of the control policy for each specific problem automatically. Moreover, a policy simplification strategy is also introduced. We conduct experiments on four reinforcement learning environments. The experiment results reveal that evolutionary feature synthesis can achieve better performance than tree-based genetic programming to extract policy from the neural network with comparable interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Terrorist attacks have been becoming one of the severe threats to national public security and world peace. Ascertaining whether the behaviors of terrorist attacks will threaten the lives of innocent people is vital in dealing with terrorist attacks, which has a profound impact on the resource optimization configuration. For this purpose, we propose an XGBoost-based casualty prediction algorithm, namely RP-GA-XGBoost, to predict whether terrorist attacks will cause the casualties of innocent civilians. In the proposed RP-GA-XGBoost algorithm, a novel method that incorporates random forest (RF) and principal component analysis (PCA) is devised for selecting features, and a genetic algorithm is used to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost. The proposed method is evaluated on the public dataset (Global Terrorism Database, GTD) and the terrorist attack dataset in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves area under curve (AUC) of 87.00%, and accuracy of 86.33% for the public dataset, and sensitivity of 94.00%, AUC of 94.90% for the terrorist attack dataset in China, which proves the superiority and higher generalization ability of the proposed algorithm. Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply machine learning in the management of terrorist attacks, which can provide early warning and decision support information for terrorist attack management.},

  abstract     = {Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are extremely scarce cells which cut off from a primary tumor and percolate into the circulation of blood flow and are, thus, critical for precise cancer detection and treatment. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) which exploits asymmetric splitting of laminar flow around the implanted microposts has displayed trustworthy capabilities in separating cells of varying sizes. In this research work, a microfluidic channel consisting of three symmetrically aligned inlets and outlets and embedded circular posts has been proposed which effectively separates the CTCs from lymphocytes utilizing the concept of DLD. Using a commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4, the design of the proposed microchannel has been simulated and analyzed considering an injected blood sample containing massive CTCs and slim WBCs of radii 13.5 µm and 6 µm, respectively. The proposed model of microchannel isolates the CTCs from WBCs at a comparatively higher sample mass flow rate of 4 × 10–6 kg/s and Reynolds number of 8.9 thereby operating efficiently at higher throughput, and offers excellent linearity in terms of velocity magnitude, pressure, shear rate and Reynolds number. The computational analysis of the proposed microchannel reveals that it can isolate CTCs from WBCs with better separation ratio, offers higher throughput, reduces possibilities of clogging and maintains better uniformity of pressure distribution and other flow parameters when compared with existing microchannel designs. The maximum separation ratio for CTCs and WBCs has been obtained as 84% and 96%, respectively.},

In such systems, web services are allocated depending on the requirements of receivers and the facilities of servers. One of the challenging issues during assignment of web services is how to select the appropriate server to minimize faults. In this paper, we proposed dynamic software rejuvenation in the form of a proactive fault-tolerance technique based on fuzzy system. While including a threshold for the rejuvenation of each web service, we carried out the training phase based on the features of the service providers as well as the receivers’ requirements. The results of simulations revealed that our strategy can mitigate the failure rate of web services by 45, 40, 23, and 12% in comparison with the non-fuzzy, regression-based, Markov-based, and ACOGELS-based web service rejuvenation strategies, respectively.},

  abstract     = {A great challenge in operational research is to apply time-efficient algorithms to find the optimal solutions to the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and its many variations. The TSP with time windows (TSPTW) arises due to intense pressure for business to improve customer service. As online shopping becomes more popular, customer satisfaction increases if customers can decide when their orders are delivered to them. Customers may choose a time window, which is defined by an earliest delivery time and a latest delivery time, during which the package is delivered. Delivering packages to multiple customers is a typical TSPTW. One main challenge for a delivery business is to determine the size of the time window (i.e., the difference between the latest and earliest delivery times), which affects delivery cost and customer satisfaction. Although many previous studies investigated the TSPTW, none of those focused on the size of time windows. This study is the first that experiments with different time window sizes and determines their impact on tour duration, customer satisfaction, and solution time of the optimal delivery routes. The experiment results show that increasing the size of the time window decreases tour duration and customer satisfaction and increases solution time. Decreasing the size of the time window increases tour duration and customer satisfaction and decreases solution time. A small solution time is necessary for the scheduling of deliveries to many customers. A large solution time prevents a delivery business from delivering packages using optimal routes, which increases delivery cost and decreases customer satisfaction. The results of this study indicate that a general guideline for business is to allow customers to choose a time window size that is within the cost limit but is sufficiently small to maximize customer satisfaction and optimize delivery routes.},

These parameters reflect the decision-makers’ risk attitudes in determining the membership and non-membership degrees of the evaluation information. In addition, the parameters demonstrate the risk attitude in terms of the hesitancy degree under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information. Then, a new score function of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs) is proposed that uses the introduced mentality parameters. Meanwhile, certain properties of the proposed score function are discussed. Furthermore, the weighted comprehensive score value of IVIFNs is introduced, and an MCDM method is developed in an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Finally, a numerical example and comparative analyses are provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, capacitated stochastic transportation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model along with some capacitated restrictions on the route. In the formulated problem, we assume that parameters of the supply and demand constraints’ follow gamma distribution, which is handled by the chance constrained programming approach and the maximum likelihood estimation approach has been used to assess the probabilistic distributions of the unknown parameters with a specified probability level. Furthermore, some of the objective function’s coefficients are consider as ambiguous in nature. The ambiguity in the formulated problem has been presented by interval type 2 fuzzy parameter and converted into the deterministic form using an expected value function approach.

This is an easily implemented and high time performance nature-inspired approach; however, the best solutions are not found for archiving, solution updating, and fast convergence problems faced in certain cases. This study investigates the previously proposed solutions for creating diversity in using MOPSO and proposes using random immigrants approach.

This shopping experience and opinion about the shopper’s shop can be observed by the customer-experience shared across social media platforms. A new customer when searching a shop needs information about manufacturing date (MRD) and manufacturing price (MRP), offers, quality, and suggestions which can only be provided by the previous customer experience. The MRP and MRD are already available in the product cover or label. Several approaches have been used for predicting the product details but not providing accurate information. This paper is motivated towards applying Machine Learning algorithms for learning, analysing and classifying the product information and the shop information based on the customer experience. The product data with customer reviews is collected from benchmark Unified computing system (UCS) which is a server for data based computer product lined up for evaluating hardware, support to visualization, software management. From the results and comparison, it has been found that machine learning algorithms outperform than other approaches.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Android applications play a major role in software industry. Therefore, having a system that can help companies predict the success probability of such applications would be useful. Thus far, numerous research works have been conducted to predict the success probability of desktop applications using a variety of machine learning techniques. However, since features of desktop programs are different from those of mobile applications, they are not applicable to mobile applications. To our knowledge, there has not been a repository or even a method to predict the success probability of Android applications so far. In this research, we introduce a repository composed of 100 successful and 100 unsuccessful apps of Android operating system in Google PlayStoreTM including 34 features per application. Then, we use the repository to a neural network and other classification algorithms to predict the success probability. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the previous approaches based on the accuracy criterion. Experimental results show that the best accuracy which we achieved is 99.99%, which obtained when we used MLP and PCA, while the best accuracy achieved by the previous work in desktop platforms was 96%. However, the time complexity of the proposed approach is higher than previous methods, since the time complexities of NPR and MLP are O $$( n^3$$ ) and O $$( nph^koi$$ ), respectively.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to present novel algorithms for solving the multiple attribute decision-making problems under the normal intuitionistic fuzzy set environment. Normal intuitionistic and interval-valued intuitionistic sets are the essential mechanisms for influencing the decision-making queries with anonymous and indeterminant data by engaging a degree of membership and non-membership of normal distribution data in quantitative terms. Holding these features in mind and united the idea of hesitation degree, this paper presents some improved score functions to rank the normal intuitionistic and interval-valued intuitionistic sets. The advantage of these proposed functions is to overwhelm the weakness of the existing functions and will aid to rank the given objects in a more consistent way. The numerous salient features of the proposed functions are studied. Later, we develop two new algorithms for interval-valued as well as crisp numbers based on the proposed functions to solve multiple attribute decision-making problems. The given approaches have been confirmed with numerical examples and the advantages, as well as comparative analysis, are furnished to shows its influence over existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Yager has established that the notion of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) is more accomplished than pythagorean fuzzy set (PyFS) and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) to cope with awkward and complicated information in real decision theory. This notion works with yes-, no- and refusal-type fuzzy information. The constraint of q-ROFS is that the sum of n-power of the truth grade and the n-power of the falsity grade is bounded to unit interval. Generalized dice similarity measures are complimentary concepts quantifying the difference and closeness of q-ROFSs. In this paper, we suggested a number of novel dice similarity measures (DSMs) in the surroundings of the q-ROFS, and we examined some prevailing dice similarity measures and their limitations. In addition, we took the DSMs broad view to some globalized dice similarity measures (GDSMs), and we examined some of their particular cases. We employed the novel suggested GDSMs to the best selections of items on identification problems, and we analyzed their acquired consequences. There is a development of novel work in which many situations are evaluated, and from this perspective, the suggested work is changed into already prevailing work. This study also examines the merits of novel DSMs and the limitations for DSMs of IFSs and PyFSs. The comparison between established measures with existing measures is explored and their graphical interpretations are also discussed to show the reliability and effectiveness of the explored measures.},

Since most of the real-world problems have uncertainty in nature, making the decision is challengeable one for the decision makers. Soft set has the advantage of free from the deficiency of the parameterization tools of existing theories, namely probability, fuzzy theory and the theory of rough sets. Linguistic terms mean different things to different people, so variability in expert&#39;s acceptance degree is possible. Here usage of type-1 fuzzy leads to noisy and uncertain, and the parameters also may be noisy and hence type-2 fuzzy sets may be used to address the mentioned issues. Therefore, a triangular interval type-2 fuzzy soft set has been considered in the present work by combining triangular interval type-2 fuzzy set and soft set. In this paper, a triangular interval type-2 fuzzy soft weighted arithmetic operator (TIT2FSWA) has been proposed with its desired mathematical properties; also applied the proposed methodology in a decision-making problem for profit analysis.

  abstract     = {Increased energy demand is expected to be met by reliable and continuous energy sources. Renewable energy which is obtained from nature and can continuously reload itself from natural sources is a new generation energy type. The sun, which is the main source of renewable energies and produces heat and electricity by direct and indirect methods, is an important renewable energy source. The installation of solar energy systems takes place under the basic technical, economic and political factors. Alternative solar energy plant projects are evaluated linguistically under the main criteria based on the knowledge and experience of the experts. Hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms are used to incorporate the uncertain and hesitant expressions into the decision-making process. The decision-making process that takes place with hesitant linguistic expressions in multiple sub-criteria is based on the AHP model. The inclusion of hesitant statements in the decision-making process with the AHP model enables more realistic choices among the alternatives. System technology (0.18), energy policy (0.15) and energy price change (0.13) appear as the most important factors in the pairwise comparison of the factors based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic evaluations. The results coincide with the need for high efficiency in solar energy systems, the importance of governmental supportive policies and the effects of price competition in the energy sector. Also, the closeness of the overall priority values of all projects (0.189, 0.23, 0.287, 0.135, 0.158) indicates that the decision makers take into account the effective factors.},

In this way, some meaningful information, such as the suitable number of experts, can be obtained through observing changes in the PCFI result when the number of experts varies. After applying the layered partial-consensus fuzzy collaborative forecasting approach to a real case, the experimental results revealed that the layered partial-consensus fuzzy collaborative forecasting approach outperformed three existing methods.

Then, MTL framework is presented to improve the gesture recognition performance and give information about force levels. Last but not least, to solve the problem that using the greedy principle in MTL, a modified pseudo-task augmentation (PTA) trajectory is introduced. Experiments conducted on two representative datasets demonstrate that compared with other methods, frequency domain information with convolutional neural network (CNN) is more suitable for gesture recognition with variable force levels. Besides, the feasibility of extracting features that are closely related to both gestures and force levels is verified via MTL. By influencing learning dynamics, the proposed PTA method can improve the results of all tasks, and make it applicable to the case where the main tasks and auxiliary tasks are clear.},

To this end, we first propose the notion of interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant linguistic sets (IVq-RDHLSs) by combining interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant fuzzy (IVq-RDHF) sets with linguistic terms set. The proposed IVq-RDHLSs utilize IVq-RDHF membership and non-membership degrees to assess linguistic terms, so that they can fully express decision-makers’ evaluation information. Additionally, some related concepts such as the operational rules, score and accuracy functions, and ranking method of IVq-RDHLSs are presented. Considering the good performance of the classical Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) in integrating fuzzy information, we further generalize MSM into IVq-RDHLSs to propose the interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant linguistic MSM operator, the interval-valued q-rung dual hesitant linguistic dual MSM operator, as well as their weighted forms. Afterwards, we study the applications of IVq-RDHLSs and their aggregation operators in decision-making and propose a new MADM method. Some real decision-making problems in daily life are employed to prove the rightness of the proposed method.

However, with the continuous expansion of the scale of sharing accommodation, it is fairly complicated for users to search appropriate services or information. The decision-making problems become more and more complicated. Hence, a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy recommendation decision-making algorithm based on bipartite network projection is proposed in this paper. First of all, combining the users’ decision-making information and the experts’ evaluation information, a bipartite graph connecting users and alternatives is established. Then, the satisfaction degree of probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element is defined. Besides, the recommended alternative is obtained by the allocation of resources. Finally, a numerical case of Airbnb users is given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a broad learning system (BLS) has been theoretically and experimentally confirmed to be an efficient incremental learning system. To get rid of deep architecture, BLS shares the same architecture and learning mechanism of the well-known functional link neural networks (FLNN), but works in broad learning way on both the randomly mapped features of original features of data and their randomly generated enhancement nodes. As such, BLS often requires a huge heap of hidden nodes to achieve the prescribed or satisfactory performance, which may inevitably cause both overwhelming storage requirement and overfitting phenomenon. In this study, a stacked architecture of broad learning systems called D&amp;BLS is proposed to achieve enhanced performance and simultaneously downsize the system architecture. By boosting the residuals between previous and current layers and simultaneously augmenting the original input space with the outputs of the previous layer as the inputs of current layer, D&amp;BLS stacks several lightweight BLS sub-systems to guarantee stronger feature representation capability and better classification/regression performance. Three fast incremental learning algorithms of D&amp;BLS are also developed, without the need for the whole re-training. Experimental results on some popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of D&amp;BLS in the sense of both enhanced performance and reduced system architecture.},

  abstract     = {The material handling equipment (MHE) has a close connection with layout of machinery and plays the important role in productivity of servicing or manufacturing systems. Since each of MHE has distinct characteristics than the others with respect to conflicting criteria and design experts may state the different subjective judgments with respect to qualitative criteria, the material handling equipment selection problem (MHESP) can be taken into account as a group multi-criteria decision-making (GMCDM) problem. In this paper, a version of type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), named Gaussian interval type-2 fuzzy sets (GIT2FSs), is first used as an alternative to the traditional triangular membership functions (MFs) to weight criteria and sub-criteria and also evaluate of alternatives with respect to sub-criteria. The synthetic value method of GIT2FSs is then carried out to convert the assessments stated as GIT2FSs for each alternative with respect to each sub-criterion and also weights of criteria (sub-criteria) into the single fuzzy rating and weight, respectively. Then, the fuzzy weighted average (FWA) approach is adopted to integrate the single fuzzy ratings of each alternative with respect to sub-criteria and the single fuzzy weights of sub-criteria under each criterion with the aggregated weighted ratings. In next stage, ELECTRE III (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realite´—elimination and choice translation reality) is generalized with GIT2FSs to select the optimal MHE through a new ranking approach. Moreover, some arithmetic operations and properties are extended to GIT2FSs. In addition, to demonstrate its potential applications, the proposed methodology is implemented in a real case study and an illustrative example, and then, the ranking results are compared with those of the others in the literature. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to show robustness and stability of the obtained results.},

This paper investigates a fuzzy expert system for directional relaying, classification, and location of faults in double-circuit transmission lines. The current magnitudes measured at only one terminal of the double-circuit transmission line are used to compute discreet Fourier coefficients. Thus, this scheme does not involve any communication channel. The presented fuzzy expert system is achieved from the structure of MAMDANI system in LabVIEW software. Test case studies show the effectiveness of the presented scheme. The simulation results attest that the directional relaying, classification, and location estimation is very accurate. This scheme is adaptive to the change of fault location, fault resistance, fault inception angle, and fault type.},

The classification is carried out on single rice kernel using image pre-processing steps followed by a cascade network classifier. The performance of the classifiers based on the above feature sets is also compared. It is found that morphological feature is more suitable for the classification of rice kernels, as compared to other features. The number of input features is reduced by a feature selection process using statistical analysis system (SAS) software. The classification accuracy based on selected features is compared with that of original features using different classifiers. It is found that the selected features are able to provide classification accuracy very close to the original features. The performance of the proposed cascade classifier is also tested against standard datasets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), and the results are compared with other classifiers. The results show that the proposed classifier provides better classification accuracy as compared to other classifiers.},

The proposed model can inherit the better generalization performance and the less training time consumption of the standard ELM, and can achieve a more balanced search strategy with the optimized weights and biases to overcome the random initialization deficiency of the typical ELM, and successfully obtain higher prediction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods. To verify the efficiency of the proposed model, we apply it to Lozi and Tent chaotic time series simulations and measured traffic flow time series experiments.

  abstract     = {Group decision-making (GDM) implies a process of extracting wisdom from a group of experts. In this study, a novel GDM model is proposed by applying the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to simulate the consensus process within a group of experts. It is assumed that the initial positions of decision-makers (DMs) are characterized by pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs). The minimum and maximum of the entries in the same locations of individual PCMs are supposed to be the constraints of DMs’ opinions. The novelty comes with the construction of the optimization problem by considering the group consensus and the consistency degree of the collective PCM. The former is to minimize the distance between the collective PCM and each individual one. The latter is to make the collective PCM be acceptably consistent in virtue of the geometric consistency index. The fitness function used in the PSO algorithm is the linear combination of the two objectives. The proposed model is applied to solve a large-scale GDM problem arising in emergency management. Some comparisons with the existing methods reveal that the developed model has the advantages to decrease the order of an optimization problem and reach a fast yet effective solution.},

  abstract     = {Many-objective optimization problems with degenerate Pareto fronts are hard to solve for most existing many-objective evolutionary algorithms. This is particularly true when the shape of the degenerate Pareto front is very narrow, and there are many dominated solutions near the Pareto front. To solve this particular class of many-objective optimization problems, a new evolutionary algorithm is proposed in this paper. In this algorithm, a set of reference vectors is generated to locate the potential Pareto front and then generate a set of location vectors. With the help of the location vectors, the solutions near the Pareto front are mapped to the hyperplane and clustered to generate more reference vectors pointing to Pareto front. This way, the location vectors are able to efficiently guide the population to converge towards the Pareto front. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined on two typical test problems with degenerate Pareto fronts, namely DTLZ5 and DTLZ6 with 5–40 objectives. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a clear advantage in dealing with this class of many-objective optimization problems. In addition, the proposed algorithm has also been successfully applied to optimization of process parameters of polyester fiber filament melt-transportation.},

In the MPSO/DD algorithm, the decomposition strategy is used to ensure the diversity of the population, and the ideal point on each reference vector can draw the population converge faster to the optimal front. The position of each individual will be updated by learning the demonstrators in its neighborhood that have less distance to the ideal point along the reference vector. Eight state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-/many-objective optimization algorithms are adopted to compare the performance with MPSO/DD for solving many-objective optimization problems. The experimental results on seven DTLZ test problems with 3, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 objectives, respectively, show the efficiency of our proposed method on solving problems with high-dimensional objective space.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous and intelligent system show a remarkable step in urban traffic management. Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) is an outstanding example of using an autonomous vehicle and wireless communication technology. The traffic performance of a single AIM system has been proved in many works however, traffic in the network of multiple AIMs is waiting for an implementation. Coordination of traffic between intersections in the network is an important step of managing the overall networked traffic throughput. The authors modeled the traffic network with the multi-agents concept and used the discrete consensus algorithm to coordinate between autonomous agents and implemented the rerouting algorithm in order to distribute the excessive traffics to neighbored intersections with the optimal condition. Our target is to have a balance traffic in each intersection and reaches the equilibrium where the stability has been not compromised. The results show that reaching consensus condition will bring the networked traffic to an equilibrium state where a peak traffic will not be happened. In addition, this method shows that when traffic in a network reached consensus, it will also converge to the Nash equilibrium in the finite time.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven decision-making ($$\mathrm {D^3}$$M) is often confronted by the problem of uncertainty or unknown dynamics in streaming data. To provide real-time accurate decision solutions, the systems have to promptly address changes in data distribution in streaming data—a phenomenon known as concept drift. Past data patterns may not be relevant to new data when a data stream experiences significant drift, thus to continue using models based on past data will lead to poor prediction and poor decision outcomes. This position paper discusses the basic framework and prevailing techniques in streaming type big data and concept drift for $$\mathrm {D^3}$$M. The study first establishes a technical framework for real-time $$\mathrm {D^3}$$M under concept drift and details the characteristics of high-volume streaming data. The main methodologies and approaches for detecting concept drift and supporting $$\mathrm {D^3}$$M are highlighted and presented. Lastly, further research directions, related methods and procedures for using streaming data to support decision-making in concept drift environments are identified. We hope the observations in this paper could support researchers and professionals to better understand the fundamentals and research directions of $$\mathrm {D^3}$$M in streamed big data environments.},

In this paper, a novel collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on user correlation and evolutionary clustering is presented. Firstly, score matrix is pre-processed with normalization and dimension reduction, to obtain denser score data. Based on these processed data, clustering principle is generated and dynamic evolutionary clustering is implemented. Secondly, the search for the nearest neighbors with highest similar interest is considered. A measurement about the relationship between users is proposed, called user correlation, which applies the satisfaction of users and the potential information. In each user group, user correlation is applied to choose the nearest neighbors to predict ratings. The proposed method is evaluated using the Movielens dataset. Diversity experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has outstanding performance in predicted accuracy and recommended precision.},

A new clustering algorithm has been designed and applied specifically for clustering 1D elementary cellular automata behaviour using the prediction by partial matching (PPM) compression scheme, with the results gathered to find interesting behaviours. This new algorithm is then compared with other clustering algorithms in Weka and the new algorithm is found to be more effective at grouping behaviour that is visually similar in output. Using PPM compression, the rate of change of the cross-entropy with respect to time is calculated. These values are used in combination with a clustering algorithm, such as k-means, to create a new set of clusters for cellular automata. An analysis of the data in each cluster is then used to determine if a cluster can be classed as interesting. The clustering algorithm itself was able to find unusual behaviours, such as rules 167 and 181 which have output that is slightly different from all the other Sierpiński Triangle-like patterns, because their apexes are off-centre by one cell. When comparing the new algorithm with other established ones, it was discovered that the new algorithm was more effective in its ability to group interesting and unusual cellular automata behaviours together.},

In the proposed methodology, at first FGM is applied to aggregate multiple experts’ opinions on the relative importance of a critical factor. Then, ACO is applied to derive the absolute fuzzy importance level of the critical factor. At last, FWA is applied to assess the sustainability of the smart technology application to mobile health care. The proposed methodology has been applied to assess the sustainability of thirteen smart technology applications to mobile health care. According to the experimental results, the most and least sustainable smart technology applications to mobile health care were smart mobile service and smart clothes, respectively. In addition, the ranking result using the proposed methodology was somewhat different from those using existing methods based on approximation.},

A collection of experimental database was applied to train and test the proposed system. This database includes 82 spiral-reinforced concrete columns (with flexure failure) which were reported in the literature and modified by PEER as a uniform database of cantilever columns. The model is created by fuzzy C-means algorithm with four cluster and Gaussian membership functions, also trained and tested by 70 and 12 datasets, respectively.

The complexity of the assessment process is due to lack of clarity on how to compare the cost of adaptation of an existing component versus the cost of developing it from scratch. Indeed, often pursuit of reuse can lead to excessive rework and adaptation, or developing suites of components that often get neglected. This paper is an important step towards modelling the complex reuse assessment process. To assess the success factors that can underpin reuse, we analyze the cognitive factors that belie developers’ behavior during their decision-making when attempting to reuse. This analysis is the first building block of a broader aim to synthesize a framework to institute activities during the software development lifecycle to support reuse.},

The drawback with current methods is that while finding semantic relatedness between input text and query, in general they do not consider the sense of the words present in the input text sentences and the query. However, this particular method can enhance the summary quality as it finds the correct sense of each word of a sentence with respect to the context of the sentence. The correct sense for each word is being used while finding semantic relatedness between input text and query.

Key point is to weight moving vectors according to their reliability when a convergence point is calculated instead of equal weighting of the original method. We propose two different methods to evaluate the reliability of moving vectors. The first approach uses the fitness gradient information between starting points and terminal points of moving vectors for their weights. When a fitness gradient is bigger, the direction of a moving vector may have more potential, and a higher weight is given to it. The second one uses the fitness of parents, i.e., starting points of moving vectors, to give weights for moving vectors. Because an individual with higher fitness may have a high probability of being close to the optimal area, it should be given a higher weight, vice versa. If the estimated point is better than the worst individual in current population, it is used as an elite individual and replace the worst one to accelerate the convergence of evolutionary algorithms. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we employ differential evolution and particle swarm optimization as baseline algorithms in our evaluation experiments and run them on 28 benchmark functions from CEC 2013. The experimental results confirmed that introducing weights can further improve the accuracy of an estimated convergence point, which helps to make EC search faster.

The significance of these concepts lies in the fact that these concepts assigned membership grades from unit circle in plane, i.e., in the form of a complex number instead from [0, 1] interval. CFS cannot deal with information of yes and no type, while CIFS works only for a limited range of values. To deal with these kinds of problems, in this article, the concept of complex Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS) is developed. The novelty of CPFS lies in its larger range comparative to CFS and CIFS which is demonstrated numerically. It is discussed how a CFS and CIFS could be CPFS but not conversely. We investigated the very basic concepts of CPFSs and studied their properties. Furthermore, some distance measures for CPFSs are developed and their characteristics are studied. The viability of the proposed new distance measures in a building material recognition problem is also discussed. Finally, a comparative study of the proposed new work is established with pre-existing study and some advantages of CPFS are discussed over CFS and CIFS.},

  abstract     = {As an intelligent search optimization technique, genetic algorithm (GA) is an important approach for non-deterministic polynomial (NP-hard) and complex nature optimization problems. GA has some internal weakness such as premature convergence and low computation efficiency, etc. Improving the performance of GA is a vital topic for complex nature optimization problems. The selection operator is a crucial strategy in GA, because it has a vital role in exploring the new areas of the search space and converges the algorithm, as well. The fitness proportional selection scheme has essence exploitation and the linear rank selection is influenced by exploration. In this article, we proposed a new selection scheme which is the optimal combination of exploration and exploitation. This eliminates the fitness scaling issue and adjusts the selection pressure throughout the selection phase. The $$\chi ^2$$ goodness-of-fit test is used to measure the average accuracy, i.e., mean difference between the actual and expected number of offspring. A comparison of the performance of the proposed scheme along with some conventional selection procedures was made using TSPLIB instances. The application of this new operator gives much more effective results regarding the average and standard deviation values. In addition, a two-tailed t test is established and its values showed the significantly improved performance by the proposed scheme. Thus, the new operator is suitable and comparable to established selection for the problems related to traveling salesman problem using GA.},
