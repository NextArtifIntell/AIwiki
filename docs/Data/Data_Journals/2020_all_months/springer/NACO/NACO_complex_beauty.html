  abstract     = {The staggered quantum walk (SQW) model is defined by partitioning the graph into cliques, which are called polygons. We analyze the role that the size of the polygon intersection plays on the dynamics of SQWs on graphs. We introduce two processes (intersection reduction and intersection expansion), that change the number of vertices in some intersection of polygons, and we compare the behavior of the SQW on the reduced or expanded graph in relation to the SQW on the original graph. We describe how the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the evolution operators relate to each other. This processes can help to establish the equivalence between SQWs on different graphs and to simplify the analysis of SQWs. We also show an example of a SQW on a graph that is not included in Szegedy’s model, but which is equivalent to an instance of Szegedy’s model after applying the intersection reduction.},

  abstract     = {In complexity theory, there is a widely studied grouping of optimization problems that belongs to the non-deterministic polynomial-time hard set. One of them is the set covering problem, known as one of Karp’s 21 $${\mathscr {NP}}$$ -complete problems, and it consists of finding a subset of decision variables for satisfying a set of constraints at the minimum feasible cost. However, due to the nature of the problem, this cannot be solved using traditional complete algorithms for hard instances. In this work, we present an improved binary version of the monkey search algorithm for solving the set covering problem. Originally, this approximate method was naturally inspired by the cognitive behavior of monkeys for climbing mountains. We propose a new climbing process with a better exploratory capability and a new cooperation procedure to reduce the number of unfeasible solutions. For testing this approach, we present a detailed computational results section, where we illustrate how this variation of the monkey search algorithm is capable of reaching various global optimums for a well-known instance set from the Beasley’s OR-Library and how it outperforms many other heuristics and meta-heuristics addressed in the literature. Moreover, we add a complete statistical analysis to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to the original version.},

The Turing Tumble has a strict constraint, based on gravity, since signals can only move from top to bottom. We introduce a uniform scheme that takes into account this restriction in directionality to construct universal machines in the TTM based on directed acyclic graphs.

In this study, the ranges of angular position of lower limb joints are confined and the velocity of swing foot is zero when it touches the ground, which result in the construction of the impactless planar bipedal model. Motion/force control scheme combined with genetic algorithm (GA) is used to ensure stability and low energy cost of bipedal walking at different speeds. The optimized parameters of gaits are obtained by GA, which include walking speed, step length and the maximum height of swing ankle joint. The results demonstrate that more energy is consumed when the optimal walking speed increases for the biped walking on slopes with the same gradient. There are no great differences in optimal step length of the biped when the walking speed changes. The optimal step length declines as the slope increases at the same walking speed. The ankle torques of standing leg have higher values in single support phase at fast speed compared to those at slow and normal speeds. Modifications of boundary conditions can not only be used to realize the stable walking for the biped negotiating slopes, but also be applied to analyze bipedal gaits for walking on stairs and uneven surfaces.},

To overcome the inefficiency of computational fluid dynamics software during the optimization process and the limitations of traditional single-objective optimization, a novel strategy combining genetic expression programming and crowding distance based multi-objective particle swarm algorithm is presented. Its central idea is as follows, several underwater vehicle shapes are analysed to obtain their water resistances and determine the best underwater robot shape. Shape factor of the bow and shape factor of the stern are employed as design variables, and sample points are selected by the optimal latin hypercube design. Then gene expression programming method is used to establish the surrogate model of resistance and surrounded volume. After that, the surrogate model based on the gene expression programming method is compared with that based on the surface respond method. The results show the superiority of the GEP method. Then the resistance and surrounded volume are set as two optimized variables and Pareto optimal solutions are obtained by using multi-objective particle swarm algorithm. Finally, the optimization results are compared with the hydrodynamic calculations, which shows the method proposed in the paper can greatly reduce the cost of computation and improve the efficiency of optimal shape design for underwater vehicle.},

For the purpose of intentional electromagnetic interference, it is necessary to realise the efficient suppression of other receivers at little cost. When multiple transmitting sources are used to interfere with multiple receivers, the parameters of multiple transmitting sources are required to be comprehensively optimised and set so as to achieve a desired high-efficiency interference. Therefore, we propose a novel method to optimise the setting of parameters of a multi-source, multi-object and multi-domain (M-SOD) interference system based on intelligent optimisation approaches. Furthermore, this study also builds an intelligent optimisation model, which contains multiple transmitters and receivers which involved many parameters include position, direction of space domain, frequency, bandwidth, and power. Then the model is abstracted to the problem of single-objective optimisation with constraints and optimised through a traditional GA and an improved FWA method. The extensive experiments and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm is an effective approach for setting the parameters of an M-SOD electromagnetic interference system and superior to the conventional method.},

By comparing with the previously generated population at the last generation, two new groups are generated according to the updating methods. Based on the alternative mutation method, the population is updated by the alternative selection according to the evaluation functions. To enhance the diversity of the population, the strategies of re-mutation, crossover, and selection are conducted throughout the optimization process. Each individual conducts the correspondent mutation and crossover strategies according to the parameter values randomly selected, and the parameter values of scaling factor and crossover probability will be updated accordingly throughout the iterations. Numerous simulations on twenty-five benchmark functions have been conducted, which indicates the proposed algorithm outperforms some well-exploited algorithms (i.e. inertia weight PSO, comprehensive learning PSO, and DE) and recently proposed algorithms (i.e. DE with the ensemble of parameters and mutation strategies and ensemble PSO).},

In consideration of the difficulty in solving the AGVs path planning problem because of NP-hard computational complexity, this approach combines the advantages of quantum theory and ant colony algorithm to obtain feasible, conflict-free, and optimal paths. To expand the search space, the pheromones on paths are coded according to Bloch coordinates. To make full use of the pheromones of three-dimensional Bloch coordinates, they are chosen with certain probabilities in accordance with the paths they obtained. Repulsions among AGVs are supposed to exist to avoid conflicts. A repulsion factor is employed in the state transition rule to increase the space–time distance among AGVs as much as possible. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with those of the other three methods in simulation of AGVs path planning at an automated container terminal. Simulation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The scheduling problems for airport baggage transport vehicles are much influential to the quality of airport service. An optimal scheduling is very helpful to provide an efficient and safe airport operation and improve customers’ experience. To address the issue, in this paper, a novel genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for the vehicles scheduling. To enhance the exploitation ability of GA, the algorithm is improved by considering both population diversity and population fitness simultaneously. In the proposed GA, a cooperative mechanism is employed to design the selection operation for genetic algorithm where both exploitation ability and exploration ability can be considered. Numerical experiments are conducted on widely used benchmarks, and several peer meta-heuristic algorithms are also used in performance comparison. To address the airport baggage transport vehicle scheduling problem, real data is adopted in the proposed algorithm for simulation. According to simulation results, the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective to obtain competitive performance and the airport baggage transport vehicles scheduling problem in is well addressed.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and explore a type of discrete dynamic system inheriting some properties of both cellular automata (CA) and L-systems. Originally suggested by Jean Della Dora, and thus called DEM-systems after him and the two current authors, these systems can have the structural flexibility of an L-system as well as algebraic properties of CA. They are defined as sequences on a one-dimensional loop with rules governing dynamics in which new sites can be created, depending on the states of a neighbourhood of sites, and complex behaviour can be generated. Although the definition of DEM-systems is quite broad, we define some subclasses, for which more complete results can be obtained. For example, we define an additive subclass, for which algebraic results on asymptotic growth are possible, and an elementary class of particularly simple rules, for which nevertheless impressive complexity is achievable. Unlike for CA, finite initial sequences can produce positive spatial entropy over time. However, even in cases where the entropy is zero, considerable complexity is possible, especially when the sequence length grows to infinity, and we demonstrate and study behaviours of DEM-systems including fragmentation of sequences, self-reproducing patterns, self-similar but irregular patterns, patterns that not only produce new sites but produce producers of new sites, and sequences whose growth rate is sublinear, linear, quadratic, cubic, or exponential. The most complex behaviour from small finite initial conditions and the simplest class of rules appear to have positive entropy, a suggestion for which we have so far only stong numerical evidence, though we present a proof for these ‘elementary’ DEM-systems that entropy cannot reach the theoretical maximum of 1.},

The evolution of species’ concentrations over time well matches the transient solutions of the target continuous-time Markov chain, while equilibrium concentrations can indicate the steady state probabilities. Additionally, second-order Markov chains are considered for implementation, with bimolecular reactions rather than unary ones.

A classical real world system will be viewed as a composition of quantum systems, where any observable measurement process of the real world data are created from an expected value measure of a quantum system state. In this projection measure a quantum phase information is naturally lost, making the inverse mapping from the classical space into quantum space impossible. However, it is possible find an arbitrate quantum state that represents the same classical information originally measured. A genetic algorithm is employed for search this arbitrate quantum state, going back from classical world to quantum world representation. The genetic algorithm searches for a compatible quantum state with the real world data, where the lost quantum phase is adjusted with the constraints to minimize the classes’ variance and to maximize the distance between the classes’ centroids. Computational simulations shown that the proposed methodology was able to transform a non linearly separable problem in classical representation space into a linearly separable problem in the quantum representation space, demonstrating an enhancement of data discrimination power.},

K-means and Agglomerative clustering algorithms, as well as, the Artificial Bee Colony and Cuckoo Search swarm-based algorithms were selected for comparison. The proposed swarm-based algorithms achieved better accuracy using the word bigram feature model as the pre-processing technique, the Global Silhouette as optimization function, and on datasets with two classes: positive and negative. Although the swarm-based algorithms obtained lower result for datasets with three classes, they are still competitive considering that neither labeled data, nor opinion lexicons are required for the opinion clustering approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the concept of extended Choquet integral generalized by a copula, called CC-integral. In particular, we adopt a CC-integral that uses a copula defined by a parameter $$\alpha $$ , which behavior was tested in a previous work using different fixed values. In this contribution, we propose an extension of this method by learning the best value for the parameter $$\alpha $$ using a genetic algorithm. This new proposal is applied in the fuzzy reasoning method of fuzzy rule-based classification systems in such a way that, for each class, the most suitable value of the parameter $$\alpha $$ is obtained, which can lead to an improvement on the system’s performance. In the experimental study, we test the performance of 4 different so called $$C_{\alpha }C$$ -integrals, comparing the results obtained when using fixed values for the parameter $$\alpha $$ against the results provided by our new evolutionary approach. From the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that the genetic learning of the parameter $$\alpha $$ is statistically superior than the fixed one for two copulas. Moreover, in general, the accuracy achieved in test is superior than that of the fixed approach in all functions. We also compare the quality of this approach with related approaches, showing that the methodology proposed in this work provides competitive results. Therefore, we demonstrate that $$C_{\alpha }C$$ -integrals with $$\alpha $$ learned genetically can be considered as a good alternative to be used in fuzzy rule-based classification systems.},

  abstract     = {Clustering algorithms have been applied to different problems in many different real-word applications. Nevertheless, each algorithm has its own advantages and drawbacks, which can result in different solutions for the same problem. Therefore, the combination of different clustering algorithms (cluster ensembles) has emerged as an attempt to overcome the limitations of each clustering technique. The use of cluster ensembles aims to combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution (consensus partition). Recently, several approaches have been proposed in the literature in order to optimize or to improve continuously the solutions found by the cluster ensembles. As a contribution to this important subject, this paper presents an investigation of five bio-inspired techniques in the optimization of cluster ensembles (Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, Ant Colony Optimization, Coral Reefs Optimization and Bee Colony Optimization). In this investigation, unlike most of the existing work, an evaluation methodology for assessing three important aspects of cluster ensembles will be presented, assessing robustness, novelty and stability of the consensus partition delivered by different optimization algorithms. In order to evaluate the feasibility of the analyzed techniques, an empirical analysis will be conducted using 20 different problems and applying two different indexes in order to examine its efficiency and feasibility. Our findings indicated that the best population-based optimization method was PSO, followed by CRO, AG, BCO and ACO, for providing robust and stable consensus partitions.},

  abstract     = {Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) has been widely studied over the years due to its competitive results in different applications. However, its performance is dependent on some design components (e.g., inertia factor, velocity equation, topology). Thus, to define which is the best algorithm design to solve a given optimization problem is difficult due to the large number of variations and parameters that can be considered. This work proposes a novel context-free grammar for Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (GGGP) algorithms to guide the creation of Particle Swarm Optimizers. The proposed grammar considers four aspects of the PSO algorithm that may strongly impact on its performance: swarm initialization, neighborhood topology, velocity update equation and mutation operator. To assess the proposal, a GGGP algorithm was set with the proposed grammar and employed to optimize the PSO algorithm in 32 unconstrained continuous optimization problems. In the experiments, we compared the algorithms generated from the proposed grammar with those algorithms produced by two other grammars presented in the literature to automate PSO designs. The results achieved by the proposed grammar were better than the counterparts. Besides, we also compared the generated algorithms to 6 competition algorithms with different strategies. The experiments have shown that the algorithms generated from the grammar reached better results.},

Consequently, the reusability, scalability and maintainability became fundamental concerns in the development of such algorithms. To this end, the use of design patterns (DPs) can benefit, ease and improve the design of MOEAs. DPs are reusable solutions for common design problems, which can be applied to almost any context. Despite their advantages to decrease coupling, increase flexibility, and allow an easier design extension, DPs have been underexplored for MOEA design. In order to contribute to this research topic, we propose a pattern-driven solution for the design of MOEAs. The MOEA designed with our solution is compared to another MOEA designed without it. The comparison considered: the Integration and Test Order (ITO) problem and the Traveling Salesman problem (TSP). Obtained results show that the use of this DP-driven solution allows the reuse of MOEA components, without decreasing the quality, in terms of hypervolume. This means that the developer can extend the algorithms to include other components using only object-oriented mechanisms in an easier way, while maintaining the expected results.},

The algorithm combines both probabilistic and exact techniques. The former implements the bio-inspired approach based on the behaviour of ants in the nature when searching for food together with simulated annealing principles. The latter complements the former. The algorithm explores the search space in a finite number of iterations. In each iteration, the deterministic local optimization process may be used to improve the current solution. Firstly, the key parts and features of the algorithm are presented, especially in connection with the exact optimization process. Next, the article deals with the results of experiments on MDVRP problems conducted to verify the quality of the algorithm; moreover, these results are compared to other state-of-the-art methods. As experiments, Cordreau’s benchmark instances were used. The experiments showed that the proposed algorithm overcomes the other methods as it has the smallest average error (the difference between the found solution and the best known solution) on the entire set of benchmark instances.},

  abstract     = {Assistive robots need to be able to perform a large number of tasks that imply some type of cloth manipulation. These tasks include domestic chores such as laundry handling or bed-making, among others, as well as dressing assistance to disabled users. Due to the deformable nature of fabrics, this manipulation requires a strong perceptual feedback. Common perceptual skills that enable robots to complete their cloth manipulation tasks are reviewed here, mainly relying on vision, but also resorting to touch and force. The use of such basic skills is then examined in the context of the different cloth manipulation tasks, be them garment-only applications in the line of performing domestic chores, or involving physical contact with a human as in dressing assistance.},

  abstract     = {Synthetic biology is a rapidly emerging research area, with expected wide-ranging impact in biology, nanofabrication, and medicine. A key technical challenge lies in embedding computation in molecular contexts where electronic micro-controllers cannot be inserted. This necessitates effective representation of computation using molecular components. While previous work established the Turing-completeness of chemical reactions, defining representations that are faithful, efficient, and practical remains challenging . This paper introduces CRN++, a new language for programming deterministic (mass-action) chemical kinetics to perform computation. We present its syntax and semantics, and build a compiler translating CRN++ programs into chemical reactions, thereby laying the foundation of a comprehensive framework for molecular programming. Our language addresses the key challenge of embedding familiar imperative constructs into a set of chemical reactions happening simultaneously and manipulating real-valued concentrations. Although some deviation from ideal output value cannot be avoided, we develop methods to minimize the error, and implement error analysis tools. We demonstrate the feasibility of using CRN++on a suite of well-known algorithms for discrete and real-valued computation. CRN++ can be easily extended to support new commands or chemical reaction implementations, and thus provides a foundation for developing more robust and practical molecular programs.},

As a first step towards developing a general framework for these problems, we consider the problem of rearranging a connected set of hexagonal tiles by a single deterministic finite automaton. After investigating some limitations of a single-robot system, we show that a feasible approach to build a particular shape is to first rearrange the tiles into an intermediate structure by performing very simple tile movements. We introduce three types of such intermediate structures, each having certain advantages and disadvantages. Each of these structures can be built in asymptotically optimal $$O(n^2)$$ rounds, where n is the number of tiles. As a proof of concept, we give an algorithm for reconfiguring a set of tiles into an equilateral triangle through one of the intermediate structures. Finally, we experimentally show that the algorithm for building the simplest of the three intermediate structures can be modified to be executed by multiple robots in a distributed manner, achieving an almost linear speedup in the case where the number of robots is reasonably small, and explain how the algorithm can be used to construct a triangle distributedly.},

We then show that in a related model which allows for hierarchical self-assembly, the 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), there does exist a tile assembly system which self-assembles the “U” fractal and conjecture that the same holds for the “H” fractal. This is the first example of discrete self similar fractals which self-assemble in the 2HAM but not in the aTAM, providing a direct comparison of the models and greater understanding of the power of hierarchical assembly.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembly is a process which is ubiquitous in natural, especially biological systems. It occurs when groups of relatively simple components spontaneously combine to form more complex structures. While such systems have inspired a large amount of research into designing theoretical models of self-assembling systems, and even laboratory-based implementations of them, these artificial models and systems often tend to be lacking in one of the powerful features of natural systems (e.g. the assembly and folding of proteins), which is dynamic reconfigurability of structures. In this paper, we present a new mathematical model of self-assembly, based on the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), called the Flexible Tile Assembly Model (FTAM). In the FTAM, the individual components are 2-dimensional tiles as in the aTAM, but in the FTAM, bonds between the edges of tiles can be flexible, allowing bonds to flex and entire structures to reconfigure, thus allowing 2-dimensional components to form 3-dimensional structures. We analyze the powers and limitations of FTAM systems by (1) demonstrating how flexibility can be controlled to carefully build desired structures, and (2) showing how flexibility can be beneficially harnessed to form structures which can “efficiently” reconfigure into many different configurations and/or greatly varying configurations. We also show that with such power comes a heavy burden in terms of computational complexity of simulation and prediction by proving that for important properties of FTAM systems, determining their existence is intractable, even for properties which are easily computed for systems in less dynamic models.},

We prove in particular that these networks have the same computational power than the classical ones, i.e. any Boolean network with firing memory composed of m vertices can be simulated by a Boolean network by adding vertices. We also prove general results on specific classes of networks. For instance, we show that the existence of at least one delay greater than 1 in disjunctive networks makes such networks have only fixed points as attractors. Moreover, for arbitrary networks composed of two vertices, we characterize the delay phase space, i.e. the delay values such that networks admits limit cycles or fixed points. Finally, we analyze two classical biological models by introducing delays: the model of the immune control of the $$\lambda $$-phage and that of the genetic control of the floral morphogenesis of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.},

Extending this work, we study the impact of a larger alphabet, which also allows a meaningful inference of the behaviour of the resultant CA from the asymptotic behaviour of the maxmin-$$\omega$$ update system. Far from being a straightforward positive correlation between complexity and alphabet size, we show that there is a region of $$\omega$$ and alphabet size where complexity of CA is maximal. Thus, despite employing a fixed CA rule, the complexity of this CA can be controlled by $$\omega$$ and alphabet size. The main message is that the effect of maxmin-$$\omega$$ updating on the state of a network can be well understood, especially if the state alphabet is counter-intuitively large.},

Angluin, Aspnes, and Eisenstat proposed a simple population protocol for Approximate Majority and proved correctness and $$O(\log n)$$ time efficiency with high probability, given an initial gap of size $$\omega (\sqrt{n}\log n)$$ when the total molecular count in the mixture is n. Motivated by their intriguing but complex proof, we provide a new analysis of several CRNs for Approximate Majority, starting with a very simple tri-molecular protocol with just two reactions and two species. We obtain simple analyses of three bi-molecular protocols, including that of Angluin et al., by showing how they emulate the tri-molecular protocol. Our results improve on those of Angluin et al. in that they hold even with an initial gap of $$\varOmega (\sqrt{n \log n})$$. We prove that our tri-molecular CRN is robust even when there is some uncertainty in the reaction rates, when some molecules are Byzantine (i.e., adversarial), or when activation of molecules is triggered by epidemic. We also analyse a natural variant of our tri-molecular protocol for the more general problem of multi-valued consensus. Our analysis approach, which leverages the simplicity of a tri-molecular CRN to ultimately reason about these many variants, may be useful in analysing other CRNs too.},

The population is randomly divided into three equally sized sub-populations, each with different mutation strategies. At the end of each generation, all sub-populations are updated independently and recombined. Each sub-population uses an adaptive mechanism for selecting how current generation control parameters are generated. An improved mutation strategy, “rand assemble/1”, is proposed, its base vector is composed proportionally of three randomly selected individuals. The performance of SAMDE is evaluated on the suite of CEC 2005 benchmark functions. A comparative study is carried out with other state-of-the-art optimization techniques. The results show that SAMDE has a competitive performance compared to several other efficient DE variants.},

  abstract     = {We present a panorama of the convergence properties of the 256 Elementary Cellular Automata under fully asynchronous updating, that is, when only one cell is updated at each time step. We regroup here various results which have been presented in different articles and expose a full analysis of the behaviour of finite systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our classification relies on the scaling properties of the average convergence time to a fixed point. We observe that different scaling laws can be found, which fall in one of the following classes: logarithmic, linear, quadratic, exponential and non-converging. The techniques for quantifying this behaviour rely mainly on Markov chain theory and martingales. Most behaviours can be studied analytically but there are still many rules for which obtaining a formal characterisation of their convergence properties is still an open problem.},

  abstract     = {Causal Graph Dynamics extend Cellular Automata to arbitrary time-varying graphs of bounded degree. The whole graph evolves in discrete time steps, and this global evolution is required to have a number of symmetries: shift-invariance (it acts everywhere the same) and causality (information has a bounded speed of propagation). We add a further physics-like symmetry, namely reversibility. In particular, we extend two fundamental results on reversible cellular automata, by proving that the inverse of a causal graph dynamics is a causal graph dynamics, and that these reversible causal graph dynamics can be represented as finite-depth circuits of local reversible gates. We also show that reversible causal graph dynamics preserve the size of all but a finite number of graphs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we address the issue of automatically learning parameters of spiking neural networks. Biological neurons are formalized as timed automata and synaptical connections are represented as shared channels among these automata. Such a formalism allows us to take into account several time-related aspects, such as the influence of past inputs in the computation of the potential value of each neuron, or the presence of the refractory period, a lapse of time immediately following the spike emission in which the neuron cannot emit. The proposed model is then formally validated: more precisely, we ensure that some relevant properties expressed as temporal logical formulae hold in the model. Once the validation step is accomplished, we take advantage of the proposed model to write an algorithm for learning synaptical weight values such that an expected behavior can be displayed. The technique we present takes inspiration from supervised learning ones: we compare the effective output of the network to the expected one and backpropagate proper corrective actions in the network. We develop several case studies including a mutual inhibition network.},

  abstract     = {One of the more common healthcare associated infection is Chronic diarrhea. This disease is caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile which alters the normal composition of the human gut flora. The most successful therapy against this infection is the fecal microbial transplant (FMT). They displace C. difficile and contribute to gut microbiome resilience, stability and prevent further episodes of diarrhea. The microorganisms in the FMT their interactions and inner dynamics reshape the gut microbiome to a healthy state. Even though microbial interactions play a key role in the development of the disease, currently, little is known about their dynamics and properties. In this context, a Boolean network model for C. difficile infection (CDI) describing one set of possible interactions was recently presented. To further explore the space of possible microbial interactions, we propose the construction of a neutral space conformed by a set of models that differ in their interactions, but share the final community states of the gut microbiome under antibiotic perturbation and CDI. To begin with the analysis, we use the previously described Boolean network model and we demonstrate that this model is in fact a threshold Boolean network (TBN). Once the TBN model is set, we generate and use an evolutionary algorithm to explore to identify alternative TBNs. We organize the resulting TBNs into clusters that share similar dynamic behaviors. For each cluster, the associated neutral graph is constructed and the most relevant interactions are identified. Finally, we discuss how these interactions can either affect or prevent CDI.},

  abstract     = {Boolean networks (BNs) are widely used to model the qualitative dynamics of biological systems. Besides the logical rules determining the evolution of each component with respect to the state of its regulators, the scheduling of component updates can have a dramatic impact on the predicted behaviours. In this paper, we explore the use of Read (contextual) Petri Nets (RPNs) to study dynamics of BNs from a concurrency theory perspective. After showing bi-directional translations between RPNs and BNs and analogies between results on synchronism sensitivity, we illustrate that usual updating modes for BNs can miss plausible behaviours, i.e., incorrectly conclude on the absence/impossibility of reaching specific configurations. We propose an encoding of BNs capitalizing on the RPN semantics enabling more behaviour than the generalized asynchronous updating mode. The proposed encoding ensures a correct abstraction of any multivalued refinement, as one may expect to achieve when modelling biological systems with no assumption on its time features.},

(AUTOMATA 2017 exploratory papers proceedings, 2017), aiming at classifying elementary cellular automata (ECA) according to their maximal one-step sensitivity to changes in the schedule of cells update. It provides a complete classification of the ECA rule space for all period sizes $$n &gt; 9$$ and, together with the classification for all period sizes $$n \le 9$$ presented in Montalva et al. (Chaos Solitons Fractals 113:209–220, 2018), closes this problem and opens further questionings. Most of the 256 ECA rule’s sensitivity is proved or disproved to be maximum thanks to an automatic application of basic methods. We formalize meticulous case disjunctions that lead to the results, and patch failing cases for some rules with simple arguments. This gives new insights on the dynamics of ECA rules depending on the proof method employed, as for the last rules 45 and 105 requiring $$({\texttt{0011}})^*$$ induction patterns.},

To explore Boolean dynamics from a novel viewpoint, we will analyse the dynamics emerging from the composition of two known Boolean modules. The state transition graphs and attractors for each of the modules can be combined to construct a new asymptotic graph which will (1) provide a reliable method for attractor computation with partial information; (2) illustrate the differences in dynamical behavior induced by the updating strategy (asynchronous, synchronous, or mixed); and (3) show the inherited organization/structure of the original network’s state transition graph.},

  abstract     = {A finite dynamical system (FDS) is a system of multivariate functions over a finite alphabet, that is typically used to model a network of interacting entities. The main feature of a finite dynamical system is its interaction graph, which indicates which local functions depend on which variables; the interaction graph is a qualitative representation of the interactions amongst entities on the network. As such, a major problem is to determine the effect of the interaction graph on the dynamics of the FDS. In this paper, we are interested in three main properties of an FDS: the number of images (the so-called rank), the number of periodic points (the so-called periodic rank) and the number of fixed points. In particular, we investigate the minimum, average, and maximum number of images (or periodic points, or fixed points) of FDSs with a prescribed interaction graph and a given alphabet size; thus yielding nine quantities to study. The paper is split into two parts. The first part considers the minimum rank, for which we derive the first meaningful results known so far. In particular, we show that the minimum rank decreases with the alphabet size, thus yielding the definition of an absolute minimum rank. We obtain lower and upper bounds on this absolute minimum rank, and we give classification results for graphs with very low (or highest) rank. The second part is a comprehensive survey of the results obtained on the nine quantities described above. We not only give a review of known results, but we also give a list of relevant open questions.},

  abstract     = {In automata networks, it is well known that the way entities update their states over time has a major impact on their dynamics. In particular, depending on the chosen update schedule, the underlying dynamical systems may exhibit more or less asymptotic dynamical behaviours such as fixed points or limit cycles. Since such mathematical models have been used in the framework of biological networks modelling, the question of choosing appropriate update schedules has arised soon. In this note, focusing on Boolean networks, our aim is to emphasise that the adequate way of thinking regulations and genetic expression over time is certainly not to consider a wall segregating synchronicity from asynchronicity because they actually complement rather well. In particular, we highlight that specific update schedules, namely block-parallel update schedules, whose intrinsic features are still not known from a theoretical point of view, admit realistic and pertinent properties in the context of biological modelling and deserve certainly more attention from the community.},
