  abstract     = {Clustering being an unsupervised learning technique, has been used extensively for knowledge discovery due to its less dependency on domain knowledge. Many clustering techniques were proposed in the literature to recognize the cluster of different characteristics. Most of them become inadequate either due to their dependency on user-defined parameters or when they are applied on multi-scale datasets. Hybrid clustering techniques have been proposed to take the advantage of both Partitional and Hierarchical techniques by first partitioning the dataset into several dense sub-clusters and merging them into actual clusters. However, the universality of the partition and merging criteria are not sufficient to capture many characteristics of the clusters. Minimum spanning tree (MST) has been used extensively for clustering because it preserves the intrinsic nature of the dataset even after the sparsification of the graph. In this paper, we propose a parameter-free, minimum spanning tree based efficient hybrid clustering algorithm to cluster the multi-scale datasets. In the first phase, we construct a MST of the dataset to capture the neighborhood information of data points and employ box-plot, an outlier detection technique on MST edge weights for effectively selecting the inconsistent edges to partition the data points into several dense sub-clusters. In the second phase, we propose a novel merging criterion to find the genuine clusters by iteratively merging only the pairs of adjacent sub-clusters. The merging technique involves both dis-connectivity and intra-similarity using the topology of two adjacent pairs which helps to identify the arbitrary shape and varying density clusters. Experiment results on various synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over other popular clustering algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs have become a popular formalism for representing entities and their properties using a graph data model, e.g., the Resource Description Framework (RDF). An RDF graph comprises entities of the same type connected to objects or other entities using labeled edges annotated with properties. RDF graphs usually contain entities that share the same objects in a certain group of properties, i.e., they match star patterns composed of these properties and objects. In case the number of these entities or properties in these star patterns is large, the size of the RDF graph and query processing are negatively impacted; we refer these star patterns as frequent star patterns. We address the problem of identifying frequent star patterns in RDF graphs and devise the concept of factorized RDF graphs, which denote compact representations of RDF graphs where the number of frequent star patterns is minimized. We also develop computational methods to identify frequent star patterns and generate a factorized RDF graph, where compact RDF molecules replace frequent star patterns. A compact RDF molecule of a frequent star pattern denotes an RDF subgraph that instantiates the corresponding star pattern. Instead of having all the entities matching the original frequent star pattern, a surrogate entity is added and related to the properties of the frequent star pattern; it is linked to the entities that originally match the frequent star pattern. Since the edges between the entities and the objects in the frequent star pattern are replaced by edges between these entities and the surrogate entity of the compact RDF molecule, the size of the RDF graph is reduced. We evaluate the performance of our factorization techniques on several RDF graph benchmarks and compare with a baseline built on top gSpan, a state-of-the-art algorithm to detect frequent patterns. The outcomes evidence the efficiency of proposed approach and show that our techniques are able to reduce execution time of the baseline approach in at least three orders of magnitude. Additionally, RDF graph size can be reduced by up to 66.56% while data represented in the original RDF graph is preserved.},

In this paper, we attempt to thoroughly analyze crime predictors from three Web open data sources: Google Street View (GSV), Twitter, and Foursquare, which provides visual, textual, and human behavioral data respectively. In contrast to existing works that attempt crime prediction at zip-code level or coarser granularity, we focus on street-level crime prediction. We transform data assigned to street-segments, and extract and determine strong predictors correlated with crime. Particularly, we are the first to discover visual clues on street outlooks that are predictive for crime. We focus on the city of San Francisco, and our extensive experiments show the effectiveness of predictors in a range of tests. We show that by analyzing and selecting strong predictors in Web open data, one could achieve significantly better crime prediction accuracy, comparing to traditional demographic data-based prediction.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, domain ontologies are widely used as background knowledge bases. However, end users of ontology-based question answering (QA) systems are unaware of major concepts of ontology or the structure of domain ontology schema. Thus, it has been essential to provide an efficient method to reduce this gap. Namely, the critical issue for ontology-based QA systems is how to generate a SPARQL query from a user’s natural language query (NLQ). Therefore, we proposed a method to generate SPARQL queries from Korean natural language queries. When an input query comes in, we split it into a set of tokens and map each token to certain resources in the ontology. Subsequently, a graph generation process creates multiple “query graphs” by arranging the resources and identifying relationships between them. To identify relations between resources, we applied a path search algorithm based on the structure of domain ontology schema. We score query graphs by measuring the degree to which the graph reflected the general user’s intent, and the best-rated query graph is converted into a SPARQL query. We implemented a prototype system to evaluate the proposed method for the music domain ontology and conclude that our query conversion process can convert Korean natural language queries into semantically equivalent SPARQL queries. We anticipate that, after appropriate modification, the process can be applied to other languages.},

Its main goal is give the reader an overview of the history and the current state-of-the-art, exploring techniques and datasets used to the date, as well as identifying current challenges, such as this ambiguity of genre definitions or the introduction of human-centric approaches.

Though intuitive, translational distance models fail to deal with the circle structure and hierarchical structure in knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a general learning framework named TransX-pa, which takes various models (TransE, TransR, TransH and TransD) into consideration. From this unified viewpoint, we analyse the learning bottlenecks are: (i) the common assumption that the inverse of a relation r is modelled as its opposite − r; and (ii) the failure to capture the rich interactions between entities and relations. Correspondingly, we introduce position-aware embeddings and self-attention blocks, and show that they can be adapted to various translational distance models. Experiments are conducted on different datasets extracted from real-world knowledge graphs Freebase and WordNet in the tasks of both triplet classification and link prediction. The results show that our approach makes a great improvement, showing a better, or comparable, performance with state-of-the-art methods.},

Secondly, a Value-driven approach for the DW design is discussed. Thirdly, three realistic scenarios for integrating LOD in the DW landscape are given.

  abstract     = {Given the rapid rate at which text data are being digitally gathered in the medical domain, there is growing need for automated tools that can analyze clinical notes and classify their sentences in electronic health records (EHRs). This study uses EHR texts to detect patients’ disease history from clinical sentences. However, in EHRs, sentences are less topic-focused and shorter than that in general domain, which leads to the sparsity of co-occurrence patterns and the lack of semantic features. To tackle this challenge, current approaches for clinical sentence classification are dependent on external information to improve classification performance. However, this is implausible owing to a lack of universal medical dictionaries. This study proposes the ETM (enrichment by topic modeling) algorithm, based on latent Dirichlet allocation, to smoothen the semantic representations of short sentences. The ETM enriches text representation by incorporating probability distributions generated by an unsupervised algorithm into it. It considers the length of the original texts to enhance representation by using an internal knowledge acquisition procedure. When it comes to clinical predictive modeling, interpretability improves the acceptance of the model. Thus, for clinical sentence classification, the ETM approach employs an initial TFiDF (term frequency inverse document frequency) representation, where we use the support vector machine and neural network algorithms for the classification task. We conducted three sets of experiments on a data set consisting of clinical cardiovascular notes from the Netherlands to test the sentence classification performance of the proposed method in comparison with prevalent approaches. The results show that the proposed ETM approach outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Community question answering (cQA) has emerged as a popular service on the web; users can use it to ask and answer questions and access historical question-answer (QA) pairs. cQA retrieval, as an alternative to general web searches, has several advantages. First, user can register a query in the form of natural language sentences instead of a set of keywords; thus, they can present the required information more clearly and comprehensively. Second, the system returns several possible answers instead of a long list of ranked documents, thereby enhancing the efficient location of the desired answers. Question retrieval from a cQA archive, an essential function of cQA retrieval services, aims to retrieve historical QA pairs relevant to the query question. In this study, combined queries (combined inverted and nextword indexes) are proposed for question retrieval in cQA. The method performance is investigated for two different scenarios: (a) when only questions from QA pairs are used as documents, and (b) when QA pairs are used as documents. In the proposed method, combined indexes are first created for both queries and documents; then, different information retrieval (IR) models are used to retrieve relevant questions from the cQA archive. Evaluation is performed on a public Yahoo! Answers dataset; the results thereby obtained show that using combined queries for all three IR models (vector space model, Okapi model, and language model) improves performance in terms of the retrieval precision and ranking effectiveness. Notably, by using combined indexes when both QA pairs are used as documents, the retrieval and ranking effectiveness of these cQA retrieval models increases significantly.},

  abstract     = {Recently, language models have gained importance in the field of information retrieval. In this paper, we propose a generic language model to improve a content-based document retrieval system. In this approach, character images are extracted, clustered, and analyzed to form high-level semantic terms using a statistical document model. This model simulates the long-term relationships between characters. Documents are then indexed according to these terms, and a query document is proposed to retrieve the relevant documents. The query document can be a single keyword, or it can be synthesized from a text string. The aim is to generate a semantic representation from low-level image pixels through pattern matching and document modeling. The conventional approach of generating semantic terms in document retrieval includes every possible symbol sequence in the feature representation. Comparatively, our approach can considerably reduce the dimensions of the feature space while producing retrieval results comparable to those of the conventional and state-of-the-art approaches.},

In Information Retrieval literature, selecting expansion terms remains a challenging task that relies on the extraction of term relationships. In this paper, we propose a new learning to rank-based query expansion model. The main idea behind is that, given a query and the set of its related ARs, our model ranks these ARs according to their relevance score regarding to this query and then selects the most suitable ones to be used in the QE process. Experiments are conducted on three test collections, namely: CLEF2003, TREC-Robust and TREC-Microblog, including long, hard and short queries. Results showed that the retrieval performance can be significantly improved when the ARs ranking method is used compared to other state of the art expansion models, especially for hard and long queries.},

Current diversified expansion techniques either make use of external knowledge sources to explicitly model the various aspects and their relationships underlying the user query or implicitly model query aspects. However these techniques assume query aspects to be independent of each other. We propose a unified framework that produces diversified query expansions in a completely implicit manner while also considering the relationships between query aspects. In particular, the framework identifies query aspects and their relationships by making use of the semantic properties of context phrases that occur within the top-ranked retrieved documents for the supplied user query, and maps them onto a Mutating Markov Chain model to generate a diverse ordering of query aspects. We test our framework against a set of ambiguous and faceted queries used in the NTCIR-12 IMine-2 Task and through an extensive empirical analysis, we show that our framework consistently outperforms existing implicit diversified query expansion algorithms. The utility of our algorithm truly comes up in the second set of experiments where we generate diversified query expansions for a retrieval engine indexing documents from specific scientific domains. Even in such a niche scenario our algorithm consistently provides robust results and performs better than other implicit approaches.},

  abstract     = {Here, we present a novel algorithm for frequent itemset mining in streaming data (FIM-SD). For the past decade, various FIM-SD methods in one-pass approximation settings that allow to approximate the support of each itemset have been proposed. They can be categorized into two approximation types: parameter-constrained (PC) mining and resource-constrained (RC) mining. PC methods control the maximum error that can be included in the approximate support based on a pre-defined parameter. In contrast, RC methods limit the maximum memory consumption based on resource constraints. However, the existing PC methods can exponentially increase the memory consumption, while the existing RC methods can rapidly increase the maximum error. In this study, we address this problem by introducing a hybrid approach of PC-RC approximations, called PARASOL. For any streaming data, PARASOL ensures to provide a condensed representation, called a Δ-covered set, which is regarded as an extension of the closedness compression; when Δ = 0, the solution corresponds to the ordinary closed itemsets. PARASOL searches for such approximate closed itemsets that can restore the frequent itemsets and their supports while the maximum error is bounded by an integer, Δ. Then, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art PC and RC methods for FIM-SD.},

  abstract     = {With the progressive increase in the number of existing ontologies, ontology matching became a challenging task. Ontology matching is a crucial step in the ontology integration process and its goal is to find correspondent elements in heterogeneous ontologies. A trend of clustering-based solutions for ontology matching has evolved, based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, which partitions ontologies, clusters similar partitions and restricts the matching to ontology elements of similar partitions. Nevertheless, most of these solutions considered solely the terminological aspect, ignoring other ontology aspects that can contribute to the final matching results. In this work, we developed a novel solution for ontology matching based on a consensus clustering of multiple aspects of ontology partitons. We partitioned the ontologies applying Community Detection techniques and applied Bayesian Cluster Ensembles (BCE) to find a consensus clustering among the terminological, topological and extensional aspects of ontology partitions. The matching results of our experimental study indicated that a BCE-based solution with three clusters best captured the contributions of the aspects, in comparison to other consensual solutions. The results corroborated the benefits of the synergy between the ontology aspects to the ontology alignment. We also verified that the BCE-based solution for three clusters yielded higher matching scores than other state-of-the-art solutions. Besides, our proposed methods structurize a configurable framework, which allows adding other ontology aspects and also other techniques.},

For instance, the GliderAgent was capable of detecting certain dangers, warn the pilot and, autonomously, send notification(s) to the ground station. Due to the continuous and rapid development of mobile technologies and sensors, our initial prototype has evolved. First, we moved the system, from an emulated environment, to real devices. Second, a semantic-rule-based decision making system was integrated with the GliderAgent, to analyze feeds from sensors (altitude, temperature, blood pressure, etc.) and, based on received information, to trigger appropriate behaviors. The result of our work provided a foundations for development of a general-purpose, cyber-physical system framework, which will be described in this paper. Furthermore, the developed system illustrates an interesting approach to integration of heterogeneous IoT devices (potentially also IoT platforms).},

Actually, sentiment orientations are highly dependent on topic content and thus detecting topic-sentiment associations and their evolution over time is very important. This paper proposes a manifold learning-based model to explore the topic-sentiment associations and their evolution over time in the online news domain. The proposed model can visualize the hidden sentiment dynamics of topics in a low-dimensional space.

  abstract     = {Data streams are good models to characterize dynamic, on-line, fast and high-volume data requirements of today’s businesses. However, sensitivity of data is usually an obstacle for deployment of many data streams applications. To address this challenging issue, many privacy preserving models, including k-anonymity, have been adapted to data streams. Data stream anonymization frameworks have already addressed how to preserve data quality as much as possible under bounded delays. In this work, our main motivation is to minimize average delay while keeping data quality high. It is our claim that data utility is a function of both data quality and data aging in data streams processing tasks. However, there is a tradeoff between data aging and data quality optimizations. To this end, we present a tunable data stream k-anonymization framework and an algorithm named UBDSA (Utility Based Approach for Data Stream Anonymization). To attain high quality anonymity groups, UBDSA also introduces a new distance metric, named CAIL (Cardinality Aware Information Loss). Our experimental evaluations compare performance of UBDSA with the literature, and the results show its merit in terms of better average delay and information loss.},

There are two main challenges in event detection: accuracy and scalability. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient method to detect events in news websites. First, we identify bursty terms which suddenly appear in a lot of news documents. Then, we construct a novel co-occurrence graph between terms in which nodes and edges are weighted based on important features such as click and document frequency within burst intervals. Finally, a weighted community detection algorithm is used to cluster terms and find events. We also propose a couple of techniques to reduce the size of the graph. The results of our evaluations show that the proposed method yields a much higher precision and recall than past methods, such that their harmonic mean is improved by at least 40%. Moreover, it reduces the running time and memory usage by a factor of at least 2.},

For Open IoT, we have proposed Tacit Computing technology to discover the devices that can provide the data users need on demand and use them dynamically. We have also proposed an automatic GPU (graphics processing unit) offloading method as an elementary technology of Tacit Computing. However, our GPU offloading method can improve only a limited number of applications because it only optimizes the extraction of parallelizable loop statements. Therefore, in this paper, to improve performances of more applications automatically, we propose an improved GPU offloading method with fewer data transfers between the CPU and GPU that can improve performance of many IoT applications. We evaluate our proposed GPU offloading method by applying it to Darknet and Fourier Transform, which are general large applications for CPU, and find that it can process them 3 times and 5 times as quickly as only using CPUs within 10-hour tuning time.},

We present a novel unsupervised method of generating tags and rank them based on relevance. We refine the generated tags using NLP syntactic rules to make them more informative. Our proposed Tagging Product Review (TPR) system takes into consideration the opinions expressed on the product or its aspects. We also address the problem of tag generation for cold products, which have only a limited number of reviews and that too, with very short content. We use transfer learning to build a tag cloud from popular product reviews and use it to identify good tags from cold product reviews. We evaluate our proposed system using online reviews of twelve products of varying popularity, collected from Amazon.com. Our result demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach at generating relevant tags compared to three popular baseline methods. Our proposed approach gives an average tag relevance score (NDCG) of around 79% for popular products and 85% for cold products. Our approach also gives an average precision of 89% for identifying correct tags. The results suggest that our TPR system successfully summarize reviews by means of tags.},

In the hybrid parameter setting strategy, the SVM parameter offspring are generated by DE operators with evolutionary parameters that are fixed or with the ones generated by fuzzy logic inference (FLI) according to a given probability. In the population size adaptation method, the population size is shrunk gradually during the search, which tries to balance the diversity and concentration ability of the algorithm to find better SVM parameters. Some benchmark data sets are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the two proposed strategies are effective to search for better SVM parameters while the proposed FDE-PS-SVM algorithm outperforms other algorithms published in other literature.},

After analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the traditional MST-based clustering algorithm, this paper presents two new methods to improve the traditional clustering algorithm. There are two steps of our first method: compute a scaled-MST with scaled distance to find the longest edges between different density clusters and clustering based on the MST. To improve the performance, our second scaled-MST-clustering works by merging the MST construction and inconsistent edges’ detection into one step. To verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, we apply our algorithm on image segmentation and integration. The encouraging performance demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method on both small data sets and high dimensional data sets.},

  abstract     = {Road owners are concerned with the state of the road surface and they try to reduce noise coming from the road as much as possible. Using sound level measuring equipment installed inside a car, we can indirectly measure the road pavement state. Noise inside a car is made up of rolling noise, engine noise and other confounding factors. Rolling noise is influenced by noise modifiers such as car speed, acceleration, temperature and road humidity. Engine noise is influenced by car speed, acceleration, and gear shifts. Techniques need to be developed which compensate for these modifying factors and filter out the confounding noise. This paper presents a hierarchical clustering method resulting in a mapping of the road pavement quality. We present the method using a dataset recorded in multiple cars under different circumstances. The data has been retrieved by placing a Raspberry Pi device within these cars and recording the sound and location during various trips at different times. The sound data of our dataset was then corrected for correlation with speed and acceleration. Furthermore, clustering techniques were used in order to estimate the type and condition of the pavement using this set of noise measurements. The algorithms were run on a small dataset and compared to a ground truth which was derived from visual observations. The results were best for a combination of Generalised Additive Model (GAM) correction on the data combined with hierarchical clustering. A connectivity matrix merging points close to each other further enhances the results for road pavement quality detection, and results in a road type detection rate around 90%.},

We study the problem of discovering primary keys and foreign keys automatically and propose an algorithm to detect both, namely Holistic Primary Key and Foreign Key Detection (HoPF). PKs and FKs are subsets of the sets of unique column combinations (UCCs) and inclusion dependencies (INDs), respectively, for which efficient discovery algorithms are known. Using score functions, our approach is able to effectively extract the true PKs and FKs from the vast sets of valid UCCs and INDs. Several pruning rules are employed to speed up the procedure. We evaluate precision and recall on three benchmarks and two real-world datasets. The results show that our method is able to retrieve on average 88% of all primary keys, and 91% of all foreign keys.

The medical field is no exception and healthcare and biomedical data must be stored and analyzed to gain insights that help in disease prevention and diagnostics. An example of this kind of data are electrocardiograms (ECG), whose careful analysis has proven to be of significant help to diagnose cardiovascular abnormalities. ECG recording devices can produce a very large amount of data in a short period of time. Usually abstracted as unstructured data, ECG digital signals have traditionally been stored and analyzed using file-based solutions for storage, and ad-hoc programs for data processing. We favor the idea that ECG signals can be abstracted as sets of tuples and stored in database relations. In this paper we present a proposal to store, manage, and analyze ECG data in a column-store database management system (DBMS). We provide extensive empirical evidence showing that incorporating complex analytical tasks such as ECG transformation and classification into a DBMS is not only feasible but also efficient and scalable. For this, we rely on the Structured Query Language provided by relational DBMSs, and the implementation of user defined functions.},

It is shown that the existing defense methods against website fingerprinting attacks are inappropriate. In addition, they use large bandwidth and time overhead. In this study, we show that the autocorrelation property is the most important success factor of the website fingerprinting attack. We offer a new effective defense model to resolve this security vulnerability of the Tor anonymity network. The proposed defense model prevents information leakage from the passing traffic. In this regard, a novel mechanism is developed to make the traffic analysis a hard task. This mechanism is based on decreasing the entropy of instances by minimizing the autocorrelation property of them. By applying the proposed defense model, the accuracy of the most effective website fingerprinting attack reduces from 98% to the lowest success rate of the website fingerprinting attack, while the maximum bandwidth overhead of the network traffic remains on about 8%. Recall that the current best defense mechanisms reduce the accuracy of the attack to 23% with a minimum bandwidth overhead of more than 44%. Hence, the proposed defense model significantly reduces the accuracy of the website fingerprinting attack, while the bandwidth overhead increases very slightly (i.e., up to 8%).},

  abstract     = {Data mining methods focus on discovering models and patterns from large databases that summarize the data. However, generating such results is not an end in itself because their applicability is not straightforward. Ideally, the user would ultimately like to use them to decide what actions to take. Action mining explicitly emerged as a response to this need. Currently, most of the action mining methods rely on simple data which describes each object independently that means they do not take into account relationships between objects. In social networks, relationships enable an individual to influence another one, so ignoring them in action mining process would lead to miss some profitable actions. In this paper, we introduce action mining from social networks. In fact, our main contribution is to extract cost-effective actions which is formulated as an optimization problem where the objective is to learn actions consisting of the changes in the network that are likely to result in desired changes in the labels of intended individuals while minimizing the cost of the changes. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach performs much better than the current state-of-the-art in action mining.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems are frequently evaluated using performance indexes based on variants and extensions of precision-like measures. As these measures are biased toward popular items, a list of recommendations simply must include a few popular items to perform well. To address the popularity bias challenge, new approaches for novelty and diversity evaluation have been proposed. On the one hand, novelty-based approaches model the quality of being new as apposed to that which is already known. Novelty approaches are commonly based on item views or user rates. On the other hand, diversity approaches model the quality of an item that is composed of different content elements. Diversity measures are commonly rooted in content-based features that characterize the diversity of the content of an item in terms of the presence/absence of a number of predefined nuggets of information. As item contents are also biased to popular contents (e.g., drama in movies or pop in music), diversity-based measures are also popularity biased. To alleviate the effect of popularity bias on diversity measures, we used an evaluation approach based on the degree of novelty of the elements that make up each item. We named this approach content novelty, as it mixes content and diversity approaches in a single and coherent evaluation framework. Experimental results show that our proposal is feasible and useful. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed measures yield consistent and interpretable results, producing insights that reduce the impact of popularity bias in the evaluation of recommender systems.},

In addition to the user preferences, using social and behavioural aspects of group members to generate group recommendations will increase the quality of the content recommended in heterogeneous groups. Group recommender systems also address the cold start problem that arises in an individual recommendation system.

As another novel feature, Wikipedia Good Pages are used as general background knowledge for matching user profiles and advertisement contents.

These disorders may affect a person’s general health and habits such as altered sleeping and eating patterns in addition to their interpersonal relationships. Early depression detection and prevention therefore becomes an important issue. To address this critical issue, we recruited 1453 individuals who use Facebook frequently and collected their Facebook data. We then propose an automatic depression detection approach, named Deep Learning-based Depression Detection with Heterogeneous Data Sources (D3-HDS), to predict the depression label of an individual by analyzing his/her living environment, behavior, and the posting contents in the social media. The proposed method employs Recurrent Neural Networks to compute the posts representation of each individual. The representations are then combined with other content-based, behavior and living environment features to predict the depression label of the individual with Deep Neural Networks. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt that simultaneously considers all the content-based, behavior, and living environment features for depression detection. The experiment results on a real dataset show that the performance of our approach significantly outperforms the other baselines.},

To encourage data sharing, we propose a privacy-preserving framework which enables shared collaborative QoS prediction without leaking the private information of the involved party.

To achieve our goal, first we leverage pervasive mobile sensing to uncover users’ mobility patterns and use of transportation modes. Second, we construct users’ persuadability profiles by considering their personality and mobility behavior. With the use of the aforementioned information we generate personalized interventions that nudge users to adopt sustainable transportation habits. These interventions rely on persuasive technologies and are embedded in a route planning application for smartphones.

This is an important consideration in that the summarization of a topic should cover all aspects of the topic and hence taking polarity into account (sentiment) can lead to the inclusion of the less popular polarity in the summarization process. ii) Some summarization techniques produce summaries at the topic level. However, it is possible that a given topic can have more than one important aspect that need to have representation in the summarization process. Our work in this paper addresses these two challenges by considering both topic sentiments and topic aspects in tandem.

The identification of personal life events from user’s profiles is a challenging yet important task, which if done appropriately, would facilitate more accurate identification of users’ preferences, interests and attitudes. For instance, a user who has just broken his phone, is likely to be upset and also be looking to purchase a new phone. While there is work that identifies tweets that include mentions of personal life events, our work in this paper goes beyond the state of the art by predicting a future personal life event that a user will be posting about on Twitter solely based on the past tweets. We propose two architectures based on recurrent neural networks, namely the classification and generation architectures, that determine the future personal life event of a user.

  abstract     = {The main goal of a Recommender System is to suggest relevant items to users, although other utility dimensions – such as diversity, novelty, confidence, possibility of providing explanations – are often considered. In this work, we investigate about confidence but from the perspective of the system: what is the confidence a system has on its own recommendations; more specifically, we focus on different methods to embed awareness into the recommendation algorithms about deciding whether an item should be suggested. Sometimes it is better not to recommend than fail because failure can decrease user confidence in the system. In this way, we hypothesise the system should only show the more reliable suggestions, hence, increasing the performance of such recommendations, at the expense of, presumably, reducing the number of potential recommendations. Different from other works in the literature, our approaches do not exploit or analyse the input data but intrinsic aspects of the recommendation algorithms or of the components used during prediction are considered. We propose a taxonomy of techniques that can be applied to some families of recommender systems allowing to include mechanisms to decide if a recommendation should be generated. In particular, we exploit the uncertainty in the prediction score for a probabilistic matrix factorisation algorithm and the family of nearest-neighbour algorithms, the support of the prediction score for nearest-neighbour algorithms, and a method independent of the algorithm. We study how the performance of a recommendation algorithm evolves when it decides not to recommend in some situations. If the decision of avoiding a recommendation is sensible – i.e., not random but related to the information available to the system about the target user or item –, the performance is expected to improve at the expense of other quality dimensions such as coverage, novelty, or diversity. This balance is critical, since it is possible to achieve a very high precision recommending only one item to a unique user, which would not be a very useful recommender. Because of this, on the one hand, we explore some techniques to combine precision and coverage metrics, an open problem in the area. On the other hand, a family of metrics (correctness) based on the assumption that it is better to avoid a recommendation rather than providing a bad recommendation is proposed herein. In summary, the contributions of this paper are twofold: a taxonomy of techniques that can be applied to some families of recommender systems allowing to include mechanisms to decide if a recommendation should be generated, and a first exploration to the combination of evaluation metrics, mostly focused on measures for precision and coverage. Empiric results show that large precision improvements are obtained when using these approaches at the expense of user and item coverage and with varying levels of novelty and diversity.},

Critique-based recommenders are data-driven in their nature since they use a conversational cyclical recommendation process to elicit user feedback. In the literature, the proposals made differ mainly in two aspects: in the source of data and in how this data is analyzed to extract knowledge for providing users with recommendations. In this paper, we propose new algorithms that address these two aspects. Firstly, we propose a new algorithm, called HOR, which integrates several data sources, such as current user preferences (i.e., a critique), product descriptions, previous critiquing sessions by other users, and users’ opinions expressed as ratings on social media web sites. Secondly, we propose adding compatibility and weighting scores to turn user behavior into knowledge to HOR and a previous state-of-the-art approach named HGR to help both algorithms make smarter recommendations. We have evaluated our proposals in two ways: with a simulator and with real users. A comparison of our proposals with state-of-the-art approaches shows that the new recommendation algorithms significantly outperform previous ones.},

  abstract     = {The second generation of World Wide Web, supplied with the platforms of Social Networks, proves to be a revealing source of knowledge. It has led to the emergence of online communities of interest. In fact, the interactions of users through web usages allow the exchange of information and the dissemination of innovation; thereby the formation of cohesive groups of individuals sharing goals, interests, semantics and services. Reflection on the evolution of those groups and their detection is a fundamental topic of interest in the field of Social Network Analysis. This problem is very challenging and hard to solve despite the huge interdisciplinary research over the past years. In this paper, we will attempt an indepth comparative review of the proposed approaches for clustering Social Network actors into communities of interests and propose a new classification of these approaches.},
