  abstract     = {We show that fMRI analysis using machine learning tools are sufficient to distinguish valence (i.e., positive or negative) of freely retrieved autobiographical memories in a cross-participant setting. Our methodology uses feature selection (ReliefF) in combination with boosting methods, both applied directly to data represented in voxel space. In previous work using the same data set, Nawa and Ando showed that whole-brain based classification could achieve above-chance classification accuracy only when both training and testing data came from the same individual. In a cross-participant setting, classification results were not statistically significant. Additionally, on average the classification accuracy obtained when using ReliefF is substantially higher than previous results - 81\% for the within-participant classification, and 62\% for the cross-participant classification. Furthermore, since features are defined in voxel space, it is possible to show brain maps indicating the regions of that are most relevant in determining the results of the classification. Interestingly, the voxels that were selected using the proposed computational pipeline seem to be consistent with current neurophysiological theories regarding the brain regions actively involved in autobiographical memory processes.},

Networks are trained with biologically motivated, unsupervised learning rules to obtain a self-organized grid of filters via cooperative and competitive excitatory-inhibitory interactions. Several inhibition strategies are developed and tested, such as (i) incrementally increasing inhibition level over the course of network training, and (ii) switching the inhibition level from low to high (two-level) after an initial training segment. During the labeling phase, the spiking activity generated by data with known labels is used to assign neurons to categories of data, which are then used to evaluate the network’s classification ability on a held-out set of test data. Several biologically plausible evaluation rules are proposed and compared, including a population-level confidence rating, and an n-gram inspired method. The effectiveness of the proposed self-organized learning mechanism is tested using the MNIST benchmark dataset, as well as using images produced by playing the Atari Breakout game.},

Despite a considerable amount of computational modeling research focuses on concrete concepts, no comprehensible method for abstract concepts has hitherto been considered. Abstract concepts can be viewed as a blend of concrete concepts. We use this view in our proposed model, Regulated Activation Network (RAN), by learning representations of non-convex abstract concepts without supervision via a hybrid model that has an evolving topology. First, we describe the RAN’s modeling process through a Toy-data problem yielding a performance of 98.5\%(ca.) in a classification task. Second, RAN’s model is used to infer psychological and physiological biomarkers from students’ active and inactive states using sleep-detection data. The RAN’s capability of performing classification is shown using five UCI benchmarks, with the best outcome of 96.5\% (ca.) for Human Activity recognition data. We empirically demonstrate the proposed model using standard performance measures for classification and establish RAN’s competency with five classifiers. We show that the RAN adeptly performs classification with a small amount of data and simulate cognitive functions like activation propagation and learning.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops and examines an innovative methodology for training an artificial neural network to identify and tag target visual objects in a given database. While the field of Artificial Intelligence in general, and computer vision in particular, has greatly advanced in recent years, fast and efficient methods for tagging (i.e., labeling) visual targets are still lacking. Tagging data is important to train, as it allow to train supervised learning models. However, this is a tiresome task that often creates bottlenecks in academic and industrial research projects. In order to develop an algorithm that improves data tagging processes, this study utilizes the advantages of human cognition and machine learning by combining Brain Computer Interface, Human-In-The-Loop, and Deep Learning. Combining these three fields into one algorithm could enable the rapid annotation of large visual databases that have no prior references and cannot be described as a mathematical optimization function. Human-In-The-Loop is an increasingly researched area that refers to the integration of human feedback in computation processes. At present, computer-based deep learning can only be incorporated in the process of identifying and tagging target objects of interest if a predefined database exists – one that has already been defined by a human user. To reduce the scope of this timely and costly process, our algorithm uses machine learning techniques (i.e., active learning) to minimize the number of target objects a human user needs to identify before the computer can successfully carry out the task independently. In our method, users are connected to electroencephalograms electrodes and shown images using rapid serial visual presentation – a fast method for presenting users with images. Some images are target objects, while others are not. Based on users’ brainwave activity when target objects are shown, the computer learns to identify and tag target objects – already in the learning stage (unlike naïve uniform sampling methods that first require human input, and only then begin the learning stage). As such, our work is proof of concept for the effectiveness of involving humans in the computer’s learning stage, i.e., human-in-the-loop as opposed to the traditional method of humans first tagging the data and the machines then learning and creating a model.},

Supervised learning with Convolutional Neural Networks has become the state of the art approach in many image related works. However, despite the great success of deep learning methods in other areas they remain relatively unexplored in the brain imaging field. In this paper we make an overview of recent achievements of Deep Learning to automatically extract features from brain signals that enable building Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI). Major challenge in the BMI research is to find common subject-independent neural signatures due to the high brain data variability across multiple subjects. To address this problem we propose a Deep Neural Autoencoder with sparsity constraint as a promising approach to extract hidden features from Electroencephalogram data (in-dept feature learning) and build a subject-independent noninvasive BMI in the affective neuro computing framework. Future direction for research are also outlined.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel, nonlinear, data-driven signal processing method, which can help neuroscience researchers visualize and understand complex dynamical patterns in both time and space. Specifically, we present applications of a Koopman operator approach for eigendecomposition of electrophysiological signals into orthogonal, coherent components and examine their associated spatiotemporal dynamics. This approach thus provides enhanced capabilities over conventional computational neuroscience tools restricted to analyzing signals in either the time or space domains. This is achieved via machine learning and kernel methods for data-driven approximation of skew-product dynamical systems. The approximations successfully converge to theoretical values in the limit of long embedding windows. First, we describe the method, then using electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from a mismatch negativity experiment, we extract time-separable frequencies without bandpass filtering or prior selection of wavelet features. Finally, we discuss in detail two of the extracted components, Beta ( $ \sim $ 13 Hz) and high Gamma ( $ \sim $ 50 Hz) frequencies, and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of high- and low- frequency components.},

Some of the issues involve dealing with the extreme signal to noise ratios, as well as variation between different individuals. Moreover, the huge amount of features relative to the number of data points is a challenge. As a result, in attacking these problems, we found it necessary to adapt a large variety of methodologies; chosen to overcome specific obstructions for specific problems.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of computing the lattice point closure of a conjunction of Unit Two Variable Per Inequality (UTVPI) constraints. We accomplish this by adapting Johnson’s all pairs shortest path algorithm to UTVPI constraint systems (UCSs). Thus, we obtain a closure algorithm that is efficient for sparse constraint systems. This problem has been extremely well-studied in the literature, since it arises in a number of applications, including but not limited to, program verification and operations research. In UTVPI constraints, linear feasibility does not always imply integer feasibility. Thus, there is a difference between the linear closure of a UCS and the integer closure of that same system. Finding the linear closure requires only a single inference rule called the transitive inference rule. This inference rule corresponds to the addition of constraints and preserves both linear and integer solutions. The problem of finding the integer closure requires the use of the tightening inference rule. Unlike the transitive inference rule, the tightening inference rule does not preserve linear solutions. However, it does preserve integer solutions. The complexity of solving the integer closure problem has steadily improved over the past several decades with the fastest algorithm for this problem running in time O(n3) on a UCS with n variables and m constraints. For the same input parameters, we detail an algorithm that runs in time $O(m\cdot n +n^{2} \cdot \log n)$ . It is clear that our algorithm is superior to the state of the art when the UCS is sparse (m ∈ o(n2)), and no worse than the state of the art when the UCS is dense (m ∈Θ(n2)). The best known running time for computing the closure of a conjunction of difference constraints (m constraints, n variables) is $O(m\cdot n +n^{2} \cdot \log n)$ , and UTVPI constraints subsume difference constraints.},

Continuous-depth RNN-like models called Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) were then introduced in 2019. The latter have a constant memory cost, and avoid the a priori specification of the number of hidden layers. In this paper, we derive and analyze a parallel (-in-parameter and time) version of the NODE, which potentially allows for a more efficient implementation than a standard/naive parallelization of NODEs with respect to the parameters only. We expect this approach to be relevant whenever we have access to a very large number of processors, or when we are dealing with high dimensional ODE systems. Moreover, when using implicit ODE solvers, solutions to linear systems with up to cubic complexity are then required for solving nonlinear systems using for instance Newton’s algorithm; as the proposed approach allows to reduce the overall number of time-steps thanks to an iterative increase of the accuracy order of the ODE system solvers, it then reduces the number of linear systems to solve, hence benefiting from a scaling effect.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the degree of relation between a feature and target class is one of the key aspects of machine learning. In this regard, information gain (IG) and χ2 are two of the most widely used measures in feature evaluation. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to unifying these and other existing feature evaluation measures under a common framework. In particular, we introduce a new generalized family of measures to estimate the similarity between features. We show that the proposed set of measures satisfies all the general criteria for quantifying the relationship between features. We demonstrate that IG and χ2 are special cases of the generalized measure. We also analyze some of the topological and set-theoretic aspects of the family of functions that satisfy the criteria of our generalized measure. Finally, we produce novel feature evaluation measures using our approach and analyze their performance through numerical experiments. We show that a diverse array of measures can be created under our framework which can be used in applications such fusion based feature selection.},

  abstract     = {As an extension of partial least squares (PLS), kernel partial least squares (KPLS) is an very important methods to find nonlinear patterns from data. However, the application of KPLS to large-scale problems remains a big challenge, due to storage and computation issues in the number of examples. To address this limitation, we utilize randomness to design scalable new variants of the kernel matrix to solve KPLS. Specifically, we consider the spectral properties of low-rank kernel matrices constructed as sums of random feature dot-products and present a new method called randomized kernel partial least squares (RKPLS) to approximate KPLS. RKPLS can alleviate the computation requirements of approximate KPLS with linear space and computation in the sample size. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the solution of our algorithm converges to exact kernel matrix in expectation.},

We introduce the concept of mutual conditional independence in an independent set of a Markov network, and we prove its equivalence to the Markov properties under certain regularity conditions. This extends the notion of similarity between separation in graph and conditional independence in probability to similarity between the mutual separation in graph and the mutual conditional independence in probability. Model selection in graphical models remains a challenging task due to the large search space. We show that mutual conditional independence property can be exploited to reduce the search space. We present a new forward model selection algorithm for graphical log-linear models using mutual conditional independence. We illustrate our algorithm with a real data set example. We show that for sparse models the size of the search space can be reduced from $\mathcal {O} (n^{3})$ to $\mathcal {O}(n^{2})$ using our proposed forward selection method rather than the classical forward selection method. We also envision that this property can be leveraged for model selection and inference in different types of graphical models.},

  abstract     = {A wide range of important problems in machine learning, expert system, social network analysis, bioinformatics and information theory can be formulated as a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference problem on statistical relational models. While off-the-shelf inference algorithms that are based on local search and message-passing may provide adequate solutions in some situations, they frequently give poor results when faced with models that possess high-density networks. Unfortunately, these situations always occur in models of real-world applications. As such, accurate and scalable maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference on such models often remains a key challenge. In this paper, we first introduce a novel family of extended factor graphs that are parameterized by a smoothing parameter χ ∈ [0,1]. Applying belief propagation (BP) message-passing to this family formulates a new family of W eighted S urvey P ropagation algorithms (WSP-χ) applicable to relational domains. Unlike off-the-shelf inference algorithms, WSP-χ detects the “backbone” ground atoms in a solution cluster that involve potentially optimal MAP solutions: the cluster backbone atoms are not only portions of the optimal solutions, but they also can be exploited for scaling MAP inference by iteratively fixing them to reduce the complex parts until the network is simplified into one that can be solved accurately using any conventional MAP inference method. We also propose a lazy variant of this WSP-χ family of algorithms. Our experiments on several real-world problems show the efficiency of WSP-χ and its lazy variants over existing prominent MAP inference solvers such as MaxWalkSAT, RockIt, IPP, SP-Y and WCSP.},

Specifically, we propose an algebraic geometric analysis on the TT manifold that can incorporate the whole rank vector simultaneously in contrast to the existing approach based on the Grassmannian manifold that can only incorporate one rank component. Our proposed technique characterizes the algebraic independence of a set of polynomials defined based on the sampling pattern and the TT decomposition, which is instrumental to obtaining the deterministic condition on the sampling pattern for finite completability. In addition, based on the proposed analysis, assuming that the entries of the tensor are sampled independently with probability p, we derive a lower bound on the sampling probability p, or equivalently, the number of sampled entries that ensures finite completability with high probability. Moreover, we also provide the deterministic and probabilistic conditions for unique completability.},

Their digital counterpart, i.e., their digitized variants are defined on discrete grids, since most of our pictures are digital nowadays. Usually, these digital versions of the transformations have different properties than the original continuous variants have. Rotations are bijective on the Euclidean plane, but in many cases they are not injective and not surjective on digital grids. Since these transformations play an important role in image processing and in image manipulation, it is important to discover their properties. Neighborhood motion maps are tools to analyze digital transformations, e.g., rotations by local bijectivity point of view. In this paper we show digitized rotations of a pixel and its 12-neighbors on the triangular grid. In particular, different rotation centers are considered with respect to the corresponding main pixel, e.g. edge midpoints and corner points. Angles of all locally bijective and non-bijective rotations are described in details. It is also shown that the triangular grid shows better performance in some cases than the square grid regarding the number of lost pixels in the neighborhood motion map.},

The same statement also holds for egalitarian social welfare. Moreover, we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether there is an allocation whose Nash product social welfare is above a certain threshold if the number of resources is a multiple of the number of agents. Finally, we consider elitist social welfare and prove that the increase in expressive power by allowing negative coefficients again yields NP-completeness.},

In particular, how we can stimulate consumers on a specific behaviour. In this work, we present a model facing energy allocation and payment. Thus, we start with the explanation of the first step of our work concerning a mechanism design approach for energy allocation among consumers. More in details, we go deep into the formal description of the energy model and users’ consumption profiles. We aim to select the optimal consumption profile for every user avoiding consumption peaks when the total required energy could exceed the energy production. The mechanism will be able to drive users in shifting energy consumptions in different hours of the day. The next step concerns a payment estimation problem which involves a community of users and an energy distributor (or producer). Our aim is to compute payments for every user in the community according to the single user’s consumption, the community’s consumption and the available energy. By computing community-dependent energy bills, our model stimulates a users’ virtuous behaviour, so that everyone approaches the production threshold as close as possible. Our payment function distributes incentives if the consumption is lower than the produced energy and penalties when the consumption exceeds the resources threshold, satisfying efficiency and fairness properties both from the community (efficiency as an economic equilibrium among sellers and buyers) and the single user (fairness as an economic measure of energy good-behaving) points of view.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Mahloujifar and Mahmoody (Theory of Cryptography Conference’17) studied attacks against learning algorithms using a special case of Valiant’s malicious noise, called p-tampering, in which the adversary gets to change any training example with independent probability p but is limited to only choose ‘adversarial’ examples with correct labels. They obtained p-tampering attacks that increase the error probability in the so called ‘targeted’ poisoning model in which the adversary’s goal is to increase the loss of the trained hypothesis over a particular test example. At the heart of their attack was an efficient algorithm to bias the expected value of any bounded real-output function through p-tampering. In this work, we present new biasing attacks for increasing the expected value of bounded real-valued functions. Our improved biasing attacks, directly imply improved p-tampering attacks against learners in the targeted poisoning model. As a bonus, our attacks come with considerably simpler analysis. We also study the possibility of PAC learning under p-tampering attacks in the non-targeted (aka indiscriminate) setting where the adversary’s goal is to increase the risk of the generated hypothesis (for a random test example). We show that PAC learning is possible under p-tampering poisoning attacks essentially whenever it is possible in the realizable setting without the attacks. We further show that PAC learning under ‘no-mistake’ adversarial noise is not possible, if the adversary could choose the (still limited to only p fraction of) tampered examples that she substitutes with adversarially chosen ones. Our formal model for such ‘bounded-budget’ tampering attackers is inspired by the notions of adaptive corruption in cryptography.},

  abstract     = {In statistical learning theory, numerous works established non-asymptotic bounds assessing the generalization capacity of empirical risk minimizers under a large variety of complexity assumptions for the class of decision rules over which optimization is performed, by means of sharp control of uniform deviation of i.i.d. averages from their expectation, while fully ignoring the possible dependence across training data in general. It is the purpose of this paper to show that similar results can be obtained when statistical learning is based on a data sequence drawn from a (Harris positive) Markov chain X, through the running example of estimation of minimum volume sets (MV-sets) related to X’s stationary distribution, an unsupervised statistical learning approach to anomaly/novelty detection. Based on novel maximal deviation inequalities we establish, using the regenerative method, learning rate bounds that depend not only on the complexity of the class of candidate sets but also on the ergodicity rate of the chain X, expressed in terms of tail conditions for the length of the regenerative cycles. In particular, this approach fully tailored to Markovian data permits to interpret the rate bound results obtained in frequentist terms, in contrast to alternative coupling techniques based on mixing conditions: the larger the expected number of cycles over a trajectory of finite length, the more accurate the MV-set estimates. Beyond the theoretical analysis, this phenomenon is supported by illustrative numerical experiments.},

It is exceptional in the range of constraint types it can discover and verify, and it directly allows for conditional effects in action operators. However, although various aspects of Discoplan have been previously described and its utility in planning demonstrated, the underlying methodology, the algorithms for the discovery and inductive verification of constraints, and the proofs of correctness of the algorithms and their complexity analysis have never been laid out in adequate detail. The purpose of this paper is to remedy these lacunae.},

Because in this approach actions and programs are represented in classical (second-order) logic, it is natural to express and prove properties of Golog programs, including non-terminating ones, in the very same logic. This approach to program proofs has the advantage of logical uniformity and the availability of classical proof theory.},

In this paper, the Qualitative Model for Angles (QMAngles) and the Qualitative Model for Lengths (QMLengths) are presented in detail by describing their arity, reference systems and operators. Their operators are defined taking the well-known temporal model by Allen (Commun. ACM 26(11), 832–843 (1983). https://doi.org/10.1145/182.358434) as a reference. Moreover, composition tables are built, and the composition relations of qualitative angles and lengths are proved using their geometric counterparts. The correctness of these composition tables is also proved computationally using a logic program implemented using Swi-Prolog.},

During engagement the system progresses the composition; during reflection the agent evaluates, and if necessary modifies, the material produced so far and generates a set of guidelines that constrains the production of material during engagement. The final output is the result of a constant interplay between these two states. We offer details of the model and describe a prototype that provides the users with the possibility of adding compositions to the knowledge-base. Then, we show how through engagement and reflection cycles, the system is capable of generating novel outputs. Using a questionnaire, we asked a group of volunteers to describe the features of pieces produced by the program and the features of pieces produced by human designers. The results suggest that our agent provides an adequate novel framework to study the generation of automatic visual compositions.},

This is the first such technique that specifically handles non-local acronyms, i.e., that can determine an acronym’s expansion even when the expansion does not appear in the same document as the acronym. Our approach automatically enhances the dictionary with contextual information to help address the acronym disambiguation task (selecting the most appropriate expansion for a given acronym in context), outperforming dictionaries built using prior techniques. We apply the approach to Modern Hebrew, a language with a long tradition of using acronyms, in which the productive morphology and unique orthography adds to the complexity of the problem.},

  abstract     = {The cognitive-linguistic theory of conceptual blending was introduced by Fauconnier and Turner in the late 90s to provide a descriptive model and foundational approach for the (almost uniquely) human ability to invent new concepts. Whilst blending is often described as ‘fluid’ and ‘effortless’ when ascribed to humans, it becomes a highly complex, multi-paradigm problem in Artificial Intelligence. This paper aims at presenting a coherent computational narrative, focusing on how one may derive a formal reconstruction of conceptual blending from a deconstruction of the human ability of concept invention into some of its core components. It thus focuses on presenting the key facets that a computational framework for concept invention should possess. A central theme in our narrative is the notion of refinement, understood as ways of specialising or generalising concepts, an idea that can be seen as providing conceptual uniformity to a number of theoretical constructs as well as implementation efforts underlying computational versions of conceptual blending. Particular elements underlying our reconstruction effort include ontologies and ontology-based reasoning, image schema theory, spatio-temporal reasoning, abstract specification, social choice theory, and axiom pinpointing. We overview and analyse adopted solutions and then focus on open perspectives that address two core problems in computational approaches to conceptual blending: searching for the shared semantic structure between concepts—the so-called generic space in conceptual blending—and concept evaluation, i.e., to determine the value of newly found blends.},

  abstract     = {Computational models of novel concept understanding and creativity are addressed in this paper from the viewpoint of conceptual blending theory (CBT). In our approach, a novel, unknown concept is addressed in a communication setting, where this novel concept, created as a blend by an emitter agent, sends a communicative object (words, or in this paper, a visual representation of that concept) to another agent. When received by a computational agent, a novel concept for that communicative object can only be understood by blending concepts already known by that agent. In this paper, we first posit that understanding new concepts via blending is also a creative process. Albeit different from generating conceptual blends, understanding a novel concept via blending involves the disintegration and decompression of that novel concept, in such a way that the receiver of that concept is able to re-create the conceptual network supposedly intended by the emitter of the novel concept. Secondly, we also propose image schemas as a tool that agents can use to interpret the spatial information obtained when disintegrating/unpacking novel concepts and then re-create the new blend. This process is studied in a communication setting where semiotics and meaning are conveyed by visual and spatial signs (instead of the usual setting of natural language or text). In this case study, qualitative spatial descriptors are applied for obtaining a formal description of an icon or pictogram, which is later assigned a meaning by a process of conceptual blending using image schemas.},

  abstract     = {Eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophers took interest in humour and, in particular, humorous incongruities. Humour was not necessarily their main interest; however, observations on humour could support their more general philosophical theories. Spontaneous and unintentional humour such as anecdotes, witty remarks and absurd events were the styles of humour that they analysed and made part of their theories. Prepared humour such as verbal jokes were rarely included in their observations, likely dismissed as too vulgar and not requiring intellectual effort. Humour, as analysed by several eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophers, was seen as part of daily life or life simulated on stage. In the twentieth century, Freud emphasized a possible ‘relief’ function of ‘prepared’ humour such as jokes. Additionally, linguists began developing theories to analyse jokes. A joke has a particular structure that is constructed with the aim of achieving a humorous effect. This structure makes jokes suitable for linguistic analysis. In the present-day humour research, jokes have become a main topic of research. This linguistically oriented joke research neglects many other forms of humour: spontaneous humour, non-verbal humour, physical humour, and many forms of unintentional humour that appear in real life. We want to survey and re-evaluate the contributions to the humour research of these eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth century philosophers and clarify that their more general contributions to the humour research have been neglected in favour of the very restricted form of prepared humour and linguistically expressed and analysed humour as it appears in jokes. We hope that the views expressed in this paper will help to steer the humour research away from joke research and help to integrate humour in the design of human-computer interfaces and smart environments. That is, rather than considering only verbal jokes, we should aim at generating smart environments that understand, facilitate or create humour that goes beyond jokes.},

This paper introduces a reasonable methodology called “multiple k–opt evaluation, multiple k–opt moves” that allows to simultaneously execute, without interference, massive k −opt moves that are globally found on the same TSP tour, as well as keep high performance GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel 2-/3-opt evaluation with characteristic of “data parallelism, decentralized control and O(1) local memory for each GPU thread”. The methodology is reasonable since intervention of a sequential O(N) time complexity tour reversal operation is unavoidable for each k −opt move when using array of ordered coordinates as TSP tour data structure for high performance GPU k −opt local search that considers coalesced memory access and usage of limited on-chip shared memory. Innovation work includes two parts, a sequential non-interacted k-opt moves’ set partition algorithm that takes linear time complexity; a new TSP tour representation, array of ordered coordinates-index, that unveils how to combine the advantages of using doubly linked list and array of ordered coordinates data structures for iterative parallel k −opt local search based on GPU CUDA. We test this methodology on 22 national TSP instances with up to 71009 cities and with brute initial tour solution. Average maximum 997 non-interacted 2-opt moves are found and executed on the same tour of ch71009.tsp instance after one iteration of complete $\frac {N*(N-1)}{2}$ 2-opt checks working in parallel on GPU. And the proposed iterative GPU parallel 2-opt methodology executes average 306631 2-opt moves while only iterates 786 tour reversal operations, in comparison with methods that have to execute tour reversal operation after each 2-opt move. Experimental comparisons show that our proposed methodology gets huge acceleration over both classical sequential and a current state-of-the-art GPU parallel 2-opt implementation.},

Its existence is a necessary prerequisite to formulate exact algorithms, to derive complexity results, and to study statistical consistency.

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art decision tree algorithms are top-down induction heuristics which greedily partition the attribute space by iteratively choosing the best split on an individual attribute. Despite their attractive performance in terms of runtime, simple examples, such as the XOR-Problem, point out that these heuristics often fail to find the best classification rules if there are strong interactions between two or more attributes from the given datasets. In this context, we present a branch and bound based decision tree algorithm to identify optimal bivariate axis-aligned splits according to a given impurity measure. In contrast to a univariate split that can be found in linear time, such an optimal cross-split has to consider every combination of values for every possible selection of pairs of attributes which leads to a combinatorial optimization problem that is quadratic in the number of values and attributes. To overcome this complexity, we use a branch and bound procedure, a well known technique from combinatorial optimization, to divide the solution space into several sets and to detect the optimal cross-splits in a short amount of time. These cross splits can either be used directly to construct quaternary decision trees or they can be used to select only the better one of the individual splits. In the latter case, the outcome is a binary decision tree with a certain sense of foresight for correlated attributes. We test both of these variants on various datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository and show that cross-splits can consistently produce smaller decision trees than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy. In some cases, our algorithm produces considerably more accurate trees due to the ability of drawing more elaborate decisions than univariate induction algorithms.},

All jobs are first divided into different parallel batches, and the processing time of the batches is equal to the largest processing time of their belonged jobs. Then, the generated batches are assigned to parallel machines to be processed. Motivated by the characteristics of machine maintenance activities in a semiconductor manufacturing process, we take the machine preventive maintenance into account, i.e., the machine should be maintained after a fixed number of batches have been completed. In order to solve the problem, we analyze several structural properties with respect to the batch formation and sequencing. Based on these properties, a hybrid BRKGA-DE algorithm combining biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) and Differential Evolution (DE) is proposed to solve the parallel-batching scheduling problem. A series of computational experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

It comes as no surprise that applications in coding theory and communications continue to arise, and also that designs have found applications in new areas. Computer science has provided a new source of applications of designs, and simultaneously a field of new and challenging problems in design theory. In this paper, we revisit a construction for orthogonal designs using the multiplication tables of Cayley-Dixon algebras of dimension 2n. The desired orthogonal designs can be described by a system of equations with the aid of a Gröbner basis computation. For orders greater than 16 the combinatorial explosion of the problem gives rise to equations that are unfeasible to be handled by traditional search algorithms. However, the structural properties of the designs make this problem possible to be tackled in terms of rewriting techniques, by equational unification. We establish connections between central concepts of design theory and equational unification where equivalence operations of designs point to the computation of a minimal complete set of unifiers. These connections make viable the computation of some types of orthogonal designs that have not been found before with the aforementioned algebraic modeling.},

The cumulated effects of the Gaussian Processes and the targeting strategy lead to a particularly efficient convergence to the desired part of the Pareto set.

Each job requires a certain amount of a common resource that is supplied through upstream processes. The total resource consumed must not exceed the resource supply up. Therefore, jobs may have to wait and the machine has to be idle due to an insufficient availability of the resource. To minimize the total tardiness, simple and effective iterated greedy (IG) heuristics are proposed. Different neighborhood operators are used in the local search phase. To choose the right neighborhood operators, we propose an adaptive selecting strategy. The heuristics are tested over an extensive computational experience on benchmark of instances from the literature and instances randomly generated in this work. Experimental results and statistical tests show that the proposed heuristics are able to obtain high-quality solutions within reasonable computational effort, and they outperform the state-of-the-art heuristic.},

This value is defined as percentage of the sum of squared distances between the elements of the input set and its centroid. In the second problem, the input is a sequence (not a set) and we have some additional constraints on the indices of the elements of the chosen subsequence. The restriction on the sum of squared distances is the same as in the first problem. Both problems can be treated as data editing problems aimed to find similar elements and removal of extraneous (dissimilar) elements. We propose exact algorithms for the cases of both problems in which the input points have integer-valued coordinates. If the space dimension is bounded by some constant, our algorithms run in a pseudopolynomial time.

  abstract     = {Moser and Tardos (J. ACM (JACM) 57(2), 11 2010) gave an algorithmic proof of the lopsided Lovász local lemma (LLL) in the variable framework, where each of the undesirable events is assumed to depend on a subset of a collection of independent random variables. For the proof, they define a notion of a lopsided dependency between the events suitable for this framework. In this work, we strengthen this notion, defining a novel directed notion of dependency and prove the LLL for the corresponding graph. We show that this graph can be strictly sparser (thus the sufficient condition for the LLL weaker) compared with graphs that correspond to other extant lopsided versions of dependency. Thus, in a sense, we address the problem “find other simple local conditions for the constraints (in the variable framework) that advantageously translate to some abstract lopsided condition” posed by Szegedy (2013). We also give an example where our notion of dependency graph gives better results than the classical Shearer lemma. Finally, we prove Shearer’s lemma for the dependency graph we define. For the proofs, we perform a direct probabilistic analysis that yields an exponentially small upper bound for the probability of the algorithm that searches for the desired assignment to the variables not to return a correct answer within n steps. In contrast, the method of proof that became known as the entropic method, gives an estimate of only the expectation of the number of steps until the algorithm returns a correct answer, unless the probabilities are tinkered with.},

Experimental evaluation performed on real scenarios on the cities of Montevideo (Uruguay) and Bahía Blanca (Argentina) demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

  abstract     = {Revenue Management uses data-driven modelling and optimization methods to decide what to sell, when to sell, to whom to sell, and for which price, in order to increase revenue and profit. Hotel Revenue Management is a very complex context characterized by nonlinearities, many parameters and constraints, and stochasticity, in particular in the demand by customers. It suffers from the curse of dimensionality (Bellman 2015): when the number of variables increases (number of rooms, number possible prices and capacities, number of reservation rules and constraints) exact solutions by dynamic programming or by alternative global optimization techniques cannot be used and one has to resort to intelligent heuristics, i.e., methods which can improve current solutions but without formal guarantees of optimality. Effective heuristics can incorporate “learning” (“reactive” schemes) that update strategies based on the past history of the process, the past reservations received up to a certain time and the previous steps in the iterative optimization process. Different approaches can be classified according to the specific model considered (stochastic demand and hotel rules), the control mechanism (the pricing policy) and the optimization technique used to determine improving or optimal solutions. In some cases, model definitions, control mechanism and solution techniques are strongly interrelated: this is the case of dynamic programming, which demands suitably simplified problem formulations. We design a flexible discrete-event simulator for the hotel reservation process and experiment different approaches though measurements of the expected effect on profit (obtained by carefully separating a “training” phase from the final “validation” phase obtained from different simulations). The experimental results show the effectiveness of intelligent heuristics with respect to exact optimization methods like dynamic programming, in particular for more constrained situations (cases when demand tends to saturate hotel room availability), when the simplifying assumptions needed to make the problem analytically treatable do not hold.},

They proved the intractability of the problem and proposed first polynomial time algorithms with fixed approximation factors. The extension of these results in the field of constructing the polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) and the description of non-trivial polynomial time solvable subclasses for the EGTSP-GC appear to be relevant in the light of the classic C. Papadimitriou result on the intractability of the Euclidean TSP and recent inapproximability results for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods (TSPN) in the case of discrete neighborhoods. In this paper, we propose Efficient Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (EPTAS) for two special cases of the EGTSP-GC, when the number of clusters $k=O(\log n)$ and $k=n-O(\log n)$. Also, we show that any time, when one of the grid dimensions (height or width) is fixed, the EGTSP-GC can be solved to optimality in polynomial time. As a consequence, we specify a novel non-trivial polynomially solvable subclass of the Euclidean TSP in the plane.},

  abstract     = {A detailed review of the dynamic search trajectory methods for global optimization is given. In addition, a family of dynamic search trajectories methods that are created using numerical methods for solving autonomous ordinary differential equations is presented. Furthermore, a strategy for developing globally convergent methods that is applicable to the proposed family of methods is given and the corresponding theorem is proved. Finally, theoretical results for obtaining nonmonotone convergent methods that exploit the accumulated information with regard to the most recent values of the objective function are given.},
