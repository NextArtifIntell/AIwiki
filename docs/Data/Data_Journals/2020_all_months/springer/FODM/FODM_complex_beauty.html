  abstract     = {As a representative of the new economy, the web celebrity economy has achieved significant development in China with the rapid development of information technology and the Internet. In this environment, web celebrity shops encounter fierce business competition of peer competitors. Online reviews which imply the consumers’ attitudes and sentiments give the web celebrity shops good feedback to improve their competitiveness. Thus, taking milk tea as an example, this paper deeply investigates the assessment of web celebrity shops by mining online review. At the same time, we also discuss the competitive analysis and propose the corresponding improvement advices. In order to obtain the satisfaction assessments of web celebrity shops, on the one hand, we analyze topic extraction with latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and determine the attributes that customers care about. On the other hand, we utilize long short-term memory (LSTM) and probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) to more precisely portray customers’ sentiment towards different attributes. By using fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and the association rule, we further investigate the interrelationship among the attributes and construct the relationship graph between attributes for web celebrity shops. With the above results, we aggregate the decision information by designing improved extended Bonferroni mean (EBM) and obtain comprehensive evaluations. General speaking, this paper successfully transforms the unstructured data of online reviews into quantitative information and obtain satisfaction evaluations. With the aid of PLTSs and FCM, we further investigate the competitive analysis and propose improvement advices for each shop, which systematically provides us with a data-driven decision-making analysis model.},

  abstract     = {When expressing preferences with different probability weights for different linguistic terms, only partial assessment information is usually to be provided. Then the probability information can be normalized to the interval probability, hence, using interval probabilistic linguistic term sets (IPLTs) is more appropriate. Considering this situation, interval probabilistic linguistic preference relation (IPLPR) is proposed. To measure the consistency of IPLPR, the consistency definition of IPLPR is put forward. For the consistent IPLPR, from which an expected consistent PLPR can be obtained, we can obtain interval weights as the final priorities by using the pairs of linear programming models. We also create the probabilistic linguistic geometric consistency index (PLGCI) of PLPRs to judge whether the IPLPR is satisfactorily consistent. For an unsatisfied consistency IPLPR, the adjusting algorithm is proposed. Probability information is firstly considered to be adjusted. If it is not possible to achieve satisfactory consistency through the adjustment of probability information, then the linguistic terms will be adjusted. In addition to examples of different situations, such as the consistency, satisfactory consistency and consistency improvement, the application example is also given to show the practicability of the proposed methods.},

When the PLPRs are inconsistent, there are contradictories in the preference relations expressed by the experts. The evaluation value with contradictory information will bring out an incorrect consequence in decision making. Hence, this paper develops a novel consistency measure method to gauge the consistency level of PLPRs. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model is newly constructed to optimize the inconsistent PLPRs. The proposed methods overcome the limitations in the existing methods and ameliorate the interpretation and complexities of inconsistency PLPRs revise strategies. Additionally, a weighting method using fuzzy cooperative games with PLPRs is put forward to derive the weight vector of experts. It helps to balance the deviations between the individual PLPRs and the group PLRP. At last, a numerical example illustration for physician selection is put forward to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its practical applicability.

First, we propose a new generalized weighted ordered weighted averaging (GWOWA) operator and discuss its properties. Second, we use probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs) to aggregate the experts’ hesitant fuzzy linguistic decision-making information and develop a novel method of transforming PLTSs into triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) based on the proposed GWOWA operator and the characteristics of PLTSs. Furthermore, we propose a method of making criteria relation analysis based on DEMATEL with TFNs. With the method, we not only access the importance weights of criteria but also obtain the influence relation among the criteria and cluster the criteria into two groups: cause group and effect group.

Due to the practicability of PLTSs, probabilistic linguistic decision making problems have been widely investigated in recent years. However, no study on probabilistic linguistic outranking relations has been conducted. This study aims to explore effective processing for the complex two-dimension structure of PLTSs and formulate probabilistic linguistic dominance and opposition relations for multi-criteria sorting decision making. Linguistic scale functions, which can generate different semantics for linguistic variables under different decision making environments, are introduced to deal with the linguistic terms in PLTSs. In this way, the probabilistic linguistic dominance degree, concordance and discordance indices are defined by systematically comparing the probabilities of PLTSs. Then, two kinds of outranking relations with dominance and opposition for PLTSs are formulated based on the defined outranking indices. Subsequently, an innovative sorting decision making framework is constructed by exploring the outranking relations between alternatives and characteristic actions under multiple criteria and implementing the outranking aggregation and exploitation. Finally, this framework is demonstrated using an illustrative example with result analyses and comparison discussions.},

To apply the projection to the probabilistic linguistic environment, we propose the equivalent expression forms of the probabilistic linguistic term sets, and then the equivalent transformation functions between the probabilistic linguistic term set and its associated vector are presented to realize the conversion between the operations on the probabilistic linguistic term sets and the operations on their associated vectors. Next, the projection formulas of the probabilistic linguistic term sets are introduced to build different normalization models for different types of uncertain probabilistic linguistic multi-criteria decision-making problems. After that, a new deviation degree formula is proposed to account for the rationality and validity of the normalization models from the theoretical perspective. Finally, the probabilistic linguistic two-step method is used to determine the criteria weights values and rank the alternatives, and the validity of these projection-based normalization models and our proposed decision-making method are illustrated by a case about the performance assessment of data hiding techniques.},

In this paper, a direct method, from the perspective of 3 tuples, is proposed to test and improve the consistency of a pairwise comparison matrix, which is far more intuitional and easier to understand. In the proposed 3 tuples iterative method, only simple mathematical calculations are needed, without the need for matrix operations. Furthermore, the calculation of Saaty’s consistency ratio is only conducted to verify the proposed method. Some related theorems and propositions are proved mathematically or verified by random simulations. The proposed method is applied to some published examples to verify its effectiveness and practicability. Finally, we provide an improved iterative method, which is based on the 3 tuples iterative method. The improved iterative method and the 3 tuples iterative method are closely linked and each has its own different perspective.

Though, with the globalization of manufacturing enterprises, manufacturing optimization problems often occur in complex manufacturing systems under the deteriorating and fuzzy environment, which brings many challenges to smart manufacturing, such as the lack of coordinating scheduling strategies to guarantee the low latency requirement. This paper investigates a robust parallel-batching scheduling problem with fuzzy processing time and past-sequence-dependent delivery time. Some structural properties are first identified, and an optimal algorithm is further developed for the single-machine scheduling problem. Then, the problem is proved to be NP-hard. We thus design a hybrid Multi-Verse Optimizer-Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm to solve the investigated problem in a reasonable time. Abundant experiments of different scales are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed hybrid method with a comparison of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed hybrid meta-heuristic shows excellent results, robustness, and computational time performance under various experiments.},

  abstract     = {Uncertain fractional difference equations may preferably describe the behavior of the systems with the memory effect and discrete feature in the uncertain environment. So it is of great significance to investigate their stability. In this paper, the concept of finite-time stability almost surely for uncertain fractional difference equations is introduced. A finite-time stability theorem is then stated by Mittag–Leffler function and proved by a generalized Gronwall inequality on a finite time. Some examples are finally presented to illustrate the validity of our results.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of fuzzy regression methods for computing more reliable estimates of higher-order moments of the risk-neutral distribution. We improve upon the formula of Bakshi et al. (RFS 16(1):101–143, 2003), which is used for the computation of market volatility and skewness indices (such as the VIX and the SKEW indices traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange), through the use of fuzzy regression methods. In particular, we use the possibilistic regression method of Tanaka, Uejima and Asai, the least squares fuzzy regression method of Savic and Pedrycz and the hybrid method of Ishibuchi and Nii. We compare the fuzzy moments with those obtained by the standard methodology, based on the Bakshi et al. (2003) formula, which relies on an ex-ante choice of the option prices to be used and cubic spline interpolation. We evaluate the quality of the obtained moments by assessing their forecasting power on future realized moments. We compare the competing forecasts by using both the Model Confidence Set and Mincer–Zarnowitz regressions. We find that the forecasts for skewness and kurtosis obtained using fuzzy regression methods are closer to the subsequently realized moments than those provided by the standard methodology. In particular, the lower bound of the fuzzy moments obtained using the Savic and Pedrycz method is the best ones. The results are important for investors and policy makers who can rely on fuzzy regression methods to get a more reliable forecast for skewness and kurtosis.},

To include more fuzzy information in observations, this study uses intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) to characterize the explanatory and response variables in formulating intuitionistic fuzzy regression (IFR) models. Different from traditional solution methods, such as the least-squares method, in this study, mathematical programming problems are built up based on the criterion of least absolute deviations to establish IFR models with intuitionistic fuzzy parameters. The proposed approach has the advantages that the model formulation is not limited to the use of symmetric triangular IFNs and the signs of the parameters are determined simultaneously in the model formulation process. The prediction performance of the obtained models is evaluated in terms of similarity and distance measures. Comparison results of the performance measures indicate that the proposed models outperform an existing approach.},

  abstract     = {When one estimates the importance of alternatives under rational choice, it is natural to avoid self-contradiction from the viewpoint of psychology. Due to the vagueness encountered in a manner analogous to human thought, decision makers always exhibit limited rationality. The judgements could be expressed as interval-valued comparison matrices within the framework of analytic hierarchy process. In this study, for additive reciprocal matrices (ARMs), three axiomatic properties are proposed to characterize the additive consistency and the multiplicative consistency under fully rational behavior. For interval additive reciprocal matrices (IARMs), the concept of weak consistency is used to capture the limited rationality. By weakening some axiomatic properties of consistent ARMs, the reasonable properties of IARMs with weak consistency are presented. Two kinds of IARMs satisfying the properties of weak consistency are analyzed and some comparisons are offered. It is observed that the consistency of ARMs can be defined exactly and characterized by using the axiomatic properties. The properties of characterizing the consistency degree of IARMs should be captured by weakening the axiomatic ones of consistent ARMs. The proposed approach visualizes the development process starting from cardinal consistency of numeric-valued preference relations to weak consistency of interval-valued comparison matrices.},

Owning to its usefulness and efficiency, the PLTS has attracted a lot of researchers’ attention, and fruitful research achievements regarding it has been published since it was introduced in 2016. As the probabilistic linguistic theory is still in its infancy, a survey of it contributes to understanding the previous topics and the current issues, and predicting the future research directions in this area. To implement these goals, this paper is organized by bibliometric analysis, definitions, multiple criteria decision-making methods, preference relations, and applications. Twelve future research directions related to the probabilistic linguistic decision-making theory are indicated.

In this paper, we prove some important properties on positive L-R fuzzy numbers, and propose a new calculation method for the product of multiple positive L-R fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, a numerical integral-based simulation algorithm (NISA) is proposed to approximate the expected value, variance and skewness of the product of positive L-R fuzzy numbers. As applications, a fuzzy multi-period utility maximization model for portfolio selection problem is considered. For handling the large number of multiplications on L-R fuzzy numbers during the optimization process, a genetic algorithm integrating NISA is designed. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the advantages of NISA. The results greatly enrich the fuzzy arithmetic methods and promote the practicability of fuzzy optimization technology.},

It has long been dominated by least squares, mostly due to the elegant theoretical foundation and ease of implementation. However, in many cases, we can only get imprecise observation values and the assumptions upon which the least squares is based may not be valid. So this paper characterizes the imprecise data in terms of uncertain variables and proposes a novel robust approach under the principle of least absolute deviations to estimate the unknown parameters in uncertain regression models. Furthermore, some general estimate approaches are also explored. Finally, numerical examples illustrate that our estimate is more robust than the least squares implying it is more suitable to handle observations with outliers.},

Short-term forecasting is important in the energy field for the management of power systems and for energy trading. Hence, we considered two typical application examples in this field, that is wind power forecasting and load forecasting.
