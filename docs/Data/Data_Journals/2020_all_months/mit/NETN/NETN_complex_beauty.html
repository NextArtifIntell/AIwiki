  abstract     = {Abstract. Patterns of brain structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) are known to be related. In SC-FC comparisons, FC has classically been evaluated from correlations between functional time series, and more recently from partial correlations or their unnormalized version encoded in the precision matrix. The latter FC metrics yield more meaningful comparisons to SC because they capture ‘direct’ statistical dependencies, that is, discarding the effects of mediators, but their use has been limited because of estimation issues. With the rise of high-quality and large neuroimaging datasets, we revisit the relevance of different FC metrics in the context of SC-FC comparisons. Using data from 100 unrelated Human Connectome Project subjects, we first explore the amount of functional data required to reliably estimate various FC metrics. We find that precision-based FC yields a better match to SC than correlation-based FC when using 5 minutes of functional data or more. Finally, using a linear model linking SC and FC, we show that the SC-FC match can be used to further interrogate various aspects of brain structure and function such as the timescales of functional dynamics in different resting-state networks or the intensity of anatomical self-connections.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Brain connectivity studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have historically relied on static measures of functional connectivity. Recent work has focused on identifying transient configurations of brain activity, yet several open questions remain regarding the nature of specific brain network dynamics in ASD. We used a dynamic coactivation pattern (CAP) approach to investigate the salience/midcingulo-insular (M-CIN) network, a locus of dysfunction in ASD, in a large multisite resting-state fMRI dataset collected from 172 children (ages 6–13 years; n = 75 ASD; n = 138 male). Following brain parcellation by using independent component analysis, dynamic CAP analyses were conducted and k-means clustering was used to determine transient activation patterns of the M-CIN. The frequency of occurrence of different dynamic CAP brain states was then compared between children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Dynamic brain configurations characterized by coactivation of the M-CIN with central executive/lateral fronto-parietal and default mode/medial fronto-parietal networks appeared less frequently in children with ASD compared with TD children. This study highlights the utility of time-varying approaches for studying altered M-CIN function in prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders. We speculate that altered M-CIN dynamics in ASD may underlie the inflexible behaviors commonly observed in children with the disorder.Author Summary. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with altered patterns of functional brain connectivity. Little is currently known about how moment-to-moment brain dynamics differ in children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Altered functional integrity of the midcingulo-insular network (M-CIN) has been implicated in the neurobiology of ASD. Here we use a novel coactivation analysis approach applied to a large sample of resting-state fMRI data collected from children with ASD and TD children to demonstrate altered patterns of M-CIN dynamics in children with the disorder. We speculate that these atypical patterns of brain dynamics may underlie behavioral inflexibility in ASD.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The relationship between structural and functional connectivity has been mostly examined in intact brains. Fewer studies have examined how differences in structure as a result of injury alters function. In this study we analyzed the relationship of structure to function across patients with stroke among whom infarcts caused heterogenous structural damage. We estimated relationships between distinct brain regions of interest (ROIs) from functional MRI in two pipelines. In one analysis pipeline, we measured functional connectivity by using correlation and partial correlation between 114 cortical ROIs. We found fMRI-BOLD partial correlation was altered at more edges as a function of the structural connectome (SC) damage, relative to the correlation. In a second analysis pipeline, we limited our analysis to fMRI correlations between pairs of voxels for which we possess SC information. We found that voxel-level functional connectivity showed the effect of structural damage that we could not see when examining correlations between ROIs. Further, the effects of structural damage on functional connectivity are consistent with a model of functional connectivity, diffusion, which expects functional connectivity to result from activity spreading over multiple edge anatomical paths.Author Summary. Examining the structure to function relationship at damaged edges in the structural connectome due to lesions from stroke we find the following:• Partial correlation reflects structural connectome damage in 24\% of edges tested.• Voxel-to-voxel correlation guided by structural connectivity shows the presence of SC damage in 39\% of edges tested.• Edges that show modulation when using voxel-to-voxel correlation are consistent with diffusion as a model of functional connectivity.Our work provides evidence that for pairs of regions that are not directly anatomically connected due to lesions from stroke, signals must be communicated through intermediate region-to-region steps along an anatomical path.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain is a complex network of interconnected and interacting neuronal populations. Global efforts to understand the emergence of behavior and the effect of perturbations depend on accurate reconstruction of white matter pathways, both in humans and in model organisms. An emerging animal model for next-generation applied neuroscience is the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). A recent open respository of retrograde and anterograde tract tracing presents an opportunity to systematically study the network architecture of the marmoset brain (Marmoset Brain Architecture Project; http://www.marmosetbrain.org). Here we comprehensively chart the topological organization of the mesoscale marmoset cortico-cortical connectome. The network possesses multiple nonrandom attributes that promote a balance between segregation and integration, including near-minimal path length, multiscale community structure, a connective core, a unique motif composition, and multiple cavities. Altogether, these structural attributes suggest a link between network architecture and function. Our findings are consistent with previous reports across a range of species, scales, and reconstruction technologies, suggesting a small set of organizational principles universal across phylogeny. Collectively, these results provide a foundation for future anatomical, functional, and behavioral studies in this model organism.Author Summary. Emerging research points to network connectivity as a fundamental feature of brains, influencing interregional signaling, cognition, and behavior. Global efforts are under way to map, image, and trace cellular connection patterns in humans and in a variety of model organisms. The common marmoset is increasingly becoming the most used nonhuman primate model for neuroimaging, genomics, and behavioral research. Here we provide a comprehensive characterization of the marmoset brain connectome using a recently published cortico-cortical tract tracing atlas. We find evidence of nonrandom organization across multiple scales, including near-minimal path length, multiscale community structure, densely interconnected hubs, a unique motif fingerprint, and the existence of topological cavities. Collectively, these features suggest that the network is configured to support the coexistence of segregation and integration of information.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An elusive phenomenon in network neuroscience is the extent of neuronal activity remodeling upon damage. Here, we investigate the action of gradual synaptic blockade on the effective connectivity in cortical networks in vitro. We use two neuronal cultures configurations—one formed by about 130 neuronal aggregates and another one formed by about 600 individual neurons—and monitor their spontaneous activity upon progressive weakening of excitatory connectivity. We report that the effective connectivity in all cultures exhibits a first phase of transient strengthening followed by a second phase of steady deterioration. We quantify these phases by measuring GEFF, the global efficiency in processing network information. We term hyperefficiency the sudden strengthening of GEFF upon network deterioration, which increases by 20–50\% depending on culture type. Relying on numerical simulations we reveal the role of synaptic scaling, an activity–dependent mechanism for synaptic plasticity, in counteracting the perturbative action, neatly reproducing the observed hyperefficiency. Our results demonstrate the importance of synaptic scaling as resilience mechanism.Author Summary. Neuronal circuits exhibit homeostatic plasticity mechanisms to cope with perturbations or damage. A central mechanism is ‘synaptic scaling,’ a self-organized response in which the strength of neurons’ excitatory synapses is adjusted to compensate for activity variations. Here we present experiments in which the excitatory connectivity of in vitro cortical networks is progressively weakened through chemical action. The spontaneous activity and effective connectivity of the whole network is monitored as degradation progresses, and the capacity of the network for broad information communication is quantified through the global efficiency. We observed that the network responded to the perturbation by strengthening the effective connectivity, reaching a hyperefficient state for moderate perturbations. The study proves the importance of ‘synaptic scaling’ as a driver for functional reorganization and network-wide resilience.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent advances in computational models of signal propagation and routing in the human brain have underscored the critical role of white-matter structure. A complementary approach has utilized the framework of network control theory to better understand how white matter constrains the manner in which a region or set of regions can direct or control the activity of other regions. Despite the potential for both of these approaches to enhance our understanding of the role of network structure in brain function, little work has sought to understand the relations between them. Here, we seek to explicitly bridge computational models of communication and principles of network control in a conceptual review of the current literature. By drawing comparisons between communication and control models in terms of the level of abstraction, the dynamical complexity, the dependence on network attributes, and the interplay of multiple spatiotemporal scales, we highlight the convergence of and distinctions between the two frameworks. Based on the understanding of the intertwined nature of communication and control in human brain networks, this work provides an integrative perspective for the field and outlines exciting directions for future work.Author Summary. Models of communication in brain networks have been essential in building a quantitative understanding of the relationship between structure and function. More recently, control-theoretic models have also been applied to brain networks to quantify the response of brain networks to exogenous and endogenous perturbations. Mechanistically, both of these frameworks investigate the role of interregional communication in determining the behavior and response of the brain. Theoretically, both of these frameworks share common features, indicating the possibility of combining the two approaches. Drawing on a large body of past and ongoing works, this review presents a discussion of convergence and distinctions between the two approaches, and argues for the development of integrated models at the confluence of the two frameworks, with potential applications to various topics in neuroscience.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The human brain displays rich communication dynamics that are thought to be particularly well-reflected in its marked community structure. Yet, the precise relationship between community structure in structural brain networks and the communication dynamics that can emerge therefrom is not well understood. In addition to offering insight into the structure-function relationship of networked systems, such an understanding is a critical step toward the ability to manipulate the brain’s large-scale dynamical activity in a targeted manner. We investigate the role of community structure in the controllability of structural brain networks. At the region level, we find that certain network measures of community structure are sometimes statistically correlated with measures of linear controllability. However, we then demonstrate that this relationship depends on the distribution of network edge weights. We highlight the complexity of the relationship between community structure and controllability by performing numerical simulations using canonical graph models with varying mesoscale architectures and edge weight distributions. Finally, we demonstrate that weighted subgraph centrality, a measure rooted in the graph spectrum, and which captures higher order graph architecture, is a stronger and more consistent predictor of controllability. Our study contributes to an understanding of how the brain’s diverse mesoscale structure supports transient communication dynamics.Author Summary. A central question in network neuroscience is how the structure of the brain constrains the patterns of communication dynamics that underlie function. At the mesoscale of network organization, this question has been examined through the lens of modularity. Recent work has demonstrated a diversity in the mesoscale architecture of the human connectome. Further diversity in the characterization of structural brain networks is introduced by the fact that the distribution of edge weights in a network depends on the precise empirical measurement whose value is assigned to an edge. This paper explores network controllability in light of the variety of community interaction motifs and edge weight distributions that may be used to characterize structural brain networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The wiring of the brain is organized around a putative unimodal-transmodal hierarchy. Here we investigate how this intrinsic hierarchical organization of the brain shapes the transmission of information among regions. The hierarchical positioning of individual regions was quantified by applying diffusion map embedding to resting-state functional MRI networks. Structural networks were reconstructed from diffusion spectrum imaging and topological shortest paths among all brain regions were computed. Sequences of nodes encountered along a path were then labeled by their hierarchical position, tracing out path motifs. We find that the cortical hierarchy guides communication in the network. Specifically, nodes are more likely to forward signals to nodes closer in the hierarchy and cover a range of unimodal and transmodal regions, potentially enriching or diversifying signals en route. We also find evidence of systematic detours, particularly in attention networks, where communication is rerouted. Altogether, the present work highlights how the cortical hierarchy shapes signal exchange and imparts behaviorally relevant communication patterns in brain networks.Author Summary. In the present report we asked how signals travel on brain networks and what types of nodes they potentially visit en route. We traced individual path motifs to investigate the propensity of communication paths to explore the putative unimodal-transmodal cortical hierarchy. We find that the architecture of the network promotes signaling via the hierarchy, suggesting a link between the structure and function of the network. Importantly, we also find instances where detours are promoted, particularly as paths traverse attention-related networks. Finally, information about hierarchical position aids navigation in some parts of the network, over and above spatial location. Altogether, the present results touch on several emerging themes in network neuroscience, including the nature of structure-function relationships, network communication and the role of cortical hierarchies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Signal interactions in brain network communication have been little studied. We describe how nonlinear collision rules on simulated mammal brain networks can result in sparse activity dynamics characteristic of mammalian neural systems. We tested the effects of collisions in “information spreading” (IS) routing models and in standard random walk (RW) routing models. Simulations employed synchronous agents on tracer-based mesoscale mammal connectomes at a range of signal loads. We find that RW models have high average activity that increases with load. Activity in RW models is also densely distributed over nodes: a substantial fraction is highly active in a given time window, and this fraction increases with load. Surprisingly, while IS models make many more attempts to pass signals, they show lower net activity due to collisions compared to RW, and activity in IS increases little as function of load. Activity in IS also shows greater sparseness than RW, and sparseness decreases slowly with load. Results hold on two networks of the monkey cortex and one of the mouse whole-brain. We also find evidence that activity is lower and more sparse for empirical networks compared to degree-matched randomized networks under IS, suggesting that brain network topology supports IS-like routing strategies.Author Summary. How do mammal brains control the communication of signals across their entire network? A fundamental goal for any large-scale communication system is managing signal interactions. Yet because brain dynamics are nonlinear and emergent, signal interactions on brain networks have been little studied. Here we investigate two forms of nonlinear signal interaction on the mammal mesoscale connectome: collisions and duplication (redundancy). Using explicit numerical simulations on high-accuracy connectomes of the mouse and monkey, we find evidence that mammal brain networks operate efficiently under a routing strategy that employs destructive collisions and the redundant spread of information. In contrast, standard random walk strategies with the same collision rule are less efficient in terms of global activity and sparseness of activity. Comparisons to randomized networks support these findings.},

We find that a small number of brain regions–the claustrum and the parietal temporal cortex being at the top of the list–are involved in almost all cortical sensory streams.

Based on this approach, we identify 399 pairs of brain regions for which there are very significant changes in the shortest communicability path length after AD appears. We find that 42\% of these regions interconnect both brain hemispheres, 28\% connect regions inside the left hemisphere only, and 20\% affect vermis connection with brain hemispheres. These findings clearly agree with the disconnection syndrome hypothesis of AD. Finally, we show that in 76.9\% of damaged brain regions the shortest communicability path length drops in AD in relation to HC. This counterintuitive finding indicates that AD transforms the brain network into a more efficient system from the perspective of the transmission of the disease, because it drops the circulability of the disease factor around the brain regions in relation to its transmissibility to other regions.Author Summary. We use a geometric measure for the separation of the different regions in the brain, which accounts for how well such regions communicate to each other. Our approach is based on the consideration of a “susceptible-infected” model of the propagation of a disease factor across the brain network. Our first important result is the finding that the shortest communicability path length is significantly better than the shortest topological path length in differentiating patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from healthy individuals. The second and most important finding is the extraction of structural factors that seems to be responsible for the appearance of AD. In particular, we find brain regions in which communicability distance is significantly affected by AD. Most of them interconnect both brain hemispheres or the vermis with them. Remarkably and counterintuitively, we found that in 76.9\% of damaged brain regions there is a drop in the communicability distance, indicating that AD makes the brain network more efficient to the transmission of the disease between brain regions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The connectome provides the structural substrate facilitating communication between brain regions. We aimed to establish whether accounting for polysynaptic communication in structural connectomes would improve prediction of interindividual variation in behavior as well as increase structure-function coupling strength. Connectomes were mapped for 889 healthy adults participating in the Human Connectome Project. To account for polysynaptic signaling, connectomes were transformed into communication matrices for each of 15 different network communication models. Communication matrices were (a) used to perform predictions of five data-driven behavioral dimensions and (b) correlated to resting-state functional connectivity (FC). While FC was the most accurate predictor of behavior, communication models, in particular communicability and navigation, improved the performance of structural connectomes. Communication also strengthened structure-function coupling, with the navigation and shortest paths models leading to 35–65\% increases in association strength with FC. We combined behavioral and functional results into a single ranking that provides insight into which communication models may more faithfully recapitulate underlying neural signaling patterns. Comparing results across multiple connectome mapping pipelines suggested that modeling polysynaptic communication is particularly beneficial in sparse high-resolution connectomes. We conclude that network communication models can augment the functional and behavioral predictive utility of the human structural connectome.Author Summary. Brain network communication models aim to describe the patterns of large-scale neural signaling that facilitate functional interactions between brain regions. While information can be directly communicated between anatomically connected regions, signaling between disconnected areas must occur via a sequence of intermediate regions. We investigated a number of candidate models of connectome communication and found that they improved structure-function coupling and the extent to which structural connectomes can predict interindividual variation in behavior. Comparing the behavioral and functional predictive utility of different models provided initial insight into which conceptualizations of network communication may more faithfully recapitulate biological neural signaling. Our results suggest network communication models as a promising avenue to unite our understanding of brain structure, brain function, and human behavior.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural computation is associated with the emergence, reconfiguration, and dissolution of cell assemblies in the context of varying oscillatory states. Here, we describe the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of cell assemblies through temporal network formalism. We use a sliding window approach to extract sequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise functional connectivity properties evolve through time and as a function of changing global brain state (theta vs. slow-wave oscillations). First, we find that information sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery structure in which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units links to more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating to the core or to the periphery substantially change across time windows, with units entering and leaving the core in a smooth way. Second, we find that discrete network states can be defined on top of this continuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching between network states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to the core and is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory states. Third, we characterize different styles of temporal connectivity that cells can exhibit within each state of the sharing network. While inhibitory cells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization only poorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells. Furthermore, cells can change temporal connectivity style when the network changes state. Altogether, these findings reveal that the sharing of information mediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and entorhinal cortex cell assemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been identified by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional connectivity.Author Summary. It is generally thought that computations performed by local brain circuits rely on complex neural processes, associated with the flexible waxing and waning of cell assemblies, that is, an ensemble of cells firing in tight synchrony. Although cell assembly formation is inherently and unavoidably dynamical, it is still common to find studies in which essentially “static” approaches are used to characterize this process. In the present study, we adopt instead a temporal network approach. Avoiding usual time-averaging procedures, we reveal that hub neurons are not hardwired but that cells vary smoothly their degree of integration within the assembly core. Furthermore, our temporal network framework enables the definition of alternative possible styles of “hubness.” Some cells may share information with a multitude of other units but only in an intermittent manner, as “activists” in a flash mob. In contrast, some other cells may share information in a steadier manner, as resolute “lobbyists.” Finally, by avoiding averages over preimposed states, we show that within each global oscillatory state rich switching dynamics can take place between a repertoire of many available network states. We thus show that the temporal network framework provides a natural and effective language to rigorously describe the rich spatiotemporal patterns of information sharing instantiated by cell assembly evolution.},

Countless studies have advanced our understanding of the human brain and its organization by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to derive network representations of human brain function. However, we do not know to what extent these “functional connectomes” are reliable over time. In a large public sample of healthy participants (N = 833) scanned on two consecutive days, we assessed the test-retest reliability of fMRI functional connectivity and the consequences on reliability of three common sources of variation in analysis workflows: atlas choice, global signal regression, and thresholding. By adopting the intraclass correlation coefficient as a metric, we demonstrate that only a small portion of the functional connectome is characterized by good (6–8\%) to excellent (0.08–0.14\%) reliability. Connectivity between prefrontal, parietal, and temporal areas is especially reliable, but also average connectivity within known networks has good reliability. In general, while unreliable edges are weak, reliable edges are not necessarily strong. Methodologically, reliability of edges varies between atlases, global signal regression decreases reliability for networks and most edges (but increases it for some), and thresholding based on connection strength reduces reliability. Focusing on the reliable portion of the connectome could help quantify brain trait-like features and investigate individual differences using functional neuroimaging.Author Summary.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We implement the dynamical Ising model on the large-scale architecture of white matter connections of healthy subjects in the age range 4–85 years, and analyze the dynamics in terms of the synergy, a quantity measuring the extent to which the joint state of pairs of variables is projected onto the dynamics of a target one. We find that the amount of synergy in explaining the dynamics of the hubs of the structural connectivity (in terms of degree strength) peaks before the critical temperature, and can thus be considered as a precursor of a critical transition. Conversely, the greatest amount of synergy goes into explaining the dynamics of more central nodes. We also find that the aging of structural connectivity is associated with significant changes in the simulated dynamics: There are brain regions whose synergy decreases with age, in particular the frontal pole, the subcallosal area, and the supplementary motor area; these areas could then be more likely to show a decline in terms of the capability to perform higher order computation (if structural connectivity was the sole variable). On the other hand, several regions in the temporal cortex show a positive correlation with age in the first 30 years of life, that is, during brain maturation.Author Summary. In a previous study implementing the Ising model on a 2D lattice, we showed that the joint synergistic information shared by two variables on a target one peaks before the transition to an ordered state (critical point).Here we implemented the same model on individual structural connectomes, to answer these questions:- Does the synergy still peak before the critical point in a nonuniform network?- Are the hubs of structural connectivity also hubs of synergy?- Is there association with age?We found that synergy still peaks before the critical temperature and that hubs of structural connectivity are not among the nodes towards which synergy is highest. Furthermore, using robust measures of association we found both positive and negative associations of synergy with age, in localized clusters. In some regions this association is continuous with age; in others it is limited to around the first 30 years of age.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Human and animal brain studies bring converging evidence of a possible role for the cerebellum and the cerebro-cerebellar system in impulsivity. However, the precise nature of the relation between cerebro-cerebellar coupling and impulsivity is far from understood. Characterizing functional connectivity (FC) patterns between large-scale brain networks that mediate different forms of impulsivity, and the cerebellum may improve our understanding of this relation. Here, we analyzed static and dynamic features of cerebro-cerebellar FC using a highly sampled resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dataset and tested their association with two widely used self-reports of impulsivity: the UPPS-P impulsive behavior scale and the behavioral inhibition/approach systems (BIS/BAS) in a large group of healthy subjects (N = 134, ≈ 1 hr of rs-fMRI/subject). We employed robust data-driven techniques to identify cerebral and cerebellar resting-state networks and extract descriptive summary measures of static and dynamic cerebro-cerebellar FC. We observed evidence linking BIS, BAS, sensation seeking, and lack of premeditation to the total strength and temporal variability of FC within networks connecting regions of the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus with the cerebellum. Overall, our findings improve the existing knowledge of the neural correlates of impulsivity and the behavioral correlates of the cerebro-cerebellar system.Author Summary. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and neuroimaging studies proposes that the cerebellum regulates impulsive behavior through its interactions with brain regions that subserve control and reward processes. To further explore this proposal, we analyzed static and dynamic aspects of resting-state functional connectivity between the cerebellum and distinct large-scale brain networks using robust methods and evaluated them against a set of self-reported measures of impulsivity. We found compelling new evidence linking multiple forms of impulsivity to strength and temporal variability of FC between large-scale cerebral networks, involved in top-down control and reward, and the cerebellum. Our findings highlight the utility of combining static and dynamic FC approaches in furthering current understanding of cerebro-cerebellar coupling and the neurobiology of complex behaviors.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Bridging the gap between symmetric, direct white matter brain connectivity and neural dynamics that are often asymmetric and polysynaptic may offer insights into brain architecture, but this remains an unresolved challenge in neuroscience. Here, we used the graph Laplacian matrix to simulate symmetric and asymmetric high-order diffusion processes akin to particles spreading through white matter pathways. The simulated indirect structural connectivity outperformed direct as well as absent anatomical information in sculpting effective connectivity, a measure of causal and directed brain dynamics. Crucially, an asymmetric diffusion process determined by the sensitivity of the network nodes to their afferents best predicted effective connectivity. The outcome is consistent with brain regions adapting to maintain their sensitivity to inputs within a dynamic range. Asymmetric network communication models offer a promising perspective for understanding the relationship between structural and functional brain connectomes, both in normalcy and neuropsychiatric conditions.Author Summary. Measures of white matter connectivity can usefully inform models of causal and directed brain communication (i.e., effective connectivity). However, due to the inherent differences in biophysical correlates, recording techniques and analytic approaches, the relationship between anatomical and effective brain connectivity is complex and not fully understood. In this study, we use simulation of heat diffusion constrained by the anatomical connectivity of the network to model polysynaptic (high-order) anatomical connectivity. The outcomes afford more useful constraints on effective connectivity than conventional, typically monosynaptic white matter connectivity. Furthermore, asymmetric network diffusion best predicts effective connectivity. In conclusion, the data provide insights into how anatomical connectomes give rise to asymmetric neuronal message passing and brain communication.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Optogenetic stimulation has become the method of choice for investigating neural computation in populations of neurons. Optogenetic experiments often aim to elicit a network response by stimulating specific groups of neurons. However, this is complicated by the fact that optogenetic stimulation is nonlinear, more light does not always equal to more spikes, and neurons that are not directly but indirectly stimulated could have a major impact on how networks respond to optogenetic stimulation. To clarify how optogenetic excitation of some neurons alters the network dynamics, we studied the temporal and spatial response of individual neurons and recurrent neural networks. In individual neurons, we find that neurons show a monotonic, saturating rate response to increasing light intensity and a nonmonotonic rate response to increasing pulse frequency. At the network level, we find that Gaussian light beams elicit spatial firing rate responses that are substantially broader than the stimulus profile. In summary, our analysis and our network simulation code allow us to predict the outcome of an optogenetic experiment and to assess whether the observed effects can be attributed to direct or indirect stimulation of neurons.Author Summary. Optogenetic circuit manipulation has become a popular tool to manipulate the activity of neurons. During optogenetic stimulation, the firing rate of a neuron can rise because of direct light excitation or indirect activation via other neurons. To disentangle these influences and predict the effects of optogenetic excitation, we set up a spiking network model with controlled connectivity and studied its response to light stimulation. We find that the optogenetically evoked activity in a network can spread far beyond the light-stimulated area. We further found a nonmonotonic rate response of single neurons to increasing light intensities and frequencies. Our results help to interpret optogenetic experiments in vivo, and we provide computer code that can be customized to simulate 2D connectivity scenarios and explore their consequences.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Resting-state functional networks such as the default mode network (DMN) dominate spontaneous brain dynamics. To date, the mechanisms linking brain structure and brain dynamics and functions in cognition, perception, and action remain unknown, mainly due to the uncontrolled and erratic nature of the resting state. Here we used a stimulation paradigm to probe the brain’s resting behavior, providing insights on state-space stability and multiplicity of network trajectories after stimulation. We performed explorations on a mouse model to map spatiotemporal brain dynamics as a function of the stimulation site. We demonstrated the emergence of known functional networks in brain responses. Several responses heavily relied on the DMN and were suggestive of the DMN playing a mechanistic role between functional networks. We probed the simulated brain responses to the stimulation of regions along the information processing chains of sensory systems from periphery up to primary sensory cortices. Moreover, we compared simulated dynamics against in vivo brain responses to optogenetic stimulation. Our results underwrite the importance of anatomical connectivity in the functional organization of brain networks and demonstrate how functionally differentiated information processing chains arise from the same system.Author Summary. We demonstrate how functionally differentiated information processing chains arise from the same anatomical network. The main result of the in-silico mouse brain simulations is the emergence of specific functional networks based on structural data from the mouse brain. When the brain is stimulated, for example, by sensory inputs or direct electrical stimulation, the brain initially responds with activities in specific regions. The brain’s anatomical connectivity constrains the subsequent pattern formation. We built a high-resolution mouse brain network model. The model structure originated from experimental data. We systematically explored the mouse model and investigated the simulated brain dynamics after stimulation. Known functional networks emerged in the simulated brain responses. The default mode network occurred in almost all characteristic response patterns. Simulated brain response dynamics and in-vivo response dynamics of the mouse brain to optogenetic stimulation showed similarities even without parameter tuning. Anatomical connectivity and dynamics shape the functional organization of brain networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Intrinsic timescales of activity fluctuations vary hierarchically across the brain. This variation reflects a broad gradient of functional specialization in information storage and processing, with integrative association areas displaying slower timescales that are thought to reflect longer temporal processing windows. The organization of timescales is associated with cognitive function, distinctive between individuals, and disrupted in disease, but we do not yet understand how the temporal properties of activity dynamics are shaped by the brain’s underlying structural connectivity network. Using resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI data from 100 healthy individuals from the Human Connectome Project, here we show that the timescale of resting-state fMRI dynamics increases with structural connectivity strength, matching recent results in the mouse brain. Our results hold at the level of individuals, are robust to parcellation schemes, and are conserved across a range of different timescale- related statistics. We establish a comprehensive BOLD dynamical signature of structural connectivity strength by comparing over 6,000 time series features, highlighting a range of new temporal features for characterizing BOLD dynamics, including measures of stationarity and symbolic motif frequencies. Our findings indicate a conserved property of mouse and human brain organization in which a brain region’s spontaneous activity fluctuations are closely related to their surrounding structural scaffold.Author Summary. Reflecting structural and functional differences across brain regions, the spontaneous dynamics of neural activity vary correspondingly. Dynamical timescales are thought to be organized hierarchically, with slower timescales in integrative association areas, consistent with longer durations of information processing. In the mouse brain, this variation in BOLD dynamical properties follows the variation in structural connectivity strength, with more strongly connected regions exhibiting slower dynamics. Here we show a consistent variation in human cortex that holds at the level of individuals, and characterize a range of BOLD properties that vary strongly with structural connectivity strength. Our results indicate a conserved property of mouse and human brain organization in which a brain area’s spontaneous activity fluctuations are closely related to its structural connectivity strength.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recently, EEG recording techniques and source analysis have improved, making it feasible to tap into fast network dynamics. Yet, analyzing whole-cortex EEG signals in source space is not standard, partly because EEG suffers from volume conduction: Functional connectivity (FC) reflecting genuine functional relationships is impossible to disentangle from spurious FC introduced by volume conduction. Here, we investigate the relationship between white matter structural connectivity (SC) and large-scale network structure encoded in EEG-FC. We start by confirming that FC (power envelope correlations) is predicted by SC beyond the impact of Euclidean distance, in line with the assumption that SC mediates genuine FC. We then use information from white matter structural connectivity in order to smooth the EEG signal in the space spanned by graphs derived from SC. Thereby, FC between nearby, structurally connected brain regions increases while FC between nonconnected regions remains unchanged, resulting in an increase in genuine, SC-mediated FC. We analyze the induced changes in FC, assessing the resemblance between EEG-FC and volume-conduction- free fMRI-FC, and find that smoothing increases resemblance in terms of overall correlation and community structure. This result suggests that our method boosts genuine FC, an outcome that is of interest for many EEG network neuroscience questions.Author Summary. In this study, we combine high-density EEG recorded during resting state with white matter connectivity obtained from diffusion MRI and fiber tracking. We leverage the additional information contained in the structural connectome towards augmenting the source-level EEG functional connectivity. In particular, it is known—and confirmed in this study—that the activity of brain regions that possess a direct anatomical connection is, on average, more strongly correlated than that of regions that have no such direct link. We use the structural connectome to define a graph and smooth the source-reconstructed EEG signal in the space spanned by this graph. We compare the resulting “filtered” signal correlation matrices with those obtained from fMRI and find that such “graph filtering” improves the agreement between EEG and fMRI functional connectivity structure. This suggests that structural connectivity can be used to attenuate some of the limitations imposed by volume conduction.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Humans process faces by using a network of face-selective regions distributed across the brain. Neuropsychological patient studies demonstrate that focal damage to nodes in this network can impair face recognition, but such patients are rare. We approximated the effects of damage to the face network in neurologically normal human participants by using theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS). Multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state data were collected pre- and post-TBS delivery over the face-selective right superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS), or a control site in the right motor cortex. Results showed that TBS delivered over the rpSTS reduced resting-state connectivity across the extended face processing network. This connectivity reduction was observed not only between the rpSTS and other face-selective areas, but also between nonstimulated face-selective areas across the ventral, medial, and lateral brain surfaces (e.g., between the right amygdala and bilateral fusiform face areas and occipital face areas). TBS delivered over the motor cortex did not produce significant changes in resting-state connectivity across the face processing network. These results demonstrate that, even without task-induced fMRI signal changes, disrupting a single node in a brain network can decrease the functional connectivity between nodes in that network that have not been directly stimulated.Author Summary. Human behavior is dependent on brain networks that perform different cognitive functions. We combined theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) with resting-state fMRI to study the face processing network. Disruption of the face-selective right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) reduced fMRI connectivity across the face network. This impairment in connectivity was observed not only between the rpSTS and other face-selective areas, but also between nonstimulated face-selective areas on the ventral and medial brain surfaces (e.g., between the right amygdala and bilateral fusiform face areas and occipital face areas). Thus, combined TBS/fMRI can be used to approximate and measure the effects of focal brain damage on brain networks, and suggests such an approach may be useful for mapping intrinsic network organization.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Studies of brain activity during number processing suggest symbolic and nonsymbolic numerical stimuli (e.g., Arabic digits and dot arrays) engage both shared and distinct neural mechanisms. However, the extent to which number format influences large-scale functional network organization is unknown. In this study, using 7 Tesla MRI, we adopted a network neuroscience approach to characterize the whole-brain functional architecture supporting symbolic and nonsymbolic number comparison in 33 adults. Results showed the degree of global modularity was similar for both formats. The symbolic format, however, elicited stronger community membership among auditory regions, whereas for nonsymbolic, stronger membership was observed within and between cingulo-opercular/salience network and basal ganglia communities. The right posterior inferior temporal gyrus, left intraparietal sulcus, and two regions in the right ventromedial occipital cortex demonstrated robust differences between formats in terms of their community membership, supporting prior findings that these areas are differentially engaged based on number format. Furthermore, a unified fronto-parietal/dorsal attention community in the nonsymbolic condition was fractionated into two components in the symbolic condition. Taken together, these results reveal a pattern of overlapping and distinct network architectures for symbolic and nonsymbolic number processing.Author Summary. Previous studies of local activity levels suggest that both shared and distinct neural mechanisms support the processing of symbolic (Arabic digits) and nonsymbolic (dot sets) number stimuli, involving regions distributed across frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Network-level characterizations of functional connectivity patterns underlying number processing have gone unexplored, however. In this study we examined the whole-brain functional architecture of symbolic and nonsymbolic number comparison. Stronger community membership was observed among auditory regions during symbolic processing, and among cingulo-opercular/salience and basal ganglia networks for nonsymbolic. A dual versus unified fronto-parietal/dorsal attention community organization was observed for symbolic and nonsymbolic formats, respectively. Finally, the inferior temporal gyrus and left intraparietal sulcus, both thought to be preferentially involved in processing number symbols, demonstrated robust differences in community membership between formats.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The identifiability framework (𝕀f) has been shown to improve differential identifiability (reliability across-sessions and -sites, and differentiability across-subjects) of functional connectomes for a variety of fMRI tasks. But having a robust single session/subject functional connectome is just the starting point to subsequently assess network properties for characterizing properties of integration, segregation, and communicability, among others. Naturally, one wonders whether uncovering identifiability at the connectome level also uncovers identifiability on the derived network properties. This also raises the question of where to apply the 𝕀f framework: on the connectivity data or directly on each network measurement? Our work answers these questions by exploring the differential identifiability profiles of network measures when 𝕀f is applied (a) on the functional connectomes, and (b) directly on derived network measurements. Results show that improving across-session reliability of functional connectomes (FCs) also improves reliability of derived network measures. We also find that, for specific network properties, application of 𝕀f directly on network properties is more effective. Finally, we discover that applying the framework, either way, increases task sensitivity of network properties. At a time when the neuroscientific community is focused on subject-level inferences, this framework is able to uncover FC fingerprints, which propagate to derived network properties.Author Summary. Functional connectome (FC) fingerprinting recently became a topic of great interest in network neuroscience. We recently proposed a framework to improve brain fingerprint (i.e., identifiability) of FCs, which improves not only test-retest reliability but also the correlation of FCs with fluid intelligence. However, does this improvement in FC fingerprints propagate to the derived network measures? In this work we found that improving the fingerprint (differential identifiability) of the functional connectome also improves the “fingerprint” of its network properties. Furthermore, when using the identifiability framework on the network properties directly, certain network properties like search information and communicability add to the FC fingerprint. Finally, we show that enhancement of the fingerprint in the network measures, in a wide range of cognitive tasks, using the identifiability framework also improves task sensitivity in these measures. We show that regardless of whether you are using functional connectomes or the network properties derived from them, using the 𝕀f framework on the functional connectomes would be a beneficial first step.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neural information processing is widely understood to depend on correlations in neuronal activity. However, whether correlation is favorable or not is contentious. Here, we sought to determine how correlated activity and information processing are related in cortical circuits. Using recordings of hundreds of spiking neurons in organotypic cultures of mouse neocortex, we asked whether mutual information between neurons that feed into a common third neuron increased synergistic information processing by the receiving neuron. We found that mutual information and synergistic processing were positively related at synaptic timescales (0.05–14 ms), where mutual information values were low. This effect was mediated by the increase in information transmission—of which synergistic processing is a component—that resulted as mutual information grew. However, at extrasynaptic windows (up to 3,000 ms), where mutual information values were high, the relationship between mutual information and synergistic processing became negative. In this regime, greater mutual information resulted in a disproportionate increase in redundancy relative to information transmission. These results indicate that the emergence of synergistic processing from correlated activity differs according to timescale and correlation regime. In a low-correlation regime, synergistic processing increases with greater correlation, and in a high-correlation regime, synergistic processing decreases with greater correlation.Author Summary. In the present work, we address the question of whether correlated activity in functional networks of cortical circuits supports neural computation. To do so, we combined network analysis with information theoretic tools to analyze the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons recorded from organotypic cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that, at timescales most relevant to direct neuronal communication, neurons with more correlated activity predicted greater computation, suggesting that correlated activity does support computation in cortical circuits. Importantly, this result reversed at timescales less relevant to direct neuronal communication, where even greater correlated activity predicted decreased computation. Thus, the relationship between correlated activity and computation depends on the timescale and the degree of correlation in neuronal interactions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) bridge brain connectivity across timescales. During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely unexplored. Here we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connICA) framework to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state datasets (total 40 subjects). Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first component has a uniformly distributed EEG frequency fingerprint linked mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities. Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG. The first hybrid component suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span timescales, from millisecond range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG to second range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI over individuals.Author Summary. Functional connectivity is governed by a whole-brain organization measurable over multiple timescales by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). The relationship across the whole-brain organization captured at the different timescales of EEG and fMRI is largely unknown. Using concurrent EEG-fMRI, we identified spatially independent components consisting of brain connectivity patterns that co-occur in EEG and fMRI over subjects. We observed a component with similar connectivity organization across EEG and fMRI as well as a component with divergent connectivity. The former component governed all EEG frequencies while the latter was modulated by frequency. These findings show that part of functional connectivity organizes in a common spatial layout over several timescales, while a spatially independent part is modulated by frequency-specific information.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Ongoing thought patterns constitute important aspects of both healthy and abnormal human cognition. However, the neural mechanisms behind these daily experiences and their contribution to well-being remain a matter of debate. Here, using resting-state fMRI and retrospective thought sampling in a large neurotypical cohort (n = 211), we identified two distinct patterns of thought, broadly describing the participants’ current concerns and future plans, that significantly explained variability in the individual functional connectomes. Consistent with the view that ongoing thoughts are an emergent property of multiple neural systems, network-based analysis highlighted the central importance of both unimodal and transmodal cortices in the generation of these experiences. Importantly, while state-dependent current concerns predicted better psychological health, mediating the effect of functional connectomes, trait-level future plans were related to better social health, yet with no mediatory influence. Collectively, we show that ongoing thoughts can influence the link between brain physiology and well-being.Author Summary. Occupying a considerable portion of our waking lives, spontaneous thoughts constitute the foundations of our rich inner mental experiences and well-being. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms behind this cognitive process and its relation to our mental health remain unresolved. In a large cohort of participants, we show that distinct dimensions of ongoing thoughts emerge from a broad set of whole-brain functional interactions, with certain patterns significantly mediating the link between brain connectivity and psychosocial health. Overall, these results highlight the heterogeneous nature of self-generated thoughts, the content and form of which have a significant influence on the association between our brain physiology and mental well-being.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. An overarching goal of neuroscience research is to understand how heterogeneous neuronal ensembles cohere into networks of coordinated activity to support cognition. To investigate how local activity harmonizes with global signals, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) while single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) perturbed occipital and parietal cortices. We estimate the rapid network reconfigurations in dynamic network communities within specific frequency bands of the EEG, and characterize two distinct features of network reconfiguration, flexibility and allegiance, among spatially distributed neural sources following TMS. Using distance from the stimulation site to infer local and global effects, we find that alpha activity (8–12 Hz) reflects concurrent local and global effects on network dynamics. Pairwise allegiance of brain regions to communities on average increased near the stimulation site, whereas TMS-induced changes to flexibility were generally invariant to distance and stimulation site. In contrast, communities within the beta (13–20 Hz) band demonstrated a high level of spatial specificity, particularly within a cluster comprising paracentral areas. Together, these results suggest that focal magnetic neurostimulation to distinct cortical sites can help identify both local and global effects on brain network dynamics, and highlight fundamental differences in the manifestation of network reconfigurations within alpha and beta frequency bands.Author Summary. TMS may be used to probe the causal link between local regional activity and global brain dynamics. Using simultaneous TMS-EEG and dynamic community detection, we introduce what we call “resonating communities” or frequency band-specific clusters in the brain, as a way to index local and global processing. These resonating communities within the alpha and beta bands display both global (or integrating) behavior and local specificity, highlighting fundamental differences in the manifestation of network reconfigurations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. While numerous studies of ephaptic interactions have focused on either axons of peripheral nerves or on cortical structures, no attention has been given to the possibility of ephaptic interactions in white matter tracts. Inspired by the highly organized, tightly packed geometry of axons in fiber pathways, we aim to investigate the potential effects of ephaptic interactions along these structures that are resilient to experimental probing. We use axonal cable theory to derive a minimal model of a sheet of N ephaptically coupled axons. Numerical solutions of the proposed model are explored as ephaptic coupling is varied. We demonstrate that ephaptic interactions can lead to local phase locking between adjacent traveling impulses and that, as coupling is increased, traveling impulses trigger new impulses along adjacent axons, resulting in finite size traveling fronts. For strong enough coupling, impulses propagate laterally and backwards, resulting in complex spatiotemporal patterns. While common large-scale brain network models often model fiber pathways as simple relays of signals between different brain regions, our work calls for a closer reexamination of the validity of such a view. The results suggest that in the presence of significant ephaptic interactions, the brain fiber tracts can act as a dynamic active medium.Author Summary. Starting from the FitzHugh-Nagumo cable model, we derive a system of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) to model a sheet of N ephaptically coupled axons. We also present a continuous limit approximation transforming the model into a two-dimensional field equation. We numerically solve the equations exploring the dynamics as coupling strength is varied. We observe phase locking of adjacent impulses and coordination of subthreshold dynamics. Strong enough coupling generates complex spatiotemporal patterns as new impulses form traveling fronts propagating laterally and backwards. The transition between different dynamic regimes happens abruptly at critical values of parameter. The results put into question the validity of assuming the role of fiber pathways to be that of mere interneuronal transmission and call for further investigation of the matter.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The complexity of brain activity has been observed at many spatial scales and has been proposed to differentiate between mental states and disorders. Here we introduced a new measure of (global) network complexity, constructed as the sum of the complexities of its nodes (i.e., local complexity). The complexity of each node is obtained by comparing the sample entropy of the time series generated by the movement of a random walker on the network resulting from removing the node and its connections, with the sample entropy of the time series obtained from a regular lattice (ordered state) and a random network (disordered state). We studied the complexity of fMRI-based resting-state networks. We found that positively correlated (pos) networks comprising only the positive functional connections have higher complexity than anticorrelation (neg) networks (comprising the negative connections) and the network consisting of the absolute value of all connections (abs). We also observed a significant correlation between complexity and the strength of functional connectivity in the pos network. Our results suggest that the pos network is related to the information processing in the brain and that functional connectivity studies should analyze pos and neg networks separately instead of the abs network, as is commonly done.Author Summary. Current measures of network complexity fail to capture the structural and functional diversity of brain networks, in which hierarchies of linked communities span across several spatial scales, from cortical minicolumns to large-scale networks. In this paper we use random walks processes to obtain a time series reflecting the complex structure of brain networks and use this time series to construct measures of local and global complexity. We found that complexity is significantly correlated to the strength of the connections in the positively correlated brain network, being stronger at the global than at the local scale.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Brain connectivity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular approach for detecting differences between healthy and clinical populations. Before creating a functional brain network, the fMRI time series must undergo several preprocessing steps to control for artifacts and to improve data quality. However, preprocessing may affect the results in an undesirable way. Spatial smoothing, for example, is known to alter functional network structure. Yet, its effects on group-level network differences remain unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of spatial smoothing on the difference between patients and controls for two clinical conditions: autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder, considering fMRI data smoothed with Gaussian kernels (0–32 mm). We find that smoothing affects network differences between groups. For weighted networks, incrementing the smoothing kernel makes networks more different. For thresholded networks, larger smoothing kernels lead to more similar networks, although this depends on the network density. Smoothing also alters the effect sizes of the individual link differences. This is independent of the region of interest (ROI) size, but varies with link length. The effects of spatial smoothing are diverse, nontrivial, and difficult to predict. This has important consequences: The choice of smoothing kernel affects the observed network differences.Author Summary. Spatial smoothing is a preprocessing tool commonly applied to reduce the amount of noise in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. However, smoothing is known to affect the outcomes of functional brain network analysis at the level of individual subjects in undesired ways. Here, we investigate how spatial smoothing affects the observed differences in brain network structure between subject groups. Using fMRI data from two clinical populations and healthy controls, we show that the between-group differences in network structure depend on the amount of spatial smoothing applied during preprocessing in a nontrivial way. The optimal level of spatial smoothing is difficult to define and probably depends on a set of analysis parameters. Therefore, we recommend applying spatial smoothing only after careful consideration.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Adherence determines the success and benefits of mental training (e.g., meditation) programs. It is unclear why some participants engage more actively in programs for mental training than others. Understanding neurobiological factors that predict adherence is necessary for understanding elements of learning and to inform better designs for new learning regimens. Clustering patterns in brain networks have been suggested to predict learning performance, but it is unclear whether these patterns contribute to motivational aspects of learning such as adherence. This study tests whether configurations of brain connections in resting-state fMRI scans can be used to predict adherence to two programs: meditation and creative writing. Results indicate that greater system segregation and clustering predict the number of practice sessions and class participation in both programs at a wide range of network thresholds (corrected p value &amp;lt; 0.05). At a local level, regions in subcortical circuitry such as striatum and accumbens predicted adherence in all subjects. Furthermore, there were also some important distinctions between groups: Adherence to meditation was predicted by connectivity within local network of the anterior insula and default mode network; and in the writing program, adherence was predicted by network neighborhood of frontal and temporal regions. Four machine learning methods were applied to test the robustness of the brain metric for classifying individual capacity for adherence and yielded reasonable accuracy. Overall, these findings underscore the fact that adherence and the ability to perform prescribed exercises is associated with organizational patterns of brain connectivity.Author Summary. Individuals vary in their ability to adhere to learning new skills. We have found that even before individuals undergo training, their brain connectivity patterns are predictive of their capacity to perform the prescribed exercises. We report that variability in brain connectivity contributes to the capacity for adhering to prescribed learning instructions such as meditation. Thus, adherence is associated with the extent of clustering and segregation between known resting-state subnetworks. These findings indicate that system segregation is a determinant feature of the motivation to learn new mental exercises and, more specifically, is conducive for adherence to learning.},

We first introduce the graph similarity problem in brain network application. We then describe the methodological background of the available metrics and algorithms of comparing graphs, their strengths, and limitations.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Network neuroscience applied to epilepsy holds promise to map pathological networks, localize seizure generators, and inform targeted interventions to control seizures. However, incomplete sampling of the epileptic brain because of sparse placement of intracranial electrodes may affect model results. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of several published network measures to incomplete spatial sampling and propose an algorithm using network subsampling to determine confidence in model results. We retrospectively evaluated intracranial EEG data from 28 patients implanted with grid, strip, and depth electrodes during evaluation for epilepsy surgery. We recalculated global and local network metrics after randomly and systematically removing subsets of intracranial EEG electrode contacts. We found that sensitivity to incomplete sampling varied significantly across network metrics. This sensitivity was largely independent of whether seizure onset zone contacts were targeted or spared from removal. We present an algorithm using random subsampling to compute patient-specific confidence intervals for network localizations. Our findings highlight the difference in robustness between commonly used network metrics and provide tools to assess confidence in intracranial network localization. We present these techniques as an important step toward translating personalized network models of seizures into rigorous, quantitative approaches to invasive therapy.Author Summary. Network neuroscience applied to epileptic brains seeks to identify pathological neural connections that promote and maintain seizures, and holds promise to guide surgical planning in patients with intractable epilepsy. However, sampling of the epileptic network in intracranial EEG recording is limited by the choice of where to place intracranial electrodes, which is highly variable within and between epilepsy centers. The effect of incomplete spatial sampling generated by sparse electrode placement on network statistics is unknown. Here, we determine the sensitivity of several network statistics to incomplete spatial sampling, and we propose a method using electrode subsampling to determine patient-specific confidence intervals in network model predictions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The contribution of structural connectivity to functional brain states remains poorly understood. We present a mathematical and computational study suited to assess the structure–function issue, treating a system of Jansen–Rit neural mass nodes with heterogeneous structural connections estimated from diffusion MRI data provided by the Human Connectome Project. Via direct simulations we determine the similarity of functional (inferred from correlated activity between nodes) and structural connectivity matrices under variation of the parameters controlling single-node dynamics, highlighting a nontrivial structure–function relationship in regimes that support limit cycle oscillations. To determine their relationship, we firstly calculate network instabilities giving rise to oscillations, and the so-called ‘false bifurcations’ (for which a significant qualitative change in the orbit is observed, without a change of stability) occurring beyond this onset. We highlight that functional connectivity (FC) is inherited robustly from structure when node dynamics are poised near a Hopf bifurcation, whilst near false bifurcations, and structure only weakly influences FC. Secondly, we develop a weakly coupled oscillator description to analyse oscillatory phase-locked states and, furthermore, show how the modular structure of FC matrices can be predicted via linear stability analysis. This study thereby emphasises the substantial role that local dynamics can have in shaping large-scale functional brain states.Author Summary. Patterns of oscillation across the brain arise because of structural connections between brain regions. However, the type of oscillation at a site may also play a contributory role. We focus on an idealised model of a neural mass network, coupled using estimates of structural connections obtained via tractography on Human Connectome Project MRI data. Using a mixture of computational and mathematical techniques, we show that functional connectivity is inherited most strongly from structural connectivity when the network nodes are poised at a Hopf bifurcation. However, beyond the onset of this oscillatory instability a phase-locked network state can undergo a false bifurcation, and structural connectivity only weakly influences functional connectivity. This highlights the important effect that local dynamics can have on large-scale brain states.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Large-scale patterns of spontaneous whole-brain activity seen in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are in part believed to arise from neural populations interacting through the structural network (Honey, Kötter, Breakspear, &amp;amp; Sporns, 2007). Generative models that simulate this network activity, called brain network models (BNM), are able to reproduce global averaged properties of empirical rs-fMRI activity such as functional connectivity (FC) but perform poorly in reproducing unique trajectories and state transitions that are observed over the span of minutes in whole-brain data (Cabral, Kringelbach, &amp;amp; Deco, 2017; Kashyap &amp;amp; Keilholz, 2019). The manuscript demonstrates that by using recurrent neural networks, it can fit the BNM in a novel way to the rs-fMRI data and predict large amounts of variance between subsequent measures of rs-fMRI data. Simulated data also contain unique repeating trajectories observed in rs-fMRI, called quasiperiodic patterns (QPP), that span 20 s and complex state transitions observed using k-means analysis on windowed FC matrices (Allen et al., 2012; Majeed et al., 2011). Our approach is able to estimate the manifold of rs-fMRI dynamics by training on generating subsequent time points, and it can simulate complex resting-state trajectories better than the traditional generative approaches.Author Summary. Brain network models have become a promising theoretical framework for simulating signals that are representative of whole-brain activity such as resting-state fMRI. However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity obtained from simulations with empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics to characterize coordination between regions such as functional connectivity. In this manuscript, we extend this work by utilizing modern machine learning techniques to fit the brain network models to observed data and train on the mismatch between the model and observed signal. Our results show that our system training on these new metrics generalizes to a system that is able to reproduce trajectories and complex state transitions seen in rs-fMRI over the span of minutes. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole-brain activity.},

These networks exhibit structural characteristics such as hierarchical architectures, small-world attributes, and scale-free topologies, providing the basis for the emergence of rich temporal characteristics such as scale-free dynamics and long-range temporal correlations. Devices that have both the topological and the temporal features of a neuronal network would be a significant step toward constructing a neuromorphic system that can emulate the computational ability and energy efficiency of the human brain. Here we use numerical simulations to show that percolating networks of nanoparticles exhibit structural properties that are reminiscent of biological neuronal networks, and then show experimentally that stimulation of percolating networks by an external voltage stimulus produces temporal dynamics that are self-similar, follow power-law scaling, and exhibit long-range temporal correlations. These results are expected to have important implications for the development of neuromorphic devices, especially for those based on the concept of reservoir computing.Author Summary. Biological neuronal networks exhibit well-defined properties such as hierarchical structures and scale-free topologies, as well as a high degree of local clustering and short path lengths between nodes. These structural properties are intimately connected to the observed long-range temporal correlations in the network dynamics. Fabrication of artificial networks with similar structural properties would facilitate brain-like (“neuromorphic”) computing. Here we show experimentally that percolating networks of nanoparticles exhibit similar long-range temporal correlations to those of biological neuronal networks and use simulations to demonstrate that the dynamics arise from an underlying scale-free network architecture. We discuss similarities between the biological and percolating systems and highlight the potential for the percolating networks to be used in neuromorphic computing applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Both natural and engineered networks are often modular. Whether a network node interacts with only nodes from its own module or nodes from multiple modules provides insight into its functional role. The participation coefficient (PC) is typically used to measure this attribute, although its value also depends on the size and connectedness of the module it belongs to and may lead to nonintuitive identification of highly connected nodes. Here, we develop a normalized PC that reduces the influence of intramodular connectivity compared with the conventional PC. Using brain, C. elegans, airport, and simulated networks, we show that our measure of participation is not influenced by the size or connectedness of modules, while preserving conceptual and mathematical properties, of the classic formulation of PC. Unlike the conventional PC, we identify London and New York as high participators in the air traffic network and demonstrate stronger associations with working memory in human brain networks, yielding new insights into nodal participation across network modules.Author Summary. It is challenging to reliably quantify how single elements (i.e., nodes) in a network are connected to different subcomponents (i.e., modules) of a network; this is important as intermodular connectivity contribute to efficient and distributed information processing. Participation coefficient (PC) calculates how distributed nodes are across modules. But PC is influenced by modularity algorithms that tend to favor large modules with strong intramodule connectivity, that in turn generate low PC values, even if a node has strong intermodule connectivity. We use a network randomization approach and show that by reducing the influence of intramodular connectivity, we obtain node participation results unaffected by size and connectedness of modules. This provides network scientists with new insights into the intermodular connectivity configurations of complex networks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The research of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in its early stages and its progression till symptomatic onset is essential to understand the pathology and investigate new treatments. Animal models provide a helpful approach to this research, since they allow for controlled follow-up during the disease evolution. In this work, transgenic TgF344-AD rats were longitudinally evaluated starting at 6 months of age. Every 3 months, cognitive abilities were assessed by a memory-related task and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired. Structural and functional brain networks were estimated and characterized by graph metrics to identify differences between the groups in connectivity, its evolution with age, and its influence on cognition. Structural networks of transgenic animals were altered since the earliest stage. Likewise, aging significantly affected network metrics in TgF344-AD, but not in the control group. In addition, while the structural brain network influenced cognitive outcome in transgenic animals, functional network impacted how control subjects performed. TgF344-AD brain network alterations were present from very early stages, difficult to identify in clinical research. Likewise, the characterization of aging in these animals, involving structural network reorganization and its effects on cognition, opens a window to evaluate new treatments for the disease.Author Summary. We have applied magnetic resonance image–based connectomics to characterize TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This represents a highly translational approach, what is essential to investigate potential treatments. TgF344-AD animals were evaluated from early to advanced ages to describe alterations in brain connectivity and how brain networks are affected by age. Results showed that aging had a bigger impact in the structural connectivity of the TgF344-AD than in control animals, and that changes in the structural network, already observed at early ages, significantly influenced cognitive outcome of transgenic animals. Alterations in connectivity were similar to that described in AD human studies and complement them by providing insights into earlier stages and a plot of AD effects throughout the whole life span.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. It is yet unclear to what extent JME leads to abnormal network activation patterns. Here, we characterized statistical regularities in magnetoencephalograph (MEG) resting-state networks and their differences between JME patients and controls by combining a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM) and novel energy landscape analyses for MEG. First, we fitted the pMEM to the MEG oscillatory power in the front-oparietal network (FPN) and other resting-state networks, which provided a good estimation of the occurrence probability of network states. Then, we used energy values derived from the pMEM to depict an energy landscape, with a higher energy state corresponding to a lower occurrence probability. JME patients showed fewer local energy minima than controls and had elevated energy values for the FPN within the theta, beta, and gamma bands. Furthermore, simulations of the fitted pMEM showed that the proportion of time the FPN was occupied within the basins of energy minima was shortened in JME patients. These network alterations were highlighted by significant classification of individual participants employing energy values as multivariate features. Our findings suggested that JME patients had altered multistability in selective functional networks and frequency bands in the fronto-parietal cortices.Author Summary. We proposed an energy landscape method to quantify the occurrence probability of network states in magnetoencephalograph (MEG) oscillatory power during rest, which was derived from a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM). We compared the energy landscapes measures of three resting-state networks between patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and healthy controls. The pMEM provided a good fit to the binarized MEG oscillatory power in both patients and controls. Patients with JME exhibited fewer local minima of the energy and elevated energy values than controls, predominately in the fronto-parietal network across multiple frequency bands. Furthermore, multivariate features constructed from energy landscapes allowed significant single-patient classification. Our results further highlighted the pMEM as a descriptive, generative, and predictive model for characterizing atypical functional network properties in brain disorders.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Neuroimaging techniques are now widely used to study human cognition. The functional associations between brain areas have become a standard proxy to describe how cognitive processes are distributed across the brain network. Among the many analysis tools available, dynamic models of brain activity have been developed to overcome the limitations of original connectivity measures such as functional connectivity. This goes in line with the many efforts devoted to the assessment of directional interactions between brain areas from the observed neuroimaging activity. This opinion article provides an overview of our model-based whole-brain effective connectivity to analyze fMRI data, while discussing the pros and cons of our approach with respect to other established approaches. Our framework relies on the multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MOU) process and is thus referred to as MOU-EC. Once tuned, the model provides a directed connectivity estimate that reflects the dynamical state of BOLD activity, which can be used to explore cognition. We illustrate this approach using two applications on task-evoked fMRI data. First, as a connectivity measure, MOU-EC can be used to extract biomarkers for task-specific brain coordination, understood as the patterns of areas exchanging information. The multivariate nature of connectivity measures raises several challenges for whole-brain analysis, for which machine-learning tools present some advantages over statistical testing. Second, we show how to interpret changes in MOU-EC connections in a collective and model-based manner, bridging with network analysis. Our framework provides a comprehensive set of tools that open exciting perspectives to study distributed cognition, as well as neuropathologies.Author Summary. Brain connectivity measures have been increasingly used to study cognition and neuropathologies with neuroimaging data. Many methods have been developed with particular objectives, in particular predictability to obtain biomarkers (i.e., which brain regions exhibit changes in their interactions across conditions) and interpretability (relating the connectivity measures back to the biology). In this article we present our framework for whole-brain effective connectivity that aims to find the equilibrium between these two desired properties, relying on a dynamic model that can be fitted to fMRI time series. Meanwhile, we compare it with previous work. Concretely, we show how machine learning can be used to extract biomarkers and how network-oriented analysis can be used to interpret the model estimates in terms of brain dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Identifying the physiological processes underlying the emergence and maintenance of consciousness is one of the most fundamental problems of neuroscience, with implications ranging from fundamental neuroscience to the treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs). One major challenge is to understand how cortical circuits at drastically different spatial scales, from local networks to brain-scale networks, operate in concert to enable consciousness, and how those processes are impaired in DOC patients. In this review, we attempt to relate available neurophysiological and clinical data with existing theoretical models of consciousness, while linking the micro- and macrocircuit levels. First, we address the relationships between awareness and wakefulness on the one hand, and cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity on the other hand. Second, we discuss the role of three main types of GABAergic interneurons in specific circuits responsible for the dynamical reorganization of functional networks. Third, we explore advances in the functional role of nested oscillations for neural synchronization and communication, emphasizing the importance of the balance between local (high-frequency) and distant (low-frequency) activity for efficient information processing. The clinical implications of these theoretical considerations are presented. We propose that such cellular-scale mechanisms could extend current theories of consciousness.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Synaptic connectivity between neocortical neurons is highly structured. The network structure of synaptic connectivity includes first-order properties that can be described by pairwise statistics, such as strengths of connections between different neuron types and distance-dependent connectivity, and higher order properties, such as an abundance of cliques of all-to-all connected neurons. The relative impact of first- and higher order structure on emergent cortical network activity is unknown. Here, we compare network structure and emergent activity in two neocortical microcircuit models with different synaptic connectivity. Both models have a similar first-order structure, but only one model includes higher order structure arising from morphological diversity within neuronal types. We find that such morphological diversity leads to more heterogeneous degree distributions, increases the number of cliques, and contributes to a small-world topology. The increase in higher order network structure is accompanied by more nuanced changes in neuronal firing patterns, such as an increased dependence of pairwise correlations on the positions of neurons in cliques. Our study shows that circuit models with very similar first-order structure of synaptic connectivity can have a drastically different higher order network structure, and suggests that the higher order structure imposed by morphological diversity within neuronal types has an impact on emergent cortical activity.Author Summary. We seek to understand how certain characteristics in the structure of neuron-to-neuron connectivity shape the activity of local neural circuits. The local connectivity of cortical networks features a nonrandom higher order structure characterized by the presence of tightly connected clusters of neurons. We use a biologically detailed model of neocortical microcircuitry that recreates these features and simplify its complexity algorithmically while preserving the larger scale connectivity trends. We then simulate spontaneous and evoked activity in the two models with simplified and complex connectivity and compare the resulting spiking statistics. The results allow us to characterize the role of the higher level structure of connectivity in interaction with other biological features shaping neuronal activity such as synaptic adaptation and noise.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) estimate organization of the cortex as a biologically meaningful set of similarities between anatomical features at the macro- and microstructural level, derived from multiple structural MRI (sMRI) sequences. These networks are clinically relevant, predicting 40\% variance in IQ. However, the sequences required (T1w, T2w, DWI) to produce these networks are longer acquisitions, less feasible in some populations. Thus, estimating MSNs using features from T1w sMRI is attractive to clinical and developmental neuroscience. We studied whether reduced-feature approaches approximate the original MSN model as a potential tool to investigate brain structure. In a large, homogenous dataset of healthy young adults (from the Human Connectome Project, HCP), we extended previous investigations of reduced-feature MSNs by comparing not only T1w-derived networks, but also additional MSNs generated with fewer MR sequences, to their full acquisition counterparts. We produce MSNs that are highly similar at the edge level to those generated with multimodal imaging; however, the nodal topology of the networks differed. These networks had limited predictive validity of generalized cognitive ability. Overall, when multimodal imaging is not available or appropriate, T1w-restricted MSN construction is feasible, provides an appropriate estimate of the MSN, and could be a useful approach to examine outcomes in future studies.Author Summary. We can estimate the higher order organization of cortical gray matter as a connectome using structural MRI. However, this methodology, termed morphometric similarity, requires multiple advanced neuroimaging protocols that are unsuitable, unavailable, or intolerable to certain populations, including children and some clinical groups. In a large, homogenous dataset of healthy young adults, we estimated these connectomes using three different feature sets, each extracted from fewer MRI sequences. Even when produced using only T1-weighted structural MRI scans, these connectomes were broadly similar to those produced with more complex or numerous MRI sequences. We did not replicate previous findings linking variation in the morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) to individual differences in cognitive abilities. We highlight potential reasons for this, including the developmental stage of the young adult imaging cohort in which our hypotheses were tested, and conclude that this study provides putative evidence that, in those populations where advanced imaging is not plausible, MSNs generated from T1-weighted structural MRIs are a promising alternative.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A central goal in neuroscience is to understand how dynamic networks of neural activity produce effective representations of the world. Advances in the theory of graph measures raise the possibility of elucidating network topologies central to the construction of these representations. We leverage a result from the description of lollipop graphs to identify an iconic network topology in functional magnetic resonance imaging data and characterize changes to those networks during task performance and in populations diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. During task performance, we find that task-relevant subnetworks change topology, becoming more integrated by increasing connectivity throughout cortex. Analysis of resting state connectivity in clinical populations shows a similar pattern of subnetwork topology changes; resting scans becoming less default-like with more integrated sensory paths. The study of brain network topologies and their relationship to cognitive models of information processing raises new opportunities for understanding brain function and its disorders.Author Summary. Our mental lives are made up of a series of predictions about the world calculated by our brains. The calculations that produce these predictions are a result of how areas in our brain interact. Measures based on graph representations can make it clear what information can be combined and therefore help us better understand the computations the brain is performing. We make use of cutting-edge techniques that overcome a number of previous limitations to identify specific shapes in the functional brain network. These shapes are similar to hierarchical processing streams that play a fundamental role in cognitive neuroscience. The importance of these structures and the technique is highlighted by how they change under different task constraints and in individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Network science has begun to reveal the fundamental principles by which large-scale brain networks are organized, including geometric constraints, a balance between segregative and integrative features, and functionally flexible brain areas. However, it remains unknown whether whole-brain networks imaged at the cellular level are organized according to similar principles. Here, we analyze whole-brain functional networks reconstructed from calcium imaging data recorded in larval zebrafish. Our analyses reveal that functional connections are distance-dependent and that networks exhibit hierarchical modular structure and hubs that span module boundaries. We go on to show that spontaneous network structure places constraints on stimulus-evoked reconfigurations of connections and that networks are highly consistent across individuals. Our analyses reveal basic organizing principles of whole-brain functional brain networks at the mesoscale. Our overarching methodological framework provides a blueprint for studying correlated activity at the cellular level using a low-dimensional network representation. Our work forms a conceptual bridge between macro- and mesoscale network neuroscience and opens myriad paths for future studies to investigate network structure of nervous systems at the cellular level.Author Summary. Little is known about the principles by which mesoscale functional networks are organized and whether they parallel the features of macroscale networks. Here, we used network science methods to investigate the architecture of functional connectivity in zebrafish larvae. We find that its architectural features are remarkably similar to that of macroscale functional brain networks, with connection weights exhibiting clear distance-dependence, evidence of multiscale and hierarchical community structure, high participation hub regions, and flexible reconfiguration across a range of tasks.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Visual exploration is related to activity in the hippocampus (HC) and/or extended medial temporal lobe system (MTL), is influenced by stored memories, and is altered in amnesic cases. An extensive set of polysynaptic connections exists both within and between the HC and oculomotor systems such that investigating how HC responses ultimately influence neural activity in the oculomotor system, and the timing by which such neural modulation could occur, is not trivial. We leveraged TheVirtualBrain, a software platform for large-scale network simulations, to model the functional dynamics that govern the interactions between the two systems in the macaque cortex. Evoked responses following the stimulation of the MTL and some, but not all, subfields of the HC resulted in observable responses in oculomotor regions, including the frontal eye fields, within the time of a gaze fixation. Modeled lesions to some MTL regions slowed the dissipation of HC signal to oculomotor regions, whereas HC lesions generally did not affect the rapid MTL activity propagation to oculomotor regions. These findings provide a framework for investigating how information represented by the HC/MTL may influence the oculomotor system during a fixation and predict how HC lesions may affect visual exploration.Author Summary. No major account of oculomotor (eye movement) guidance considers the influence of the hippocampus (HC) and broader medial temporal lobe (MTL) system, yet it is clear that information is exchanged between the two systems. Prior experience influences current viewing, and cases of amnesia due to compromised HC/MTL function show specific alterations in viewing behavior. By modeling large-scale network dynamics, we show that stimulation of subregions of the HC, and of the MTL, rapidly results in observable responses in oculomotor control regions, and that HC/MTL lesions alter signal propagation. These findings suggest that information from memory may readily guide visual exploration, and call for a reconsideration of the neural circuitry involved in oculomotor guidance.},

Synthetic lethality, the finding that the simultaneous knockout of two or more individually nonessential genes leads to cell or organism death, has offered a systematic framework to explore cellular function, and also offered therapeutic applications. Yet the concept lacks its parallel in neuroscience—a systematic knowledge base on the role of double or higher order ablations in the functioning of a neural system. Here, we use the framework of network control to systematically predict the effects of ablating neuron pairs and triplets on the gentle touch response. We find that surprisingly small sets of 58 pairs and 46 triplets can reduce muscle controllability in this context, and that these sets are localized in the nervous system in distinct groups. Further, they lead to highly specific experimentally testable predictions about mechanisms of loss of control, and which muscle cells are expected to experience this loss.Author Summary. “Synthetic lethality” in cell biology is an extreme example of the effects of higher order genetic interactions: The simultaneous knockout of two or more individually nonessential genes leads to cell death. We define a neural analog to this concept in relation to the locomotor response to gentle touch in C. elegans. Two or more neurons are synthetic essential if individually they are not required for this behavior, yet their combination is. We employ a network control approach to systematically assess all pairs and triplets of neurons by their effect on body wall muscle controllability, and find that only surprisingly small sets of neurons are synthetic essential. They are highly localized in the nervous system and predicted to affect control over specific sets of muscles.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Along sensory pathways, representations of environmental stimuli become increasingly sparse and expanded. If additionally the feed-forward synaptic weights are structured according to the inherent organization of stimuli, the increase in sparseness and expansion leads to a reduction of sensory noise. However, it is unknown how the synapses in the brain form the required structure, especially given the omnipresent noise of environmental stimuli. Here, we employ a combination of synaptic plasticity and intrinsic plasticity—adapting the excitability of each neuron individually—and present stimuli with an inherent organization to a feed-forward network. We observe that intrinsic plasticity maintains the sparseness of the neural code and thereby allows synaptic plasticity to learn the organization of stimuli in low-noise environments. Nevertheless, even high levels of noise can be handled after a subsequent phase of readaptation of the neuronal excitabilities by intrinsic plasticity. Interestingly, during this phase the synaptic structure has to be maintained. These results demonstrate that learning and recalling in the presence of noise requires the coordinated interplay between plasticity mechanisms adapting different properties of the neuronal circuit.Author Summary. Everyday life requires living beings to continuously recognize and categorize perceived stimuli from the environment. To master this task, the representations of these stimuli become increasingly sparse and expanded along the sensory pathways of the brain. In addition, the underlying neuronal network has to be structured according to the inherent organization of the environmental stimuli. However, how the neuronal network learns the required structure even in the presence of noise remains unknown. In this theoretical study, we show that the interplay between synaptic plasticity—controlling the synaptic efficacies—and intrinsic plasticity—adapting the neuronal excitabilities—enables the network to encode the organization of environmental stimuli. It thereby structures the network to correctly categorize stimuli even in the presence of noise. After having encoded the stimuli’s organization, consolidating the synaptic structure while keeping the neuronal excitabilities dynamic enables the neuronal system to readapt to arbitrary levels of noise resulting in a near-optimal classification performance for all noise levels. These results provide new insights into the interplay between different plasticity mechanisms and how this interplay enables sensory systems to reliably learn and categorize stimuli from the surrounding environment.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Brains in unconsciousness are characterized by significantly limited responsiveness to stimuli. Even during conscious wakefulness, responsiveness is highly dependent on ongoing brain activity, specifically, of alpha oscillations (∼10 Hz). We hypothesized that the variety of brain responses to external stimuli result from the interaction between state-specific and transient alpha oscillations and stimuli. To justify this hypothesis, we simulated various alpha oscillations in the human brain network, modulating criticality (a balanced state between order and disorder), and investigated specific alpha oscillation properties (instantaneous amplitude, phase, and global synchronization) that induce a large or small response. As a result, we found that the alpha oscillations near a critical state show a more complex and long-lasting response, which is more prominent when stimuli are given to globally desynchronized and low-amplitude oscillations. We also found specific phases of alpha oscillation that barely respond to stimuli, which implies the presence of temporal windows in the alpha cycle for a large or small response. The results explain why brain responses are so variable across conscious and unconscious states and across time windows even during conscious wakefulness, and emphasize the importance of considering ongoing alpha oscillations for effective brain stimulation.Author Summary. Responsiveness of the brain varies depending on the brain states (wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia, and traumatic injuries) and even during wakefulness, resulting in various responses to the same stimulus. What makes those different responses across brain states and even across time windows in conscious state? What is an effective way to obtain the largest response to external stimulus? To answer those questions, we simulated various alpha oscillations (∼10 Hz) in a large-scale brain network and found state-specific alpha oscillation properties that show large or small responsiveness. Notably, the results suggest the presence of temporal windows in alpha cycle that inhibit external information integration and emphasize considering the large/small responsiveness conditions for effective brain stimulation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in clinical applications to highlight brain areas involved in specific cognitive processes. Brain impairments, such as tumors, suppress the fMRI activation of the anatomical areas they invade and, thus, brain-damaged functional networks present missing links/areas of activation. The identification of the missing circuitry components is of crucial importance to estimate the damage extent. The study of functional networks associated with clinical tasks but performed by healthy individuals becomes, therefore, of paramount concern. These “healthy” networks can, indeed, be used as control networks for clinical studies. In this work we investigate the functional architecture of 20 healthy individuals performing a language task designed for clinical purposes. We unveil a common architecture persistent across all subjects under study, that we call “core” network, which involves Broca’s area, Wernicke’s area, the premotor area, and the pre-supplementary motor area. We study the connectivity of this circuitry by using the k-core centrality measure, and we find that three of these areas belong to the most robust structure of the functional language network for the specific task under study. Our results provide useful insights on primarily important functional connections.Author Summary. Neurosurgeons employ language fMRI to localize important language areas for patients with brain impairment. Yet, brain pathologies (e.g., brain tumors, strokes, epilepsy) affect functional connectivity by disrupting functional links and suppressing the activation of brain areas. Thus, although clinical tasks are designed to guarantee robust activation, the functional connectivity of patients with brain pathologies is ultimately damaged by brain impairments. To better quantify the damage produced by the brain pathology on the functional connectivity, it is paramount to have, as a benchmark, functional networks of healthy individuals who perform a task for clinical cases. Our findings identify a group of functional regions of interest linked together in a functional circuitry that have a decisive role for the language task used in clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Late human development is characterized by the maturation of high-level functional processes, which rely on reshaping of white matter connections, as well as synaptic density. However, the relationship between the whole-brain dynamics and the underlying white matter networks in neurodevelopment is largely unknown. In this study, we focused on how the structural connectome shapes the emerging dynamics of cerebral development between the ages of 6 and 33 years, using functional and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging combined into a spatiotemporal connectivity framework. We defined two new measures of brain dynamics, namely the system diversity and the spatiotemporal diversity, which quantify the level of integration/segregation between functional systems and the level of temporal self-similarity of the functional patterns of brain dynamics, respectively. We observed a global increase in system diversity and a global decrease and local refinement in spatiotemporal diversity values with age. In support of these findings, we further found an increase in the usage of long-range and inter-system white matter connectivity and a decrease in the usage of short-range connectivity with age. These findings suggest that dynamic functional patterns in the brain progressively become more integrative and temporally self-similar with age. These functional changes are supported by a greater involvement of long-range and inter-system axonal pathways.Author Summary. Maturation in human development is represented by changes in both functional dynamics and structural connectivity in the human brain. By constructing a spatiotemporal connectome for a cohort of 81 subjects ranging from 6 to 33 years of age, we demonstrate how these changes can be studied in a unified framework. We do so by defining two new measures of brain dynamics, namely the spatiotemporal diversity, mapping the level of temporal self-similarity of the functional patterns of brain dynamics, and system diversity, quantifying the level of integration/segregation between functional systems. These measures, we argue, represent a novel way of looking at brain dynamics constraints by structural connectivity. Using these measures, we show that dynamic functional patterns in the brain progressively become more integrative and temporally self-similar with age.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Age-related declines in cognition are associated with widespread structural and functional brain changes, including changes in resting-state functional connectivity and gray and white matter status. Recently we have shown that the elasticity of cerebral arteries also explains some of the variance in cognitive and brain health in aging. Here, we investigated how network segregation, cerebral arterial elasticity (measured with pulse-DOT—the arterial pulse based on diffuse optical tomography) and gray and white matter status jointly account for age-related differences in cognitive performance. We hypothesized that at least some of the variance in brain and cognitive aging is linked to reduced cerebrovascular elasticity, leading to increased cortical atrophy and white matter abnormalities, which, in turn, are linked to reduced network segregation and decreases in cognitive performance. Pairwise comparisons between these variables are consistent with an exploratory hierarchical model linking them, especially when focusing on association network segregation (compared with segregation in sensorimotor networks). These findings suggest that preventing or slowing age-related changes in one or more of these factors may induce a neurophysiological cascade beneficial for preserving cognition in aging.Author Summary. Age-related declines in cognition are associated with widespread structural and functional brain changes as well as changes in the elasticity of cerebral arteries. In this study, using an exploratory hierarchical model as a guide, and novel measures of cerebral arterial elasticity (pulse-DOT—the arterial pulse based on diffuse optical tomography), we show, for the first time, that cerebral arterial stiffness is strongly correlated with measures of functional brain network segregation, even after partialing out the effects of age. These findings suggest that preventing cerebral arterial stiffening could induce a neurophysiological cascade beneficial for preserving cognition in aging.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Whole-brain network analysis is commonly used to investigate the topology of the brain using a variety of neuroimaging modalities. This approach is notable for its applicability to a large number of domains, such as understanding how brain network organization relates to cognition and behavior and examining disrupted brain network organization in disease. A benefit to this approach is the ability to summarize overall brain network organization with a single metric (e.g., global efficiency). However, important local differences in network structure might exist without any corresponding observable differences in global topology, making a whole-brain analysis strategy unlikely to detect relevant local findings. Conversely, using local network metrics can identify local differences, but are not directly informative of differences in global topology. Here, we propose the network statistic (NS) jackknife framework, a simulated lesioning method that combines the utility of global network analysis strategies with the ability to detect relevant local differences in network structure. We evaluate the NS jackknife framework with a simulation study and an empirical example comparing global efficiency in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing (TD) children. The NS jackknife framework has been implemented in a public, open-source R package, netjack, available at https://cran.r-project.org/package=netjack.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The brain is a complex, multiscale dynamical system composed of many interacting regions. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal organization of these interactions is critical for establishing a solid understanding of the brain’s functional architecture and the relationship between neural dynamics and cognition in health and disease. The possibility of studying these dynamics through careful analysis of neuroimaging data has catalyzed substantial interest in methods that estimate time-resolved fluctuations in functional connectivity (often referred to as “dynamic” or time-varying functional connectivity; TVFC). At the same time, debates have emerged regarding the application of TVFC analyses to resting fMRI data, and about the statistical validity, physiological origins, and cognitive and behavioral relevance of resting TVFC. These and other unresolved issues complicate interpretation of resting TVFC findings and limit the insights that can be gained from this promising new research area. This article brings together scientists with a variety of perspectives on resting TVFC to review the current literature in light of these issues. We introduce core concepts, define key terms, summarize controversies and open questions, and present a forward-looking perspective on how resting TVFC analyses can be rigorously and productively applied to investigate a wide range of questions in cognitive and systems neuroscience.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The discovery of a stable, whole-brain functional connectivity organization that is largely independent of external events has drastically extended our view of human brain function. However, this discovery has been primarily based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The role of this whole-brain organization in fast oscillation-based connectivity as measured, for example, by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) is only beginning to emerge. Here, we review studies of intrinsic connectivity and its whole-brain organization in EEG, MEG, and intracranial electrophysiology with a particular focus on direct comparisons to connectome studies in fMRI. Synthesizing this literature, we conclude that irrespective of temporal scale over four orders of magnitude, intrinsic neurophysiological connectivity shows spatial similarity to the connectivity organization commonly observed in fMRI. A shared structural connectivity basis and cross-frequency coupling are possible mechanisms contributing to this similarity. Acknowledging that a stable whole-brain organization governs long-range coupling across all timescales of neural processing motivates researchers to take “baseline” intrinsic connectivity into account when investigating brain-behavior associations, and further encourages more widespread exploration of functional connectomics approaches beyond fMRI by using EEG and MEG modalities.},
