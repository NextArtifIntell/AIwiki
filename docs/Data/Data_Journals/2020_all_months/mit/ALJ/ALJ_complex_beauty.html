  abstract     = {We introduce the framework of reality-assisted evolution to summarize a growing trend towards combining model-based and model-free approaches to improve the design of physically embodied soft robots. In silico , data-driven models build, adapt, and improve representations of the target system using real-world experimental data. By simulating huge numbers of virtual robots using these data-driven models, optimization algorithms can illuminate multiple design candidates for transference to the real world. In reality , large-scale physical experimentation facilitates the fabrication, testing, and analysis of multiple candidate designs. Automated assembly and reconfigurable modular systems enable significantly higher numbers of real-world design evaluations than previously possible. Large volumes of ground-truth data gathered via physical experimentation can be returned to the virtual environment to improve data-driven models and guide optimization. Grounding the design process in physical experimentation ensures that the complexity of virtual robot designs does not outpace the model limitations or available fabrication technologies. We outline key developments in the design of physically embodied soft robots in the framework of reality-assisted evolution.},

It incorporated robotic simulators into robotic controllers to provide them with a mechanism to approximate the effects their actions had on the robot. Controllers with and without internal simulators were tested and compared. The proposed controller architecture was shown to outperform the regular controller architecture. However, the longer an internal simulator was executed, the more inaccurate it became. Thus, the performance of controllers with internal simulators reduced over time unless their internal simulator was periodically corrected.},

Here we assess whether access to social information leads to significant behavioral differences both when access to social information leads to improved performance on the task, and when it does not: Do any behaviors resulting from social information use, such as movement and increased agent interaction, persist even when the ability to discriminate between poisonous and non-poisonous food is no better than when social information is unavailable? Using a neuroevolutionary artificial life simulation, we show that social information use can lead to the emergence of behaviors that differ from when social information is unavailable, and that these behaviors act as a promoter of agent interaction. The results presented here suggest that the introduction of social information is sufficient, even when decoupled from within-lifetime learning, for the emergence of pro-social behaviors. We believe this work to be the first use of an artificial evolutionary system to explore the behavioral consequences of social information use in the absence of within-lifetime learning.},

  abstract     = {The possibility of using competitive evolutionary algorithms to generate long-term progress is normally prevented by the convergence on limit cycle dynamics in which the evolving agents keep progressing against their current competitors by periodically rediscovering solutions adopted previously. This leads to local but not to global progress (i.e., progress against all possible competitors). We propose a new competitive algorithm that produces long-term global progress by identifying and filtering out opportunistic variations, that is, variations leading to progress against current competitors and retrogression against other competitors. The efficacy of the method is validated on the coevolution of predator and prey robots, a classic problem that has been used in related researches. The accumulation of global progress over many generations leads to effective solutions that involve the production of articulated behaviors. The complexity of the behavior displayed by the evolving robots increases across generations, although progress in performance is not always accompanied by behavior complexification.},

  abstract     = {Self-organization can be broadly defined as the ability of a system to display ordered spatiotemporal patterns solely as the result of the interactions among the system components. Processes of this kind characterize both living and artificial systems, making self-organization a concept that is at the basis of several disciplines, from physics to biology and engineering. Placed at the frontiers between disciplines, artificial life (ALife) has heavily borrowed concepts and tools from the study of self-organization, providing mechanistic interpretations of lifelike phenomena as well as useful constructivist approaches to artificial system design. Despite its broad usage within ALife, the concept of self-organization has been often excessively stretched or misinterpreted, calling for a clarification that could help with tracing the borders between what can and cannot be considered self-organization. In this review, we discuss the fundamental aspects of self-organization and list the main usages within three primary ALife domains, namely “soft” (mathematical/computational modeling), “hard” (physical robots), and “wet” (chemical/biological systems) ALife. We also provide a classification to locate this research. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of self-organization and related concepts within ALife studies, point to perspectives and challenges for future research, and list open questions. We hope that this work will motivate discussions related to self-organization in ALife and related fields.},

GeMS generates music with simulations of genetic processes, such as transcription, translation, and protein folding, with which biological systems render chains of amino acids from DNA strands. The system comprises the following components: the Miranda machine , the rhythmator , and the pitch processor . The Miranda machine is an abstract Turing-machine-like processor, which manipulates a sequence of DNA symbols according to a set of programming instructions. This process generates a pool of new DNA strands, which are subsequently translated into rhythms. GeMS represents the musical equivalent of amino acids in terms of rhythms, referred to as rhythmic codons. This enables the rhythmator to convert DNA sequences into rhythmic sequences. The pitch processor generates pitches for such rhythmic sequences. It is inspired by the phenomenon of protein folding. The pitch processor considers orientation information of DNA instructions yielded by the Miranda machine in order to activate algorithms for generating pitches. A musical composition, entitled Artibiotics , for percussion ensemble and electronic instruments, is presented to demonstrate the system.},

In the simulation, the fitness of an entity is measured by a series of one-on-one competitions in the Immigration Game, a two-player variation of Conway&#39;s Game of Life. Mutation, reproduction, and symbiosis are implemented as operations that are external to the Immigration Game. Because these operations are external to the game, we can freely manipulate the operations and observe the effects of the manipulations. The simulation is composed of four layers, each layer building on the previous layer. The first layer implements a simple form of asexual reproduction, the second layer introduces a more sophisticated form of asexual reproduction, the third layer adds sexual reproduction, and the fourth layer adds symbiosis. The experiments show that a small amount of symbiosis, added to the other layers, significantly increases the fitness of the population. We suggest that the model may provide new insights into symbiosis in biological and cultural evolution.},

Due to the strong nonlinear effects involved in such systems, they are often difficult to study analytically. There are however certain conditions that allow for a wide range of these reaction systems to be well described by a set of linear ordinary differential equations. In this article, we elucidate these conditions and present a method to construct and solve such equations. For those linear self-replicating systems, we quantitatively find that the growth rate of the system is simply proportional to the sum of all the rate constants of the reactions that constitute the system (but is nontrivially determined by the relative values). We also give quantitative descriptions of how strongly side reactions need to be coupled with the system in order to completely disrupt the system.},

  abstract     = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: Artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes, uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This article is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

This study aims to design swarm robots capable of executing spatially distributed tasks effectively, which can be potentially used for tasks such as search-and-rescue operation and gathering scattered garbage in rooms. We propose a simple decentralized control scheme for swarm robots by extending our previously proposed non-reciprocal-interaction-based model. Each robot has an internal state, called its workload . Each robot first moves randomly to find a task, and when it does, its workload increases, and then it attracts its neighboring robots to ask for their help. We demonstrate, via simulations, that the proposed control scheme enables the robots to effectively execute multiple tasks in parallel under various environments. Fault tolerance of the proposed system is also demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Children&#39;s acquisition of the English past tense has been widely studied as a testing ground for theories of language development, mostly because it comprises a set of quasi-regular mappings. English verbs are of two types: regular verbs, which form their past tense based on a productive rule, and irregular verbs, which form their past tenses through exceptions to that rule. Although many connectionist models exist for capturing language development, few consider individual differences. In this article, we explore the use of populations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that evolve according to behavioral genetics principles in order to create computational models capable of capturing the population variability exhibited by children in acquiring English past tense verbs. Literature in the field of behavioral genetics views variability in children&#39;s learning in terms of genetic and environmental influences. In our model, the effects of genetic influences are simulated through variations in parameters controlling computational properties of ANNs, and the effects of environmental influences are simulated via a filter applied to the training set. This filter alters the quality of information available to the artificial learning system and creates a unique subsample of the training set for each simulated individual. Our approach uses a population of twins to disentangle genetic and environmental influences on past tense performance and to capture the wide range of variability exhibited by children as they learn English past tenses. We use a novel technique to create the population of ANN twins based on the biological processes of meiosis and fertilization. This approach allows modeling of both individual differences and development (within the lifespan of an individual) in a single framework. Finally, our approach permits the application of selection on developmental performance on the quasi-regular task across generations. Setting individual differences within an evolutionary framework is an important and novel contribution of our work. We present an experimental evaluation of this model, focusing on individual differences in performance. The experiments led to several novel findings, including: divergence of population attributes during selection to favor regular verbs, irregular verbs, or both; evidence of canalization, analogous to Waddington&#39;s developmental epigenetic landscape, once selection starts targeting a particular aspect of the task domain; and the limiting effect on the power of selection in the face of stochastic selection (roulette wheel), sexual reproduction, and a variable learning environment for each individual. Most notably, the heritability of traits showed an inverse relationship to optimization. Selected traits show lower heritability as the genetic variation of the population reduces. The simulations demonstrate the viability of linking concepts such as heritability of individual differences, cognitive development, and selection over generations within a single computational framework.},

  abstract     = {Among the major unresolved questions in ecosystem evolution are whether coevolving multispecies communities are dominated more by biotic or by abiotic factors, and whether evolutionary stasis affects performance as well as ecological profile; these issues remain difficult to address experimentally. Digital evolution, a computer-based instantiation of Darwinian evolution in which short self-replicating computer programs compete, mutate, and evolve, is an excellent platform for investigating such topics in a rigorous experimental manner. We evolved model communities with ecological interdependence among community members, which were subjected to two principal types of mass extinction: a pulse extinction that killed randomly, and a selective press extinction involving an alteration of the abiotic environment to which the communities had to adapt. These treatments were applied at two different strengths (Strong and Weak), along with unperturbed Control experiments. We performed several kinds of competition experiments using simplified versions of these communities to see whether long-term stability that was implied previously by ecological and phylogenetic metrics was also reflected in performance, namely, whether fitness was static over long periods of time. Results from Control and Weak treatment communities revealed almost completely transitive evolution, while Strong treatment communities showed higher incidences of temporal intransitivity, with pre-treatment ecotypes often able to displace some of their post-recovery successors. However, pre-treatment carryovers more often had lower fitness in mixed communities than in their own fully native conditions. Replacement and invasion experiments pitting single ecotypes against pre-treatment reference communities showed that many of the invading ecotypes could measurably alter the fitnesses of one or more residents, usually with depressive effects, and that the strength of these effects increased over time even in the most stable communities. However, invaders taken from Strong treatment communities often had little or no effect on resident performance. While we detected periods of time when the fitness of a particular evolving ecotype remained static, this stasis was not permanent and never affected an entire community at once. Our results lend support to the fitness-deterioration interpretation of the Red Queen hypothesis, and highlight community context dependence in determining fitness, the shaping of communities by both biotic factors and abiotic forcing, and the illusory nature of evolutionary stasis. Our results also demonstrate the potential of digital evolution studies to illuminate many aspects of evolution in interacting multispecies communities.},

Autopoiesis is a key concept in the study of living organisms, where the boundaries of the organism are not static but dynamically regulated by the system itself. To study the autonomous regulation of a self-boundary, we focus on neural homeodynamic responses to environmental changes using both biological and artificial neural networks. Previous studies showed that embodied cultured neural networks and spiking neural networks with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learn an action as they avoid stimulation from outside. In this article, as a result of our experiments using embodied cultured neurons, we find that there is also a second property allowing the network to avoid stimulation: If the agent cannot learn an action to avoid the external stimuli, it tends to decrease the stimulus-evoked spikes, as if to ignore the uncontrollable input. We also show such a behavior is reproduced by spiking neural networks with asymmetric STDP. We consider that these properties are to be regarded as autonomous regulation of self and nonself for the network, in which a controllable neuron is regarded as self, and an uncontrollable neuron is regarded as nonself. Finally, we introduce neural autopoiesis by proposing the principle of stimulus avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Criticality is thought to be crucial for complex systems to adapt at the boundary between regimes with different dynamics, where the system may transition from one phase to another. Numerous systems, from sandpiles to gene regulatory networks to swarms to human brains, seem to work towards preserving a precarious balance right at their critical point. Understanding criticality therefore seems strongly related to a broad, fundamental theory for the physics of life as it could be, which still lacks a clear description of how life can arise and maintain itself in complex systems. In order to investigate this crucial question, we model populations of Ising agents competing for resources in a simple 2D environment subject to an evolutionary algorithm. We then compare its evolutionary dynamics under different experimental conditions. We demonstrate the utility that arises at a critical state and contrast it with the behaviors and dynamics that arise far from criticality. The results show compelling evidence that not only is a critical state remarkable in its ability to adapt and find solutions to the environment, but the evolving parameters in the agents tend to flow towards criticality if starting from a supercritical regime. We present simulations showing that a system in a supercritical state will tend to self-organize towards criticality, in contrast to a subcritical state, which remains subcritical though it is still capable of adapting and increasing its fitness.},

  abstract     = {Many factors influence the evolvability of populations, and this article illustrates how intrinsic mortality (death induced through internal factors) in an evolving population contributes favorably to evolvability on a fixed deceptive fitness landscape. We test for evolvability using the hierarchical if-and-only-if ( h - iff ) function as a deceptive fitness landscape together with a steady state genetic algorithm (SSGA) with a variable mutation rate and indiscriminate intrinsic mortality rate. The mutation rate and the intrinsic mortality rate display a relationship for finding the global maximum. This relationship was also found when implementing the same deceptive fitness landscape in a spatial model consisting of an evolving population. We also compared the performance of the optimal mutation and mortality rate with a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm called age-fitness Pareto optimization (AFPO) and show how the two approaches traverse the h - iff landscape differently. Our results indicate that the intrinsic mortality rate and mutation rate induce random genetic drift that allows a population to efficiently traverse a deceptive fitness landscape. This article gives an overview of how intrinsic mortality influences the evolvability of a population. It thereby supports the premise that programmed death of individuals could have a beneficial effect on the evolvability of the entire population.},

We present three types of lineage measurements: lineage length, mutation accumulation, and phenotypic volatility. Additionally, we suggest the adoption of four phylogeny measurements from biology: phylogenetic richness, phylogenetic divergence, phylogenetic regularity, and depth of the most-recent common ancestor. In addition to quantitative metrics, we also discuss several existing data visualizations that are useful for understanding lineages and phylogenies: state sequence visualizations, fitness landscape overlays, phylogenetic trees, and Muller plots. We examine the behavior of these metrics (with the aid of data visualizations) in two well-studied computational contexts: (1) a set of two-dimensional, real-valued optimization problems under a range of mutation rates and selection strengths, and (2) a set of qualitatively different environments in the Avida digital evolution platform. These results confirm our intuition about how these metrics respond to various evolutionary conditions and indicate their broad value.},

  abstract     = {Using the in silico experimental evolution platform Aevol, we have tested the existence of a complexity ratchet by evolving populations of digital organisms under environmental conditions in which simple organisms can very well thrive and reproduce. We observed that in most simulations, organisms become complex although such organisms are a lot less fit than simple ones and have no robustness or evolvability advantage. This excludes selection from the set of possible explanations for the evolution of complexity. However, complementary experiments showed that selection is nevertheless necessary for complexity to evolve, also excluding non-selective effects. Analyzing the long-term fate of complex organisms, we showed that complex organisms almost never switch back to simplicity despite the potential fitness benefit. On the contrary, they consistently accumulate complexity in the long term, meanwhile slowly increasing their fitness but never overtaking that of simple organisms. This suggests the existence of a complexity ratchet powered by negative epistasis: Mutations leading to simple solutions, which are favorable at the beginning of the simulation, become deleterious after other mutations—leading to complex solutions—have been fixed. This also suggests that this complexity ratchet cannot be beaten by selection, but that it can be overthrown by robustness because of the constraints it imposes on the coding capacity of the genome.},

  abstract     = {Susceptibility to common human diseases such as cancer is influenced by many genetic and environmental factors that work together in a complex manner. The state of the art is to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that measures millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome followed by a one-SNP-at-a-time statistical analysis to detect univariate associations. This approach has identified thousands of genetic risk factors for hundreds of diseases. However, the genetic risk factors detected have very small effect sizes and collectively explain very little of the overall heritability of the disease. Nonetheless, it is assumed that the genetic component of risk is due to many independent risk factors that contribute additively. The fact that many genetic risk factors with small effects can be detected is taken as evidence to support this notion. It is our working hypothesis that the genetic architecture of common diseases is partly driven by non-additive interactions. To test this hypothesis, we developed a heuristic simulation-based method for conducting experiments about the complexity of genetic architecture. We show that a genetic architecture driven by complex interactions is highly consistent with the magnitude and distribution of univariate effects seen in real data. We compare our results with measures of univariate and interaction effects from two large-scale GWASs of sporadic breast cancer and find evidence to support our hypothesis that is consistent with the results of our computational experiment.},

  abstract     = {Artificial life is a research field devoted to the theoretical study of features of living systems, such as evolution and the brain. The field has developed philosophical concepts such as autopoiesis and emergence, alongside a large range of computational and experimental setups, from evolutionary simulations to robotics and chemical experiments.The complexity and diversity of the artificial life field is crucial to its community. Many researchers consider the community a real source of creativity and free-minded exchange of ideas on important questions. For ideas that don&#39;t fit neatly into a single “mainstream” field of science, there is value in examining and discussing them in a context free from departmental or disciplinary constraints, with the purpose of reaching a better knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms that govern living systems.Workers in the field of artificial life convene yearly at a conference, which most recently took place in 2018 in Tokyo. The ALIFE 2018 conference highlighted eight categories of topics:• Perception, cognition, behavior• Bio-inspired, cognitive, and evolutionary robotics; swarms• Ecological and social systems• Artificial chemistry, origins of life, computational biology• Complex dynamical systems and networks• Evolution of language, computational linguistics• Philosophy of mind, philosophy of science• Artificial-life–based art• Synthetic biology and wet artificial life• Education and society issuesIn this issue, we present a selection of recent studies on these topics, which were presented at ALIFE 2018 and which reflect the very rich heterogeneity of the field, and many of which are contributions from young scientists. These articles have been selected from a very diverse pool of submissions. The conference featured 112 papers, selected out of 212 submissions, of which 64 were accepted as oral presentations and 48 as poster presentations.We focused on top-rated, promising, and impactful studies by young contributors to artificial life research. The articles cover a set of concepts key to artificial life, and ground them in concrete models and outputs to better describe those concepts and make them actionable for the whole field. A simple classification of the current research paradigm in this volume can be described as follows: (i) autopoiesis, (ii) evolution and evolvability, (iii) emergence, and (iv) embodiment.The first three articles examined autopoiesis and embodiment. Randall Beer [1] investigated the initial-state dependence of the Game of Life to show how the initial distribution generates gliders but also annihilates and regenerates them as time passes. This is a prototypical life evolution example. This work is in the line of embodied autopoiesis, which is reconsidered by studying gliders and their peripheral configurations.Tamaru, Yui, and Hashida [9] demonstrated the self-organized motion of a pine cone, emphasizing its unexpected locomotion, which realizes a sensory-motor coupling. The motion of gliders and pine cones is different, but has that common property, resulting from environmental conditions (humidity for pine cones, and the bit configuration for gliders).Masumori et al. [5] discussed the concept of autopoiesis in terms of artificial and biological neural focused on networks. Their work proposes a new learning principle of neural networks called stimulus avoidance. If a network can avoid being stimulated from the outside, it does so by organizing its behavior to avoid the source of stimuli in the environment. If not, the network tends to inactivate its sensory part to prevent the information from the sensor neurons from spreading. So, effectively, the sensory inputs are removed.In contrast with Randy Beer&#39;s work [1], neural networks can self-organizingly change their boundary conditions to acquire robustness. A neural network protects itself from environmental stimuli, whereas gliders are totally fragile against external perturbation.The next articles examined aspects of evolutionary dynamics.Dolson et al. [2] proposed a set of metrics for analyzing evolutionary histories in digital evolution experiments, with the hope of boosting the computational evolution community&#39;s interest in using such measures to improve our understanding of evolutionary dynamics. The article offers some simple use cases, and points to code available online to compute the measures.Khajehabdollahi and Witkowski [3], by using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) (installed agents), demonstrated that a critical state of an RBM is not always adaptive. The critical states should be selected through evolutionary dynamics for a particular task.Liard et al. [4] examined whether complexity is driven primarily by selection or a non-selective force, which is a central question in artificial life. Using the Aevol system for digital organisms, they designed a simple world and a simple genome, and applied directional selection pressure for a protein that can function to produce a triangle. They explored how an information metric for complexity at genomic and phenotypic levels appears to increase at low mutation rates, and as well, explored robustness and evolvability.Moore et al. [6] gave a tangible example of how artificial life models are a powerful tool to help society, in particular in the biomedical realm, to test hypotheses in great detail. Although methods such as genome-wide association study (GWAS) have allowed identifying thousands of genetic risk factors for hundreds of diseases, the genetic risk factors detected have very small effect sizes and tell little about the overall heritability of diseases. With the help of a heuristic simulation, the authors were able to ask questions about the complexity of genetic architectures, in particular whether common diseases are partly driven by non-additive interactions. The simulations were highly consistent with the magnitude and distribution of univariate effects seen in real data, as is corroborated by a comparison with large-scale studies of sporadic breast cancer.Veenstra et al. [10] studied how senescence, or intrinsic mortality, influences the evolvability of a population. They used the hierarchical if-and-only-if function as a deceptive fitness landscape, together with a spatial artificial life model. They showed an explicit relationship between mutation and mortality rate in a few different application scenarios. Their results support the premise that programmed death of individuals can have a beneficial effect on the evolvability of the entire population.The studies by Masumori et al. [5], Khajehabdollahi and Witkowski [3], and Beer [1] all addressed the important theme of embodiment, that is, how an embodied mind “as it could be” might develop a first-person perspective in a different but even more direct way. Tamaru, Yui, and Hashida [9] also addressed how intelligence can be embedded in a direct physical task, where an embodiment computes how to advance.The general theme of this conference was “Beyond AI.” Since around 2010, AI has rapidly become a major trend, and the use of big data has gradually invaded every area of science. AI does not need to visualize big data, nor does it have to solve any equations. Just from the big data itself, AI can extract patterns and forms to predict future outcomes. A missing piece of this new era driven by AI is embodiment and evolutionary perspectives, which are also the main foci of this volume.The fundamental principles of life are missing from current AI systems, which bear little of the richness of living systems. From the point of view of the ALife community, it is fairly evident that the post-AI era will need to invent something completely new, which can be done by leveraging research topics that are already active in the ALife community.If one is serious about designing systems that mimic human intelligence, the priority should be put on a theory of the nature of living (if not human) systems, on their emergence, and on their evolution through time. The understanding of such principles can then contribute to an effort to design intelligence, which could even come as an inevitable side effect of homeostasis and evolution in a complex and dynamic environment.Although this approach may seem like wishful thinking, possibly sprouting from a whole community&#39;s hallucination due to its dedication to tackling life as it could be, perhaps the rich interdisciplinarity of the field may manage to protect it from biases. Actually, looking at the major conferences about diverse types of machine learning, AI scientists themselves have generally started looking in the direction of ALife, in a search for creative ideas.AI research currently sees limitations, suggesting the arrival of a next AI winter, in which AI will pass on its popularity to other sectors of science. The first signs are the absence of new paradigms in machine learning, and the shift from the invention of new algorithmic principles to their use: We are now merely applying all the key inventions at our disposal, such as backpropagation, neural architectures, and powerful computation, to solve application problems in other fields. AI needs a next source of creativity, which will bring about the next step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial superintelligence (ASI).In a sense, ALife has been pushing in the creative direction all along, in particular through its search for open-ended evolution (OEE), which is also the study of the production of novelty in nature. The extraordinary source of inventiveness and diversity seems to be key to the nature of living systems. In 2019, Artificial Life journal published two special issues (see [7] and [8] for overviews) that focused on OEE as an essential part of artificial systems as well as real living systems, from many different angles. Those issues and the current one could not be better aligned, for in order to capture the I in AI, one needs to focus on what is at its roots: the fundamental principles of life, including the juice that makes it maintain its creative productivity.ALife as a field has managed to develop a unique creative ecology for the study of living systems from first principles, by building them piece by piece from the most diverse substrates. Before this proves useful for enabling AI&#39;s next steps, ALife will probably undergo changes itself, following its two major conferences, which have now been merged into one since the Tokyo conference. Not only a central concept in this day and age, ALife also is a symbol of transdisciplinary, diverse, and open-ended scientific endeavor, which exemplifies the creativity required to make significant leaps in understanding our universe, and us as cognitive beings living, evolving, and growing in it.},
