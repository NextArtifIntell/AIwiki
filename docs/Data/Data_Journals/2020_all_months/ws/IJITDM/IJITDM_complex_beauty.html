  abstract     = {This paper develops a multi-objective multi-layer location-pricing (MLLP) model with congested facilities in which the facilities act like a classic queuing system. The customers who arrive to this system receive service at all layers in a predetermined order to fulfill their demands. The goal is to determine (1) optimal number of the facilities required at each layer, (2) optimal allocation of customers to facilities, and (3) optimal price of providing service at each layer. The objective functions are to maximize the total profit of the system and to minimize the sum of travel and waiting times, simultaneously. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective nonlinear integer mathematical programming model. Since the problem is hard to be solved analytically, we present a multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm (MHA) based on an electromagnetism-like mechanism (ELM) as a solution for multi-objective MLLP. This algorithm used an elitist mechanism to strengthen the structure of search engine in order to find better quality solutions. The results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the traditional ELM.},

  abstract     = {Evaluation and benchmarking of many-objective optimization (MaOO) methods are complicated. The rapid development of new optimization algorithms for solving problems with many objectives has increased the necessity of developing performance indicators or metrics for evaluating the performance quality and comparing the competing optimization algorithms fairly. Further investigations are required to highlight the limitations of how criteria/metrics are determined and the consistency of the procedures with the evaluation and benchmarking processes of MaOO. A review is conducted in this study to map the research landscape of multi-criteria evaluation and benchmarking processes for MaOO into a coherent taxonomy. Then contentious and challenging issues related to evaluation are highlighted, and the performance of optimization algorithms for MaOO is benchmarked. The methodological aspects of the evaluation and selection of MaOO algorithms are presented as the recommended solution on the basis of four distinct and successive phases. First, in the determination phase, the evaluation criteria of MaOO are collected, classified and grouped for testing experts’ consensus on the most suitable criteria. Second, the identification phase involves the process of establishing a decision matrix via a crossover of the ‘evaluation criteria’ and MaOO’, and the level of importance of each selective criteria and sub-criteria from phase one is computed to identify its weight value by using the best–worst method (BWM). Third, the development phase involves the creation of a decision matrix for MaOO selection on the basis of the integrated BWM and VIKOR method. Last, the validation phase involves the validation of the proposed solution.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of smart things. It indicates the ability that the mentioned physical things transfer information with each other. The characteristics of these networks, such as topology dynamicity and energy constraint, make the routing problem a challenging task in these networks. Traditional routing methods could not achieve the required performance in these networks. Therefore, developers of these networks have to consider specific routing methods in order to satisfy their requirements. One of the routing methods is utilization of the multipath protocols in which data are sent to its destination using multiple routes with separate links. One of such protocols is AOMDV routing protocol. In this paper, AOMDV is improved using gray system theory which chooses the best paths used for separate routes to send packets. To do this, Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV) packet format is altered and some fields are added to it so that energy criteria, link expiration time, and signal-to-noise ratio can also be considered during selection of the best route. The proposed method named RMPGST-IoT is introduced which chooses the routes with highest rank for concurrent transmission of data, using a specific method based on the gray system theory. In order to evaluate the results, the proposed Routing Multipath based on Gray System Theory (RMPGST)-IoT method is compared to the Emergency Response IoT based on Global Information Decision (ERGID) and Ad hoc Delay-aware Distributed Routing Model (ADRM)-IoT approaches in terms of throughput, packet receiving rate, packet loss rate, average remaining energy, and network lifetime. The results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed RMPGST-IoT is superior to that of ERGID and ADRM-IoT approaches.},

As different criteria from ED context and several alternatives need to be considered, selecting a suitable Multicriteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach has become a crucial step for ED performance evaluation. Although some methodologies have been proposed to address this challenge, a more complete approach is still lacking. This paper bridges this gap by integrating three potent MCDM methods. First, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used to determine the criteria and sub-criteria weights under uncertainty, followed by the interdependence evaluation via fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL). The fuzzy logic is merged with AHP and DEMATEL to illustrate vague judgments. Finally, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used for ranking EDs. This approach is validated in a real 3-ED cluster. The results revealed the critical role of Infrastructure (21.5%) in ED performance and the interactive nature of Patient safety ( C + R = 1 2 . 7 7 1 ). Furthermore, this paper evidences the weaknesses to be tackled for upgrading the performance of each ED.},

  abstract     = {Academic conferences are popular platforms for academicians to share their research with colleagues, get feedback, and stay up to date on recent academic studies. Conferences also provide opportunities for the participants to express themselves, expand their network, and become socialized. However, academicians are forced to choose a limited number of conferences to participate due to several different factors such as time required for preparing a research, traveling and lodging expenses, and conference fees. At this multi-criteria decision problem, relevant factors can be used to evaluate the alternatives (i.e., academic conferences to participate) and prioritization of these factors would be necessary in advance. To address this issue, this study suggests an improved fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach to analyze factors affecting the choice of academic conferences to participate. The classical FCM allows to observe the dynamic behavior of complex systems during time. While the approach is widely used in different areas, it has considerable drawbacks: (i) producing same steady state values under different initial conditions and (ii) yielding completely different steady state values when different threshold functions are used. The new approach provides a mathematical formulation that produces steady state values sensitive to initial conditions. Since the selection of the threshold function in classical FCM is a highly subjective choice, the proposed approach offers an alternative way to obtain comparable values.},

Two basic principles of normalization of multidimensional data are defined: preservation of dispositions of natural and normalized values on the measurement scale and the absence of a displacement in the areas of normalized values of various criteria relative to each other. A method is proposed for converting normalized values of cost criteria to profit criteria based on the reverse sorting algorithm (ReS-algorithm). The ReS-algorithm preserves the dispositions of the natural and normalized values of the attributes of the alternatives and eliminates the displacement the areas of normalized values of the cost criteria relative to the profit criteria, which ensures the equality of the contributions of various criteria to the performance indicator of the alternatives.},

Then, the similarity measure for PMVNSs is defined and utilized to derive the important degree of DMs, and the likelihood of preference relations expressed by the probability multi-valued neutrosophic numbers (PMVNNs) is first presented and employed to replace the distance deviation in traditional MABAC method. Furthermore, a novel MAGDM method where the performance of alternatives is expressed by the PMVNN is established by combining the likelihood-based MABAC method and RT which considered given DMs’ behavior psychology.

However, project risk and uncertainty are rarely considered by these techniques. This paper proposes a project control framework that integrates the project uncertainty and associated risk factors into project control. Our framework is based on earned value management (EVM), which is an effective and widely used quantitative project control technique. The framework uses hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) to enhance EVM with the ability to compute the uncertainty associated with its parameters and risk factors. The framework can be applied to projects from different domains, and we illustrate its use with a simple example and a case study of a construction project.},

It utilized the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to evaluate the influential factors that contribute to water losses. The Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation Technique (FSET) has been utilized to assess WLRI at pipe level and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator has been used to aggregate the individual WLRI values for each zone. The framework is extended by incorporating Monte Carlo simulation model to generate the final ranking of zones. The outcomes of this simulation showed fair stability in terms of ranking the scrutinized zones.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel approach and framework based on interval-dependent degree and probability distribution for multi-criteria decision-making problems with multi-valued neutrosophic sets (MVNSs) is proposed. First, a simplified dependent function and distribution function are given and integrated into a concise formula, which is called the interval-dependent function and contains interval computing and probability distribution information in an interval. Then a transformation operator is defined and it is shown how to convert MVNSs into an interval set. Subsequently, the interval-dependent function with the probability distribution of MVNSs is deduced. Finally, an example and comparative analysis are provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, uncertainty analysis, which reflects the dynamic change of the ranking result with decision-makers’ preferences, is performed by setting different distribution functions, which increases the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has a tremendous effect on people’s lives worldwide, and the number of infected patients increases daily. The healthcare sector is affected by a large number of patients with COVID-19, and a solution is urgently needed to avert the risk of deteriorating patients in terms of prioritizing patients based on their health conditions. Prioritization of patients with COVID-19 is a complex and multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) problem due to (i) multiple biological laboratory examination criteria, (ii) criteria importance and (iii) trade-off amongst the criteria. This study presents a new multi-biological laboratory examination framework for prioritizing patients with COVID-19 on the basis of integrated MCDA methods. The experiment was conducted on the basis of three phases. In the first phase, patient datasets containing eight biological laboratory examination criteria for six patients with COVID-19 were derived and discussed. The outcome of this phase was used to propose a decision matrix on the basis of the intersection between “biological laboratory examination criteria” and “COVID-19 patients list”. In the second phase, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was utilized to set the subjective weights for the biological laboratory examination criteria by respiratory experts. In the last phase, the VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method was adopted to prioritize patients in the context of individual and group decision making (GDM). Results showed that (1) the integration of AHP–VIKOR method based on individual and GDM contexts was effective for solving prioritization problems for patients with COVID-19, and (2) the prioritization results of patients with COVID-19 showed no variation in the internal and external VIKOR GDM contexts. The proposed multi-biological laboratory examination framework can differentiate between the mild and serious or critical condition of patients with COVID-19 by prioritizing them based on integrated AHP–VIKOR methods. In conclusion, medical sectors can use the proposed framework to differentiate the health conditions of infected patients and to assign appropriate care with prompt and effective treatment.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the number of deteriorating bridges has drastically increased. Furthermore, tight maintenance budgets are cut down, imposing escalating adverse implications on the safety of bridges. This state of affairs entails the development of decision support systems for the effective management of bridges within the allocated budget. As such, this study introduces an invasive weed optimization-based fuzzy decision-making framework designated for bridge intervention prioritization in both element and network levels. The proposed decision-making platform encompasses three main tiers. The first tier is an optimized fuzzy analytical network process model that aims at computing the weighting vector of the bridge defects, namely corrosion, delamination, cracking, spalling and scaling. In this model, a genetic algorithm optimization model is formulated to improve the consistencies of judgment matrices through circumventing the imprecisions encountered by the classical judgment assignment. The second tier encompasses establishing an integrated bridge deck condition assessment model capitalizing on ground-penetrating radar and inspection reports. In it, the severities of the bridge defects are demonstrated in the form of fuzzy membership functions to address the inherent uncertainties of inspection. Subsequently, a variable-length invasive weed optimization model is structured to automatically calibrate the fuzzy membership functions. The third model is designed for structuring a bridge maintenance decision-making strategy stepping on the integrated condition index. The capabilities of the proposed framework were validated through several levels of comparisons. For instance, it significantly outperformed some of the current condition assessment models. Additionally, it inferred that the thresholds separating the four categories of the integrated bridge deck condition index are 75.651, 67.769 and 60.318.},

One solution to this problem is to conduct patent analysis using a patent classification system. However, in a corpus such as cloud patents, many keywords are common among different classes, making it difficult to classify the unknown class documents using the machine learning techniques proposed by previous studies. To remedy this problem, this study aims to establish an efficient classification system with a special focus on features extraction and application of extension theory. We first propose a compound method to determine the features, and then, we propose an extension-based classification method to develop an efficient patent classification system. Using cloud computing patents as the database, the experimental results show that our proposed scheme can outperform the classification quality of the traditional classifiers.},

To assess the users’ learning and performance, a comprehensive five-dimensional model was used to evaluate subjects’ task performance, decision time, decision strategy, structural knowledge, and heuristics knowledge. The results showed that process-oriented debriefing improved subjects’ task performance, helped users gain task knowledge, develop heuristics, and adapt to systematic-variable consistent strategies. Contrary to our hypothesis, the process-oriented debriefing group did not use less decision time. In contrast to the cost-benefit approach to decision making, a relatively more systematic effort is needed to perform better in dynamic tasks such as fisheries management.},

Different users have different requirements and preferences while selecting a smartphone. There is ‘no one-size fits all’ remedy when it comes to smartphones. Additionally, the availability of a wide variety of smartphones in the market makes it difficult for the user to select the best one. The use of only product ratings to choose the best smartphone is not sufficient because the interpretation of such ratings can be quite vague and ambiguous. In this paper, reviews of products are incorporated into the decision-making process in order to select the best product for a recommendation. The top five different brands of smartphones are considered for a case study. The proposed system, then, analyses the customer reviews of these smartphones from two online platforms, Flipkart and Amazon, using sentiment analysis techniques. Next, it uses a hybrid MCDM approach, where characteristics of AHP and TOPSIS methods are combined to evaluate the best smartphones from a list of five alternatives and recommend the best product. The result shows that brand1 smartphone is considered to be the best smartphone among five smartphones based on four important decision criteria. The result of the proposed system is also validated by manually annotated customer reviews of the smartphone by experts. It shows that recommendation of the best product by the proposed system matches the experts’ ranking. Thus, the proposed system can be a useful decision support tool for the best smartphone recommendation.},

Construction decision making used to depend on managerial staff’ experience and subjective recognition, but this approach is likely to bring about wrong decisions because of an excessive number of factors involved or biased subjective recognition. To prevent such a situation, this study establishes a Hybrid Gaussian Process Inference Model (HGPIM), which uses a Gaussian process (GP) to sort out the mapping relationship between data input and output. It also uses Bayesian inference together with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the hyper-parameters of the covariance function in GP to obtain the best inference predictive ability. By predicting with the model and giving the events that need to be decided an expected value and a variance, we can establish the data’s confidence interval as a reference for making decisions. This study collects data from three construction projects to conduct the experiment and uses HGPIM to train, predict and retest these cases to prove HGPIMs predictive ability. It also shows that the model can be applied to various cases and data and thus can be applied to construction engineering.},

  abstract     = {Cloud security in finance is considered as the key importance, taking account of the aspect of critical data stored over cloud spaces within organizations all around the globe. They are chiefly relying on cloud computing to accelerate their business profitability and scale up their business processes with enhanced productivity coming through flexible work environments offered in cloud-run working systems. Hence, there is a prerequisite to contemplate cloud security in the entire financial service sector. Moreover, the main issue challenged by privacy and security is the presence of diverse chances to attack the sensitive data by cloud operators, which leads to double the user’s anxiety on the stored data. For solving this problem, the main intent of this paper is to develop an intelligent privacy preservation approach for data stored in the cloud sector, mainly the financial data. The proposed privacy preservation model involves two main phases: (a) data sanitization and (b) data restoration. In the sanitization process, the sensitive data is hidden, which prevents sensitive information from leaking on the cloud side. Further, the normal as well as the sensitive data is stored in a cloud environment. For the sanitization process, a key should be generated that depends on the new meta-heuristic algorithm called crossover improved-lion algorithm (CI-LA), which is inspired by the lion’s unique social behavior. During data restoration, the same key should be used for effectively restoring the original data. Here, the optimal key generation is done in such a way that the objective model involves the degree of modification, hiding rate, and information preservation rate, which effectively enhance the cyber security performance in the cloud.},

  abstract     = {A new adaptive weighted deep forest algorithm which can be viewed as a modification of the confidence screening mechanism is proposed. The main idea underlying the algorithm is based on adaptive weigting of every training instance at each cascade level of the deep forest. The confidence screening mechanism for the deep forest proposed by Pang et al. , strictly removes instances from training and testing processes to simplify the whole algorithm in accordance with the obtained random forest class probability distributions. This strict removal may lead to a very small number of training instances at the next levels of the deep forest cascade. The presented modification is more flexible and assigns weights to instances in order to differentiate their use in building decision trees at every level of the deep forest cascade. It overcomes the main disadvantage of the confidence screening mechanism. The proposed modification is similar to the AdaBoost algorithm to some extent. Numerical experiments illustrate the outperformance of the proposed modification in comparison with the original deep forest. It is also illustrated how the proposed algorithm can be extended for solving the transfer learning and distance metric learning problems.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for image dehazing-based applications has raised the value of efficient evaluation and benchmarking for image dehazing algorithms. Several perspectives, such as inhomogeneous foggy, homogenous foggy, and dark foggy scenes, have been considered in multi-criteria evaluation. The benchmarking for the selection of the best image dehazing intelligent algorithm based on multi-criteria perspectives is a challenging task owing to (a) multiple evaluation criteria, (b) criteria importance, (c) data variation, (d) criteria conflict, and (e) criteria tradeoff. A generally accepted framework for benchmarking image dehazing performance is unavailable in the existing literature. This study proposes a novel multi-perspective (i.e., an inhomogeneous foggy scene, a homogenous foggy scene, and a dark foggy scene) benchmarking framework for the selection of the best image dehazing intelligent algorithm based on multi-criteria analysis. Experiments were conducted in three stages. First was an evaluation experiment with five algorithms as part of matrix data. Second was a crossover between image dehazing intelligent algorithms and a set of target evaluation criteria to obtain matrix data. Third was the ranking of the image dehazing intelligent algorithms through integrated best–worst and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods. Individual and group decision-making contexts were applied to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. The mean was used to objectively validate the ranks given by group decision-making contexts. Checklist and benchmarking scenarios were provided to compare the proposed framework with an existing benchmark study. The proposed framework achieved a significant result in terms of selecting the best image dehazing algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Best Worst Method (BWM) is a multi-criteria decision-making method that is based on a structured pairwise comparison system. It uses two pairwise comparison vectors ( best -to-others and others-to- worst ) as input for an optimization model to get the optimal weights of the criteria (or alternatives). The original BWM involves a nonlinear model that sometimes results in multiple optimal weights meaning that the weight of each criterion is presented as an interval. The aim of this paper is to introduce a ratio, called concentration ratio, to check the concentration of the optimal intervals obtained from the nonlinear BWM. The relationship between the concentration ratio and the consistency ratio is investigated and it is found that the concentration ratio along with the consistency ratio of the model provides enhanced insights into the reliability and flexibility of the results of BWM.},

In the past, wide amount and variety of approaches to derive interschema properties from structured and semi-structured data have been proposed. However, currently, it is esteemed that more than 80% of data sources are unstructured. Furthermore, the number of sources generally involved in an interaction is much higher than in the past. As a consequence, the necessity arises of new approaches to address the interschema property derivation issue in this new scenario. In this paper, we aim at providing a contribution in this setting by proposing an approach capable of uniformly extracting interschema properties from a huge number of structured, semi-structured and unstructured sources.},

  abstract     = {The selection of software programmer applicants based on multiperspective evaluation criteria (grade point average (GPA) and soft skills of the applicants) is needed instead of an interview because an interview does not necessarily lead to hiring the best candidate amongst the applicants. The selection of a suitable software programmer is considered a challenging task owing to the following factors: (1) data variation, (2) multiple evaluation criteria and (3) criterion importance. A general framework for the selection of the best software programmer applicants is not available in the existing literature. The present study aims to propose a novel multiperspective hiring framework based on multicriteria analysis to select the best software programmer amongst several applicants. A decision matrix (DM) is constructed for the selection of the best programmer applicants according to multiple criteria, namely, structured programming, object-oriented programming, data structure, database system and courseware engineering. Each criterion includes two parameters, namely, GPA and soft skills, and these criteria cross over with programmer applicants as alternatives. The standard and expert opinion of the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge is used to distribute the criteria in the DM. The two commonly used techniques of multicriteria decision-making are analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for weighing the criteria and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for ranking the alternatives (programmer applicants). The data used in this study include 60 software engineering students who graduated in 2016 from Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris. Results show that integrating multilayer analytic hierarchy process (MLAHP) and group TOPSIS are effective for solving applicant selection problems. Group TOPSIS uses different contexts — internal and external aggregation — and indicates similar results. Objective validation is used for the ranking of the results, which are equally divided into four parts. Furthermore, the applicants are systematically ranked. This study benefits application software, system software and computer programming tool companies by providing a method that improves software quality whilst reducing time and cost in the selection process.},

To that end, a sample of specialists in Iran was asked to take part in an online questionnaire, based on best–worst method (BWM), to determine the weight of the criteria included in the proposed framework, after which a number of potential locations are evaluated on the basis of the criteria. The proposed model is evaluated under a number of settings.

The major task of time-series classification using shapelets is to discover high quality shapelets. However, this is challenging since local patterns may have various scales/lengths rather than a unified scale. In this paper, we resolve this problem by discovering shapelets with multiple scales. We propose a novel Multi-Scale Shapelet Discovery (MSSD) algorithm to discover expressive multi-scale shapelets by extending initial single-scale shapelets (i.e., shapelets with a unified scale). MSSD adopts a bi-directional extension process and is robust to extend single-shapelets obtained by different methods. A supervised shapelet quality measurement is further developed to qualify the extension of shapelets. Comprehensive experiments conducted on 25 UCR time-series datasets show that multi-scale shapelets discovered by MSSD improve classification accuracy by around 10% (in average), compared with single-scale shapelets discovered by counterpart methods.},

  abstract     = {The technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is one of the most well-known methods in multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The classical TOPSIS method employs a similarity index to rank alternatives. However, the chosen alternative sometimes does not have the shortest distance to the positive ideal solution (PIS) and remotest distance from the negative ideal solution (NIS), simultaneously. Besides, in some cases, TOPSIS cannot assign a unique rank to alternatives. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new similarity TOPSIS index based on the relative distance to the best and worst points. In the proposed method, by treating the separations of an alternative from the PIS and the NIS as negative criterion and positive criterion, respectively, we reduce the original MCDM problem to a new one with two criteria. The proposed index, based on different weights, in optimistic, pessimistic, and apathetic cases, easily determines the score of each alternative. Finally, we illustrate the proposed index using four numerical examples. The results are compared with those published in the literature.},

Fluctuations in demand and priorities, the requirement for value-added service, government regulations and other factors put pressure on the operational decision makers on the warehouse floor and the systems that support them. The increasing complexity of daily warehouse operations means that decision support systems will need to become more sophisticated and intelligent to assist decision makers in real-time. The aim of this literature review is to investigate how decision support in warehousing and distribution operations is examined in the research literature. The objective of this review is to understand how this decision support research can assist operational decision makers to manage and complete the daily volume of work through the warehouse. Fifty-one articles were obtained by the literature search. Articles were categorized by type of warehouse, decision support target, operational task and problem type, research article methodology, architecture and technology. Decision support is examined in almost all areas of warehousing operations with the use of a variety of methods and technologies within the research literature. Most “daily warehouse operational” decision support deals with expertise transfer and reacting to real-time events. This paper highlights the lack of research into human–machine collaboration in adaptive decision support systems to assist warehouse operational decision makers.},

Because of the individual properties of the newly introduced term, the definitions of the data-intensive problems including optimization problems have been substantially changed and investigations about the solving capabilities of the existing techniques and then developing their specialized variants for big data optimizations have become important research topic. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm inspired by the clever foraging characteristics of the real honey bees is one of the most successful swarm intelligence-based metaheuristics. In this study, a new ABC algorithm-based technique that is named source-linked ABC (slinkABC) was proposed by considering the properties of the optimization problems related with the big data. The slinkABC algorithm was tested on the big data optimization problems presented at the Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2015 Big Data Optimization Competition. The results obtained from the experimental studies were compared with the different variants of the ABC algorithm including gbest-guided ABC (GABC), ABC/best/1, ABC/best/2, crossover ABC (CABC), converge-onlookers ABC (COABC), quick ABC (qABC) and modified gbest-guided ABC (MGABC) algorithms. In addition to these, the results of the proposed ABC algorithm were also compared with the results of the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, Genetic algorithm (GA), Firefly algorithm (FA), Phase-Based Optimization (PBO) algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm-based approaches. From the experimental studies, it was understood that the ABC algorithm modified by considering the unique properties of the big data optimization problems as in the slinkABC produces better solutions for most of the tested instances compared to the mentioned optimization techniques.},

  abstract     = {Increased global competition has led to a slowdown in Taiwan’s domestic semiconductor industry growth, which has resulted in many semiconductor companies reducing their investments and or seeking mergers and acquisitions (M &amp; As) to increase market power, expand their business territories or increase their competitive edge. However, as there is general uncertainty regarding the efficiencies to be gained from these M &amp; As, there has been an increase in M &amp; A supervision. While past research has explored company operations and management efficiency after mergers, there has been less focus on potential mergers. Therefore, this study used a resample slacks-based measure (RSBM) and merger potential gains models to evaluate potential merger efficiency gains. Data on 29 Taiwanese-listed integrated circuit (IC) design industry firms were collected to evaluate the efficiency of potential M &amp; As, from which it was found that the potential M &amp; As efficiencies had positive and negative values, indicating that efficiency gains were not guaranteed. A positive value was found for a potential M &amp; A between MTK &amp; NOVATEK and MTK &amp; DAVICOM, which meant that a potential M &amp; A would increase operating efficiencies and reduce costs.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method based on Dempster–Shafer Evidence Theory (DST) and linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (LIFNs), in which both the expert weights and attribute weights are unknown. Firstly, we represent LIFNs as basic probability assignments (BPAs) by DST based on linguistic scale function (LSF), and a linear programming model is proposed to combine the objective weights and subjective weights of attributes to obtain the combined weights. At the same time, the experts’ weights are obtained through Jousselme distance. Secondly, we use the weights to correct the evidence, and the comprehensive evaluation value of each alternative is calculated by the combination rule of evidence. Further, a new MAGDM approach with DST and LIFNs is presented. Finally, we give an example to explain the proposed method and compare it with other methods to show the feasibility and superiority.},

  abstract     = {Socially important locations are places which are frequently visited by social media users in their social media lifetime. Discovering socially important locations provides valuable information, such as which locations are frequently visited by a social media user, which locations are common for a social media user group, and which locations are socially important for a group of urban area residents. However, discovering socially important locations is challenging due to huge volume, velocity, and variety of social media datasets, inefficiency of current interest measures and algorithms on social media big datasets, and the need of massive spatial and temporal calculations for spatial social media analyses. In contrast, cloud computing provides infrastructure and platforms to scale compute-intensive jobs. In the literature, limited number of studies related to socially important locations discovery takes into account cloud computing systems to scale increasing dataset size and to handle massive calculations. This study proposes a cloud-based socially important locations discovery algorithm of Cloud SS-ILM to handle volume and variety of social media big datasets. In particular, in this study, we used Apache Hadoop framework and Hadoop MapReduce programming model to scale dataset size and handle massive spatial and temporal calculations. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted on a cloud computing environment using Turkey Twitter social media big dataset. The experimental results show that using cloud computing systems for socially important locations discovery provide much faster discovery of results than classical algorithms. Moreover, the results show that it is necessary to use cloud computing systems for analyzing social media big datasets that could not be handled with traditional stand-alone computer systems. The proposed Cloud SS-ILM algorithm could be applied on many application areas, such as targeted advertisement of businesses, social media utilization of cities for city planners and local governments, and handling emergency situations.},

No studies have been done in Turkey with similar purposes in the telecommunication sector. To reach this goal, there has been an attempt to develop both artificial neural network models and sector-specific applicable models. Four years of data between 2011 and 2014 belonging to customers in the telecommunication sector who have a Twitter account are used in this study. The CLV is modeled through radial basis function (RBF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and Elman neural network approaches, and the performance of such models is compared. According to the findings, calculated CLV error values are at an acceptable range in all formed models. Additionally, it is determined that the CLV was calculated with a lower error value in models where social media variables were used. The Elman neural network is determined to perform better compared to RBF and MLP.},

  abstract     = {Most of the traditional recommendation systems are based on user ratings. Here, users provide the ratings towards the product after use or experiencing it. Accordingly, the user item transactional database is constructed for recommendation. The rating based collaborative filtering method is well known method for recommendation system. This system leads to data sparsity problem as the user is unaware of other similar items. Web cataloguing service such as tags plays a significant role to analyse the user’s perception towards a particular product. Some system use tags as additional resource to reduce the data sparsity issue. But these systems require lot of specific details related to the tags. Existing system either focuses on ratings or tags based recommendation to enhance the accuracy. So these systems suffer from data sparsity and efficiency problem that leads to ineffective recommendations accuracy. To address the above said issues, this paper proposed hybrid recommendation system (Iter_ALS Iterative Alternate Least Square) to enhance the recommendation accuracy by integrating rating and emotion tags. The rating score reveals overall perception of the item and emotion tags reflects user’s feelings. In the absence of emotional tags, scores found in rating is assumed as positive or negative emotional tag score. Lexicon based semantic analysis on emotion tags value is adopted to represent the exclusive value of tag. Unified value is represented into Iter_ALS model to reduce the sparsity problem. In addition, this method handles opinion bias between ratings and tags. Experiments were tested and verified using a benchmark project of MovieLens dataset. Initially this model was tested with different sparsity levels varied between 0%-100 percent and the results obtained from the experiments shows the proposed method outperforms with baseline methods. Further tests were conducted to authenticate how it handles opinion bias by users before recommending the item. The proposed method is more capable to be adopted in many real world applications},

The balanced scorecard (BSC) model is modified to determine the criteria according to the literature review and experts’ judgments for this problem. Internal , Customer , and Financial perspectives of the traditional BSC model are used as the main criteria and an external perspective is considered as the fourth criterion for modified balanced scorecard. The experts’ criteria evaluations are gained and consolidated by the Modified Delphi Method. The criteria weights are determined by the Pythagorean Fuzzy-AHP method using the final pairwise comparison results obtained from the Modified Delphi Method. Subsequently, the Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to determine the best alternative site among alternatives to locate the ATM according to these criteria. Finally, the results are presented and discussed by sensitivity analysis.},

To achieve this aim, we first develop a novel conception of SVN correlation coefficient, whose significant feature is that it lies in the interval [ − 1 ,1], which is in accordance with the classical correlation coefficient in statistics, whereas all the existing SVN correlation coefficients in the literature are within unit interval [0,1]. Afterwards, a weighted SVN correlation coefficient is also introduced to infuse the importance of attributes. Moreover, a correlation-based comprehensive index is further proposed to establish the central structure of TOPSIS model, called the SVN correlation-based TOPSIS approach. Finally, a numerical example and relevant comparative analysis are implemented to explain the applicability and effectiveness of the mentioned methodology.},

For the waterway mode, cargo transportation is predominantly carried out by pushed convoys. The objective of this research is to evaluate and select, the best river train for the outflow of iron ore on the Marabá – Vila do Conde stretch, through a multiple criteria decision-making approach. To meet the objectives, a methodological framework is proposed using a hybrid AHP-DEMATEL method, based on a statistical analysis and to guarantee the reliability of the results for the proposed alternatives and not only considering the preference function, the ELECTRE method was used and also a parametric comparison of the AHP results. The main goals of this work were achieved and it was possible to infer that the combination of these methods has, in addition to the evident efficacy, a high reliability in the water transport area, being able to be used with accuracy of diverse forms in the academic area, as well as in industrial applications. Therefore, it can be affirmed that the best-pushed convoy configuration for the iron ore runoff in the Marabá – Vila do Conde stretch is composed by six barges in the arrangement of two columns and three rows with the measurements, by barge, with length of 60.96 m; beam of 13.75 m; and a 5 m molded depth.},

This algorithm can be used for supervised and unsupervised learning, based on the calculation of the Global Adequacy Degree (GAD) of one individual to a class, through the contributions of all its descriptors. LAMDA has the capability of creating new classes after the training stage. If an individual does not have enough similarity to the preexisting classes, it is evaluated with respect to a threshold called the Non-Informative Class (NIC), this being the novelty of the algorithm. However, LAMDA has problems making good classifications, either because the NIC is constant for all classes, or because the GAD calculation is unreliable. In this work, its efficiency is improved by two strategies, the first one, by the calculation of adaptable NICs for each class, which prevents that correctly classified individuals create new classes; and the second one, by computing the Higher Adequacy Degree (HAD), which grants more robustness to the algorithm. LAMDA-HAD is validated by applying it in different benchmarks and comparing it with LAMDA and other classifiers, through a statistical analysis to determinate the cases in which our algorithm presents a better performance.},

Data mining-based DSS produces potentially interesting patterns from data. The transition from extracted patterns to knowledge is a delicate task. In this context, we propose to adapt a common visual analytics process for creating a path that enables the user (decision-maker) to automatically explore and visually extract insights by interacting with the patterns. This proposal is inspired from integrating traditional visual analytics concepts with the mental model of knowledge visualization. The idea is to combine an automatic and visual analysis of patterns to generate knowledge for the purpose of decision-making. To validate our proposal, we have applied it to a medical case study for the fight against Nosocomial Infections in Intensive Care Units. The developed platform was evaluated according to the utility and usability dimensions.},

The new, relatively simple and transparent method can become a useful and practical tool for the decision makers. Mathematical correctness of the proposed methodology is proven. Based on the new method, a procedure for solving a complex decision problem is created. Its applicability is illustrated by two case studies. Choosing the best option for the organization’s competitive position in a health-care organization shows how the proposed method works with uncertain judgments. Its usefulness for group decision-making is illustrated by applying it to a decision concerning allocation of public funds for sport development in a small commune.},

  abstract     = {In time series modeling, one problem is to identify a small number of influential factors to explain variations in the variable of interest. With a vast number of possible factors available, suitable features need to be identified to yield multi-factor models with good explanatory power. In this paper, we propose a novel subset selection method which makes use of the properties in the frequency domain environment. The proposed system ensures key patterns in the target variable be sought and suitable factors be selected based on frequency peaks in common. It can perform well even when the number of factors is significantly greater than the sample size. Moreover, a very important feature of the proposed system is the capability of handling factors with different timeframes, which is lacking in existing methods. We demonstrate the system via several examples with dataset from finance, economic, road traffic and air pollution.},

  abstract     = {Since 2013, China has become the world’s largest gold producer and consumer. To gain the corresponding global pricing power in gold, many actions have been taken by China in recent years, including the International Board at Shanghai Gold Exchange, Shanghai-Hong Kong Gold Connect and Shanghai Gold Fix. Our work studies the dependence structure between China’s and international gold price and examines whether these moves are changing the dependence structure. We use GARCH-copula models to detect the dynamic dependence and tail dependence. The research period is set to contain the Financial Crisis in 2008, the dramatical plunge of gold price in 2013 and a series of black swan events in 2016. The empirical study shows that some event driven dependence structure breaks are statistically insignificant. And the time-varying Symmetrized Joe-Clayton copula is the best copula to model the dependence structure based on AIC value. Finally, an example of applications of this dependence structure is given by estimating the VaR of an equally weighted portfolio with a simulation-based method.},

  abstract     = {The linguistic D numbers (LDNs) can express the fuzzy evaluation information more easily and precisely by combining the advantages of linguistic terms (LTs) and D numbers (DNs). Existing researches on the fuzzy entropy of LDNs are rare, and most of the definitions of fuzzy entropy for LDNs are unreasonable. In view of this research gap, this paper improves the definition of fuzzy entropy of LDNs, which simultaneously considers the effects of confidence degrees and LTs on the value of fuzzy entropy in LDNs. Then, the weights of attributes can be calculated by the improved fuzzy entropy. Further, a new combination rule for LDNs is also presented in this paper. Based on these studies, we extend the traditional Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to the LDNs and develop the LD-VIKOR method. The proposed LD-VIKOR method is convenient to handle MADM problems with unknown attributes weights under the environment of LDNs. Finally, we verify the validity and reliability of the proposed method by an illustrative example, and analyze the advantages of the proposed method by comparing it with other existing MADM methods.},

  abstract     = {To improve the quality of service and network performance for the Flash P2P video-on-demand, the prediction Flash P2P network traffic flow is beneficial for the control of the network video traffic. In this paper, a novel prediction algorithm to forecast the traffic rate of Flash P2P video is proposed. This algorithm is based on the combination of the ensemble local mean decomposition (ELMD) and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH). The ELMD is used to decompose the original long-related flow into the summation of the short-related flow. Then, the GRACH is utilized to predict the short-related flow. The developed algorithm is tested in a university’s campus network. The predicted results show that our proposed method can further achieve higher accuracy than those obtained by existing algorithms, such as GARCH and Local Mean Decomposition and Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (LMD-GARCH) while keeping lower computational complexity.},

It is also a focus of academic research, as shown by a large number of papers, books, and research reports. On the other hand, the BA domain suffers from several incorrect, imprecise, and incomplete notions. New areas and concepts emerge quickly; making it difficult to ascertain their structure. BA-related taxonomies play a crucial role in analyzing, classifying, and understanding related objects. However, according to the literature on taxonomy development in information systems (IS), in most cases the process is ad hoc . BA taxonomies and frameworks are available in the literature; however, some are excessively general frameworks with a high-level conceptual focus, while others are application or domain-specific. Our paper aims to present a novel semi-automatic method for taxonomy development and maintenance in the field of BA using content analysis and text mining. The contribution of our research is threefold: (1) the taxonomy development method, (2) the draft taxonomy for BA, and (3) identifying the latest research areas and trends in BA.},

To guarantee high efficiency, the clustering process should ensure high accuracy and low complexity. Many clustering methods were developed in various fields depending on the type of application and the data type considered. Categorical clustering considers segmenting a dataset in which the data are categorical and were widely used in many real-world applications. Thus several methods were developed including hard, fuzzy and rough set-based methods. In this survey, more than 30 categorical clustering algorithms were investigated. These methods were classified into hierarchical and partitional clustering methods and classified in terms of their accuracy, precision and recall to identify the most prominent ones. Experimental results show that rough set-based clustering methods provided better efficiency than hard and fuzzy methods. Besides, methods based on the initialization of the centroids also provided good results.},
