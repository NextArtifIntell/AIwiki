  abstract     = {To identify precursors of epileptic seizures, an EEG characteristic analysis is carried out based on a roughness-length method, where fractal dimensions and intercept values are extracted to measure the structure complexity and the amplitude roughness of EEG signals in different phases. Using the significant changes of the fractal dimension and intercept in the preictal phase with respect to those in the interictal phase, a patient-specific seizure prediction algorithm is then proposed by combining with a gradient boosting classifier. The probabilistic outputs of the trained gradient boosting classifier are further processed by threshold comparison and rule-based judgment to distinguish preictal EEG from interictal EEG and to generate seizure alerts. The prediction algorithm was evaluated on 20 patients’ intracranial EEG recordings from the Freiburg EEG database, which contains the preictal periods of 65 seizures and 499 h interictal EEG. Setting the seizure prediction horizon as 2 min, averaged sensitivity values of 90.42% and 91.67% with averaged false prediction rates of 0.12/h and 0.10/h were achieved for seizure occurrence periods of 30 and 50 min, respectively. These results demonstrate the ability of fractal dimension and intercept metrics in predicting the occurrence of seizures.},

  abstract     = {Stroke, if not lethal, is a primary cause of disability. Early assessment of markers of recovery can allow personalized interventions; however, it is difficult to deliver indexes in the acute phase able to predict recovery. In this perspective, evaluation of electrical brain activity may provide useful information. A machine learning approach was explored here to predict post-stroke recovery relying on multi-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of few minutes performed at rest. A data-driven model, based on partial least square (PLS) regression, was trained on 19-channel EEG recordings performed within 10 days after mono-hemispheric stroke in 101 patients. The band-wise (delta: 1–4 Hz, theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha: 8–14 Hz and beta: 15–30 Hz) EEG effective powers were used as features to predict the recovery at 6 months (based on clinical status evaluated through the NIH Stroke Scale, NIHSS) in an optimized and cross-validated framework. In order to exploit the multimodal contribution to prognosis, the EEG-based prediction of recovery was combined with NIHSS scores in the acute phase and both were fed to a nonlinear support vector regressor (SVR). The prediction performance of EEG was at least as good as that of the acute clinical status scores. A posteriori evaluation of the features exploited by the analysis highlighted a lower delta and higher alpha activity in patients showing a positive outcome, independently of the affected hemisphere. The multimodal approach showed better prediction capabilities compared to the acute NIHSS scores alone ( r = 0 . 5 3 versus r = 0 . 4 1 , AUC = 0.80 versus AUC = 0.70, p &lt; 0 . 0 5 ). The multimodal and multivariate model can be used in acute phase to infer recovery relying on standard EEG recordings of few minutes performed at rest together with clinical assessment, to be exploited for early and personalized therapies. The easiness of performing EEG may allow such an approach to become a standard-of-care and, thanks to the increasing number of labeled samples, further improving the model predictive power.},

Drawing inspiration from this two-way relationship in which the astrocytes influence and are influenced by the neurons by means of calcium ions, in this paper, we define and study spiking neural P systems with astrocytes producing calcium. Distinct from the usual firing rules in spiking neural P systems, the firing condition not only depends on the spikes collected in a neuron but also on the calcium units received from astrocytes. From the perspective of topological structure, the new variant is shown as a directed graph in which synapses link either astrocytes or neurons, as well as astrocytes to neurons and conversely. The computational power of spiking neural P systems with astrocytes producing calcium is investigated; it is proved that these systems using a limited number of rules are Turing universal as both number generating and number accepting devices. It is also presented how to obtain normal forms by removing forgetting rules and delays while preserving the computational power.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic profile of brain function has received much attention in recent years and is also a focus in the study of epilepsy. The present study aims to integrate the dynamics of temporal and spatial characteristics to provide comprehensive and novel understanding of epileptic dynamics. Resting state fMRI data were collected from eighty-three patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) and 87 healthy controls (HC). Specifically, we explored the temporal and spatial variation of functional connectivity density (tvFCD and svFCD) in the whole brain. Using a sliding-window approach, for a given region, the standard variation of the FCD series was calculated as the tvFCD and the variation of voxel-wise spatial distribution was calculated as the svFCD. We found primary, high-level, and sub-cortical networks demonstrated distinct tvFCD and svFCD patterns in HC. In general, the high-level networks showed the highest variation, the subcortical and primary networks showed moderate variation, and the limbic system showed the lowest variation. Relative to HC, the patients with IGE showed weaken temporal and enhanced spatial variation in the default mode network and weaken temporospatial variation in the subcortical network. Besides, enhanced temporospatial variation in sensorimotor and high-level networks was also observed in patients. The hyper-synchronization of specific brain networks was inferred to be associated with the phenomenon responsible for the intrinsic propensity of generation and propagation of epileptic activities. The disrupted dynamic characteristics of sensorimotor and high-level networks might potentially contribute to the driven motion and cognition phenotypes in patients. In all, presently provided evidence from the temporospatial variation of functional interaction shed light on the dynamics underlying neuropathological profiles of epilepsy.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic brain activity is organized into large-scale networks displaying specific structural–functional architecture, known as resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs reflect complex neurophysiological processes and interactions, and have a central role in distinct sensory and cognitive functions, making it crucial to understand and quantify their anatomical and functional properties. Fractal dimension (FD) provides a parsimonious way of summarizing self-similarity over different spatial and temporal scales but despite its suitability for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal analysis its ability to characterize and investigate RSNs is poorly understood. We used FD in a large sample of healthy participants to differentiate fMRI RSNs and examine how the FD property of RSNs is linked with their functional roles. We identified two clusters of RSNs, one mainly consisting of sensory networks (C1, including auditory, sensorimotor and visual networks) and the other more related to higher cognitive (HCN) functions (C2, including dorsal default mode network and fronto-parietal networks). These clusters were defined in a completely data-driven manner using hierarchical clustering, suggesting that quantification of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal complexity with FD is able to characterize meaningful physiological and functional variability. Understanding the mechanisms underlying functional RSNs, and developing tools to study their signal properties, is essential for assessing specific brain alterations and FD could potentially be used for the early detection and treatment of neurological disorders.},

Every year, approximately 2.4 million people are diagnosed with epilepsy, two-thirds of them will not know the etiology of their disease, and 1% of these individuals will decease as a consequence of it. Due to the inherent complexity of predicting and explaining it, the mathematical model Epileptor was recently developed to reproduce seizure-like events, also providing insights to improve the understanding of the neural dynamics in the interictal and ictal periods, although the physics behind each parameter and variable of the model is not fully established in the literature. This paper introduces an approach to design a feedback-based controller for suppressing epileptic seizures described by Epileptor. Our work establishes how the nonlinear dynamics of this disorder can be written in terms of a combination of linear sub-models employing an exact solution. Additionally, we show how a feedback control gain can be computed to suppress seizures, as well as how specific shapes applied as input stimuli for this purpose can be obtained. The practical application of the approach is discussed and the results show that the proposed technique is promising for developing controllers in this field.},

Previous studies have used certain risk factors or electroencephalogram (EEG) findings to predict seizure recurrence after the withdrawal of AEDs. However, validated biomarkers to guide the withdrawal of AEDs are lacking. In this study, we used quantitative EEG analysis to establish a method for predicting seizure recurrence after the withdrawal of AEDs. A total of 34 patients with epilepsy were divided into two groups, 17 patients in the recurrence group and the other 17 patients in the nonrecurrence group. All patients were seizure free for at least two years. Before AED withdrawal, an EEG was performed for each patient that showed no epileptiform discharges. These EEG recordings were classified using Hjorth parameter-based EEG features. We found that the Hjorth complexity values were higher in patients in the recurrence group than in the nonrecurrence group. The extreme gradient boosting classification method achieved the highest performance in terms of accuracy, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity (84.76%, 88.77%, 89.67%, and 80.47%, respectively). Our proposed method is a promising tool to help physicians determine AED withdrawal for seizure-free patients.},

  abstract     = {Advances in electroencephalography (EEG) equipment now allow monitoring of people with epilepsy in their daily-life environment. The large volumes of data that can be collected from long-term out-of-clinic monitoring require novel algorithms to process the recordings on board of the device to identify and log or transmit only relevant data epochs. Existing seizure-detection algorithms are generally designed for post-processing purposes, so that memory and computing power are rarely considered as constraints. We propose a novel multi-channel EEG signal processing method for automated absence seizure detection which is specifically designed to run on a microcontroller with minimal memory and processing power. It is based on a linear multi-channel filter that is precomputed offline in a data-driven fashion based on the spatial-temporal signature of the seizure and peak interference statistics. At run-time, the algorithm requires only standard linear filtering operations, which are cheap and efficient to compute, in particular on microcontrollers with a multiply-accumulate unit (MAC). For validation, a dataset of eight patients with juvenile absence epilepsy was collected. Patients were equipped with a 20-channel mobile EEG unit and discharged for a day-long recording. The algorithm achieves a median of 0.5 false detections per day at 95% sensitivity. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art absence seizure detection algorithms and conclude it performs on par with these at a much lower computational cost.},

  abstract     = {Visual evaluation of electroencephalogram (EEG) for Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) as distinctive biomarkers of epilepsy has various limitations, including time-consuming reviews, steep learning curves, interobserver variability, and the need for specialized experts. The development of an automated IED detector is necessary to provide a faster and reliable diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, we propose an automated IED detector based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We have evaluated the proposed IED detector on a sizable database of 554 scalp EEG recordings (84 epileptic patients and 461 nonepileptic subjects) recorded at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston. The proposed CNN IED detector has achieved superior performance in comparison with conventional methods with a mean cross-validation area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.838 ± 0.040 and false detection rate of 0.2 ± 0.11 per minute for a sensitivity of 80%. We demonstrated the proposed system to be noninferior to 30 neurologists on a dataset from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Further, we clinically validated the system at National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore, with an agreement accuracy of 81.41% with a clinical expert. Moreover, the proposed system can be applied to EEG recordings with any arbitrary number of channels.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection plays a vital role in the detection and discrimination of epileptic seizures in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The state-of-the-art EEG classification techniques commonly entail the extraction of the multiple features that would be fed into classifiers. For some techniques, the feature selection strategies have been used to reduce the dimensionality of the entire feature space. However, most of these approaches focus on the performance of classifiers while neglecting the association between the feature and the EEG activity itself. To enhance the inner relationship between the feature subset and the epileptic EEG task with a promising classification accuracy, we propose a machine learning-based pipeline using a novel feature selection algorithm built upon a knockoff filter. First, a number of temporal, spectral, and spatial features are extracted from the raw EEG signals. Second, the proposed feature selection algorithm is exploited to obtain the optimal subgroup of features. Afterwards, three classifiers including k -nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are used. The experimental results on the Bonn dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques, with accuracy as high as 99.93% for normal and interictal EEG discrimination and 98.95% for interictal and ictal EEG classification. Meanwhile, it has achieved satisfactory sensitivity (95.67% in average), specificity (98.83% in average), and accuracy (98.89% in average) over the Freiburg dataset.},

  abstract     = {Thalamus interacts with cortical areas, generating oscillations characterized by their rhythm and levels of synchrony. However, little is known of what function the rhythmic dynamic may serve in thalamocortical couplings. This work introduced a general approach to investigate the modulatory contribution of rhythmic scalp network to the thalamo-frontal couplings in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Here, time-varying rhythmic network was constructed using the adapted directed transfer function between EEG electrodes, and then was applied as a modulator in fMRI-based thalamocortical functional couplings. Furthermore, the relationship between corticocortical connectivity and rhythm-dependent thalamocortical coupling was examined. The results revealed thalamocortical couplings modulated by EEG scalp network have frequency-dependent characteristics. Increased thalamus- sensorimotor network (SMN) and thalamus-default mode network (DMN) couplings in JME were strongly modulated by alpha band. These thalamus–SMN couplings demonstrated enhanced association with SMN-related corticocortical connectivity. In addition, altered theta-dependent and beta-dependent thalamus-frontoparietal network (FPN) couplings were found in FLE. The reduced theta-dependent thalamus–FPN couplings were associated with the decreased FPN-related corticocortical connectivity. This study proposed interactive links between the rhythmic modulation and thalamocortical coupling. The crucial role of SMN and FPN in subcortical-cortical circuit may have implications for intervention in generalized and focal epilepsy.},

We here propose Pyramidal Image Anomaly DEtector ( PIADE ), a deep reconstruction-based pyramidal approach, in which image features are extracted at different scale levels to better catch the peculiarities that could help to discriminate between normal and anomalous data. The features are dynamically routed to a reconstruction layer and anomalies can be identified by comparing the input image with its reconstruction. Unlike similar approaches, the comparison is done by using structural similarity and perceptual loss rather than trivial pixel-by-pixel comparison.

  abstract     = {Speech is controlled by axial neuromotor systems, therefore, it is highly sensitive to the effects of neurodegenerative illnesses such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Patients suffering from PD present important alterations in speech, which are manifested in phonation, articulation, prosody, and fluency. These alterations may be evaluated using statistical methods on features obtained from glottal, spectral, cepstral, or fractal descriptions of speech. This work introduces an evaluation paradigm based on Information Theory (IT) to differentiate the effects of PD and aging on glottal amplitude distributions. The study is conducted on a database including 48 PD patients (24 males, 24 females), 48 age-matched healthy controls (HC, 24 males, 24 females), and 48 mid-age normative subjects (NS, 24 males, 24 females). It may be concluded from the study that Hierarchical Clustering (HiCl) methods produce a clear separation between the phonation of PD patients from NS subjects (accuracy of 89.6% for both male and female subsets), but the separation between PD patients and HC subjects is less efficient (accuracy of 75.0% for the male subset and 70.8% for the female subset). Conversely, using feature selection and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, the differentiation between PD and HC is substantially improved (accuracy of 94.8% for the male subset and 92.8% for the female subset). This improvement was mainly boosted by feature selection, at a cost of information and generalization losses. The results point to the possibility that speech deterioration may affect HC phonation with aging, reducing its difference to PD phonation.},

  abstract     = {The basal ganglia (BG) represent a critical center of the nervous system for sensorial discrimination. Although it is known that Huntington’s disease (HD) affects this brain area, it still remains unclear how HD patients achieve paradoxical improvement in sensorial discrimination tasks. This paper presents a computational model of the BG including the main nuclei and the typical firing properties of their neurons. The BG model has been embedded within an auditory signal detection task. We have emulated the effect that the altered levels of dopamine and the degree of HD affectation have in information processing at different layers of the BG, and how these aspects shape transient and steady states differently throughout the selection task. By extracting the independent components of the BG activity at different populations, it is evidenced that early and medium stages of HD affectation may enhance transient activity in the striatum and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. These results represent a possible explanation for the paradoxical improvement that HD patients present in discrimination task performance. Thus, this paper provides a novel understanding on how the fast dynamics of the BG network at different layers interact and enable transient states to emerge throughout the successive neuron populations.},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition and neural activity analysis are the basis for human computational neureoethology research dealing with the simultaneous analysis of behavioral ethogram descriptions and neural activity measurements. Wireless electroencephalography (EEG) and wireless inertial measurement units (IMU) allow the realization of experimental data recording with improved ecological validity where the subjects can be carrying out natural activities while data recording is minimally invasive. Specifically, we aim to show that EEG and IMU data fusion allows improved human activity recognition in a natural setting. We have defined an experimental protocol composed of natural sitting, standing and walking activities, and we have recruited subjects in two sites: in-house ( N = 4 ) and out-house ( N = 1 2 ) populations with different demographics. Experimental protocol data capture was carried out with validated commercial systems. Classifier model training and validation were carried out with scikit-learn open source machine learning python package. EEG features consist of the amplitude of the standard EEG frequency bands. Inertial features were the instantaneous position of the body tracked points after a moving average smoothing to remove noise. We carry out three validation processes: a 10-fold cross-validation process per experimental protocol repetition, (b) the inference of the ethograms, and (c) the transfer learning from each experimental protocol repetition to the remaining repetitions. The in-house accuracy results were lower and much more variable than the out-house sessions results. In general, random forest was the best performing classifier model. Best cross-validation results, ethogram accuracy, and transfer learning were achieved from the fusion of EEG and IMUs data. Transfer learning behaved poorly compared to classification on the same protocol repetition, but it has accuracy still greater than 0.75 on average for the out-house data sessions. Transfer leaning accuracy among repetitions of the same subject was above 0.88 on average. Ethogram prediction accuracy was above 0.96 on average. Therefore, we conclude that wireless EEG and IMUs allow for the definition of natural experimental designs with high ecological validity toward human computational neuroethology research. The fusion of both EEG and IMUs signals improves activity and ethogram recognition.},

  abstract     = {Emotion and affect play crucial roles in human life that can be disrupted by diseases. Functional brain networks need to dynamically reorganize within short time periods in order to efficiently process and respond to affective stimuli. Documenting these large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics on the same timescale they arise, however, presents a large technical challenge. In this study, the dynamic reorganization of the cortical functional brain network during an affective processing and emotion regulation task is documented using an advanced multi-model electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Sliding time window correlation and k -means clustering are employed to explore the functional brain connectivity (FC) dynamics during the unaltered perception of neutral (moderate valence, low arousal) and negative (low valence, high arousal) stimuli and cognitive reappraisal of negative stimuli. Betweenness centralities are computed to identify central hubs within each complex network. Results from 20 healthy subjects indicate that the cortical mechanism for cognitive reappraisal follows a ‘top-down’ pattern that occurs across four brain network states that arise at different time instants (0–170 ms, 170–370 ms, 380–620 ms, and 620–1000 ms). Specifically, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is identified as a central hub to promote the connectivity structures of various affective states and consequent regulatory efforts. This finding advances our current understanding of the cortical response networks of reappraisal-based emotion regulation by documenting the recruitment process of four functional brain sub-networks, each seemingly associated with different cognitive processes, and reveals the dynamic reorganization of functional brain networks during emotion regulation.},

  abstract     = {Hippocampal place cells and interneurons in mammals have stable place fields and theta phase precession profiles that encode spatial environmental information. Hippocampal CA1 neurons can represent the animal’s location and prospective information about the goal location. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as Q-learning have been used to build the navigation models. However, the traditional Q-learning ( t Q-learning) limits the reward function once the animals arrive at the goal location, leading to unsatisfactory location accuracy and convergence rates. Therefore, we proposed a revised version of the Q-learning algorithm, dynamical Q-learning ( d Q-learning), which assigns the reward function adaptively to improve the decoding performance. Firing rate was the input of the neural network of d Q-learning and was used to predict the movement direction. On the other hand, phase precession was the input of the reward function to update the weights of d Q-learning. Trajectory predictions using d Q- and t Q-learning were compared by the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted rat trajectories. Using d Q-learning, significantly higher prediction accuracy and faster convergence rate were obtained compared with t Q-learning in all cell types. Moreover, combining place cells and interneurons with theta phase precession improved the convergence rate and prediction accuracy. The proposed d Q-learning algorithm is a quick and more accurate method to perform trajectory reconstruction and prediction.},

  abstract     = {Past studies have consistently shown functional dysconnectivity of large-scale brain networks in schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to further assess whether multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) could yield a sensitive predictor of patient symptoms, as well as identify ultra-high risk (UHR) stage of schizophrenia from intrinsic functional connectivity of whole-brain networks. We first combined rank-based feature selection and support vector machine methods to distinguish between 43 schizophrenia patients and 52 healthy controls. The constructed classifier was then applied to examine functional connectivity profiles of 18 UHR individuals. The classifier indicated reliable relationship between MVPA measures and symptom severity, with higher classification accuracy in more severely affected schizophrenia patients. The UHR subjects had classification scores falling between those of healthy controls and patients, suggesting an intermediate level of functional brain abnormalities. Moreover, UHR individuals with schizophrenia-like connectivity profiles at baseline presented higher rate of conversion to full-blown illness in the follow-up visits. Spatial maps of discriminative brain regions implicated increases of functional connectivity in the default mode network, whereas decreases of functional connectivity in the cerebellum, thalamus and visual areas in schizophrenia. The findings may have potential utility in the early diagnosis and intervention of schizophrenia.},

In recent studies, advanced signal processing techniques have been favored to diagnose OCD. This research suggests four different measurements; intrinsic phase-locked value, intrinsic coherence, intrinsic synchronization likelihood, and intrinsic visibility graph similarity that quantifies the synchronization level and complexity in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This intrinsic synchronization is achieved by utilizing Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD), a data-driven method that resolves nonlinear and nonstationary data into their intrinsic mode functions. Our intrinsic technique in this study demonstrates that MEMD-based synchronization analysis gives us much more detailed knowledge rather than utilizing the synchronization method alone. Furthermore, the nonlinear synchronization method presents more consistent results considering OCD heterogeneity. Statistical evaluation using sample t -test and U -test has shown the significance of such new methodology.},

  abstract     = {Visual neuroprosthesis, that provide electrical stimulation along several sites of the human visual system, constitute a potential tool for vision restoration for the blind. Scientific and technological progress in the fields of neural engineering and artificial vision comes with new theories and tools that, along with the dawn of modern artificial intelligence, constitute a promising framework for the further development of neurotechnology. In the framework of the development of a Cortical Visual Neuroprosthesis for the blind (CORTIVIS), we are now facing the challenge of developing not only computationally powerful tools and flexible approaches that will allow us to provide some degree of functional vision to individuals who are profoundly blind. In this work, we propose a general neuroprosthesis framework composed of several task-oriented and visual encoding modules. We address the development and implementation of computational models of the firing rates of retinal ganglion cells and design a tool — Neurolight — that allows these models to be interfaced with intracortical microelectrodes in order to create electrical stimulation patterns that can evoke useful perceptions. In addition, the developed framework allows the deployment of a diverse array of state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques for task-oriented and general image pre-processing, such as semantic segmentation and object detection in our system’s pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first deep-learning-based system designed to directly interface with the visual brain through an intracortical microelectrode array. We implement the complete pipeline, from obtaining a video stream to developing and deploying task-oriented deep-learning models and predictive models of retinal ganglion cells’ encoding of visual inputs under the control of a neurostimulation device able to send electrical train pulses to a microelectrode array implanted at the visual cortex.},

Within this context, this work presented here tries to provide a set of imaging features based on morphological characteristics extracted from I [ 1 2 3 ] -Ioflupane SPECT scans to discern between HC and PD participants in a balanced set of 3 8 6 scans from Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database.

The proposed system, based on a Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon U-Test for feature selection and the SVM approach, yielded a 9 7 . 0 4 % balanced accuracy when the performance was evaluated using a 1 0 -fold cross-validation. This proves the reliability of these biomarkers, especially those related to sphericity, center of mass, number of vertices, 2D-projected perimeter or the 2D-projected eccentricity, among others, but including both internal and external isosurfaces.},

Imbalanced datasets are common in several domains such as health, finance, security and others. A wide range of solutions to handle imbalanced datasets focus mainly on the class distribution problem and aim at providing more balanced datasets by means of resampling. However, existing literature shows that class overlap has a higher negative impact on the learning process than class distribution. In this paper, we propose overlap-based undersampling methods for maximizing the visibility of the minority class instances in the overlapping region. This is achieved by the use of soft clustering and the elimination threshold that is adaptable to the overlap degree to identify and eliminate negative instances in the overlapping region. For more accurate clustering and detection of overlapped negative instances, the presence of the minority class at the borderline areas is emphasized by means of oversampling. Extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets covering a wide range of imbalance and overlap scenarios including extreme cases were carried out. Results show significant improvement in sensitivity and competitive performance with well-established and state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Several data have demonstrated that during the widely used experimental paradigm for studying associative learning, trace eye blinking conditioning (TEBC), there is a strong interaction between cerebellum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Despite this evidence, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction are still not clear. Here, we propose a neurophysiologically plausible computational model to address this issue. The model is constrained on the basis of two critical anatomo-physiological features: (i) the cerebello-cortical organization through two circuits, respectively, targeting M1 and mPFC; (ii) the different timing in the plasticity mechanisms of these parallel circuits produced by the granule cells time sensitivity according to which different subpopulations are active at different moments during conditioned stimuli. The computer simulations run with the model suggest that these features are critical to understand how the cooperation between cerebellum and mPFC supports motor areas during TEBC. In particular, a greater trace interval produces greater plasticity changes at the slow path synapses involving mPFC with respect to plasticity changes at the fast path involving M1. As a consequence, the greater is the trace interval, the stronger is the mPFC involvement. The model has been validated by reproducing data collected through recent real mice experiments.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) systems are affected by a pervasive lack of transparency. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research area addresses this problem and the related issue of explaining the behavior of ML systems in terms that are understandable to human beings. In many explanation of XAI approaches, the output of ML systems are explained in terms of low-level features of their inputs. However, these approaches leave a substantive explanatory burden with human users, insofar as the latter are required to map low-level properties into more salient and readily understandable parts of the input. To alleviate this cognitive burden, an alternative model-agnostic framework is proposed here. This framework is instantiated to address explanation problems in the context of ML image classification systems, without relying on pixel relevance maps and other low-level features of the input. More specifically, one obtains sets of middle-level properties of classification inputs that are perceptually salient by applying sparse dictionary learning techniques. These middle-level properties are used as building blocks for explanations of image classifications. The achieved explanations are parsimonious, for their reliance on a limited set of middle-level image properties. And they can be contrastive, because the set of middle-level image properties can be used to explain why the system advanced the proposed classification over other antagonist classifications. In view of its model-agnostic character, the proposed framework is adaptable to a variety of other ML systems and explanation problems.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting has always been the cornerstone of machine learning and statistics. Despite the great evolution of the time series theory, forecasters are still in the hunt for better models to make more accurate decisions. The huge advances in neural networks over the last years has led to the emergence of a new generation of effective models replacing classic econometric models. It is in this direction that we propose, in this paper, a new multiscaled Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), with the aim of forecasting multivariate time series. This new model, called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based Neural ARDL, is inspired from the well-known Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model being our proposal founded upon the concepts of nonlinearity, EMD-multiresolution and neural networks. These features give the model the ability to effectively capture many nonlinear patterns like the ones often present in econophysical time series, such as nonlinear trends, seasonal effects, long-range dependency, etc. The proposed algorithm can be summarized into the following four basic tasks: (i) EMD breaking-down multivariate time series into different resolution levels, (ii) feeding EMD components from the same levels into a number of feedforward neural ARDL models, (iii) from one level to the next, extrapolating the component corresponding to the response variable (scalar output) a number of steps ahead, and finally, (iv) recombining level-by-level forecasts into a single output. An optimal learning scheme is rigorously designed for efficiently training the new proposed architecture. The approach is finally tested and compared to a number of powerful benchmark models, where experiments are conducted on real-world data.},

  abstract     = {The Temporal Sampling Framework (TSF) theorizes that the characteristic phonological difficulties of dyslexia are caused by an atypical oscillatory sampling at one or more temporal rates. The LEEDUCA study conducted a series of Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments on children listening to amplitude modulated (AM) noise with slow-rythmic prosodic (0.5–1 Hz), syllabic (4–8 Hz) or the phoneme (12–40 Hz) rates, aimed at detecting differences in perception of oscillatory sampling that could be associated with dyslexia. The purpose of this work is to check whether these differences exist and how they are related to children’s performance in different language and cognitive tasks commonly used to detect dyslexia. To this purpose, temporal and spectral inter-channel EEG connectivity was estimated, and a denoising autoencoder (DAE) was trained to learn a low-dimensional representation of the connectivity matrices. This representation was studied via correlation and classification analysis, which revealed ability in detecting dyslexic subjects with an accuracy higher than 0.8, and balanced accuracy around 0.7. Some features of the DAE representation were significantly correlated ( p &lt; 0 . 0 0 5 ) with children’s performance in language and cognitive tasks of the phonological hypothesis category such as phonological awareness and rapid symbolic naming, as well as reading efficiency and reading comprehension. Finally, a deeper analysis of the adjacency matrix revealed a reduced bilateral connection between electrodes of the temporal lobe (roughly the primary auditory cortex) in DD subjects, as well as an increased connectivity of the F7 electrode, placed roughly on Broca’s area. These results pave the way for a complementary assessment of dyslexia using more objective methodologies such as EEG.},

This paper introduces an accurate identification of stress/calm condition from electrodermal activity (EDA) signals. The acquisition of EDA signals from a commercial wearable as well as their storage and processing are presented. Several time-domain, frequency-domain and morphological features are extracted over the skin conductance response of the EDA signals. Afterwards, a classification is undergone by using several classical support vector machines (SVMs) and deep support vector machines (D-SVMs). In addition, several binary classifiers are also compared with SVMs in the stress/calm identification task. Moreover, a series of video clips evoking calm and stress conditions have been viewed by 147 volunteers in order to validate the classification results. The highest F1-score obtained for SVMs and D-SVMs are 83% and 92%, respectively. These results demonstrate that not only classical SVMs are appropriate for classification of biomarker signals, but D-SVMs are very competitive in comparison to other classification techniques. In addition, the results have enabled drawing useful considerations for the future use of SVMs and D-SVMs in the specific case of stress/calm identification.},

Its prevalence is estimated between 5% and 12% of the population. Traditional tests for DD diagnosis aim to measure different behavioral variables involved in the reading process. In this paper, we propose a diagnostic method not based on behavioral variables but on involuntary neurophysiological responses to different auditory stimuli. The experiments performed use electroencephalography (EEG) signals to analyze the temporal behavior and the spectral content of the signal acquired from each electrode to extract relevant (temporal and spectral) features. Moreover, the relationship of the features extracted among electrodes allows to infer a connectivity-like model showing brain areas that process auditory stimuli in a synchronized way. Then an anomaly detection system based on the reconstruction residuals of an autoencoder using these features has been proposed. Hence, classification is performed by the proposed system based on the differences in the resulting connectivity models that have demonstrated to be a useful tool for differential diagnosis of DD as well as a method to step towards gaining a better knowledge of the brain processes involved in DD. The results corroborate that nonspeech stimulus modulated at specific frequencies related to the sampling processes developed in the brain to capture rhymes, syllables and phonemes produces effects in specific frequency bands that differentiate between controls and DD subjects. The proposed method showed relatively high sensitivity above 0.6, and up to 0.9 in some of the experiments.},

  abstract     = {Noninvasive behavior observation techniques allow more natural human behavior assessment experiments with higher ecological validity. We propose the use of gaze ethograms in the context of user interaction with a computer display to characterize the user’s behavioral activity. A gaze ethogram is a time sequence of the screen regions the user is looking at. It can be used for the behavioral modeling of the user. Given a rough partition of the display space, we are able to extract gaze ethograms that allow discrimination of three common user behavioral activities: reading a text, viewing a video clip, and writing a text. A gaze tracking system is used to build the gaze ethogram. User behavioral activity is modeled by a classifier of gaze ethograms able to recognize the user activity after training. Conventional commercial gaze tracking for research in the neurosciences and psychology science are expensive and intrusive, sometimes impose wearing uncomfortable appliances. For the purposes of our behavioral research, we have developed an open source gaze tracking system that runs on conventional laptop computers using their low quality cameras. Some of the gaze tracking pipeline elements have been borrowed from the open source community. However, we have developed innovative solutions to some of the key issues that arise in the gaze tracker. Specifically, we have proposed texture-based eye features that are quite robust to low quality images. These features are the input for a classifier predicting the screen target area, the user is looking at. We report comparative results of several classifier architectures carried out in order to select the classifier to be used to extract the gaze ethograms for our behavioral research. We perform another classifier selection at the level of ethogram classification. Finally, we report encouraging results of user behavioral activity recognition experiments carried out over an inhouse dataset.},

  abstract     = {A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie the capacity to control our behavior according to internal goals. Flanker tasks, which require responding to stimuli surrounded by distracters that trigger incompatible action tendencies, are frequently used to measure this conflict. Even though the interference generated in these situations has been broadly studied, multivariate analysis techniques can shed new light into the underlying neural mechanisms. The current study is an initial approximation to adapt an interference Flanker paradigm embedded in a Demand-Selection Task (DST) to a format that allows measuring concurrent high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode conflict-related electrophysiological markers associated with congruent or incongruent target events in a time-frequency resolved way. Our results replicate findings obtained with other analysis approaches and offer new information regarding the dynamics of the underlying mechanisms, which show signs of reinstantiation. Our findings, some of which could not have been obtained with classic analytical strategies, open novel avenues of research.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they are typically limited by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own complexity (the “black box problem”). In this paper, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI) connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) versus typically developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterize with inferential statistics. To contextualize these findings, we additionally perform classifications of gender and task versus rest. Employing class-balancing to build a training set, we trained 3 × 3 0 0 modified CNNs in an ensemble model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774, 0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD versus TD, gender, and task versus rest, respectively. Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification. Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-center dataset, finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed), and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate nucleus and paracentral sulcus.},

  abstract     = {In the context of neuro-pathological disorders, neuroimaging has been widely accepted as a clinical tool for diagnosing patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The advanced deep learning method, a novel brain imaging technique, was applied in this study to evaluate its contribution to improving the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The dataset from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support vector machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes of accuracy with ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-SVM were 8 2 . 5 7 ± 7 . 3 5 %, 8 9 . 7 6 ± 8 . 6 7 % and 9 5 . 7 4 ± 2 . 3 1 % respectively. The 3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy of 93.71%, 96.82% and 96.73% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses, respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM showed the best performance for binary classification. Our study indicated that ‘NC versus MCI’ showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90%, 98.90% and 98.80%; ‘NC versus AD’ showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.10%, 99.80% and 98.40%; and ‘MCI versus AD’ showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 89.40%, 86.70% and 84.00%, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance with MRI compared to currently utilized deep learning methods. In addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be efficient without having to manually perform any prior feature extraction and is totally independent of the variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This suggests that it can potentially be exploited by untrained operators and extended to virtual patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, noninvasiveness and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV may serve as an effective screening option for AD in the general population. This study holds value in distinguishing AD and MCI subjects from normal controls and to improve value-based care of patients in clinical practice.},

  abstract     = {The cortical and subcortical circuit regulating both cognition and cardiac autonomic interactions are already well established. This circuit has mainly been analyzed from cortex to heart. Thus, the heart rate variability (HRV) is usually considered a reflection of cortical activity. In this paper, we investigate whether HRV changes affect cortical activity. Short-term local autonomic changes were induced by three breathing strategies: spontaneous (Control), normal (NB) and slow paced breathing (SB). We measured the performance in two cognition domains: executive functions and processing speed. Breathing maneuvres produced three clearly differentiated autonomic states, which preconditioned the cognitive tasks. We found that the SB significantly increased the HRV low frequency (LF) power and lowered the power spectral density (PSD) peak to 0.1 Hz. Meanwhile, executive function was assessed by the working memory test, whose accuracy significantly improved after SB, with no significant changes in the response times. Processing speed was assessed by a multitasking test. Consistently, the proportion of correct answers (success rate) was the only dependent variable affected by short-term and long-term breath pacing. These findings suggest that accuracy, and not timing of these two cognitive domains would benefit from short-term SB in this study population.},

We derive a new learning rule for this sort of network, named S4NN, akin to traditional error backpropagation, yet based on latencies. We show how approximated error gradients can be computed backward in a feedforward network with any number of layers. This approach reaches state-of-the-art performance with supervised multi-fully connected layer SNNs: test accuracy of 97.4% for the MNIST dataset, and 99.2% for the Caltech Face/Motorbike dataset.

This study aimed to determine whether visuospatial imagery, a previously unexplored task, could be used to signify intent in an online electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI. Eighteen typically developed participants imagined checkerboard arrow stimuli in four quadrants of the visual field in 5-s trials, while signals were collected using 16 dry electrodes over the visual cortex. In online blocks, participants received graded visual feedback based on their performance. An initial BCI pipeline (visuospatial imagery classifier I) attained a mean accuracy of 7 1 . 6 7 ± 1 2 . 3 2 % classifying rest against visuospatial imagery in online trials. This BCI pipeline was further improved using restriction to alpha band features (visuospatial imagery classifier II), resulting in a mean pseudo-online accuracy of 7 5 . 0 5 ± 1 1 . 9 0 %. Accuracies exceeded the threshold for practical BCIs in 12 participants. This study supports the use of visuospatial imagery as a real-time, binary EEG-BCI control paradigm.},

  abstract     = {The training procedure of the minimal learning machine (MLM) requires the selection of two sets of patterns from the training dataset. These sets are called input reference points (IRP) and output reference points (ORP), which are used to build a mapping between the input geometric configurations and their corresponding outputs. In the original MLM, the number of input reference points is the hyper-parameter and the patterns are chosen at random. Therefore, the conventional proposal does not consider which patterns will belong to each reference point group, since the model does not implement an appropriate way of selecting the most suitable patterns as reference points. Such an approach can impact on the decision function in terms of smoothness, resulting in high complexity models. This paper introduces a new approach to select IRP for MLM applied to classification tasks. The optimally selected minimal learning machine (OS-MLM) relies on the multiresponse sparse regression (MRSR) ranking method and the leave-one-out (LOO) criterion to sort the patterns in terms of relevance and select an appropriate number of input reference points, respectively. The experimental assessment conducted on UCI datasets reports the proposal was able to produce sparser models and achieve competitive performance when compared to the regular strategy of selecting MLM input RPs.},

  abstract     = {Wistar Audiogenic Rats (WARs) are genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures that start in the brainstem and, in response to repetitive stimulation, spread to limbic areas, such as hippocampus. Analysis of the distribution of interevent intervals of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells showed a monoexponential trend in Wistar rats, suggestive of a homogeneous population of synapses, but a biexponential trend in WARs. Based on this, we hypothesize that there are two populations of GABAergic synaptic release sites in CA1 pyramidal neurons from WARs. To address this hypothesis, we used a well-established neuronal computational model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron previously developed to replicate physiological properties of these cells. Our simulations replicated the biexponential trend only when we decreased the release frequency of synaptic currents by a factor of six in at least 40% of distal synapses. Our results suggest that almost half of the GABAergic synapses of WARs have a drastically reduced spontaneous release frequency. The computational model was able to reproduce the temporal dynamics of GABAergic inhibition that could underlie susceptibility to the spread of seizures.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the neurophysiology of emotions, the neuronal structures involved in processing emotional information and the circuits by which they act, is key to designing applications in the field of affective neuroscience, to advance both new treatments and applications of brain–computer interactions. However, efforts have focused on developing computational models capable of emotion classification instead of on studying the neural substrates involved in the emotional process. In this context, we have carried out a study of cortical asymmetries and functional cortical connectivity based on the electroencephalographic signal of 24 subjects stimulated with videos of positive and negative emotional content to bring some light to the neurobiology behind emotional processes. Our results show opposite interhemispheric asymmetry patterns throughout the cortex for both emotional categories and specific connectivity patterns regarding each of the studied emotional categories. However, in general, the same key areas, such as the right hemisphere and more anterior cortical regions, presented higher levels of activity during the processing of both valence emotional categories. These results suggest a common neural pathway for processing positive and negative emotions, but with different activation patterns. These preliminary results are encouraging for elucidating the neuronal circuits of the emotional valence dimension.},

  abstract     = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is an effective spatial filtering algorithm widely used in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In existing CCA methods, training data are used for constructing templates of stimulus targets and the spatial filters are created between the template signals and a single-trial testing signal. The fact that spatial filters rely on testing data, however, results in low classification performance of CCA compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms such as task-related component analysis (TRCA). In this study, we proposed a novel CCA method in which spatial filters are estimated using training data only. This is achieved by using observed EEG training data and their SSVEP components as the two inputs of CCA and the objective function is optimized by averaging multiple training trials. In this case, we proved in theory that the two spatial filters estimated by the CCA are equivalent, and that the CCA and TRCA are also equivalent under certain hypotheses. A benchmark SSVEP data set from 35 subjects was used to compare the performance of the two algorithms according to different lengths of data, numbers of channels and numbers of training trials. In addition, the CCA was also compared with power spectral density analysis (PSDA). The experimental results suggest that the CCA is equivalent to TRCA if the signal-to-noise ratio of training data is high enough; otherwise, the CCA outperforms TRCA in terms of classification accuracy. The CCA is much faster than PSDA in detecting time of targets. The robustness of the training data-driven CCA to noise gives it greater potential in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Status epilepticus (SE) is a common, life-threatening neurological disorder that may lead to permanent brain damage. In rodent models, SE is an acute phase of seizures that could be reproduced by injecting with pilocarpine and then induce chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) seizures. However, how SE disrupts brain activity, especially communications among brain regions, is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the characteristic abnormalities of network connections among the frontal cortex, hippocampus and thalamus during the SE episodes in a pilocarpine model with functional and effective connectivity measurements. We showed that the coherence connectivity among these regions increased significantly during the SE episodes in almost all frequency bands (except the alpha band) and that the frequency band with enhanced connections was specific to different stages of SE episodes. Moreover, with the effective analysis, we revealed a closed neural circuit of bidirectional effective interactions between the frontal regions and the hippocampus and thalamus in both ictal and post-ictal stages, implying aberrant enhancement of communication across these brain regions during the SE episodes. Furthermore, an effective connection from the hippocampus to the thalamus was detected in the delta band during the pre-ictal stage, which shifted in an inverse direction during the ictal stage in the theta band and in the theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma bands during the post-ictal stage. This specificity of the effective connection between the hippocampus and thalamus illustrated that the hippocampal structure is critical for the initiation of SE discharges, while the thalamus is important for the propagation of SE discharges. Overall, our results demonstrated enhanced interaction among the frontal cortex, hippocampus and thalamus during the SE episodes and suggested the modes of information flow across these structures for the initiation and propagation of SE discharges. These findings may reveal an underlying mechanism of aberrant network communication during pilocarpine-induced SE discharges and deepen our knowledge of TLE seizures.},

  abstract     = {Numerous nonepileptic paroxysmal events, such as syncope and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, may imitate seizures and impede diagnosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to mistreatment, affecting patients’ lives considerably. Electroencephalography is commonly used for diagnosing epilepsy. Although on electroencephalograms (EEGs), epileptiform discharges (ED) specifically indicate epilepsy, only approximately 50% of patients with epilepsy have ED in their first EEG. In this study, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based classifier to distinguish EEG between patients with epilepsy without ED and controls. Overall, 25 patients with epilepsy without ED in their EEGs and 25 age-matched patients with Tourette syndrome or syncope were enrolled. Their EEGs were classified using the deep ConvNet. When the EEG data without overlapping were used, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 65.00%, 48.00%, and 82.00%, respectively. The performance measures improved when the input EEG data were augmented through overlapping. With 95% EEG data overlapping, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity increased to 80.00%, 70.00%, and 90.00%, respectively. The proposed method could be regarded as a pilot study to demonstrate a proof of concept of a potential diagnostic value of deep ConvNet in patients with epilepsy without ED. Further studies are needed to assist neurologists in distinguishing nonepileptic paroxysmal events from epilepsy.},

  abstract     = {The automatic seizure detection system can effectively help doctors to monitor and diagnose epilepsy thus reducing their workload. Many outstanding studies have given good results in the two-class seizure detection problems, but most of them are based on hand-wrought feature extraction. This study proposes an end-to-end automatic seizure detection system based on deep learning, which does not require heavy preprocessing on the EEG data or feature engineering. The fully convolutional network with three convolution blocks is first used to learn the expressive seizure characteristics from EEG data. Then these robust EEG features pertinent to seizures are presented as an input to the Nested Long Short-Term Memory (NLSTM) model to explore the inherent temporal dependencies in EEG signals. Lastly, the high-level features obtained from the NLSTM model are fed into the softmax layer to output predicted labels. The proposed method yields an accuracy range of 98.44–100% in 10 different experiments based on the Bonn University database. A larger EEG database is then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real-life situations. The average sensitivity of 97.47%, specificity of 96.17%, and false detection rate of 0.487 per hour are yielded. For CHB–MIT Scalp EEG database, the proposed model also achieves a segment-level sensitivity of 94.07% with a false detection rate of 0.66 per hour. The excellent results obtained on three different EEG databases demonstrate that the proposed method has good robustness and generalization power under ideal and real-life conditions.},

  abstract     = {Moving object detection in video streams plays a key role in many computer vision applications. In particular, separation between background and foreground items represents a main prerequisite to carry out more complex tasks, such as object classification, vehicle tracking, and person re-identification. Despite the progress made in recent years, a main challenge of moving object detection still regards the management of dynamic aspects, including bootstrapping and illumination changes. In addition, the recent widespread of Pan–Tilt–Zoom (PTZ) cameras has made the management of these aspects even more complex in terms of performance due to their mixed movements (i.e. pan, tilt, and zoom). In this paper, a combined keypoint clustering and neural background subtraction method, based on Self-Organized Neural Network (SONN), for real-time moving object detection in video sequences acquired by PTZ cameras is proposed. Initially, the method performs a spatio-temporal tracking of the sets of moving keypoints to recognize the foreground areas and to establish the background. Then, it adopts a neural background subtraction, localized in these areas, to accomplish a foreground detection able to manage bootstrapping and gradual illumination changes. Experimental results on three well-known public datasets, and comparisons with different key works of the current literature, show the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of modeling and background subtraction.},

The results showed the importance of beta and gamma rhythms. The indices density , degree and clustering coefficient increased in MDD responders in beta and gamma bands after rTMS. Interestingly, the density and the degree changed in theta band in both groups of nonresponders (decreased in MDD nonresponders but increased in BD nonresponders). Moreover, both indices of integration (the characteristic path length and the global efficiency ) as well as the clustering coefficient increased in BD nonresponders for gamma band. In BD responders, the activity increased in the frontal lobe, mainly in the left hemisphere, while in MDD responders in the central posterior part of brain. The fronto-posterior asymmetry decreased in both groups of responders in delta and beta bands. Changes in inter-hemispheric asymmetry were found only in BD nonresponders in all bands, except gamma band. Comparison between groups showed that the degree increased in delta band independently on disease (BD, MDD). These preliminary results showed that the DTF may be a useful marker allowing for evaluation of effectiveness of the rTMS therapy as well for group differentiation between MDD and BD considering separately groups of responders and nonresponders. However, further investigation should be performed over larger groups of patients to confirmed our findings.},

The field of human–robot interactions (HRIs) could benefit from a broadened understanding of the brain and physiological emotion encoding, together with the use of lightweight software and cheap wearable devices, and thus improve the capabilities of robots to fully engage with the users emotional reactions. In this paper, a previously developed methodology for real-time emotion estimation aimed for its use in the field of HRI is tested under realistic circumstances using a self-generated database created using dynamically evoked emotions. Other state-of-the-art, real-time approaches address emotion estimation using constant stimuli to facilitate the analysis of the evoked responses, remaining far from real scenarios since emotions are dynamically evoked. The proposed approach studies the feasibility of the emotion estimation methodology previously developed, under an experimentation paradigm that imitates a more realistic scenario involving dynamically evoked emotions by using a dramatic film as the experimental paradigm. The emotion estimation methodology has proved to perform on real-time constraints while maintaining high accuracy on emotion estimation when using the self-produced dynamically evoked emotions multi-signal database.},

First, an N -layer trapezoid feature set whose size ratio of the top, bottom and height is 1:2:1 is constructed for each frequency band of each EEG sample. This construction is based on N optimized power-spectral-density features extracted from N real electrodes and N nonreal electrode’s features. Subsequently, the N real electrodes’ sequence (ES) codes of each layer of the constructed trapezoid feature set are obtained by arranging the feature values in ascending order. Finally, the nearest neighbor classification is used to find a class whose ES codes are the most similar to those of the testing sample. Thirteen-class olfactory EEG signals collected from 11 subjects are used to compare the classification performance of the proposed method with six traditional classification methods. The comparison shows that the proposed method gives average accuracy of 94.3%, Cohen’s kappa value of 0.94, precision of 95.0%, and F1-measure of 94.6%, which are higher than those of the existing methods.},

This method adopts cross-validation to extend the amount of the new subject’s training data and sets an adaptive threshold to select the optimal combination of the classifiers. Twenty-five subjects participated in the N200- and P300-based brain–computer interface. The study compares CV-T-TAB to five traditional training methods by testing them on the training of a support vector machine. The accuracy, information transfer rate, area under the curve, recall and precision are used to evaluate the performances under nine conditions with different amounts of data. CV-T-TAB outperforms the other methods and retains a high accuracy even when the amount of data is reduced to one-third of the original amount.

  abstract     = {Recent continuous task studies, such as narrative speech comprehension, show that fluctuations in brain functional connectivity (FC) are altered and enhanced compared to the resting state. Here, we characterized the fluctuations in FC during comprehension of speech and time-reversed speech conditions. The correlations of Hilbert envelope of source-level EEG data were used to quantify FC between spatially separate brain regions. A symmetric multivariate leakage correction was applied to address the signal leakage issue before calculating FC. The dynamic FC was estimated based on a sliding time window. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on individually concatenated and temporally concatenated FC matrices to identify FC patterns. We observed that the mode of FC induced by speech comprehension can be characterized with a single principal component. The condition-specific FC demonstrated decreased correlations between frontal and parietal brain regions and increased correlations between frontal and temporal brain regions. The fluctuations of the condition-specific FC characterized by a shorter time demonstrated that dynamic FC also exhibited condition specificity over time. The FC is dynamically reorganized and FC dynamic pattern varies along a single mode of variation during speech comprehension. The proposed analysis framework seems valuable for studying the reorganization of brain networks during continuous task experiments.},

  abstract     = {Despite many advances in the development of retinal prostheses, clinical reports show that current retinal prosthesis subjects can only perceive prosthetic vision with poor visual acuity. A possible approach for improving visual acuity is to produce virtual electrodes (VEs) through electric field modulation. Generating controllable and localized VEs is a crucial factor in effectively improving the perceptive resolution of the retinal prostheses. In this paper, we aimed to design a microelectrode array (MEA) that can produce converged and controllable VEs by current steering stimulation strategies. Through computational modeling, we designed a three-dimensional concentric ring–disc MEA and evaluated its performance with different stimulation strategies. Our simulation results showed that electrode–retina distance (ERD) and inter-electrode distance (IED) can dramatically affect the distribution of electric field. Also the converged VEs could be produced when the parameters of the three-dimensional MEA were appropriately set. VE sites can be controlled by manipulating the proportion of current on each adjacent electrode in a current steering group (CSG). In addition, spatial localization of electrical stimulation can be greatly improved under quasi-monopolar (QMP) stimulation. This study may provide support for future application of VEs in epiretinal prosthesis for potentially increasing the visual acuity of prosthetic vision.},

We examined the persistence of MW in different signals and stability of their oscillations on the level of individual MW waveforms, which was achieved by applying matching pursuit (MP). MP yields adaptive time-frequency approximation of signal’s structures in terms of frequency, amplitude, time occurrence, and time-span. The number of waveforms contributing to 95% of the energy of the signals was vastly different for the time series, but the average number of waveforms conforming to the MW criteria was almost the same ( 3 . 5 ± 0 . 4 per 120 s epoch). In all the investigated signals, MW had the same distributions of frequency and the number of cycles. We show that the MW energy ratios in different signals varied strongly, p &lt; 0 . 0 0 1 . The highest percentage of MW energy was observed in blood pressure signals, heart rate variability, and reduced hemoglobin, in contrast to brain signals and oxygenated hemoglobin. The percentage of MW energy was related to the strength of causal influence exerted by them on the other signals. Our results indicate existence of a common mechanism of MW generation and support the hypothesis of MW generation in the baroreflex loop; however, they do not exclude the action of a central pacemaker.},

Intracranial EEG data from subdural grid positions were analyzed in 16 pre-surgery epileptic patients. LFES was performed by injecting current pulses (10 mA, 0.2 ms pulse width, 0.5 Hz, 25 trials) into all adjacent electrode contacts. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis was carried out on two frequency bands (low: 1–4 Hz; high: 10–40 Hz) to investigate the early, high frequency and late, low frequency responses elicited by the stimulation. The centralization increased in early compared to late responses, suggesting a more prominent role of direct neural links between primarily activated areas and distant brain regions. Injecting the current into the seizure onset zone (SOZ) evoked a more integrated functional topology during the early (N1) period of the response, whereas during the late (N2) period — regardless of the stimulation site — the connectedness of the SOZ was elevated compared to the non-SOZ tissue. The abnormal behavior of the epileptic sub-network during both part of the responses supports the idea of the pathogenic role of impaired inhibition and excitation mechanisms in epilepsy.},

The neuronal dynamic was characterized using mathematical tools defined in different frameworks (rate, oscillations or complex patterns). Then, and for each cortical area, multivariate and discriminate analyses were further performed on these features to identify those important to differentiate between the normal and the pathological neuronal activity. Our results show a different order in the importance of the features to discriminate the pathological state in each cortical area which suggests that the M1 and the SMA exhibit dissimilarities in their neuronal alterations induced by parkinsonism. Our findings highlight the need for multiple mathematical frameworks to best characterize the pathological neuronal activity related to parkinsonism.

  abstract     = {Dynamically assessing the level of consciousness is still challenging during anesthesia. With the help of Electroencephalography (EEG), the human brain electric activity can be noninvasively measured at high temporal resolution. Several typical quasi-stable states are introduced to represent the oscillation of the global scalp electric field. These so-called microstates reflect spatiotemporal dynamics of coherent neural activities and capture the switch of brain states within the millisecond range. In this study, the microstates of high-density EEG were extracted and investigated during propofol-induced transition of consciousness. To analyze microstates on the frequency domain, a novel microstate-wise spectral analysis was proposed by the means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert–Huang transform. During the transition of consciousness, a map with a posterior central maximum denoted as microstate F appeared and became salient. The current results indicated that the coverage, occurrence, and power of microstate F significantly increased in moderate sedation. The results also demonstrated that the transition of brain state from rest to sedation was accompanied by significant increase in mean energy of all frequency bands in microstate F. Combined with studies on the possible cortical sources of microstates, the findings reveal that non-canonical microstate F is highly associated with propofol-induced altered states of consciousness. The results may also support the inference that this distinct topography can be derived from canonical microstate C (anterior-posterior orientation). Finally, this study further develops pertinent methodology and extends possible applications of the EEG microstate during propofol-induced anesthesia.},

A total of 59 MCI subjects were recruited and divided -after appropriate follow-up- into cMCI or sMCI. They were further divided in MCI with linguistic domain (LD) impairment and in MCI with executive domain (ED) impairment. Small World (SW) index was measured as index of balance between integration and segregation brain processes. SW, computed restricting to nodes of DMN regions for all frequency bands, evaluated how they differ between MCI subgroups assessed through clinical and neuropsychological four-years follow-up. In addition, SW evaluated how this pattern differs between MCI with LD and MCI with ED. Results showed that SW index significantly decreased in gamma band in cMCI compared to sMCI. In cMCI with LD impairment, the SW index significantly decreased in delta band, while in cMCI with ED impairment the SW index decreased in delta and gamma bands and increased in alpha1 band. We propose that the DMN functional alterations in cognitive impairment could reflect an abnormal flow of brain information processing during resting state possibly associated to a status of pre-dementia.},

The complexity of such a task a rises from the unexpected relationship between the magnitude of the motion and the feedback. The characterization of complex patterns arising from EEG is an important problem in identifying different mental intentions. We proposed a scaling analysis of phase fluctuation in the scalp EEG to discriminate the network states related to different EEG patterns, which correspond to manipulating the task with right or left movement intention. These intentions are generated while the participant is engaged in such a complex task. The phase characterization method was used to calculate the instantaneous phase from the operational EEG. Then, functional brain networks (FBNs) of 20 subjects based on the task-related EEG were constructed by phase synchronization. The degree features representing the structures and scaling components of brain networks are sensitive to the EEG patterns with left or right motor intention. The correlation between features and mental intentions was investigated by discriminant analysis. For 20 subjects, the average accuracy of state detection is 0 . 8 5 4 1 ± 0 . 0 3 9 8 , and the average mean-squared error (MSE) is 0 . 6 0 3 6 ± 0 . 1 2 2 6 . The brain state depicted by the results is related to high awareness, the phase characterization is of the effectiveness in EEG processing and FBN construction and the difference of control intentions can be explored by the phase characterization method.

A controllability analysis of neural dynamics is necessary to ensure neuromodulation’s feasibility. Here, we present such a theoretical method by using the concept of controllability from the control theory that neuromodulation’s feasibility can be studied smoothly. Firstly, networks of multiple coupled neural populations with different topologies are established to mathematically model complicated neural dynamics. Secondly, an analytical method composed of a linearization method, the Kalman controllable rank condition and a controllability index is applied to analyze the controllability of the established network models. Finally, the relationship between network dynamics or topological characteristic parameters and controllability is studied by using the analytical method. The proposed method provides a new idea for the study of neuromodulation’s feasibility, and the results are expected to guide us to better modulate neurodynamics by optimizing network dynamics and network topology.},

To fill this gap, a novel bio-inspired modular control architecture that merges a recurrent cerebellar-like loop for adaptive control and a Smith predictor controller is proposed. The goal is to provide accurate anticipatory corrections to the generation of the motor commands in spite of sensory delays and to validate the robustness of the proposed control method to input and physical dynamic changes. The outcome of the proposed architecture with other two control schemes that do not include the Smith control strategy or the cerebellar-like corrections are compared.

First, we present a variation of Gait Energy Images, i.e. frame-by-frame GEI (ff-GEI), to expand the volume of available Gait Energy Images (GEI) data and relax the constraints of gait cycle segmentation required by existing gait recognition methods. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ff-GEI by analyzing the cross-covariance of one person’s gait data. Then, making use of the temporality of our human gait, we design a novel gait recognition model using Conv-LSTM. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated extensively based on the CASIA Dataset B for cross-view gait recognition, furthermore the OU-ISIR Large Population Dataset is employed to verify its generalization ability. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms based on these two datasets. The results indicate that the proposed ff-GEI model using Conv-LSTM, coupled with the new gait representation, can effectively solve the problems related to cross-view gait recognition.},

  abstract     = {Epileptic seizures arise from synchronous firing of multiple spatially separated neural masses; therefore, many synchrony measures are used for seizure detection and characterization. However, synchrony measures reflect only the overall interaction strength among populations of neurons but cannot reveal the coupling strengths among individual populations, which is more important for seizure control. The concepts of reachability and reachable cluster were proposed to denote the coupling strengths of a set of neural masses. Here, we describe a seizure control method based on coupling strengths using combination convolutional neural network (CCNN) modeling. The neurophysiologically based neural mass model (NMM), which can bridge signal processing and neurophysiology, was used to simulate the proposed controller. Although the adjacency matrix and reachability matrix could not be identified perfectly, the vast majority of adjacency values were identified, reaching 95.64% using the CCNN with an optimal threshold. For cases of discrete and continuous coupling strengths, the proposed controller maintained the average reachable cluster strengths at about 0.1, indicating effective seizure control.},

  abstract     = {Working memory (WM) is a crucial cognitive process and its disruption is among the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. While alterations of the neuronal processes underlying WM have been evidenced in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), scarce literature is available in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). We used magnetoencephalography during a WM task performed by MCI ( n = 4 5 ) , SCD ( n = 4 9 ) and healthy elders ( n = 4 9 ) to examine group differences during the maintenance period (0–4000 ms). Data were analyzed using time–frequency analysis and significant oscillatory differences were localized at the source level. Our results indicated significant differences between groups, mainly during the early maintenance (250–1250 ms) in the theta, alpha and beta bands and in the late maintenance (2750–3750 ms) in the theta band. MCI showed lower local synchronization in fronto-temporal cortical regions in the early theta–alpha window relative to controls ( p = 2 × 1 0 − 0 3 ) and SCD ( p = 4 × 1 0 − 0 3 ) , and in the late theta window relative to controls ( p = 1 × 1 0 0 3 ) and SCD ( p = 0 . 0 1 ) . Early theta–alpha power was significantly correlated with memory scores ( rho = 0 . 2 4 , p = 0 . 0 2 ) and late theta power was correlated with task performance ( rho = 0 . 2 4 , p = 0 . 0 3 ) and functional activity scores ( rho = − 0 . 2 3 , p = 0 . 0 2 ) . In the early beta window, MCI showed reduced power in temporo-posterior regions relative to controls ( p = 3 × 1 0 − 0 3 ) and SCD ( p = 0 . 0 2 ) . Our results may suggest that these alterations would reflect that memory-related networks are damaged.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue is one problem with driving as it can lead to difficulties with sustaining attention, behavioral lapses, and a tendency to ignore vital information or operations. In this research, we explore multimodal physiological phenomena in response to driving fatigue through simultaneous functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings with the aim of investigating the relationships between hemodynamic and electrical features and driving performance. Sixteen subjects participated in an event-related lane-deviation driving task while measuring their brain dynamics through fNIRS and EEGs. Three performance groups, classified as Optimal, Suboptimal, and Poor, were defined for comparison. From our analysis, we find that tonic variations occur before a deviation, and phasic variations occur afterward. The tonic results show an increased concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO 2 ) and power changes in the EEG theta, alpha, and beta bands. Both dynamics are significantly correlated with deteriorated driving performance. The phasic EEG results demonstrate event-related desynchronization associated with the onset of steering vehicle in all power bands. The concentration of phasic HbO 2 decreased as performance worsened. Further, the negative correlations between tonic EEG delta and alpha power and HbO 2 oscillations suggest that activations in HbO 2 are related to mental fatigue. In summary, combined hemodynamic and electrodynamic activities can provide complete knowledge of the brain’s responses as evidence of state changes during fatigue driving.},

  abstract     = {We employed high-density microelectrode arrays to investigate spontaneous firing patterns of neurons in brain circuits of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in mice. We recorded from over 150 neurons for 10 min in each of eight different experiments, identified their location in S1, sorted their action potentials (spikes), and computed their power spectra and inter-spike interval (ISI) statistics. Of all persistently active neurons, 92% fired with a single dominant frequency — regularly firing neurons (RNs) — from 1 to 8 Hz while 8% fired in burst with two dominant frequencies — bursting neurons (BNs) — corresponding to the inter-burst (2–6 Hz) and intra-burst intervals (20–160 Hz). RNs were predominantly located in layers 2/3 and 5/6 while BNs localized to layers 4 and 5. Across neurons, the standard deviation of ISI was a power law of its mean, a property known as fluctuation scaling, with a power law exponent of 1 for RNs and 1.25 for BNs. The power law implies that firing and bursting patterns are scale invariant: the firing pattern of a given RN or BN resembles that of another RN or BN, respectively, after a time contraction or dilation. An explanation for this scale invariance is discussed in the context of previous computational studies as well as its potential role in information processing.},
