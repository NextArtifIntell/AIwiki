  abstract     = {Techniques are developed for creating new and general language families of only semilinear languages, and for showing families only contain semilinear languages. It is shown that for language families ℒ that are semilinear full trios, the smallest full AFL containing ℒ that is also closed under intersection with languages in NCM (where NCM is the family of languages accepted by NFA s augmented with reversal-bounded counters), is also semilinear. If these closure properties are effective, this also immediately implies decidability of membership, emptiness, and infiniteness for these general families. From the general techniques, new grammar systems are given that are extensions of well-known families of semilinear full trios, whereby it is implied that these extensions must only describe semilinear languages. This also implies positive decidability properties for the new systems. Some characterizations of the new families are also given.},

The same size gap is also known from constant-height pushdown automata and 1 -limited automata to deterministic finite automata. Constant-height pushdown automata and 1 -limited automata are compared with non-self-embedding grammars. It is proved that non-self-embedding grammars and constant-height pushdown automata are polynomially related in size. Furthermore, a polynomial size simulation by 1 -limited automata is presented. However, the converse transformation is proved to cost exponential.

The state complexity of a regularity-preserving binary operation on regular languages is defined as the maximal state complexity of the result of the operation where the two operands range over all languages of state complexities ≤ m and ≤ n , respectively. We determine, for m ≥ 2 , n ≥ 3 , the exact value of the state complexity of the binary operation overlap assembly on regular languages. This operation was introduced by Csuhaj-Varjú, Petre, and Vaszil to model the process of self-assembly of two linear DNA strands into a longer DNA strand, provided that their ends “overlap”. We prove that the state complexity of the overlap assembly of languages L m and L n , where m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 1 , is at most 2 ( m − 1 ) 3 n − 1 + 2 n . Moreover, for m ≥ 2 and n ≥ 3 there exist languages L m and L n over an alphabet of size n whose overlap assembly meets the upper bound and this bound cannot be met with smaller alphabets. Finally, we prove that m + n is the state complexity of the overlap assembly in the case of unary languages and that there are binary languages whose overlap assembly has exponential state complexity at least m ( 2 n − 1 − 2 ) + 2 .},

Group automata are automata where all letters act as permutations on the set of states, and they are not synchronizing (unless they have one state). In almost-group automata, one of the letters acts as a permutation on n − 1 states, and the others as permutations. We prove that this small change is enough for automata to become synchronizing with high probability. More precisely, we establish that the probability that a strongly-connected almost-group automaton is not synchronizing is 2 k − 1 − 1 n 2 ( k − 1 ) ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) , for a k -letter alphabet. We also present an efficient algorithm that decides whether a strongly-connected almost-group automaton is synchronizing. For a natural model of computation, we establish a O ( k n ) worst-case lower bound for this problem ( O ( n ) for the average case), which is almost matched by our algorithm.},

This hierarchy extends that given by Sidki for automaton groups, and also gives new insights into the latter. Its exponential part coincides with a notion of entropy for some associated automata. We prove that the Order Problem is decidable whenever the state-activity is bounded. The Order Problem remains open for the next level of this hierarchy, that is, when the state-activity is linear. Gillibert showed that it is undecidable in the whole family. We extend the aforementioned hierarchy via a semi-norm making it more coarse but somehow more robust and we prove that the Order Problem is still decidable for the first two levels of this alternative hierarchy.},

It is of significant interest from both a practical and theoretical point of view to close these gaps. We here extend these reversible models by a preprocessing unit which is basically a reversible injective and length-preserving finite state transducer. It turns out that preprocessing the input using such weak devices increases the computational power of reversible deterministic finite automata to the acceptance of all regular languages, whereas for reversible pushdown automata the accepted family of languages lies strictly in between the reversible deterministic context-free languages and the real-time deterministic context-free languages. For reversible queue automata the preprocessing of the input leads to machines that are stronger than real-time reversible queue automata, but less powerful than real-time deterministic (irreversible) queue automata. Moreover, it is shown that the computational power of all three types of machines is not changed by allowing the preprocessing finite state transducer to work irreversibly. Finally, we examine the closure properties of the family of languages accepted by such machines.},

Current software systems of formal language objects do not have a mechanism to define such objects. We define transducers in which transition labels involve what we call set specifications, some of which are alphabet invariant. In fact, we give a more broad definition of automata-type objects, called labelled graphs, where each transition label can be any string, as long as that string represents a subset of a certain monoid. Then, the behavior of the labelled graph is a subset of that monoid. We do the same for regular expressions. We obtain extensions of a few classic algorithmic constructions on ordinary regular expressions and transducers at the broad level of labelled graphs and in such a way that the computational efficiency of the extended constructions is not sacrificed. For transducers with set specs we obtain further algorithms that can be applied to questions about independent regular languages as well as a decision question about synchronous transducers.},

  abstract     = {The Steiner tree problem is one of the fundamental and classical problems in combinatorial optimization. In this paper we study this problem in the CONGESTED CLIQUE model (CCM) [29] of distributed computing. For the Steiner tree problem in the CCM, we consider that each vertex of the input graph is uniquely mapped to a processor and edges are naturally mapped to the links between the corresponding processors. Regarding output, each processor should know whether the vertex assigned to it is in the solution or not and which of its incident edges are in the solution. We present two deterministic distributed approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problem in the CCM. The first algorithm computes a Steiner tree using Õ ( n 1 / 3 ) rounds and Õ ( n 7 / 3 ) messages for a given connected undirected weighted graph of n nodes. Note here that Õ ( ⋅ ) notation hides polylogarithmic factors in n . The second one computes a Steiner tree using O ( S + log log n ) rounds and O ( S m + n 2 ) messages, where S and m are the shortest path diameter and number of edges respectively in the given input graph. Both the algorithms achieve an approximation ratio of 2 ( 1 − 1 / ℓ ) , where ℓ is the number of leaf nodes in the optimal Steiner tree. For graphs with S = ω ( n 1 / 3 log n ) , the first algorithm exhibits better performance than the second one in terms of the round complexity. On the other hand, for graphs with S = õ ( n 1 / 3 ) , the second algorithm outperforms the first one in terms of the round complexity. In fact when S = O ( log log n ) then the second algorithm achieves a round complexity of O ( log log n ) and message complexity of Õ ( n 2 ) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the Steiner tree problem in the CCM.},

  abstract     = {Watson–Crick jumping finite automata work on tapes which are double stranded sequences of symbols similar to that of Watson–Crick automata. The double stranded sequence is scanned in a discontinuous manner. That is, after reading a double stranded string, the automata can jump over some subsequence and continue scanning depending on the rule. Some variants of such automata are 1-limited, No state, All final and Simple Watson–Crick jumping finite automata. The comparison of the languages accepted by these variants with the language classes in Chomsky hierarchy has been carried out. We investigate some closure properties. We also try to place the duplication closure of a word in Watson–Crick jumping finite automata family. We have discussed the closure property of Watson–Crick jumping finite automata family under duplication operations.},

However, it is difficult to construct such optimal codebooks. There have been a number of attempts to construct codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound. In this paper, we introduce a generic construction of codebooks using generalized bent functions from 𝔽 p n to ℤ p k , where p is a prime and k is a positive integer with 1 &lt; k ≤ n / 2 . With this construction, we obtain two new families of codebooks nearly meeting the Welch bound. These codebooks have new parameters and could have a small alphabet size. In particular, a class of regular generalized bent functions from 𝔽 p n to ℤ p k is presented.},

  abstract     = {Transducers constitute a fundamental extension of automata. The class of regular word functions has recently emerged as an important class of word-to-word functions, characterized by means of (functional, or unambiguous, or deterministic) two-way transducers, copyless streaming string transducers, and MSO-definable graph transformations. A fundamental result in language theory is Kleene’s Theorem, relating finite state automata and regular expressions. Recently, a set of regular function expressions has been introduced and used to prove a similar result for regular word functions, by showing its equivalence with copyless streaming string transducers. In this paper, we propose a direct, simplified and effective translation from unambiguous two-way transducers to regular function expressions extending the Brzozowski and McCluskey algorithm. In addition, our approach allows us to derive a subset of regular function expressions characterizing the (strict) subclass of functional sweeping transducers.},

In previous work, it was shown that is problem is P S P A C E -complete. We introduce compressibility measures as a useful tool to classify the complexity of the intersection problem for certain classes of finite semigroups. Using this framework, we obtain a new and simple proof that for groups and for commutative semigroups, the problem (as well as the variant where the languages are represented by finite automata) is contained in N P . We uncover certain structural and non-structural properties determining the complexity of the intersection problem for varieties of semigroups containing only trivial submonoids. More specifically, we prove N P -hardness for classes of semigroups having a property called unbounded order and for the class of all nilpotent semigroups of bounded order . On the contrary, we show that bounded order and commutativity imply decidability in poly-logarithmic time on alternating random-access Turing machines with a single alternation. We also establish connections to the monoid variant of the problem.},

Here we focus on decision problems for ROWJFAs. It turns out that most problems such as, e.g., emptiness, finiteness, universality, the word problem and variants thereof, closure under permutation, etc., are decidable. Moreover, we show that the containment of a language within the strict hierarchy of ROWJFA permutation closed languages induced by the number of accepting states as well as whether permutation closed regular or jumping finite automata languages can be accepted by ROWJFAs is decidable, too. On the other hand, we prove that for (linear) context-free languages the corresponding ROWJFA acceptance problem becomes undecidable.

In this paper, we show that the class of languages recognizable by such tree automata with a Büchi acceptance condition is closed under projection. This construction yields a new algorithm for the emptiness problem, implies that a regular tree is accepted if the language is non-empty (for the Büchi condition), and can be used to obtain a decision procedure for an extension of monadic second-order logic with predicates for subtree comparisons.},

We give tight complexity results for the three logics with respect to the model-checking problem, depending on whether the formula is fixed or not. We study the expressiveness of our logics by expressing classical structural patterns characterising for instance finite ambiguity and polynomial ambiguity in the case of finite automata, determinisability and finite-valuedness in the case of transducers and sum-automata. As a consequence of our complexity results, we directly obtain that these classical properties can be decided in polynomial time.},

  abstract     = {Forest algebras are defined for investigating languages of forests [ordered sequences] of unranked trees, where a node may have more than two [ordered] successors. They consist of two monoids, the horizontal and the vertical, with an action of the vertical monoid on the horizontal monoid, and a complementary axiom of faithfulness. A pseudovariety is a class of finite algebras of a given signature, closed under the taking of homomorphic images, subalgebras and finitary direct products. By looking at the syntactic congruence for monoids and as the natural extension in the case of forest algebras, we could define a version of syntactic congruence of a subset of the free forest algebra, not just a forest language. Let A be a finite alphabet and V be a pseudovariety of finite forest algebras. A language L is V -recognizable if its syntactic forest algebra belongs to V . Separation is a classical problem in mathematics and computer science. It asks whether, given two sets belonging to some class, it is possible to separate them by another set of a smaller class. Suppose that a forest language L and a forest w are given. We want to find if there exists any proof for that w does not belong to L just by using V -recognizable languages, i.e. given such L and w , if there exists a V -recognizable language K which contains L and does not contain w . In this paper, we present how one can use profinite forest algebra to separate a forest language and a forest term and also to separate two forest languages.},

From the new quotient proposed, we define a class of p r + 1 -periodic binary threshold sequences. Then combining the Legendre symbol and Euler quotient modulo p r together, with the condition of 2 p − 1 ≢ 1 ( mod p 2 ) , we present exact values of the linear complexity for p ≡ ± 3 ( mod 8 ) , and all the possible values of the linear complexity for p ≡ ± 1 ( mod 8 ) . The linear complexity is very close to the period and is of desired value for cryptographic purpose. Our results extend the linear complexity results of the corresponding p 2 -periodic binary sequences in earlier work.},

These automata are nondeterministic. They guess an order in which rows of the input array are read and they jump to the next row only after reading all symbols in the previous row. In each row, they choose, also nondeterministically, an order in which segments of the row are read. In this paper, we study the membership problem for these automata. We show that each general row jumping finite automaton can be simulated by a nondeterministic Turing machine with space bounded by the logarithm. This means that the fixed membership problems for such automata are in NL, and so in P. On the other hand, we show that the uniform membership problem is NP-complete.},

For context-free languages the problem is solved efficiently by various well-known parsing algorithms. However, there are several important languages that are not context-free. The membership problem of the context-sensitive language class is PSPACE-complete, thus, it is believed that it is generally not solvable in an efficient way. There are various language classes between the above mentioned two classes having membership problems with various complexity. One of these classes, the class of permutation languages, is generated by permutation grammars, i.e., context-free grammars extended with permutation rules, where a permutation rule allows to interchange the position of two consecutive nonterminals in the sentential form. In this paper, the membership problem for permutation languages is studied. A proof is presented to show that this problem is NP-complete.},

An O ( 𝒯 ( n + m ) ) time centralized algorithm is proposed to construct a bounded arrival time convergecast tree , where n is the number of nodes, m is the number of edges, and 𝒯 is the lifetime of the given temporal graph. The algorithm presented is an offline algorithm and assumes that all information about change in the graph topology is known apriori. It is then shown that the problem of constructing a minimum total arrival time convergecast tree is NP-complete, and an O ( 𝒯 ( n + m ) ) time centralized, offline heuristic algorithm is proposed to address it.

Whereas the original algorithm uses groups of odd size at least 5 and runs in linear time, it has been perpetuated in the literature that using smaller group sizes will force the worst-case running time to become superlinear, namely Ω ( n log n ) . We first point out that the usual arguments found in the literature justifying the superlinear worst-case running time fall short of proving this claim. We further prove that it is possible to use group size smaller than 5 while maintaining the worst case linear running time. To this end we introduce three simple variants of the classic algorithm, the repeated step algorithm, the shifting target algorithm, and the hyperpair algorithm, all running in linear time.},

  abstract     = {In multi-tree-structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) video streaming, video streams are delivered from the source peer to subscribing peers in such a way that each stream is divided into several sub-streams and those sub-streams are delivered through different spanning trees. In this paper, we focus on the delivery of all sub-streams to n subscribers through spanning trees of depth two each, which will be referred to as the 2-hop delivery of sub-streams. The main contribution of the current paper is the derivation of a tight lower bound on the upload capacity of homogeneous peers so that 2-hop delivery is possible if and only if the upload capacity of each peer is greater than or equal to the derived bound.},

This naturally generalizes the classical connectivity of graphs defined in term of the minimum vertex-cut. This kind of connectivity can help us to measure the robustness of the graph corresponding to a network. The hierarchical star networks H S n , proposed by Shi and Srimani, is a new level interconnection network topology, and uses the star graphs as building blocks. In this paper, by exploring the combinatorial properties and fault-tolerance of H S n , we study the ℓ -component connectivity of hierarchical star networks H S n .

We prove that both problems are NP-hard for 3-outerplanar labeled graphs even if the maximum vertex degree is bounded by 4. Since the reductions used in the proofs construct graphs with treewidth at most 4, both problems are NP-hard also for such graphs, which significantly improves the previous hardness results for graphs with treewidth 11.

At Eurocrypt 96, Coppersmith presented a polynomial-time algorithm for finding small roots of univariate modular equations based on lattice reduction and then succussed to factorize the RSA modulus. Since then, a series of attacks on the key equation e d − k ϕ ( n ) = 1 of RSA have been presented. In this paper, we show that many of such attacks can be unified in a single attack using a new notion called Coppersmith’s interval . We determine a Coppersmith’s interval for a given RSA public key ( n , e ) . The interval is valid for any variant of RSA, such as Multi-Prime RSA, that uses the key equation. Then we show that RSA is insecure if δ &lt; β + 1 3 α − 1 3 1 2 α β + 4 α 2 provided that we have approximation p 0 ≥ n of p with p − p 0 ≤ 1 2 n α , α ≤ 1 2 .

In this work, we investigate the study of subversion attacks against cloud auditing protocol, which has been well-known as useful primitive for secure cloud storage. We demonstrate that subverted auditing protocol enables the cloud server to recover secret information stored on the data owner side. Particularly, we first define an asymmetric subversion attack model for auditing protocol. This model serves as the principle for analyzing the undetectability and key recovery of subversion attacks against auditing protocols. We then show a general framework of asymmetric subversion attacks against auditing protocols with index-coefficient challenge. To illustrate the feasibility of our paradigm, several concrete auditing protocols are provided. As a feasible countermeasure, we propose a subversion-resilient auditing protocol with index-coefficient challenge.},

  abstract     = {Certificateless cryptosystems have attracted great interests in cryptographic research since its invention. Because compared with traditional public key cryptosystems or identity-based cryptosystems, they could not only simplify the certificate management, but also alleviate the key escrow problem. In certificateless cryptosystems, user revocation is a challenging issue. To address this issue, one popular method is to update the key via public channels. However, most of the existing schemes in this approach are impractical because of the following two shortcomings. Firstly, the user needs to maintain a list of decryption keys, but the size of the list will keep increasing. Secondly, the revoked user can still recover the plaintexts of the encrypted data prior to revocation, and this is a particular threat in some applications. To solve these problems, this paper presents revocable certificateless encryption with ciphertext evolution. We give a generic construction and then describe how it can be initialized concretely. In our proposed scheme, the user only needs to keep one decryption key, and once a user is revoked, it can no longer decrypt any ciphertext in the server. Moreover, the IND-CCA security model is defined against three types of attacks. And our schemes are formally proved to satisfy these security requirements.},

  abstract     = {Multikey fully homomorphic encryption (MFHE) allows homomorphic operations between ciphertexts encrypted under different keys. In applications for secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols, MFHE can be more advantageous than usual fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) since users do not need to agree with a common public key before the computation when using MFHE. In EUROCRYPT 2016, Mukherjee and Wichs constructed a secure MPC protocol in only two rounds via MFHE which deals with a common random/reference string (CRS) in key generation. After then, Brakerski et al. replaced the role of CRS with the distributed setup for CRS calculation to form a four round secure MPC protocol. Thus, recent improvements in round complexity of MPC protocols have been made using MFHE. In this paper, we go further to obtain round-efficient and secure MPC protocols. The underlying MFHE schemes in previous works still involve the common value, CRS, it seems to weaken the power of using MFHE to allow users to independently generate their own keys. Therefore, we resolve the issue by constructing an MFHE scheme without CRS based on LWE assumption, and then we obtain a secure MPC protocol against semi-malicious security in three rounds. We also define a new security notion “multikey-CPA security” to prove that a multikey ciphertext cannot be decrypted unless all the secret keys are gathered and our scheme is multikey-CPA secure.},

Here we discuss the SNQ P systems using the rule application strategy as defined by Linqiang Pan and collaborators and we are able to improve their result of universality of such systems using two types of spikes. In the current work, we prove that only one type of spikes is sufficient for reaching the computational power of Turing Machines for these devices, bringing closer to implementation such a device. The result holds both in maximum parallel manner application of the rules as well as the maximum-sequentiality application of rules.},

  abstract     = {Ant Colony Systems have been widely employed in optimization issues primarily focused on path finding optimization, such as Traveling Salesman Problem. The main advantage lies in the choice of the edge to be explored, defined using the idea of pheromone. This article proposes the use of Ant Colony Systems to explore a Backus-Naur form grammar whose elements are solutions to a given problem. Similar studies, without using Ant Colonies, have been used to solve optimization problems, such as Grammatical Swarm (based on Particle Swarm Optimization) and Grammatical Evolution (based on Genetic Algorithms). Proposed algorithm opens the way to a new branch of research in Swarm Intelligence, which until now has been almost non-existent, using ant colony algorithms to solve problems described by a grammar.},

  abstract     = {This work answers some questions proposed by Bottoni, Labella, and Mitrana ( Theoretical Computer Science 682, 2017) regarding the prefix–suffix reduction on words. The operation is defined as a reduction by one half of every square that is present as either a prefix or a suffix of a word, leading thus to a finite set of words associated to the starting one. The iterated case considers consecutive applications of the operations, on all the resulting words. We show that the classes of linear and context-free language are closed under iterated bounded prefix–suffix square reduction, and that for a given word we can determine in 𝒪 ( n 2 log n ) time all of its primitive prefix–suffix square roots.},

In particular, we consider a model where the context for a reaction system originates from a network of reaction systems. Such a network is formalized as a graph with reaction systems residing at its nodes, where each reaction system contributes to defining the context of all its neighbors. This paper provides a framework for investigating the behavior of reaction systems receiving contexts from networks of reaction systems, provides a characterisation of their state sequences, and considers different topologies of context networks.},

Unlike the NPEP model, GNPEP uses its numerical evaluation over the processed data from a quantitative perspective, hence this model might be more suitable to solve specific hard problems in a more efficient and economic way. In particular, we propose a GNPEP network to solve a well-known NP-hard problem, namely the N -queens. We prove that this GNPEP algorithm requires a linear time in the size of a given instance. This result suggests that the GNPEP model is more suitable to address problems related to combinatorial optimization in which integer restrictions have a relevant role.},
