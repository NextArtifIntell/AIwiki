  abstract     = {Target detection is one of the important subfields in the research of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). It faces several challenges, due to the stationary objects, leading to the presence of scatter signal. Many researchers have succeeded on target detection, and this work introduces an approach for moving target detection in SAR. The newly developed scheme named Adaptive Particle Fuzzy System for Moving Target Detection (APFS-MTD) as the scheme utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO), adaptive, and fuzzy linguistic rules in APFS for identifying the target location. Initially, the received signals from the SAR are fed through the Generalized Radon-Fourier Transform (GRFT), Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), and matched filter to calculate the correlation using Ambiguity Function (AF). Then, the location of target is identified in the search space and is forwarded to the proposed APFS. The proposed APFS is the modification of standard Adaptive genetic fuzzy system using PSO. The performance of the MTD based on APFS is evaluated based on detection time, missed target rate, and Mean Square Error (MSE). The developed method achieves the minimal detection time of 4.13 s, minimal MSE of 677.19, and the minimal moving target rate of 0.145, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis (SA) is a technique that lets people in different fields such as business, economy, research, government, and politics to know about people’s opinions, which greatly affects the process of decision-making. SA techniques are classified into: lexicon-based techniques, machine learning techniques, and a hybrid between both approaches. Each approach has its limitations and drawbacks, the machine learning approach depends on manual feature extraction, lexicon-based approach relies on sentiment lexicons that are usually unscalable, unreliable, and manually annotated by human experts. Nowadays, word-embedding techniques have been commonly used in SA classification. Currently, Word2Vec and GloVe are some of the most accurate and usable word embedding techniques, which can transform words into meaningful semantic vectors. However, these techniques ignore sentiment information of texts and require a huge corpus of texts for training and generating accurate vectors, which are used as inputs of deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ensemble classifier framework. Our framework is based on our previously published lexicon-based method, bag-of-words, and pre-trained word embedding, first the sentence is preprocessed by removing stop-words, POS tagging, stemming and lemmatization, shortening exaggerated word. Second, the processed sentence is passed to three modules, our previous lexicon-based method (Sum Votes), bag-of-words module and semantic module (Word2Vec and Glove) and produced feature vectors. Finally, the previous features vectors are fed into 11 different classifiers. The proposed framework is tested and evaluated over four datasets with five different lexicons, the experiment results show that our proposed model outperforms the previous lexicon based and the machine learning methods individually.},

Based on the rough set and shadow set theories, the fuzzy distribution centroid was defined to represent the clustering center of the discrete feature so that the fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) could be extended to cluster the data with both continuous and discrete features. Then, considering the different contributions of the features to each cluster, a new weighted objective function was constructed in accordance with the principles of fuzzy compactness and separation. Because the learning feature weight is the key step in feature-weighted FCM, this paper regarded the feature weight as a variable optimized in the clustering process and put forward a self-adaptive mixed-type weighted FCM. The experimental results showed that the algorithm could be effectively applied to a heterogeneous mixed-type dataset.},

It is difficult to establish an accurate bed temperature model as the complexity of circulating fluidized bed combustion system. T-S fuzzy model was widely applied in the system identification for it can approximate complex nonlinear system with high accuracy. Fuzzy c-regression model (FCRM) clustering based on hyper-plane-shaped distance has the advantages in describing T-S fuzzy model, and Gaussian function was adapted in antecedent membership function of T-S fuzzy model. However, Gaussian fuzzy membership function was more suitable for clustering algorithm using point to point distance, such as fuzzy c-means (FCM). In this paper, a hyper-plane-shaped FCRM clustering algorithm for T-S fuzzy model identification algorithm is proposed. The antecedent membership function of proposed identification algorithm is defined by a hyper-plane-shaped membership function and an improved fuzzy partition method is applied. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed identification algorithm, the algorithm is applied in four nonlinear systems which shows higher identification accuracy and simplified identification process. At last, the algorithm is used in a circulating fluidized bed boiler bed temperature identification process, and gets better identification result.},

The sample sizes of some steel tube families given namely, yield a particular property are discrepant and sometimes very small. To overcome this sample imbalance and lack of representativeness, committees of predictive neural network models based on bagging predictors, a type of ensemble method, were adopted. As a result, all steel families for all properties have been satisfactorily described showing the correlations between targets and model estimates close to 99%. These results were compared to multiple linear regression, support vector machine and a simpler neural network.

In which various features such as n -GDip, DCCA, psePSSM were used as training features and SVM with linear kernel was employed as a classifier. To solve the imbalance problem of the benchmark datasets, the oversampling technique SMOTE was adopted. To deal with the huge amount of features, the PCA algorithm and Fisher feature selection method were adopted to reduce feature dimensions and remove redundant features. The experimental results show that the proposed method had a further improvement compared with other traditional machine learning methods in 10-fold cross-validation, Jackknife cross-validation and independent testing, which means a further step for the clinical application of computational methods to predict the Golgi protein types.},

According to Meta-SR’s Meta-Upscale Module, we designed a different structure called Meta-Downscale Module. By using these two different modules and back-projection structure, we construct an arbitrary back-projection network, which has the ability to enlarge images with arbitrary scale factor by using only one single model, meanwhile, obtains state-of-the-art reconstruction results. Through extensive experiments, our proposed method performs better reconstruction effect than Meta-SR and more efficient than D-DBPN. Besides that, we also evaluated the proposed method on widely used benchmark dataset on single image super-resolution.

In this work, we benefit from sentiment analysis of tweets using both an existing sentiment analysis package and a manually tailored “objective analysis,” to calculate one impact value for each analysis every 15 min. We then select the most appropriate training method by applying evolutionary techniques and discover the best subset of the generated features to include, as well as other parameters. One of the unique contributions of this work is the analysis of both English and Japanese tweets with a tailored “objective analysis” tool. This resulted in implementation of predictors which yielded 28% to 122% profit in a four-week simulation, much more than simply holding a digital currency for the same period of time.},

However, it lacks effective solutions based on machine learning for the prediction of cardiac arrhythmias.

A cardiac arrhythmia is a disturbance of the heart rhythm. It occurs when the heart beats too slowly, too fast or anarchically, with no apparent cause. The diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias is based on the analysis of the ECG properties, especially, the durations (P, QRS, T), the amplitudes (P, Q, R, S, T), the intervals (PQ, QT, RR), the cardiac frequency and the rhythm. In this paper we propose a system of arrhythmias diagnosis assistance based on the analysis of the temporal and frequential properties of the ECG signal. After the features extraction step, the ECG properties are then used as input for a convolutional neural network to detect and classify the arrhythmias. Finally, the classification results are used to perform a prediction of arrhythmias with nonlinear regression model. The method is illustrated using the MIT-BIH database.},

  abstract     = {Groundwater management problems are typically of a large-scale nature, involving complex nonlinear objective functions and constraints, which are commonly evaluated through the use of numerical simulation models. Given these complexities, metaheuristic optimization algorithms have recently become popular choice for solving such complex problems which are difficult to solve by traditional methods. However, the practical applications of metaheuristics are severely challenged by the requirement of large number of function evaluations to achieve convergence. To overcome this shortcoming, many new metaheuristics and different variants of existing ones have been proposed in recent years. In this study, a recently developed algorithm called flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is investigated for optimal groundwater management. The FPA is improved, combined with the widely used groundwater flow simulation model MODFLOW, and applied to solve two groundwater management problems. The proposed algorithm, denoted as IFPA, is first tested on a hypothetical aquifer system, to minimize the total pumping to contain contaminated groundwater within a capture zone. IFPA is then applied to maximize the total annual pumping from existing wells in Rhis-Nekor unconfined coastal aquifer on the northern of Morocco. The obtained results indicate that IFPA is a promising method for solving groundwater management problems as it outperforms the standard FPA and other algorithms applied to the case studies considered, both in terms of convergence rate and solution quality.},

Recently, there has been an increased interest from the evolutionary computation community to model bilevel problems due to its applicability in real-world applications for decision-making problems. In this work, a partial nested evolutionary approach with a local heuristic search has been proposed to solve the benchmark problems and have outstanding results. This approach relies on the concept of intermarriage-crossover in search of feasible regions by exploiting information from the constraints. A new variant has also been proposed to the commonly used convergence approaches, i.e., optimistic and pessimistic. It is called an extreme optimistic approach. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm converges differently to known optimum solutions with the optimistic variants. Optimistic approach also outperforms pessimistic approach. Comparative statistical analysis of our approach with other recently published partial to complete evolutionary approaches demonstrates very competitive results.},

  abstract     = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are beginning to be deployed at an accelerated pace, and they have attracted significant attention in a broad spectrum of applications. WSNs encompass a large number of sensor nodes enabling a base station (BS) to sense and transmit data over the area where WSN is spread. As most sensor nodes have a limited energy capacity and at the same time transmit critical information, enhancing the lifetime and the reliability of WSNs are essential factors in designing these networks. Among many approaches, clustering of sensor nodes has proved to be an effective method of reducing energy consumption and increasing lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, a new energy-efficient clustering protocol is implemented using a two-step Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the first step of GA, cluster heads (CHs) are selected, and in the second step, cluster members are chosen based on their distance to the selected CHs. Compared to other clustering protocols, the lifetime of WSNs in the proposed clustering is improved. This improvement is the consequence of the fact that this clustering considers energy efficient parameters in clustering protocol.},

  abstract     = {Intrusion is one of the biggest problems in wireless sensor networks. Because of the evolution in wired and wireless mechanization, various archetypes are used for communication. But security is the major concern as networks are more prone to intrusions. An intrusion can be dealt in two ways: either by detecting an intrusion in a wireless sensor network or by preventing an intrusion in a wireless sensor network. Many researchers are working on detecting intrusions and less emphasis is given on intrusion prevention. One of the modern techniques for averting intrusions is through fuzzy logic. In this paper, we have defined a fuzzy rule-based system to avert intrusions in wireless sensor network. The proposed system works in three phases: feature extraction, membership value computation and fuzzified rule applicator. The proposed method revolves around predicting nodes in three categories as “red”, “orange” and “green”. “Red” represents that the node is malicious and prevents it from entering the network. “Orange” represents that the node “might be malicious” and marks it suspicious. “Green” represents that the node is not malicious and it is safe to enter the network. The parameters for the proposed FzMAI are packet send to base station, energy consumption, signal strength, a packet received and PDR. Evaluation results show an accuracy of 98.29% for the proposed system. A detailed comparative analysis concludes that the proposed system outperforms all the other considered fuzzy rule-based systems. The advantage of the proposed system is that it prevents a malicious node from entering the system, thus averting intrusion.},

  abstract     = {Over the past 25 years, numerous fuzzy time series forecasting models have been proposed to deal the complex and uncertain problems. The main factors that affect the forecasting results of these models are partition universe of discourse, creation of fuzzy relationship groups and defuzzification of forecasting output values. So, this study presents a hybrid fuzzy time series forecasting model combined particle swarm optimization (PSO) and fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) for solving issues above. The FCM clustering is used to divide the historical data into initial intervals with unequal size. After generating interval, the historical data is fuzzified into fuzzy sets with the aim to serve for establishing fuzzy relationship groups according to chronological order. Then the information obtained from the fuzzy relationship groups can be used to calculate forecasted value based on a new defuzzification technique. In addition, in order to enhance forecasting accuracy, the PSO algorithm is used for finding optimum interval lengths in the universe of discourse. The proposed model is applied to forecast three well-known numerical datasets (enrolments data of the University of Alabama, the Taiwan futures exchange —TAIFEX data and yearly deaths in car road accidents in Belgium). These datasets are also examined by using some other forecasting models available in the literature. The forecasting results obtained from the proposed model are compared to those produced by the other models. It is observed that the proposed model achieves higher forecasting accuracy than its counterparts for both first—order and high—order fuzzy logical relationship.},

One of the widely used methods for image segmentation is image thresholding that can separate pixels based on the specified thresholds. Otsu method calculates the thresholds to divide two or multiple classes based on between-class variance maximization and within-class variance minimization. However, increasing the number of thresholds, surging the computational time of the segmentation. To combat this drawback, the combination of Otsu and the evolutionary algorithm is usually beneficial. Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) is a novel, and efficient swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm that inspired from the way crows storing and retrieving food. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid method based on employing CSA and Otsu for multilevel thresholding. The obtained results compared with the combination of the Otsu method with three other evolutionary algorithms consisting of improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and also the fuzzy version of FA.

Therefore, it is a massive importance to predict the microclimate inside greenhouse as a preceding stage for accurate design of a control system that could fulfill the requirements of suitable environment for the plants and crop managing. The LSTM network is trained and tested by the temperatures and relative humidity data measured inside the greenhouse utilizing the mathematical greenhouse model with the outside weather data over 27 days. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the suggested LSTM network, different measurements, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), are calculated and compared to those of conventional networks in references. The simulation results of LSTM network for forecasting the temperature and relative humidity inside greenhouse outperform over those of the traditional methods. The prediction results of temperature and humidity inside greenhouse in terms of RMSE approximately are 0.16 and 0.62 and in terms of MAE are 0.11 and 0.4, respectively, for both of them.},

Inadequate information and awareness of flood hazard make the management of flood risks arduous and challenging. This paper proposes a hybridized analytic approach via unsupervised and supervised learning methodologies, for the discovery of pieces of knowledge, clustering and prediction of flood severity levels (FSL). A two-staged unsupervised learning based on k -means and self-organizing maps (SOM) was performed on the unlabeled flood dataset. K -means based on silhouette criterion discovered top three representatives of the optimal numbers of clusters inherent in the flood dataset. Experts’ judgment favored four clusters, while Squared Euclidean distance was the best performing distance measure. SOM provided cluster visuals of the input attributes within the four different groups and transformed the dataset into a labeled one. A 5-layered Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) driven by hybrid learning algorithm was applied to classify and predict FSL. ANFIS optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) produced root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.323 and Error Standard Deviation of 0.408 while Particle Swarm Optimized ANFIS model produced 0.288 as the RMSE, depicting 11% improvement when compared with GA optimized model. The result shows significant improvement in the classification and prediction of flood risks using single ML tool.},

In this paper, we propose a spatial relational attention approach to consider spatial positions and attributes. Image features are firstly weighted by the attention mechanism. Then they are concatenated with contextual features to form a spatial–visual tensor. The tensor is feature extracted by a fully convolutional network to produce visual concepts for the decoder network. The fully convolutional layers maintain spatial topology of images. Experiments conducted on the three benchmark datasets, namely Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MSCOCO, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Recently, Convolutional Neural community (CNN) has emerged as one of the maximum efferent techniques for medical records evaluation and diverse picture classification issues. On this paper, a notably strong and green BC-CAD solution has been proposed. Our proposed gadget consists of pre-processing, more suitable adaptive learning based totally Gaussian aggregate model (GMM), connected element analysis based vicinity of interest localization, and AlexNet-DNN primarily based characteristic extraction. The precept factor analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) primarily based on characteristic selection that&#39;s used as dimensional discount. One of the blessings of the proposed method is that not one of the current dimensional reduction algorithms hired with SVM to perform breast most cancers detection and class. The overall results acquired signify that the AlexNet-DNN based capabilities at completely connected layer; FC6 together with LDA dimensional discount and SVM-based totally classification outperforms other country-of-artwork techniques for breast cancer detection. The proposed method completed 96.20 for AlexNet-FC6 and 96.70 for AlexNet-FC7 in term of assessment measures.},

  abstract     = {G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR) are the large family of protein membrane; and until now some of them still remain orphans. Predicting GPCR functions is a challenging task, it depends closely to their classification, which requires a digital representation of each protein chain as an attribute vector. A major problem of GPCR databases is their great number of features which can produce combinatorial explosion and increase the complexity of classification algorithms. Feature selection techniques are used to deal with this problem by minimizing features space dimension, and keeping the most relevant ones. In this paper, we propose to use the BAT algorithm for extracting the pertinent features and to improve the classification results. We compared the results obtained by our system with two other bio-inspired algorithms, Evolutionary Algorithm and PSO search. Metrics quality measures used for comparison are Error Rate, Accuracy, MCC and F -measure. Experimental results indicate that our system is more efficient.},

  abstract     = {Estimation of software cost and effort is of prime importance in software development process. Accurate and reliable estimation plays a vital role in successful completion of the project. To estimate software cost, various techniques have been used. Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) is amongst most prominent algorithmic model used for cost estimation. Different versions of COCOMO consider different types of parameters affecting overall cost. Parameters involved in estimation using COCOMO possess vagueness which introduces some degree of uncertainty in algorithmic modelling. The concept of fuzzy logic can deal with uncertainty involved in Intermediate COCOMO cost driver measurements via Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). In the proposed research, an effort has been made wherein, for each cost driver, an FIS is designed to calculate the corresponding effort multiplier. Proposed research provides an insight through evolutionary-based optimization techniques to optimize fuzzy logic-based COCOMO using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm. The magnitude of relative error and its mean, calculated using COCOMO NASA2 and COCOMONASA datasets are used as evaluation metrics to validate the proposed model. The model outperforms when compared to other optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Classification problems in which the number of features (dimensions) is unduly higher than the number of samples (observations) is an essential research and application area in a variety of domains, especially in computational biology. It is also known as a high-dimensional small-sample-size (HDSSS) problem. Various dimensionality reduction methods have been developed, but they are not potent with the small-sample-sized high-dimensional datasets and suffer from overfitting and high-variance gradients. To overcome the pitfalls of sample size and dimensionality, this study employed variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a dynamic framework for unsupervised learning in recent years. The objective of this study is to investigate a reliable classification model for high-dimensional and small-sample-sized datasets with minimal error. Moreover, it evaluated the strength of different architectures of VAE on the HDSSS datasets. In the experiment, six genomic microarray datasets from Kent Ridge Biomedical Dataset Repository were selected, and several choices of dimensions (features) were applied for data preprocessing. Also, to evaluate the classification accuracy and to find a stable and suitable classifier, nine state-of-the-art classifiers that have been successful for classification tasks in high-dimensional data settings were selected. The experimental results demonstrate that the VAE can provide superior performance compared to traditional methods such as PCA, fastICA, FA, NMF, and LDA in terms of accuracy and AUROC.},
