  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel fault diagnosis (FD) approach for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors that recognize the fault patterns of MEMS inertial sensors in an end-to-end manner. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based data-driven method to classify the temperature-related sensor faults in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). First, we formulate the FD problem for MEMS inertial sensors into a deep learning framework. Second, we design a multi-scale CNN which uses the raw data of MEMS inertial sensors as input and which outputs classification results indicating faults. Then we extract fault features in the temperature domain to solve the non-uniform sampling problem. Finally, we propose an improved adaptive learning rate optimization method which accelerates the loss convergence by using the Kalman filter (KF) to train the network efficiently with a small dataset. Our experimental results show that our method achieved high fault recognition accuracy and that our proposed adaptive learning rate method improved performance in terms of loss convergence and robustness on a small training batch.},

When records in different data sources do not have a common key and they contain typographical errors in their identifier fields, the extended Fellegi–Sunter probabilistic record linkage method with consideration of field similarity proposed by Winkler, is one of the most effective methods to perform record linkage to our knowledge. But this method has a limitation that it cannot efficiently handle the problem of missing value in the fields, an inappropriate weight is assigned to record pair containing missing data. Therefore, to improve the performance of Winkler’s probabilistic record linkage method in presence of missing value, we proposed a solution for adjusting record pair’s weight when missing data occurred, which allows enhancing the accuracy of the Winkler’s record linkage decisions without increasing much more computational time.},

  abstract     = {Nonphotorealistic rendering (NPR) techniques are used to transform real-world images into high-quality aesthetic styles automatically. NPR mainly focuses on transfer hand-painted styles to other content images, and simulates pencil drawing, watercolor painting, sketch painting, Chinese monochromes, calligraphy and, so on. However, digital simulation of Chinese embroidery style has not attracted researcher’s much attention. This study proposes an embroidery style transfer method from a 2D image on the basis of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and evaluates the relevant rendering features. The primary novelty of the rendering technique is that the strokes and needle textures are produced by the CNN and the results can display embroidery styles. The proposed method can not only embody delicate strokes and needle textures but also realize stereoscopic effects to achieve real embroidery features. First, using conditional random fields (CRF), the algorithm segments the target content and the embroidery style images through a semantic segmentation network. Then, the binary mask image is generated to guide the embroidery style transfer for different regions. Next, CNN is used to extract the strokes and texture features from the real embroidery images, and transfer these features to the content images. Finally, the simulating image is generated to show the features of the real embroidery styles. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, the simulations are compared with real embroidery artwork and other methods. In addition, the quality evaluation method is used to evaluate the quality of the results. In all the cases, the proposed method is found to achieve needle visual quality of the embroidery styles, thereby laying a foundation for the research and preservation of embroidery works.},

Plantar pressure images of early diabetic foot patients were collected and de-noised. An improved automatic regional division algorithm of plantar pressure images was proposed. Laplacian spectrum features were extracted according to the maximum pressure point, pressure center point, and pressure values of the different plantar regions, including plantar shape and tactile features. Finally, based on these data, a support vector classifier was designed and sequential minimal optimization algorithms were used to train the classifier on the plantar pressure data of the left and right foot in 70 subjects to identify early diabetic foot. The results showed that the average recognition rates of the algorithm were high, providing an important reference for the diagnosis of early diabetic foot.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a robust face detection method based on skin color enhancement model and a facial expression recognition algorithm with block principal component analysis (PCA). First, the luminance range of human face image is broadened and the contrast ratio of skin color is strengthened by the homomorphic filter. Second, the skin color enhancement model is established using YCbCr color space components to locate the face area. Third, the feature based on differential horizontal integral projection is extracted from the face. Finally, the block PCA with deep neural network is used to accomplish the facial expression recognition. The experimental results indicate that in the case of weaker illumination and more complicated backgrounds, both the face detection and facial expression recognition can be achieved effectively by the proposed algorithm, meanwhile the mean recognition rate obtained by the facial expression recognition method is improved by 2.7% comparing with the traditional Local Binary Patterns (LBPs) method.},

Furthermore, it has vital roles in the fields of video streaming, multimedia, video conferencing and much more. Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is an emerging research area, due to its extensive application in most of the multimedia devices as well as public demand. The proposed coding technique is capable of eliminating the Spatio-temporal regularity of a video sequence. In Discrete Bandelet Transform (DBT), the directions are modeled by a three-directional vector field, known as structural flow. Regularity is decided by this flow where the data entropy is low. The wavelet vector decomposition of geometrically ordered data results in a lesser extent of significant coefficients. The directions of geometrical regularity are interpreted with a two-dimensional vector, and the approximation of these directions is found with spline functions. This paper deals with a novel SVC technique by exploiting the DBT. The bandelet coefficients are further encoded by utilizing Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) encoder, followed by global thresholding mechanism. The proposed method is verified with several benchmark datasets using the performance measures which gives enhanced performance. Thus, the experimental results bring out the superiority of the proposed technique over the state-of-arts.},

  abstract     = {Despite the extensive attention attracted by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the radiation therapy, computed tomography was reintroduced by the researchers. During the calculation process of the 3D dose distribution of tissues, there were some arguments about the electron density information obtained from the CT scan. However, the CT-provided bones are accurate for constructing a radiograph. Recently, the advantages boosted by the soft tissue contrast relying on MRI and as well as the advantages boosted by CT imaging have been combined by the using of MRI/CT. Unfortunately, disadvantages still exist in the MRI/CT workflow because the voxel-intensities are unbalanced in the MRI and the CT scan. Here, based on the mapping method of CT and MRI, the potential of pseudo-CT (PCT) instead of CT planning was studied. The estimated PCT only from the corresponding MRI was obtained by using the patch-based random forest regression. The CT voxel target was trained by 3D Gabor feature in the MRI cube and the Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Besides, the regression task was solved by the alternative regression forest. According to the experiment, the method performs better than the current dictionary learning-based (DLB) method or atlas-based (AB) method.},

  abstract     = {As a significant application in aerial image, road mapping is still a difficult task since roads show complex features caused by the influence of spectral reflectance, shadows and occlusions. To achieve a satisfying result, a new method combing multiple road features and biased gradient vector flow (B-GVF) snake is studied in this paper. First, an exponential function is applied to fuse the color-based and structure-based measure for gaining the saliency maps which is viewed as the candidate region of B-GVF snake; Secondly, the initial road boundary is calculated from the candidate region using a region-growing algorithm, and then an gradient map is produced by an Gaussian filtering function; at last, a normally biased GVF external force is proposed for mapping road edges, which keeps the diffusion along the tangential direction of the isophotes and biases along the normal direction. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has the good performance in Completeness, Correctness, and F-measure comparing with other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In the era of globalization, manufacturing industries are facing intense pressure to prevent unexpected breakdowns, reduce maintenance cost and increase plant availability. Induction motors are the most sought-after prime movers in modern-day industries due to their robustness. Recently, research has picked up a fervent pace in the area of fault diagnosis of electrical machines. This paper presents the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based system to diagnose the vibration and Instantaneous Power (IP)-based responses of rolling element bearings and broken rotor bars in an induction motor. The dimensionality of the extracted features was reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and thereafter the selected features were ranked in order of relevance using the Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) method for reducing the size of input features and finding the most optimal feature set. A comparative analysis of the effectiveness of SVM and ANN is carried out using statistical parameters extracted from vibration and IP signals. The highest accuracy of 92.5% and 98.2% was achieved for vibration and IP signatures, respectively, using the proposed SFFS-based feature selection technique and ANN classification method. The results reveal that ANN has better performance than SVM and the proposed strategy can be used for automatic recognition of machine faults. The use of this type of intelligent system helps in avoiding unwanted and unplanned system shutdowns due to the failure of the motor.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at problems of multipoint leakage source detection and low positioning accuracy in urban gas pipelines, a multipoint leak location method base on improved variational mode decomposition (VMD) was proposed. By improving the VMD decomposition of the original leakage signal, the parameters of the VMD were optimized to reduce the influence of noise and weak correlation signals on the leak location. Then the multi-point leakage location model of pipeline was established, and the sensitive modal component Intrinsic mode function (IMF) with the most leakage information was selected by multiscale entropy. According to the characteristics of the blind source separation method, the relevant time delays of the simultaneous leakage of multiple points on the pipeline and the frequency of the signal are extracted. Finally, The location of the leak source is determined according to the principle of cross-correlation. The experimental results show that compared with the direct cross-correlation method and the VMD-based method, the proposed multipoint leak diagnosis method has less error, the minimum relative error is 1.61%, and the positioning accuracy is higher.},

A 360-degree video should be projected as a planar video before encoding, but this process causes distortion whose degree depends on the latitude. Traditional coding algorithms cannot effectively adapt to this feature. In this study, a fast intra prediction algorithm based on WMSE for 360-degree video is proposed. The similarity between the mother block and child blocks can reflect whether the mother block needs to be divided. Spherical weights are introduced in WMSE, and the similarity expressed by WMSE can distinguish the video of different latitude, which is consistent with the weight characteristics of ERP projection. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 32% time reduction, with only 0.29% luma Bjontegaard delta rate (BD-rate) increase on average. The proposed algorithm provides a more effective solution to reduce the coding complexity of 360-degree video.},

The compact genetic algorithm helps in the evolution of network structure by optimizing the number of convolutional layers and number of filters in each convolutional layer. At the same time, an optimal set of weight parameters of the network is obtained using the SGD law. This approach amalgamates exploration in network space by compact genetic algorithm and exploitation in weight space with SGD in an effective manner. The proposed approach also incorporates user-defined parameters in the cost function in an elegant manner which controls the network structure and hence the performance of the network based on the users need. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated on four benchmark datasets, namely MNIST, COIL-100, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

With the advent of the proteomics era, some PPIs prediction methods have emerged. However, the performances of these PPIs prediction methods still need to be optimized and improved. In order to optimize the performance of the PPIs prediction methods, we used the dropout method to reduce over-fitting by deep neural networks (DNNs), and combined with three types of feature extraction methods, conjoint triad (CT), auto covariance (AC) and local descriptor (LD), to build DNN models based on amino acid sequences.

As the number of samples grows larger, traditional metric and feature learning methods fall into bottleneck, while it just meets the needs of deep learning algorithm, which perform very well in person re-identification. Although they have achieved good results in the field of supervised learning, their application in real-world scenarios is not very satisfactory. This is mainly because in the real world, a huge number of labeled images are hard to obtain, and even if they are obtained, the cost is expensive. Meanwhile, the performance of deep learning in unsupervised metrics is not ideal. For solving the problem, we propose a new method based on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and re-ranking, and name it UDA + . As for this method, we first train a camera-aware style transfer model to gain camstyle images. Then we further reduce the difference between the domain of the target and source by using invariant feature, and further improve their commonality. In addition, re-ranking is also introduced to optimize the matching results. This method can not only reduce the cost of obtaining labeled data, but also improve the accuracy. Experimental results show that our method can outperform the most advanced method by 4% on Rank-1 and 14% on mAP. The results also better confirm the effectiveness of Re-ranking module and provide a new idea for domain adaptation by unsupervised methods in the future.},

To address these problems, this paper presents a new scalable metric learning algorithm for multi-modal data. Our method learns an optimal metric for any feature set of the multi-modal data in an online fashion. We also combine the learned metrics with a novel Passive/Aggressive (PA)-based algorithm which results in a higher convergence rate compared to the state-of-the-art methods. To address scalability with respect to dimensionality, Dual Random Projection (DRP) is adopted in this paper. The present method is evaluated on some challenging machine vision datasets for image classification and Content-Based Information Retrieval (CBIR) tasks.

In this paper, we investigate two state-of-the-art methods, a multi-loss deep residual learning method with 50 layers (multi-loss ResNet-50) and an ORB feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping method (ORB-SLAM). While deep learning methods have been extensively studied for head pose detection, this is the first study in which SLAM has been employed to innovatively track head scanning over a very wide range. Our laboratory experimental results showed that ORB-SLAM was more accurate than multi-loss ResNet-50, which often failed when many facial features were not in the view. On the contrary, ORB-SLAM was able to continue tracking as it does not rely on particular facial features. Testing with real driving videos demonstrated the feasibility of using ORB-SLAM for tracking large lateral head scans in naturalistic video data.},

  abstract     = {Microscopic images of bovine milk somatic cells are used to classify neutrophils, epithelial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. Using pattern recognition technology, the problem of classification and recognition is solved from different nature, levels and spaces. The proposed RKSGA-SVM algorithm is used to realize somatic cell image recognition. First, color, morphological and texture features of four types of cells are extracted separately, including geometric and moment invariant features. Second, ReliefF algorithm is used to calculate the weights of all features. According to preset cumulative contribution rate, the preliminary feature set is obtained. Third, redundant features are eliminated by Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test, and the high-level optimization is obtained. The selected feature sets have remarkable distinguishing ability. Finally, the weighted optimal feature sets are obtained by weighted coefficient method on the advanced optimal feature sets. The overall accuracy of RKSGA-SVM algorithm is 99.00%, and Kappa coefficient is 0.987. The proposed algorithm has the advantages of balancing classification accuracy, eliminating redundancy and reducing feature dimension. On the premise of ensuring high classification accuracy, the feature set can reduce feature dimension and the amount of data calculation, improve operation efficiency and save storage space. Experiments show that the feature selection method proposed in this paper is feasible and more suitable for extracting feature sets in the process of somatic cell classification.},

Through simulation experiments, this paper compares four improved particle swarm optimization algorithms, inertia weight, linear decline, shrinkage factor and chaos, and finds that ACPSO can find the optimal path faster and transmit data quickly. So, this paper uses chaotic particle swarm optimization (CACPSO) to improve AODV protocol. Finally, based on NS2 simulation platform, the improved AODV protocol is simulated and experimented. Different network environments are set up to test packet delivery rate, network delay and routing discovery frequency.

Intelligent factory is one of the main research points in the industry 4.0 era. In order to improve the intelligent level of the factory, the connection-and-cognition ability has to be established for the factory and its equipment. Connection builds data pipes among equipment and systems while cognition automatically turns the data into knowledge. In an intelligent factory, industrial robot plays a leading role. Hence, the aim of this paper is to synthetically study connection and cognition of industrial robots in intelligent factories. To be specific, open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA) is applied to establish heterogeneous connection of industrial robots with factory management software. A long short-term memory (LSTM) joint auto encoder method is proposed to establish the unsupervised anomaly detection cognition ability for industrial robot process (e.g. grinding, welding and assembling). In summary, this study puts OPC UA and LSTM auto encoder technology together to study heterogeneous connection and process anomaly detection of industrial robots in intelligent factory. The experimental results showed that the proposed method successfully realized heterogeneous connection of an industrial robot and detected process anomaly from the robot built-in sensors’ data.},

The essential reason is that the hard information is used in the initialization and iterative processes. For the problem of partial loss of information, when the reliability is assigned during initialization, the error correction performance is improved by modifying the assignment of reliability at initialization. The initialization process is determined by the probability of occurrence of the number of erroneous bits in the symbol and the Hamming distance. In addition, the IHRB-MLGD decoding algorithm uses the hard decision in the iterative decoding process. The improved algorithm adds soft decision information in the iterative process, which improves the error correction performance while only slightly increasing the decoding complexity, and improves the reliability accumulation process which makes the algorithm more stable.

In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm based on nonnegative sparse representation, collaborative presentation, and probabilistic graph estimation to address SSFR. The proposed algorithm is named as Nonnegative Sparse Probabilistic Estimation (NNSPE). To extract the variation information from the generic training set, we first select some neighbor samples from the generic training set for each sample in the gallery set and the generic training set can be partitioned into some reference subsets. To make more meaningful reconstruction, the proposed method adopts nonnegative sparse representation to reconstruct training samples, and according to the reconstruction coefficients, NNSPE computes the probabilistic label estimation for the samples of the generic training set. Then, for a given test sample, collaborative representation (CR) is used to acquire an adaptive variation subset. Finally, the NNSPE classifies the test sample with the adaptive variation subset and probabilistic label estimation. The experiments on the AR and PIE verify the effectiveness of the proposed method both in recognition rates and time cost.},

  abstract     = {Similar to human biometrics such as faces and fingerprints, animals also have biometrics for individual identifiers. This research paper works on biometrics of cattle using images of muzzle patterns. The proposed approach begins with a training process to construct a cattle face localization model using a Haar feature-based cascade classifier. Then, the watershed technique is applied to segment a region of interest (RoI) of a muzzle area in the detected region of the cattle face. This muzzle ROI is further enhanced to make ridge lines more outstanding. The next step, using two approaches, is to extract a main feature descriptor based on a bag of histograms of oriented gradients (BoHoG) and a histogram of local binary patterns (LBP). Then, the support vector machine (SVM) is applied with the histogram intersection kernel for a final cattle identifier. The proposed method is evaluated using five different datasets including one existing cattle dataset used in previous research works, one newly collected dataset of swamp buffalo captured in a controlled environment, and three newly collected datasets of swamp buffalo captured in an outdoor field environment. This outdoor field environment includes challenges of freely moving cattle and differences in daylight. It could achieve a promising accuracy of 95% for a large dataset of 431 subjects.},

A 3D model, reconstructed using Generic Elastic Model (3D GEM) from a frontal view training sample, is used to generate a set of nonfrontal gallery face images. The face region of the nonfrontal query sample is then extracted using the same landmark detection technique as in the 3D GEM algorithm. Afterwards, a novel texture representation technique called Local Comparative Decimal Pattern (LCDP) is proposed to extract features from each of the training and query samples. A set of experimental results on the ORL, Georgia Tech (GT), and LFW face databases demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Through changing tissue-equivalent gas pressure, TEPC can simulate the case of radiation energy deposition in different sizes of human cells.

Because TEPC simulated cell size is less than the range of ionizing radiation particles, TEPC can be used as linear energy transfer spectroscopy, which can identify different linear energy transfer particles in a mixed radiation field and play an important role in mixed neutron–photon radiation field monitoring and protection.

  abstract     = {The writing style is a unique characteristic of a human being as it varies from one person to another. Due to such diversity in writing style, handwritten character recognition (HCR) under the purview of pattern recognition is not trivial. Conventional methods used handcrafted features that required a-priori domain knowledge, which is always not feasible. In such a case, extracting features automatically could potentially attract more interests. For this, in the literature, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been a popular approach to extract features from the image data. However, state-of-the-art works do not provide a generic CNN model for character recognition, Devanagari script, for instance. Therefore, in this work, we first study several different CNN models on publicly available handwritten Devanagari characters and numerals datasets. This means that our study is primarily focusing on comparative study by taking trainable parameters, training time and memory consumption into account. Later, we propose and design DevNet, a modified CNN architecture that produced promising results, since computational complexity and memory space are our primary concerns in design.},

A fast and effective image fusion scheme based on multi-resolution singular value decomposition (MR-SVD) with guided filter (GF) has been introduced in this paper. The proposed scheme decomposes an image of two-scale by MR-SVD into a lower approximate layer and a detailed layer containing the lower and higher variations of pixel intensity. It generates lower and details of left focused (LF) and right focused (RF) layers by applying the MR-SVD on each series of multi-focus images. GF is utilized to create a refined and smooth-textured weight fusion map by the weighted average approach on spatial features of the lower and detail layers of each image. A fused image of LF and RF has been achieved by the inverse MR-SVD. Finally, a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) has been applied to segment the fused results by generating the trained-patches mechanism. Comparing the results by state-of-the-art fusion and segmentation methods, we have illustrated that the proposed schemes provide superior fused and its segment results in terms of both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Deep neural networks are able to extract pertinent features automatically from the input image. This drops the dependency on handcrafted features, which is typically a trial and error process. In this paper, we perform an exhaustive experimental evaluation of learned against handcrafted features for Arabic handwriting recognition task. Moreover, we focus on the optimization of the competing full-word based language models by incorporating different characters and sub-words models. We extensively investigate the use of different sub-word-based language models, mainly characters, pseudo-words, morphemes and hybrid units in order to enhance the full-word handwriting recognition system for Arabic script. The proposed method allows the recognition of any out of vocabulary word as an arbitrary sequence of sub-word units. The KHATT database has been used as a benchmark for the Arabic handwriting recognition. We show that combining multiple language models enhances considerably the recognition performance for a morphologically rich language like Arabic. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the KHATT dataset.},

Conventional methods usually construct classifiers with hand-crafted or the learned features to recognize human actions.

Specifically, we first utilize the memory neural network to construct action predictors for each kind of activity. These action predictors can then output the action trends at the next time step. According to the predictions of these action predictors at each time step and the removal rule, the poor predictors can be eliminated step by step, and the IDentity(ID) number of the last predictor left is considered as the label of the action sequence to be categorized. We compare the proposed action recognition algorithm using sequence prediction learning with other methods on two publicly available datasets.

The aim of this paper is to propose a new hierarchical ACO- and PSO-based method for TSP solutions. Enhancing neighboring operators were used to achieve better results by hierarchical method.

We employ the variational Bayesian (VB) inference method with Gaussian process (GP) prior for separating the nonstationary source frame by frame from the time-varying convolution signal, in which the prior information of the mixing matrix and the source signal are obtained by the Gaussian autoregressive method, and the posterior distributions of parameters (source signal and mixing matrix) are obtained by the VB learning. In the learning process, the learned parameters and hyperparameters are propagated to the next frame for VB inference as the prior which is combined with the likelihood function to get the posterior distribution.

  abstract     = {Task scheduling between edge devices and remote servers is a common application scenario in edge computing or cloud computing, also known as computational offloading. A reasonable scheduling strategy can effectively shorten task completion time, reduce energy consumption, and improve user experience. However, the traditional offline task scheduling algorithm is NP-hard, and the decision requires obtaining all the information of the task and the device (such as task computing amount, data amount, device computing resources, etc.), which is challenging to meet in practical applications. The semi-online algorithm describes the task scheduling method when the system cannot obtain all the information. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Semi-online algorithm for Multi-users task offloading (ESaM), which includes two specific implementations: ESaM-I as known server-side idle time, and ESaM-O for known task computing amount. Because ESaM-I has obtained server information, it is better than ESaM-O in performance for most of the scenarios. The experimental results show that ESaM-I and ESaM-O are superior to the well-known semi-online scheduling algorithm SPaC in task completion time. As the remote processor computing ability increases, the average makespan converges to 0.875, 0.742, 0.782 for SPaC-M, ESaM-O, and ESaM-I in the simulation.},

The method of segmenting images by the two-dimensional maximum entropy is a species of the useful technique of threshold segmentation. However, the efficiency and stability of this technique are still not ideal and the traditional search algorithm cannot meet the needs of engineering problems. To mitigate the above problem, swarm intelligent optimization algorithms have been employed in this field for searching the optimal threshold vector. An effective technique of lightning attachment procedure optimization (LAPO) algorithm based on a two-dimensional maximum entropy criterion is offered in this paper, and besides, a chaotic strategy is embedded into LAPO to develop a new algorithm named CLAPO. In order to confirm the benefits of the method proposed in this paper, the other seven kinds of competitive algorithms, such as Ant–lion Optimizer (ALO) and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), are compared. Experiments are conducted on four different kinds of images and the simulation results are presented in several indexes (such as computational time, maximum fitness, average fitness, variance of fitness and other indexes) at different threshold levels for each test image. By scrutinizing the results of the experiment, the superiority of the introduced method is demonstrated, which can meet the needs of image segmentation excellently.},

  abstract     = {Aimed at scene matching problem for taking infrared image as the actual data and the visible image as the referenced data, a multi-resolution matching algorithm which fuses compressive sensing Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) feature is presented based on Bandelet transform. Two kinds of images are separately transformed into Bandelet domain to compress the feature search space of scene matching based on the best sparse representation of natural images by Bandelet transform. On the basis of adaptive Bayes threshold denoising for infrared image, the concept of sparse feature representation of compressive sensing theory is introduced into SIFT algorithm. For low-frequency image in Bandelet domain, high-dimensional SIFT key point feature description vector is projected on compressive sensing random measurement matrix to achieve dimensionality reduction. Then, the improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) to overcome premature phenomena is used as the search strategy, and the L 1 distance measure of SIFT feature vectors of compressive sensing for two kinds of images is applied to the search similarity criterion to match low-frequency image of high scale in Bandelet domain. The matching result is used as the guidance of the matching process for low-frequency image of low scale, and the matching result of full-resolution image is obtained iteratively. Experimental results show that the proposed method has not only high matching accuracy and fast matching speed, but also better robustness in comparison with some classic matching algorithms, which can resist the geometric distortion of rotation for actual image.},

  abstract     = {Virtual simulation and 3D interaction have shown great potentials in a variety of domains for our future life. For a virtual fish swarm simulation system, the simulation of cohesion behaviors of fish swarm and the interaction between human and fish swarm are two key components to create immersive interactive experiences. However, it is a huge challenge to create a realistic fish swarm simulation system while providing a natural and comfortable interaction. In this paper, we propose a method for immersive virtual fish swarm simulation based on infrared sensors. Based on dynamic weight constraints, we propose a particle swarm optimization method for fish swarm cohesion simulation, which separates a particle swarm by the state of each particle and dynamically controls the particle swarm, making the movement behavior of virtual fish more realistic. In addition, an interactive fast skinning method is proposed for cartoon fishes, which leverages image segmentation, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and bone skinning are used to generate cartoon fishes based on user-created colors. With infrared sensors, we propose a method for virtual fish swarm interaction, where the positions of human skeleton are processed by an action analyzer, achieving real-time user interactions with fish swarms. With all the proposed techniques integrated in a system, the experimental results show that our method is feasible and effective.},

Preprocessing step involves image segmentation for background elimination, de-noising and image enhancement. A combination of color, local binary pattern (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and wavelet features forms the feature vector. An ensemble feature reduction technique is used to reduce the attribute size. Performances of the system using combined as well as reduced feature sets are evaluated using seven popular classifiers. Among the classifiers, wavelet kernel extreme learning machine (ELM) showed higher classification accuracy of 96.65% in genus level and polynomial kernel ELM showed an accuracy of 92.42% in species level with the reduced feature set.},

Emotional speech recognition is an important research field in the human–computer interaction. Ultimately, the endowing machines that perceive the users’ emotions will enable a more intuitive and reliable interaction.The researchers presented many models to recognize the human emotion from the speech. One of the famous models is the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Nevertheless, GMM may sometimes have one or more of its components as ill-conditioned or singular covariance matrices when the number of features is high and some features are correlated. In this research, a new system based on a weighted distance optimization (WDO) has been developed for recognizing the emotional speech. The main purpose of the WDO system (WDOS) is to address the GMM shortcomings and increase the recognition accuracy. We found that WDOS has achieved considerable success through a comparative study of all emotional states and the individual emotional state characteristics. WDOS has a superior performance accuracy of 86.03% for the Japanese language. It improves the Japanese emotion recognition accuracy by 18.43% compared with GMM and k -mean.},

Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model, which relies on building visual vocabulary, has been widely used in this area. Recently, attention has been shifted to the use of advanced architectures which are characterized by multi-level processing. Hierarchical Max-Pooling (HMAX) model has attracted a great deal of attention in image classification. To improve image classification and annotation, several approaches based on ontologies have been proposed. However, image classification and annotation remain a challenging problem due to many related issues like the problem of ambiguity between classes. This problem can affect the quality of both classification and annotation results. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based image classification and annotation approach. Our contributions consist of the following: (1) exploiting ontological relationships between classes during both image classification and annotation processes; (2) combining the outputs of hypernym–hyponym classifiers to lead to a better discrimination between classes; and (3) annotating images by combining hypernym and hyponym classification results in order to improve image annotation and to reduce the ambiguous and inconsistent annotations. The aim is to improve image classification and annotation by using ontologies. Several strategies have been experimented, and the obtained results have shown that our proposal improves image classification and annotation.},

  abstract     = {Cuttings are likely to accumulate and eventually form a cuttings bed in the highly-deviated section, which usually lead to high friction and torque, slower rate of penetration, pipe stuck and other problems. It is therefore necessary to study cuttings transport mechanism and improve hole cleaning efficiency. In this study, the cuttings-transport behaviors with pipe rotation under turbulent flow conditions in the highly deviated eccentric section were numerically simulated based on Euler solid–fluid model and Realizable k – ε model. The resulted numerical results were compared with available experimental data in reported literature to validate the algorithm, and good agreement was found. Under the conditions of drill string rotation, cuttings bed surface tilts in the direction of rotation and distributes asymmetrically in annulus. Drill string rotation, drilling fluid flow rate, cuttings diameter, cuttings injection concentration and drilling fluid viscosity affect the axial velocity of drilling fluid; whereas drilling fluid tangential velocity is mainly controlled by the rotational speed of drill string. Increase in value of drill string rotation, drilling fluid flow rate or hole inclination will increase cuttings migration velocity. Notably, drill string rotation reduces cuttings concentration and solid–fluid pressure loss, and their variations are dependent on inclination, cuttings injection concentration, cuttings diameter, drilling fluid velocity and viscosity. However, when a critical rotation speed is reached, no additional contribution is observed. The results can provide theoretical support for optimizing hole cleaning and realizing safety drilling of horizontal wells and extended reach wells.},

The studies of the KG completion are rich, but less attention has been paid to the methods of the KG error correction. The correction methods are divided into embedding and nonembedding methods. Embedding correction methods have been recently introduced in which a KG is embedded into a vector space. Also, existing correction approaches focused on the recognition of the three types of errors, the outliers, inconsistencies and erroneous relations. One of the challenges is that most outlier correction methods can recognize only numeric outlier entities by nonembedding methods. On the other hand, inconsistency errors are recognized during the knowledge extraction step and existing methods of this field do not pay attention to the recognition of these errors as post-correction by embedding methods. Also, to correct erroneous relations, new embedding techniques have not been used. Since the errors of a KG are variant and there is no method to cover all of them, a new general correction method is proposed in this paper. This method is called correction tower in which these three error types are corrected in three trays. In this correction tower, a new configuration will be suggested to solve the above challenges. For this aim, a new embedding method is proposed for each tray. Finally, the evaluation results show that the proposed correction tower can improve the KG error correction methods and proposed configuration can outperform previous results.},

In the mobile device, the ECG signals can be stored, displayed on screen, and automatically transmitted to a distant server unit over the internet; the server stores ECG data from several patients. Health care stakeholders use a monitoring unit to retrieve the ECG signals of multiple patients at any time from the server for display and real-time automatic analysis. The analysis includes segmentation of the ECG signal into separate heartbeats followed by arrhythmia detection and classification. When compared to existing real-time ECG systems, where the detection of abnormalities is usually performed using simple rules, the proposed system implements a real-time classification module that is based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Extensive experimental results on ECG data obtained from a TechPatient TM simulator, a real person, and 20 records from the MIT arrhythmia database are reported and discussed.},

Because of its introduction of mutation operator, this algorithm overcomes the problem where by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm easily falls into local optimal value, with a low calculation accuracy. At the same time, the distribution and diversity of particles in the sampling process are improved through the mutation operation. The defect of particle filter (PF) algorithm where the particles are poor and the utilization rate is not high is also solved. The mutation control function makes the particle set optimization process happen in the early and late stages, and improves the convergence speed of the particle set, which greatly reduces the running time of the whole algorithm. Simulation experiments show that compared with PF and PSO-PF algorithms, the proposed NPSO-PF algorithm has lower root mean square error, shorter running time, higher signal-to-noise ratio and more stable filtering performance. It is proved that the algorithm is suitable for real-time filtering and noise reduction processing of nonlinear signals.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the accuracy of human action recognition in video and the computational efficiency of large data sets, an action recognition algorithm based on multiple features and modified deep learning model is proposed. First, the deep network pre-training process is used to learn and optimize the RBM parameters, and the deep belief nets (DBN) model is constructed through deep learning. Then, human 13 joint points and critical points of optical flow are automatically extracted by DBN model. Second, these more abstract and more effective human motion features are combined to represent human actions. Ultimately, the entire DBN network structure is fine-tuned by support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify human actions. We demonstrate that human 13 joint points and critical points of optical flow are two very effective human action characterizations, our proposed approach greatly reduces the required samples, and shortens the training time of the samples, can efficiently process large data sets and can effectively recognize novel actions. We performed experiments on the KTH data set, Weizmann data set, the ballet data set and UCF101 data set to evaluate the proposed method, the experiment results show that the average recognition accuracy is over 98%, which validates its effectiveness, and show that our results are stable, reliable, and significantly better than the results of two state-of-the-art approaches on four different data sets. So, it lays a good theoretical foundation for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of computer technology and network technology, it has become possible to build a large-scale networked video surveillance system. The video surveillance system has become a new type of infrastructure necessary for modern cities. In this paper, the problem of foreground extraction and motion recognition in intelligent video surveillance is studied. The three key sub-problems, namely the extraction of motion foreground in video, the deblurring of motion foreground and the recognition of human motion, are studied and corresponding solutions are proposed. A background modeling technique based on video block is proposed. The background is modeled at the block level, which greatly reduces the spatial complexity of the algorithm. It solves the problem that the traditional Gaussian model (GMM) moving target enters the static state and is integrated into the background process. The target starts to move for a long time and there are ghosts and other problems, which reduce the processing efficiency of the lifting algorithm. The test results on the Weizmann dataset show that the proposed algorithm can achieve high human motion recognition accuracy and recognition with low computational complexity. The rate can reach 100%; the local constrained group sparse representation classification (LGSRC) model is used to classify it. The experimental results on Weizmann, KTH, UCF sports and other test datasets confirm the validity of the algorithm in this chapter. KNN, SRC voting classification accuracy.},

In order to solve the traffic problem, all countries are actively studying the intelligent transportation system, and one of the important research contents of the intelligent transportation system is vehicle detection. Vehicle detection based on vision is to capture vehicle images in the driving environment through a camera, and then use computer vision recognition technology for vehicle detection and recognition. Although computer vision recognition technology has made great progress, how to improve the detection accuracy of the image to be detected is still an important content of visual recognition technology research. Intelligent vehicle visual robust detection and identification of methods of research to reduce the growing incidence of traffic accidents, improve the existing road traffic safety and transportation efficiency, alleviate the degree of driver fatigue problem are of great significance. This paper considers the intelligent vehicle environmental awareness of the key technology to the goal of robust detection and recognition based on machine vision problems for further research. The particle filter is used to extract the local energy of the image to realize the fast segmentation of the region of interest (ROI). In order to further verify the ROI, a measure learning method based on multi-core embedding is proposed, and the semantic classification of ROI is realized by integrating the color, shape and geometric features of ROI. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively eliminate false sexy ROI interest, and the algorithm is robust to complex background, illumination changes, perspective changes and other conditions.},

In a correlation, you have to obtain an output plane that is as clean as possible. To measure the sharpness of the correlation peak and the cleanliness of the output plane, a performance metric called Peak to Correlation Energy (PCE) is used. In this paper, the fractional correlation is applied to recognize real phytoplankton images. This fractional correlation guarantees a higher PCE compared to the conventional correlation. The results of PCE are two-orders of magnitude higher than those obtained with the conventional correlation and manage to identify 91.23% of the images, while the conventional correlation only manages to identify 87.42% of them. This methodology was tested using images in salt and pepper or Gaussian noise, and the fractional correlation output plane always is cleaner and generates a better-defined correlation peak when compared with the classical correlation.},

But there are some deficiencies in certain issues of image recognition. For example, CNN’s recognizing performance is not good at different angles of objects and overlapping objects. Also, CNN is sometimes very sensitive to slight perturbations, modifying one pixel of a recognized image may cause recognition errors. For these problems, the capsule network (CapsNet) proposed by Geoffrey Hinton can solve the problems of traditional convolutional networks. Shortly after CapsNet was proposed, the model structure was relatively simple, and many aspects could be explored for improvement. This paper will optimize CapsNet from two aspects: “optimization of routing mechanism” and “increase Dropout operation.” And carry out experiments and results analysis on these optimizations.},

The output of the DNN model is used as the input of the Sarsa algorithm to improve the prediction performance of the target building energy consumption.

The quality of the fingerprint database construction can directly affect the positioning results. This work proposes a three-stage fingerprint database processing method. In the first stage, the original fingerprint database is divided into several small sub-fingerprint databases according to the specified rules. In the second stage, every sub-fingerprint database is processed using the principal component analysis method to achieve a reduced dimension fingerprint dataset. In the third stage, the k-d tree method is used to process each dimension-reduced sub-fingerprint database for obtaining a hierarchical sub-fingerprint database. In addition, in the online phase, the best bin first (BBF) method is applied to the search engine of sub-fingerprint database to complete the location determination of the device.

In this paper, according to the coordinate rotation transformation and neural network theory, a method for predicting the change of head posture with sight-line coordinates is proposed. First, the coordinate rotation transformation theory is used to replace the head posture change amount with the coordinate change amount, and the first-order difference value of the sight-line point coordinate is obtained by the difference method. Then, under the unified Cartesian coordinate system, the MP-MTM-LSTM neural network is established with the input information of first-order difference value and the output information of coordinate change amount. The innovation of this method is that the Cartesian coordinate change is employed instead of the Euler angle transformation. In the model verification phase, the true value of the head pose is collected by the posture meter. The experimental results show that the absolute error between the predicted value and the true value estimated by the new method is less than 15%. In the field of fatigue monitoring, the proposed method can estimate the amount of head posture change effectively, which is suitable for the case where the head center point is not fixed.},

  abstract     = {Based on big data, this paper starts from the behavior data of users on social media, and studies and explores the core issues of user modeling under personalized services. Focusing on the goal of user interest modeling, this paper proposes corresponding improvement measures for the existing interest model, which has great difference in interest description among different users and it is difficult to find the user interest change in time. For the above problems, this paper takes user-generated content and user behavior information as the analysis object, and uses natural language processing, knowledge warehouse, data fusion and other methods and techniques to numerically analyze user interest mining based on text mining and multi-source data fusion. We propose a user interest label space mapping method to avoid data sparse problem caused by too many dimensions in interest analysis. At the same time, we propose a method to extract and blend the long-term and short-term interests, and realize the comprehensive evaluation of interests. In the analysis of the big data phase, the user preference social property application preference value law, it is expected to achieve user Internet social media application preference data mining from the perspective of big data.},

The following are the results. (1) After the fractal analysis was used directly, only three geomagnetic stations in 15 geomagnetic stations showed synchronous anomalous signals; (2) After the method of this paper was used, 9 of the 15 geomagnetic stations (including the three stations in the first point) extracted two synchronous anomalous signals, and six of the nine geomagnetic stations presented additional synchronous anomalous signals. (3) Of the three abnormal signals extracted, one had a medium-term effect and two had short-term effects. (4) The anomalous duration of the Z component of nine geomagnetic stations was longer than that of H and F. And as the epicentral distance increased, duration decreased. While the proposed method could not clearly indicate the exact relationship between the anomalous signals and the earthquake, it was proved that the signals extracted are effective and well-correlative to the earthquake.},

Human behavior monitoring is the process of obtaining activity information with wearables and computer technology. In this paper, we design a data preprocessing method based on the data collected by a single three-axis accelerometer. We first use Butterworth filter as low-pass filtering to remove the noise. Then, we propose a KGA algorithm to remove abnormal data and smooth them at the same time. This method uses genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of Kalman filter. After that, we use a threshold-based method to identify falls that are harmful to the elderly. The key point of this method is to distinguish falls from people’s daily activities. According to the characteristics of human falls, we extract eigenvalues that can effectively distinguish daily activities from falls. In addition, we use cross-validation to determine the threshold of the method. The results show that in the analysis of 11 kinds of human daily activities and 15 types of falls, our method can distinguish 15 types of falls. The recognition recall rate in our method reaches 99.1%.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (person re-ID) is a challenging task which aims at spotting same persons among disjoint camera views. It has certainly generated a lot of attention in the field of computer vision, but it remains a challenging task due to the complexity of person appearances from different camera views. To solve this challenging problem, many excellent methods have been proposed, especially metric learning-based algorithms. However, most of them suffer from the problem of data imbalance. To solve this problem, in the paper we proposed a new data-balanced method and named it Enhanced Metric Learning (EML) based on adaptive asymmetric and diversity regularization for person re-ID. Metric learning is important for person re-ID because it can eliminate the negative effects caused by camera differences to a certain extent. But most metric learning approaches often neglect the problem of data imbalance caused by too many negative samples but few positive samples. And they often treat all negative samples the same as positive ones, which can lead to the loss of important information. Our approach pays different attention to the positive samples and negative ones. Firstly, we classified negative samples into three groups adaptively, and then paid different attention to them using adaptive asymmetric strategy. By treating samples differently, the proposed method can better exploit the discriminative information between positive and negative samples. Furthermore, we also proposed to impose a diversity regularizer to avoid over-fitting when the training sets are small or medium-sized. Finally, we designed a series of experiments on four challenging databases (VIPeR, PRID450S, CUHK01 and GRID), to compare with some excellent metric learning methods. Experimental results show that the rank-1 matching rate of the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art by 3.64%, 4.2%, 3.13% and 2.83% on the four databases, respectively.},

This paper proposes an analytical method based on psychological experiments introduced into task monitoring interfaces to study reactions to error factors. It uses psychological techniques to conduct experiments which evoke physiological reactions to various error factors under different sub-interfaces of the monitoring system and sub-task environments. The behavioral and eye tracking data demonstrate the association between the error factors and the information interface. Error factors arising in visual search are directly related to the layout of the task-interface, the information proximity–position, and the information features-volume. Our method opens up new approaches for design optimizations of visual information interfaces and introduces novel concepts for the introduction of interface design via error factor analysis.},

Affinity propagation (AP) is a base method to obtain clusters from a learnt dictionary, with an adaptive window selection, which are then refined using SCI-MEP to preserve the semantic components of the image. Since only the significant clusters are worked upon, the computational time drastically reduces. The flexibility of SCI-MEP allows it to be integrated with any clustering algorithm to improve its efficiency. The method is tested and verified to remove Gaussian noise, rain noise and speckle noise from images.

  abstract     = {Background subtraction is a prerequisite and often the very first step employed in several high-level and real-time computer vision applications. Several parametric and non-parametric change detection algorithms employing multiple feature spaces have been proposed to date but none has proven to be robust against all challenges that can possibly be posed in a complex real-time environment. Amongst the varied challenges posed, illumination variations, shadows, dynamic backgrounds, camouflaged and bootstrapping artifacts are some of the well-known problems. This paper presents a light-weight hybrid change detection algorithm that integrates a novel combination of RGB color space and conditional YCbCr-based XCS-LBP texture descriptors (YXCS-LBP) into a modified pixel-based background model. The conditional employment of light-weight YXCS-LBP texture features with the modified Visual background extractor (ViBe) aiming at reduction in false positives, produces outperforming results without incurring much memory and computational cost. The random and time-subsampled update strategy employed with the proposed classification procedure ensures the efficient suppression of shadows and bootstrapping artifacts along with the complete retention of long-term static objects in the foreground masks. Comprehensive performance analysis of the proposed technique on publicly available Change Detection dataset (2014 CDnet dataset) demonstrates the superiority of the proposed technique over different state-of-the-art-methods against varied challenges.},

  abstract     = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based meta-heuristic known for its simplicity, being successfully used in clustering task with interesting performance. Clustering of multi-view data sets has received increasing attention since it explores multiple sources or views of data sets aiming at improving clustering accuracy. Previous studies mainly focused on PSO-based clustering of single-view vector data, neither single- nor multi-view PSO-based clustering of relational received proper attention. This paper introduces a PSO-based approach to the fuzzy clustering of multi-view relational data, which can cluster data sets described by several dissimilarity matrices, each of them representing a particular view. In this work, ten fitness functions were considered, in which eight of them were adapted to deal with multi-view relational data and to consider the relevance weights of views. These fitness functions were compared to evaluate which best fit to cluster multi-view relational data. The performance and usefulness of the proposed approach, in comparison with previous single- and multi-view relational fuzzy clustering algorithms, are illustrated with several multi-view data sets. The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and F-measure were used to assess the quality of fuzzy partitions provided by clustering algorithms. The results have shown that the proposed methods significantly outperformed the compared algorithms in the majority of cases.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of computer technology and electronics industry, computer processing capability and image processing technology have been greatly improved, making robots based on computer processing and image processing have entered a new development in the field of navigation path recognition research. As an indispensable carrier for intelligent manufacturing and industrial development, robots are expanding their applications. The key to the successful execution of the mobile robot is to move according to the planned path and to avoid obstacles autonomously. These two points depend on the validity and accuracy of navigation path identification. At present, research on mobile robot navigation path recognition mainly uses visual navigation as the main method, which uses visual sensors to simulate human eye functions, obtains relevant information from external environment images, and processes them to realize related functions that the system needs to complete. The two major problems in visual navigation are poor recognition ability and insufficient ability to resist light source interference. The main purpose of this paper is to improve the recognition ability of mobile robot navigation path and the ability to resist light source interference. It mainly uses the K -means algorithm for visual navigation research. By simulating the acquired image and the selected color space, the results show that the average time taken to complete a path identification method is 152 ms. Under different illumination environments, the information extraction rate of mobile robot navigation path can reach 90%, and the effect of strong light on navigation path recognition is effectively reduced under strong illumination environment. The results show that the recognition of the visual navigation path of a mobile robot using the K -means algorithm is more precise than the conventional method, and it takes less time to better meet the timeliness requirements of mobile robots.},

  abstract     = {In order to better apply the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm in solving the problem of function extremum optimization, and further improve the phenomenon of low precision and slow convergence in the optimization process of algorithm, the two subpopulations CS algorithm based on mean value evaluation is proposed. On the one hand, the algorithm introduces dynamic inertia weight to adjust the lévy flight mechanism, thus dynamically constraining the moving step-size of each generation of population, so that the algorithm has certain self-adaptability. On the other hand, the algorithm changes the way of mutation in the preference random walk. First, the average fitness evaluation mechanism is used to divide the current population into two subpopulations: good and bad. Then, it adopts a directional mutation strategy for the better population, so that the individual can search purposefully. The worse population uses differential mutation mechanism of the disturbance items with the t -distribution characteristics, and makes the individual to search in the best orientation of current, so as to enhance the local search performance and accelerate the convergence rate of the algorithm. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence and time complexity of the algorithm in this paper. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm has good applicability in solving the function optimization problem, and the optimization results and convergence speed have been significantly improved in the algorithm.},

In this work, we present a probabilistic method to estimate the Resting State Networks (RSNs) using a model-based approach. More specifically, RSNs are assumed to be the result of a clustering procedure. In order to perform the clustering, a mixture of regression models are used. Furthermore, special care has been given in order to incorporate important functionalities, such as spatial and embedded sparsity enforcing properties, through the use of informative priors over the model parameters. Another interesting feature of the proposed scheme is the flexibility to handle all the brain time series at once, allowing more robust solutions. We provide comparative experimental results, using an artificial fMRI dataset and two real resting state fMRI datasets, that empirically illustrate the efficiency of the proposed regression mixture model.},

Especially in traffic blind areas, right-turning areas of vehicles, etc., traffic accidents such as vehicle collisions are extremely easy to occur, which poses a serious threat to people’s lives and property, and is extremely harmful. Therefore, related research on collision detection of people and vehicles has been traffic-safe and has received extensive attention from field researchers. At present, the research on human-vehicle collision detection is to detect human-vehicle collision accidents by tracking the track of vehicles and pedestrians, but there are problems such as poor tracking effect, low accuracy of collision discrimination and complex algorithms. Aiming at these problems, this paper studies the human-vehicle collision detection algorithm based on image processing. Through the image processing of traffic monitoring video, the vehicle and pedestrian contour information is extracted. Based on this, a mathematical model for collision detection is constructed to realize human-vehicle collision detection. The results show that the proposed method can effectively distinguish the collision between pedestrians and vehicles, and the algorithm for image processing is simpler than the traditional tracking algorithm, and the time is shorter. The results show that the image-based collision detection algorithm based on image processing can effectively and quickly identify the traffic accidents in which people and vehicles collide, and then can issue alarm signals in time, shortening the accident processing time and reducing the accident time. The possibility of a secondary accident has a high practicability in the detection of traffic accidents in which people and vehicles collide.},

Since the dark pixels in the clear remote sensing image will increase the pixel value of the dark pixels in the blurred remote sensing image due to the weighted balance with the bright pixels around it, the sparsity of the dark pixels in the blurred remote sensing image is reduced.

  abstract     = {As an important part of metal processing, welding is widely used in industrial manufacturing activities, and its application scenarios are very extensive. Due to technical limitations, the welding process always unavoidably leaves weld defects. Weld defects are extremely hazardous, and the work used must be guaranteed to be defect-free, regardless of the field. However, manual weld inspection has subjective factors such as inefficiency and easy missed detection, and although some automatic weld inspection methods have appeared, these traditional methods still do not meet actual demand in terms of detection time and detection accuracy. Therefore, there is a need for a higher quality weld image automatic detection method to replace the manual method and the traditional automatic detection method. In view of the above, this paper proposes a weld seam image recognition algorithm based on deep learning. The Adam adaptive moment estimation algorithm is chosen as the backpropagation optimization algorithm to accelerate the training of convolutional neural networks and design an independent adaptive learning rate. Through the simulation of the collected 4500 tube images, the adaptive threshold-based method is used for weld seam extraction. The algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with the weld seam recognition method based on image texture feature value distribution (ITFVD) and the SUSAN-based weld defect target detection method. The results show that the proposed method can identify weld defects in a short time on different sizes of weld images, and can further detect the type of weld defects. In addition, the method in this paper is better than the other two methods in the false detection rate, recall rate and overall recognition accuracy, which shows that the experimental results have achieved the expected results.},

In this paper, we develop an accurate prediction model based on dilated convolution — ST-MINet (Deep Spatio-Temporal Modified-Inception with Dilated convolution Networks). We fully consider the complexity, nonlinearity and uncertainly of traffic network by summarizing various network models such as ResNet and Inception. So, we use the deep space-time residual network to ensure the convolution accuracy of the information’s position distribution on the basis of existing networks. Then, we add the cavity convolution to the model, which can effectively control the field of view of the convolution kernel.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel deep learning classification technique applied on optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal images. We propose the deep neural networks based on Vgg16 pre-trained network model. The OCT retinal image dataset consists of four classes, including three most common retina diseases and one normal retina scan. Because the scale of training data is not sufficiently large, we use the transfer learning technique. Since the convolutional neural networks are sensitive to a little data change, we use data augmentation to analyze the classified results on retinal images. The input grayscale OCT scan images are converted to RGB images using colormaps. We have evaluated different types of classifiers with variant parameters in training the network architecture. Experimental results show that testing accuracy of 99.48% can be obtained as combined on all the classes.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of intelligent manufacturing and Internet technology, the industrial system has entered a new stage of development. As an indispensable carrier for intelligent manufacturing and industrial development, robots are expanding their applications. Among them, the flexible mechanical arm has the advantages of light weight, low energy consumption and low inertia compared with the bulky rigid mechanical arm, and has been increasingly valued. The flexible manipulator is a very complex dynamic system whose dynamic equations are characterized by nonlinearity, strong coupling and time-varying. Therefore, this paper uses the most common and effective method to establish the dynamic model of the flexible manipulator using the Lagrange equation. Due to the uncertain system parameters, lack of control of the trajectory and the influence of load changes and external disturbances, the flexible manipulator has great uncertainty in its control process, and the traditional control methods have not very good control effect. Based on this, this paper proposes a combination of dynamic pattern recognition theory and flexible joint manipulator intelligent control method for the two-link flexible manipulator, and uses the new GA-RBF neural network closed-loop adaptive control method to achieve high precision. Trajectory tracking ensures stability in a shorter time. The simulation results show that the intelligent joint control method based on dynamic pattern recognition has better trajectory tracking and autonomous fast recognition dynamic mode.},

Workpiece recognition is the use of machine learning, computer vision and other technologies to identify the target workpiece, and the robot intelligent capture is a higher level of operation of the workpiece recognition, which is the key to realize the intelligentization of industrial robots. Due to the complex environmental factors and the diversity of the shape and size of the objects to be grasped, the accuracy and efficiency of the workpiece recognition are not ideal at this stage, and intelligent crawling is even more difficult to talk about. Aiming at the above problems, this paper builds a crawling planning model based on the convolutional neural network and the grasping pose mapping rules. Based on the established crawling planning model, the sampling candidate grabbing algorithm is designed and the migration learning method is adopted. The pretrained convolutional neural network for image recognition on the ImageNet dataset was migrated to the capture detection task of the Carnegie Mellon dataset. Experiments show that the network model proposed in this paper performs well, and its correct crawl rate is as high as 81.27%. This is to achieve a more stable and reliable identification and intelligent crawling work.},

Finally, based on the FVC fingerprint database, their matching precision is compared for the algorithm before and after optimization.

In the conventional CRs, the communication is restricted to the secondary users (SUs) in the allocated bands causing the underutilization of the available band. Thus, with the aim to afford higher throughput and spectrum efficiency, this paper introduces the hybrid mixture model for spectrum sensing in the multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the effectiveness is evaluated based on the evaluation parameters, such as detection probability and probability of false alarm. The signal received through the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) antenna is employed for analyzing the spectral availability for which the energy and Eigen statistics of the signal is generated, which forms the input to the Hybrid mixture model. The developed Hybrid mixture model is the integration of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Whale Elephant-Herd Optimization (WEHO). The GMM is subjected to the optimal tuning using the WEHO, which is the modification of the standard Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with the Elephant-Herd Optimization (EHO). The analysis reveals that the proposed spectrum sensing model acquired the maximal detection probability and minimal false alarm probability of 99.9% and 46.4%, respectively. The proposed hybrid mixture model derives the spectrum availability and ensures the effective communication in CR without any interference.},

In order to realize the accurate classification of expression images under normal conditions, this paper proposes an expression recognition model of improved Visual Geometry Group (VGG) deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Based on the VGG-19, the model optimizes network structure and network parameters. Most expression databases are unable to train the entire network from the start due to lack of sufficient data. This paper uses migration learning techniques to overcome the shortage of image training samples. Shallow CNN, Alex-Net and improved VGG-19 deep CNN are used to train and analyze the facial expression data on the Extended Cohn–Kanade expression database, and compare the experimental results obtained. The experimental results indicate that the improved VGG-19 network model can achieve 96% accuracy in facial expression recognition, which is obviously superior to the results of other network models.},

Intelligent vehicles have the important significance of reducing traffic accidents, improving transportation capacity and broad market prospects, and can lead the future development of the automotive industry, so they have received extensive attention. In the existing intelligent vehicle system, the laser radar is a well-deserved protagonist because of its excellent speed and precision. It is an indispensable part of achieving high-precision positioning, but to some extent, the price hindering its marketization is a major factor. Compared with lidar sensors, vision sensors have the advantages of fast sampling rate, light weight, low energy consumption and low price.

However, the current vision-based intelligent vehicle environment sensing technology is also susceptible to factors such as illumination, climate and road type, resulting in insufficient accuracy and real-time performance of the algorithm. This paper takes the environment perception of intelligent vehicles as the research object, and conducts in-depth research on the existing problems in road recognition and obstacle detection algorithms, including road image vanishing point detection, road image segmentation problem, road scene based on binocular vision.

  abstract     = {Many tasks of natural language processing such as information retrieval, intelligent question answering, and machine translation require the calculation of sentence similarity. The traditional calculation methods used in the past could not solve semantic understanding problems well. First, the model structure based on Siamese lack of interaction between sentences; second, it has matching problem which contains lacking position information and only using partial matching factor based on the matching model. In this paper, a combination of word and word’s dependence is proposed to calculate the sentence similarity. This combination can extract the word features and word’s dependency features. To extract more matching features, a bi-directional multi-interaction matching sequence model is proposed by using word2vec and dependency2vec. This model obtains matching features by convolving and pooling the word-granularity (word vector, dependency vector) interaction sequences in two directions. Next, the model aggregates the bi-direction matching features. The paper evaluates the model on two tasks: paraphrase identification and natural language inference. The experimental results show that the combination of word and word’s dependence can enhance the ability of extracting matching features between two sentences. The results also show that the model with dependency can achieve higher accuracy than these models without using dependency.},

  abstract     = {Fire is one of the most common serious disasters in human society. It is a kind of burning phenomenon that is out of control in time and space. When a fire occurs, how to detect the fire quickly and remove it in the budding state has become the key content of fire control work. Outdoor fire is very common in our daily life, and once it occurs without effective and timely control, it will cause huge losses. Therefore, it is particularly important to study an intelligent alarm system for outdoor fire. Generally, fire detection technology can be divided into sensor fire detection technology and image fire detection technology. Sensor fire detection technology is low cost and easy to design, but its application field is limited. Under the interference of many factors outside, misjudgement and missed judgement will occur. Image fire detection technology can achieve certain detection function through manual design of features and classifiers, but there are still defects in the application in the actual diversified environment. With the development of neural network technology in recent years, it has made great breakthroughs in the field of image recognition. Its judgment type is obtained through a large number of data training algorithms. Because of its automatic feature extraction and classification characteristics, it can effectively adapt to the external environment. Therefore, this paper proposes an end-to-end two-stream neural network model to detect fires, uses fire video on the network to train the algorithm, and then uses the fire database to test. Compared with the existing fire detection algorithms, it is found that the proposed method has good practicability and versatility, and provides a good reference for the development of fire detection technology.},

  abstract     = {The thorniest difficulties for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) handling many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) are the inefficiency of selection operators and high computational cost. To alleviate such difficulties and simplify the MaOPs, objective reduction algorithms have been proposed to remove the redundant objectives during the search process. However, those algorithms can only be applicable to specific problems with redundant objectives. Worse still, the Pareto solutions obtained by reduced objective set may not be the Pareto solutions of the original MaOPs. In this paper, we present a novel objective grouping evolutionary algorithm (OGEA) for general MaOPs. First, by dividing original objective set into several overlapping lower-dimensional subsets in terms of interdependence correlation information, we aim to separate the MaOPs into a number of sub-problems so that each of them can be able to preserve as much dominance structure in the original objective set as possible. Subsequently, we employ the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to generate Pareto solutions. Besides, instead of nondominated sorting on the whole population, a novel dual selection mechanism is proposed to choose individuals either having high ranks in subspaces or locating sparse region in the objective space for better proximity and diversity. Finally, we compare the proposed strategy with the other two classical space partition methods on benchmark DTLZ5 (I, M), DTLZ2 and a practical engineering problem. Numerical results show the proposed objective grouping algorithm can preserve more dominance structure in original objective set and achieve better quality of Pareto solutions.},

Then, the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of various test cubes were carried out by using electrochemical workstation. The results show that the salt water can improve electric double layer capacitance in the test cubes with the same water-cement ratio, but it can reduce some other parameters such as resistance of pore solution, resistance to transfer the hydrated electron, coefficient of diffusion impedance of concreter, which shows that the chloride ions diffused into the concrete in salt water and increase the ionic concentration in pore solution and C-S-H gel. However, the phase angle index is constant whether in fresh water or salt water, which shows chloride ions cannot affect the concrete meso-structure even though they can improve the ion concentration of pore structure. For the concrete test cubes which has different water-cement ratio in salt water, with the reduction of water-cement ratio, the electric double-layer capacitance of concrete remains unchanged, which indicates when the water-cement ratio becomes smaller, the porosity becomes lower, and the internal structure of concrete becomes denser.},

The traditional data processing technology can only achieve basic functions such as data query and statistics, and cannot achieve the goal of extracting the knowledge existing in the data to predict the future trend. Therefore, along with the rapid development of database technology and the rapid improvement of computer’s computing power, data mining (DM) came into existence. Research on DM algorithms includes knowledge of various fields such as database, statistics, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. Pattern recognition mainly extracts features of known data samples. The DM algorithm using pattern recognition technology is a better method to obtain effective information from massive data, thus providing decision support, and has a good application prospect. Support vector machine (SVM) is a new pattern recognition algorithm proposed in recent years, which avoids dimension disaster by dimensioning and linearization. Based on this, this paper studies the DM algorithm based on pattern recognition, and proposes a DM algorithm based on SVM. The algorithm divides the vector of the SV set into two different types and iterates through multiple iterations to obtain a classifier that converges to the final result. Finally, through the cross-validation simulation experiment, the results show that the DM algorithm based on pattern recognition can effectively reduce the training time and solve the mining problem of massive data. The results show that the algorithm has certain rationality and feasibility.},

In this paper, the theoretical principle of displacement measurement is first presented by a combination of monocular vision and laser speckle. Then, a model between object displacement and CCVLSC (particularly, Y coordinate value) is derived. Finally, a denoising algorithm with competitive protection of contour effective points is proposed, on the basis of effects of noises coming from background and contour edge on CCVLSC. The algorithm includes ellipse fitting to laser speckle contour, calculating offsets between all contour points and the fitted eclipse, eliminating noise points with higher deviation (generally about 5% of all contour points) by using competitive strategy, ellipse refitting, and recalculating and re-eliminating until the deviation is below a specified threshold. It is shown that the algorithm can not only eliminate the fixed noise points in each round but also protect the number of effective points to the greatest extent. Finally, the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by two ways. One is an ideal data validation. It proves that the algorithm can guarantee the convergence towards the ideal center coordinate value. Another is an experimental verification. An experimental system is built up based on the relationship between object displacement and Y coordinate value of CCVLSC for obtaining relevant dada. It is shown by the comparison between predictions and experimental data that the algorithm has a better robustness and a higher accuracy of distance measurement than other typical algorithms.},

From a biological point of view, in the acquisition and processing of information, vision is much more important than hearing, touch, etc., because 70% of the human cerebral cortex is processing visual information. Therefore, advances in computer vision technology are critical to the development of artificial intelligence that is designed to allow machines to think and handle things like humans. The acquisition and processing of visual information has always been the focus of computer vision research, and it is also difficult. The main problem of traditional computer vision technology in the processing of visual information is that the extracted image features are less discriminative, the generalization ability of image features in complex background scenes is insufficient, and the recognition ability on object recognition is poor. In response to these problems, based on the visual neural mechanism, this paper establishes an appropriate computer model for the neuronal cells in the human primary visual cortex, models the recognition response mechanism of the visual ventral system, and performs image feature extraction on the training samples. And object recognition. The results show that compared with the traditional methods, the proposed method effectively improves the discrimination of image features, and the image features extracted under complex background scenes have good generalization ability. On this basis, the training samples can be effectively recognized.

First, in the pre-processing stage of bill image, denoising and graying of bill image are processed. After binarization of bill image, the tilt detection method based on Bresenham integer algorithm is used to correct the tilted bill image. Secondly, character localization and feature extraction are carried out for par characters, and the target background is separated from the interference background in order to extract the desired target characters. Finally, the improved BP neural network-based bill digit data acquisition and recognition algorithm is used to realize the classification and recognition of bill characters.

  abstract     = {In the past, most of the digital camouflage used textural features to extract the configuration features of spots in gray images, unable to effectively utilize the position relationship between color information. In order to overcome this shortcoming, a new digital camouflage pattern design model was proposed based on the model of adversarial autoencoder network. Firstly, the complexity and performance of several main color extraction algorithms were analyzed and compared, and combined with AFK-MC 2 algorithm and color similarity coefficient, a fast camouflage main color clustering method was proposed. Then a deep convolution adversarial autoencoder network was designed to extract and describe the configuration features of the spots in background pattern. In order to diffuse pixel spot and achieve the effect of spatial color blending, a morphological processing algorithm was proposed to process the generated camouflage patterns. Finally, two sets of grassland and woodland datasets were established, respectively. The influence of the number of latent variables of network on the training process was tested on the dataset, and the number of camouflage feature descriptions was determined to be greater than or equal to 10. In order to verify the effectiveness of the generated camouflage, the spots in background region and target region were randomly selected, and the Euclidean distance between the feature parameters of these spots was calculated. Both the visual and experimental results demonstrate that the generated spots have high fusion with the background.},

  abstract     = {With the improvement of our country’s economic level and quality of life, the numbers and scales of highway networks and motor vehicles are constantly expanding, which makes the current road traffic burden more and more serious. As an important means of traffic automation management, license plate recognition (LPR) technology plays an important role in traffic surveillance and control. However, the recognition rate and accuracy of the traditional license plate recognition methods still need to be improved. In the case of poor surrounding environment, it is prone to localization failure, vehicle license plate recognition errors or unrecognizable phenomena. Wavelet transform, as another landmark signal processing method after Fourier transform, has been widely used in the field of image processing. In China, the number of horizontal lines is usually larger than that of vertical lines. If the two vertical boundaries of the license plate can be detected successfully, the four angles of the license plate can be determined efficiently to complete the license plate positioning. In view of the advantages of wavelet transform technology and the characteristics of vehicle license plate, in this paper, a vehicle license plate recognition algorithm based on wavelet transform and vertical edge matching is proposed. The edge of the license plate is detected by wavelet transform technology, and then the license plate is located by vertical edge matching technology. After the location is realized, the characters are segmented by vertical projection method and the characters are recognized by improved BP neural network algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed vehicle license plate recognition algorithm based on wavelet transform and vertical edge matching performs well in algorithm performance, which provides a good reference for the development of vehicle license plate recognition system.},

  abstract     = {With the growth of massive data in the current mobile Internet, network recruitment is gradually growing into a new recruitment channel. How to effectively mine available information in the massive network recruitment data has become the technical bottleneck of current education and social supply and demand development. The renewal of talent demand information is carried out every day, which produces a large amount of text data. How to manage these talents’ demand information reasonably becomes more and more important. Artificial classification is time-consuming and laborious, which is unrealistic naturally. Therefore, using automatic text categorization technology to classify and manage this information becomes particularly important. To break through the bottleneck of this technology, a heuristic KNN text categorization algorithm based on ABC (artificial bee colony) is proposed to adjust the weight of features, and the similarity between test observation and training observation is measured by using the method of fuzzy distance measurement. Firstly, the recruitment information is segmented and feature selection and noise data elimination are carried out by using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm and AP (affinity propagation) clustering algorithm. Finally, the text information is classified by using KNN algorithm combined with heuristic search and fuzzy distance measurement. The experimental results show that this method effectively solves the problem of poor stability and low classification accuracy of traditional KNN algorithm in text categorization method for talent demand.},

  abstract     = {With the accumulation of people’s wealth and the improvement of purchasing power, more and more people are buying cars as a means of travel. Walking and cycling of the past have now become a car trip. License plate recognition technology is especially important in intelligent transportation systems. It has been widely used in large shopping malls or supermarket parking lots, highway toll stations, speeding violation supervision and other fields. However, the accuracy and efficiency of license plate image recognition are insufficient. To solve the above problems, we propose a license plate character recognition method based on local HOG and layered LBP feature fusion from the perspectives of image pre-processing, license location, characters’ segmentation and recognition. First, pre-processing the license image area by highlighting the license plate image; then, the license plate is positioned based on wavelet decomposition and brightness moment; next the tilted license plate image is corrected, the license plate frame is adjusted, and characterization is performed by using the improved projection method based on the fact that the projection of the character is a single peak or a double peak. Finally, the local HOG and hierarchical LBP feature fusion methods are used to identify the license characters. The results show that the license plate’s character recognition rate of the proposed method reaches 99.71%, and the time taken is small. This not only improves the character recognition rate, but also saves recognition time. The results show that the method has important practical significance in license plates’ recognition.},

This method uses top-hat transform to detect the high-frequency region in infrared image, and filters out the low-frequency region in the image to implement the preliminary background suppression of infrared image. Then the SUSAN algorithm is used to detect small targets in the image after background suppression. The proposed method is applied to the single infrared image which is acquired by the infrared guidance system in the process of detecting and tracking the target under specific conditions.

This paper introduces a novel robotic assistant system for prostate intervention and the system architecture and workflow are described, which is significant for the design of similar systems. In order to offer higher precision and better real-time performance, a Ultrasound (US)/Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) fusion method is proposed to guide the procedures in this study. Moreover, image registration is a key step and a hot issue in image fusion, especially in multimodal image fusion. In this work, we adopt a novel registration method based on active demons and optic flow for prostate image fusion. To verify the availability of the system, we evaluate our approach of the US/MRI image fusion by using data acquired from six patients, and root mean square error (RMSE) for anatomical landmarks is 3.15 mm. In order to verify the accuracy and validity of the system developed in this paper, a system experimental platform was built and used for bionic tissue puncture of prostate under the guidance of MR and Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) fusion images. The experimental results show that the deviations of the final actual needle points of the three target points on the bionic tissue model measured in the laboratory environment are less than 2.5 mm.},

An active spine model based on the Parallel Kinematic Mechanism (PKM) system and biological phenomena is described. The general principles involved in constructing a neural network coupled with limbs and spine to solve specific problems are discussed. A CPG mathematical model based on Hopf nonlinear oscillators produces rhythmic signal during locomotion is described, where many parameters to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired stability, often subject to vertical stability analysis. Our simulations demonstrate that active spine with setting reasonable CPG parameters can reduce unnecessary lateral displacement during trot gait, improving the stability of quadruped robot. In addition, we demonstrate that physical prototype mechanism provides a framework which shows correctness of simulation, and stability can thus be easily embodied within locomotion.},

The goal of this study was to distinguish osteoporotic cases from healthy controls on 2D bone radiograph images, using texture analysis and genetic algorithms (GAs).

The related experts can pick out the useful input features for the classifier. It however remains a difficult task and may be inefficient or even harmful as the data pattern is not clear. In this paper, GAs were used to optimize the two parameters of the co-occurrence matrix (distance parameter or pixel separation, orientation or direction) and the number of gray levels used in the preprocessing quantification step. GAs were also used to select the best combination of features extracted from GLCM and RLM matrices. Experiments were conducted on two populations composed of Osteoporotic Patients and Control Subjects. Results show that GAs combined with GLCM and BSIF features can improve the classification rates (ACC = 87.50%) obtained using GLCM (ACC = 77.8%) alone.},

Pattern recognition is essentially a branch of artificial intelligence. It has its unique role in the field of artificial intelligence. Accurate recognition of human body motion patterns in video images is of great help in image classification, retrieval, human tracking and video surveillance. Based on the human visual perception mechanism, this paper proposes a human behavior recognition algorithm based on semantic saliency map. Through the combination of sliding window and similarity measure, the behavioral region that best exhibits the semantic features of the image is found, which is the semantically significant region. The semantic significant region and the original image are used as the dual input source to study the human behavior recognition, and the image is enhanced. The utilization of significant regional information better reveals the identifiable area of the image and contributes to the recognition of human behavior.},

However, the traditional target recognition method has the characteristics of artificial design, and the generalization ability is not strong, which makes it difficult to meet the requirement of the current mass data. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new methods for feature extraction and target recognition and location in remote sensing images. Convolutional neural network in deep learning can extract representative and discriminative multi-level features of typical features from images, so it can be used for multi-target recognition of remote sensing big data in complex scenes. In this study, NWPU VHR-10 data was selected, 50% was used for training, and the remainder was used for verification. The target recognition effects of two kinds of convolutional neural network models, Faster R-CNN and SSD, were studied and compared, and the mean average precision (mAP) was used for evaluation. The evaluation results show that the Faster R-CNN has three categories with an accuracy of more than 80%, and the SSD has seven categories with an accuracy of more than 80%, all of which show good results. The SSD model is particularly prominent in running time and recognition results, which proves convolutional neural networks have broad application prospects in the target recognition of remote sensing image data.},

  abstract     = {With the economic growth of our country and the continuous improvement of people’s living standards, cars have begun to enter thousands of households and become a necessity for people. However, the rapid growth of the number of automobiles has led to a sustained increase in carbon dioxide emissions and a significant decline in urban air quality, which seriously restricts the sustainable development of cities. With the introduction of the national air quality protection policy, electric vehicles will eventually replace the existing fuel vehicles and become a new generation of transportation for people to travel. At the same time, the large expansion of the number of cars has increased the hidden dangers of traffic accidents. In order to ensure the safety of pedestrians, drivers are given a more intelligent driving environment.

  abstract     = {Smart cars are the result of the combination of the latest technological achievements in the fields of artificial intelligence, sensors, control science, computer, and network technology with the modern automobile industry. Intelligent cars usually have functions, such as automatic shifting, automatic driving, and automatic road condition recognition. The research of intelligent car technology involves many disciplines. This thesis focuses on the field of smart car visual navigation, focusing on image denoising, image information recognition, extraction, and pattern recognition control algorithms. The traditional trajectory tracking algorithm is mainly used in industrial computer or high-performance computer. The computational complexity leads to poor real-time control, and it is easily interfered by external complex terrain environment and internal disordered electromagnetic environment during vehicle driving. In general, on a regular basis, by the image analysis of the driver or the driver information, the image information is proposed using way trace processing technology, vehicle tracking control method and automatic driving rules. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed control methods and rules used to carry out automatic driving vehicle are feasible. The algorithm reduces the complexity of the algorithm, improves the real-time and stability of the control and finally achieves a good trajectory tracking effect of the car on high-speed automatic driving.},

  abstract     = {Reliable remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of industrial equipment key components is of considerable importance in condition-based maintenance to avoid catastrophic failure, promote reliability and reduce cost during the production. Diamond-coated mechanical seal is one of the most critical wearing components in petroleum chemical, nuclear power and other process industries. Estimating the RUL is of critical importance. We consider the data-driven approaches for diamond-coated mechanical seal RUL estimation based on AE sensor data, since it is difficult to construct an explicit mathematical degradation model of seal. The challenges of this work are dealing with the noisy AE sensor data and modeling the degradation process with fluctuation. Faced with these challenges, we propose a pipeline method CDF-CNN to estimate the RUL for mechanical seal: WPD-KLD to raise the signal-to-noise ratio, novel CDF-based statistics to represent seal degradation process and CNN structure to estimate RUL. To acquire AE sensor data, several diamond-coated seals are tested from new to failure in three working conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately predict the RUL of diamond-coated mechanical seal based on AE signals. The proposed prediction method can be generalized to other various mechanical assets.},

With the development and advancement of computer technology, the emergence of intelligent transportation provides a better way to solve the problem of effectively alleviating traffic pressure and reducing the incidence of traffic accidents. In recent years, intelligent traffic monitoring system, as one of the important branches in the field of intelligent transportation, has also received more and more attention. Among them, video-based moving target recognition technology involves theoretical knowledge in various fields such as artificial intelligence, image processing, pattern recognition and computer vision. It is an important means to realize “safe city” and “smart city” and a key technology for intelligent monitoring. Therefore, the research on human motion target recognition algorithm in complex traffic environment has important theoretical and practical value. In the field of intelligent traffic monitoring, the moving target detection and recognition effect of video images will have certain influence on the classification and behavior understanding of subsequent moving targets. In this paper, the commonly used moving target detection methods are studied first, and the convergence problem of the traditional Adaboost algorithm is improved. An Adaboost algorithm based on adaptive weight update is proposed, and then the support vector machine (SVM) is used. The algorithm identifies the detected moving target. Finally, through simulation experiments on the acquired video images, the results show that the proposed human motion target recognition algorithm based on adaptive weight update Adaboost and SVM has good feasibility and rationality.},

Nowadays, information systems produce streaming event logs to record their huge processes. The truncated streaming event log is a big issue in process discovery because it inflicts incomplete traces that make process discovery depict wrong processes in a process model. Earlier research suggested several methods for recovering the truncated streaming event log and none of them utilized Coupled Hidden Markov Model. This research proposes a method that combines Coupled Hidden Markov Model with Double States and the Modification of Viterbi–Backward method for recovering the truncated streaming event log. The first layer of states contains the transition probability of activities. The second layer of states uses patterns for detecting traces which have a low appearance in the event log. The experiment results showed that the proposed method recovered appropriately the truncated streaming event log. These results also have proven that the accuracies of recovered traces obtained by the proposed method are higher than those obtained by the Hidden Markov Model and the Coupled Hidden Markov Model.},

To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, we adopt a flatten function to eliminate many local optimal solutions first, and then a new filled function with one parameter is proposed, and its parameter is easy to control. Furthermore, we propose an efficient method for determining initial point of the filled function by using adaptive step size. Moreover, when some basins of the filled function are shallow ones, it will result in inefficiency of searching these basins during the minimization of the filled function. To tackle this issue and make the search for global optimal solutions much easier, we propose a strategy of basin deepening. By integrating these schemes, we propose a new efficient filled flatten function method. Numerical results indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed filled function methods.},

Among various localization techniques, the fingerprint-based method has attracted much interest due to its high accuracy and low equipment requirement. Traditional fingerprint-based indoor localization systems mostly obtain positioning by measuring the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). However, the RSSI is affected by environmental influences, thereby limiting the precision of positioning. Therefore, we propose a new indoor fingerprint localization system based on channel state information (CSI). We adopt a novel method, in which the amplitude and phase of the CSI are fused to generate fingerprints in the training phase and apply a weighted k -nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for fingerprint matching during the estimation phase. The system is validated in an exhibition hall and laboratory and we also compare the results of the proposed system with those of two CSI-based and an RSSI-based fingerprint localization systems. The results show that the proposed system achieves a minimum mean distance error of 0.85 m in the exhibition hall and 1.28 m in the laboratory, outperforming the other systems.},

It assigns consistent labeling for the same person within the field of view of the same camera or even across multiple cameras. While handcrafted feature extraction is certainly one way of approaching this problem, in many cases, these features are becoming more and more complex. Besides, training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch is difficult because it requires a large amount of labeled training data and a great deal of expertise to ensure proper convergence. This paper explores the following three main strategies for solving the person re-identification problem: (i) using handcrafted features, (ii) using transfer learning based on a pre-trained deep CNN (trained for object categorization) and (iii) training a deep CNN from scratch. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that: (1) The handcrafted features may still have favorable characteristics and benefits especially in cases where the learning database is not sufficient to train a deep network. (2) A fully trained Siamese CNN outperforms handcrafted approaches and the combination of pre-trained CNN with different re-identification processes. (3) Moreover, our experiments demonstrated that pre-trained features and handcrafted features perform equally well. These experiments have also revealed the most discriminative parts in the human body.},

  abstract     = {Information retrieval in the cloud is common and convenient. Nevertheless, privacy concerns should not be ignored as the cloud is not fully trustable. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows arbitrary operations to be performed on encrypted data, where the decryption of the result of ciphertext operation equals that of the corresponding plaintext operation. Thus, FHE schemes can be utilized for private information retrieval (PIR) on encrypted data. In the FHE scheme proposed by Ducas and Micciancio (DM), only a single homomorphic NOT AND (NAND) operation is allowed between consecutive ciphertext refreshings. Aiming at this problem, an improved FHE scheme is proposed for efficient PIR where homomorphic additions and multiplications are based on linear operations on ciphertext vectors. Theoretical analysis shows that when compared with the DM scheme, the proposed scheme allows multiple homomorphic additions and a single homomorphic multiplication to be performed. The number of allowed homomorphic additions is determined by the ratio of the ciphertext modulus to the upper bound of initial ciphertext noise. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed scheme is significantly faster than the DM scheme in the homomorphic evaluation for a series of algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The recognition rate of computer vision algorithms is highly dependent on the image quality. To enhance the visual quality of the images captured under high-dynamic range (HDR) scenes, we propose an efficient and adaptive tone mapping algorithm based on guided image filter (GIF). The HDR image is compressed adaptively according to its average luminance. Then we decompose it into a base layer and a detail layer using the guided image filter. We improve the base layer and enhance the detail layer simultaneously, and combine the two layers to get the final low-dynamic range (LDR) image. Since the parameters are linked with image statistics, they adaptively fit to various kinds of images. The objective evaluation results on HDR image sets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, the result of our algorithm can reduce the halo artifacts and preserve more detail by subjective observation.},

  abstract     = {Paraphrase identification is a natural language processing (NLP) problem that involves the determination of whether two text segments have the same meaning. Various NLP applications rely on a solution to this problem, including automatic plagiarism detection, text summarization, machine translation (MT), and question answering. The methods for identifying paraphrases found in the literature fall into two main classes: similarity-based methods and classification methods. This paper presents a critical study and an evaluation of existing methods for paraphrase identification and its application to automatic plagiarism detection. It presents the classes of paraphrase phenomena, the main methods, and the sets of features used by each particular method. All the methods and features used are discussed and enumerated in a table for easy comparison. Their performances on benchmark corpora are also discussed and compared via tables. Automatic plagiarism detection is presented as an application of paraphrase identification. The performances on benchmark corpora of existing plagiarism detection systems able to detect paraphrases are compared and discussed. The main outcome of this study is the identification of word overlap, structural representations, and MT measures as feature subsets that lead to the best performance results for support vector machines in both paraphrase identification and plagiarism detection on corpora. The performance results achieved by deep learning techniques highlight that these techniques are the most promising research direction in this field.},

The weight coefficient introduced in W-DenseNet, the current layer received all the previous layers’ feature maps with different initial weights, which can extract feature information of different layers more effectively according to tasks. According to the weight adjusted by learning, the cross-layer connection is pruned to remove the cross-layer connection with smaller weight, so as to reduce the number of cross-layer.

The algorithm uses a full cycle of post-fault currents. A Multiresolution Analysis Wavelet-based decomposition technique is used to provide a joint time frequency analysis. Extensive study is done by designing different fault classifiers using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different feature vector groups. The SVMs with different parameters are compared to show performance of SVMs in given feature space of faults. A new algorithm is proposed with Ensemble method having group of different classifiers, namely, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) and SVM. A combination of feature selection with Ensemble Classifiers is trained and tested on a wide range of fault patterns. A significant improvement in performance is obtained with different combination of features in Ensemble Classifier using subspace partition method.The proposed Ensemble Classifier provides an accuracy of 99.5%.},

The Delaunay tetrahedralization of initial sample is generated first, the initial surface mesh which is a subset of the Delaunay tetrahedralization can be achieved. A triangle is refined by inserting a new point if it is large or of bad quality. For each sample, we also check the triangles that adjoin it whether from a topological disk. If not, the largest triangle will be refined. Finally, the surface mesh is updated after a new point is inserted into the sample. The definition of mesh size function for surface mesh generation is also put in this paper. Meshing experiments of some models demonstrate that the new algorithm is advantageous in generating high quality surface mesh, the count of mesh is suitable and can well approximate the curved surface.

Based on the MOPSO algorithm, a new external archive control strategy was established by using the grid technology and Pareto-dominant ordering principle, and the learning samples were improved. The proposed GDMOPSO is compared with a group of benchmark function tests and four classical algorithms.

For the training task, powerful improvements have been proposed especially using SGD, ALS, and their parallel versions. In this paper, we focus on the prediction task and combine matrix factorization with approximate nearest neighbor search methods to improve the efficiency of top- N prediction queries. Our efforts result in a meta-algorithm, MMFNN, which can employ various common matrix factorization models, drastically improve their prediction efficiency, and still perform comparably to standard prediction approaches or sometimes even better in terms of predictive power.

So, it needs an effective image detection algorithm for us to identify recaptured images. In this paper, a new detection algorithm of the recaptured image is presented based on gray level co-occurrence matrix by analyzing the differences between the real and recaptured images. In order to analyze the differences, a new image evaluation model was put forward in this paper, which is called image variance ratio. Firstly, the algorithm proposed extracted high-frequency and low-frequency information of images by wavelet transform, based on which we calculated the relative gray level co-occurrence matrices. Secondly, the features of gray level co-occurrence matrix were extracted. At last, the recaptured image was classified by the support vector machine according to the features. The experimental results showed the algorithm proposed can not only effectively identify the recaptured image obtained from different media but also have better identification rate.},

In this work, a webpage recommendation system has been proposed by introducing Chronological Cuckoo Search (Chronological-CS) algorithm and the Laplace correction based k-Nearest Neighbor (LKNN) to retrieve the useful webpage from the interesting webpage. Initially, W-Gaston algorithm extracts the interesting subgraph from the log files and provides it to the proposed webpage recommendation system.

  abstract     = {Projective synchronization (PS) is a type of chaos synchronization where the states of slave system are scaled replicas of the states of master system. This paper studies the asymptotic projective synchronization (APS) between master–slave chaotic neural networks (NNs) with mixed time-delays and unmatched coefficients. Based on useful inequality techniques and constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, some simple criteria are derived to ensure the APS of considered networks via designing a novel adaptive feedback controller. In addition, a numerical example and its MATLAB simulations are provided to check the feasibility of the obtained results. The main innovation of our work is that we dealt with the APS problem between two different chaotic NNs, while most of the existing works only concerned with the PS of chaotic systems with the same topologies. In addition, compared with the controllers introduced in the existing papers, the designed controller in this paper does not require any knowledge about the activation functions, which can be seen as another novelty of the paper.},

Herein, for the first time to our knowledge, we present two diverse image recognition approaches for classification of fashion article images called random-forest method based on genetic algorithm (GA-RF) and Visual Geometry Group-Image Enhancement algorithm (VGG-IE) to solve classification accuracy and computation time problem. In GA-RF, the number of segmentation times and the decision trees are the key factors affecting the classification results. Improved genetic algorithm is introduced into the parameter optimization of forests to determine the optimal combination of the two parameters with minimal manual intervention. Finally, we propose six different Deep Neural Network architectures, including VGG-IE, to improve classification accuracy. The VGG-IE algorithm uses batch normalization and seven kinds training-data augmentation for ease and promotion of learning process. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method using Fashion-MNIST dataset and 70 000 pictures, Experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms for 10 categories of image recognition, our VGG algorithm has the shortest computational time when it satisfies certain classification accuracy.

  abstract     = {As a classical clustering model, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) can be the footstone of dominant machine learning methods like transfer learning. Evolving GMM is an approximation to the classical GMM under time-critical or memory-critical application scenarios. Such applications often have constraints on time-to-answer or high data volume, and raise high computation demand. A prominent approach to address the demand is GPGPU-powered computing. However, the existing evolving GMM algorithms are confronted with a dilemma between clustering accuracy and parallelism. Point-wise algorithms achieve high accuracy but exhibit limited parallelism due to point-evolutionary pattern. Block-wise algorithms tend to exhibit higher parallelism. Whereas, it is challenging to achieve high accuracy under a block-evolutionary pattern due to the fact that it is difficult to track evolving process of the mixture model in fine granularity. Consequently, the existing block-wise algorithm suffers from significant accuracy degradation, compared to its batch-mode counterpart: the standard EM algorithm. To cope with this dilemma, we focus on the accuracy issue and develop an improved block-evolutionary GMM algorithm for GPGPU-powered computing systems. Our algorithm leverages evolving history of the model to estimate the latest model order in each incremental clustering step. With this model order as a constraint, we can perform similarity test in an elastic manner. Finally, we analyze the evolving history of both mixture components and the data points, and propose our method to merge similar components. Experiments on real images show that our algorithm significantly improves accuracy of the original general purpose bock-wise algorithm. The accuracy of our algorithm is at least comparable to that of the standard EM algorithm and even outperforms the latter under certain scenarios.},

We conducted field investigations of a dozen typical underground streets in eight big cities in China with 42 test samples, and this research obtained the pavement elements’ data of underground commercial streets, built virtual 3D scenes based on orthogonal analysis and virtual reality technology of computer vision, acquired the psychological data of spatial experience through virtual reality test, and analyzed the relationship between six elements (glossiness, roughness, color, dimension, pattern, and collage of ground pavement in underground commercial streets) and spatial visual comfort based on quantitative analysis of experimental data. Results show that, “Cold–hot sensation”, “Glossiness”, and “Collage ordered degree” are chief elements for underground commercial streets’ pavement design. The pavement design featured with neutral color, medium- and large-scale and ordered collage form are the design preference and emphasis for underground commercial streets.

The process of freshness evaluation covers a scala of seven different classes corresponding to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 storage days. These seven classes are categorized according to six different classifiers in the proposed binary decision tree structure. Classifiers at each particular node of the tree are individually trained with the training dataset. To increase success in determining the level of fish freshness, one of the k -Nearest Neighbors ( k -NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Bayes methods is selected for every classifier and the feature spaces change in every node. The significance of this study among the others in the literature is that this proposed decision tree structure has never been applied to determine fish freshness before. Because the freshness of fish is observed under actual market storage conditions, the classification is more difficult. The results show that the electronic nose designed with the proposed decision tree structure is able to determine the freshness of horse mackerels with 85.71% accuracy for the test data obtained one year after the training process. Also, the performances of the proposed methods are compared against conventional methods such as Bayes, k -NN, and LDA.},

In this paper, an instance-based cost-sensitive Bayesian consistent version of exponential loss function is proposed. Using the modified loss function, the derivation of instance-based cost-sensitive extensions of AdaBoost, RealBoost and GentleBoost are developed which are termed as ICSAdaBoost, ICSRealBoost and ICSGentleBoost, respectively. In this research, a new instance-based cost generation method is proposed instead of doing this expensive process by experts. Thus, each sample takes two cost values; a class cost and a sample cost. The first cost is equally assigned to all samples of each class while the second cost is generated according to the probability of each sample within its class probability density function. Experimental results of the proposed schemes imply 12% enhancement in terms of F -measure and 13% on cost-per-sample over a variety of UCI datasets, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The significant priority of the proposed method is supported by applying the pair of T -tests to the results.},

Cybern. 46 (12) (2016) 3059–3072. However, we found that this algorithm consumes a lot of time in re-ordering data because a one-to-one comparison method is used in this process, which is the main reason that the speeding-up structure is difficult to establish when coping with much more large amount of data. To overcome these problems, this paper aims to propose an improved speeding-up AR algorithm based on group similarity and Apache Spark framework to further reduce the memory requirements and runtime.

If the uncertainty coefficient between some genes exceeds predefined thresholds, the gene nodes will be connected by directed edges. Thus, a gene network is generated, which we define as gene logical network. This method is applied to the breast cancer data including control group and experimental group, with comparisons of the 2nd-order logic type distribution, average degree as well as average path length of the networks. It is found that these structures with different networks are quite distinct. By the comparison of the degree difference between control group and experimental group, the key genes are picked up. By defining the dynamics evolution rules of state transition based on the logical regulation among the key genes in the network, the dynamic behaviors for normal breast cells and cells with cancer of different stages are simulated numerically. Some of them are highly related to the development of breast cancer through literature inquiry.

Through the optimized power inversion algorithm, the interference signal can be weakened obviously at the antenna receiving end, and the quality of the effective signal received by the antenna can be improved significantly. Afterwards, the algorithm was used to carry out MATLAB simulation in space based on the anti-jamming performance of different array models, which determined the anti-jamming antenna array structure as a uniform matrix and optimized the array structure. The simulation results show that the optimized power inversion algorithm can filter strong and weak interference better, and the anti-jamming performance is better under different array models and two kinds of interferences. Through comparative analysis, it is concluded that the four elements have the best interference suppression effect in uniform circular array structure, which provides an important reference for the selection of antenna array in adaptive interference suppression hardware structure.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose two self-adapting patch strategies, which are obtained by employing the integral projection technique on images’ edge images, while the edge images are recovered by the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. The patch strategies are equipped with the advantage of considering the single image’s unique properties and maintaining the integrity of some particular local information. Combining the self-adapting patch strategies with local binary pattern feature extraction and the classifier of the forward and backward greedy algorithms under strong sparse constraint, we propose two new face recognition methods. Experiments are run on the Georgia Tech, LFW and AR face databases. The obtained numerical results show that the new methods outperform some related patch-based methods to a larger extent.},

Because the food safety traceability system requires storing and processing of massive video data, this paper proposes to build a reliable food safety traceability system by introducing cloud storage technology into video surveillance system. Hadoop platform is built to store and process massive monitoring of video data. In addition, in order to make use of Map Reduce framework for parallel computing, this paper optimizes the traditional particle filter target tracking algorithm, and proposes using the parallel computing framework Map Reduce in Hadoop to achieve the parallel computing of all particles in particle filter. Finally, the simulation results show that when the number of videos is large, the time of parallel processing is obviously shorter than that of single-machine mode. And as the video data becomes larger and larger, the advantages of parallel processing become more and more obvious.},

  abstract     = {Railway fastener recognition and detection is an important task for railway operation safety. However, the current automatic inspection methods based on computer vision can effectively detect the intact or completely missing fasteners, but they have weaker ability to recognize the partially worn ones. In our method, we exploit the EA-HOG feature fastener image, generate two symmetrical images of original test image and turn the detection of the original test image into the detection of two symmetrical images, then integrate the two recognition results of symmetrical image to reach exact recognition of original test image. The potential advantages of the proposed method are as follows: First, we propose a simple yet efficient method to extract the fastener edge, as well as the EA-HOG feature of the fastener image. Second, the symmetry images indeed reflect some possible appearance of the fastener image which are not shown in the original images, these changes are helpful for us to judge the status of the symmetry samples based on the improved sparse representation algorithm and then obtain an exact judgment of the original test image by combining the two corresponding judgments of its symmetry images. The experiment results show that the proposed approach achieves a rather high recognition result and meets the demand of railway fastener detection.},

  abstract     = {An effective and accurate lane marking detection algorithm is a fundamental element of the intelligent vehicle system and the advanced driver assistant system, which can provide important information to ensure the vehicle runs in the lane or warn the driver in case of lane departure. However, in the complex urban environment, lane markings are always affected by illumination, shadow, rut, water, other vehicles, abandoned old lane markings and non-lane markings, etc. Meanwhile, the lane markings are weak caused by hard use over time. The dash and curve lane marking detection is also a challenge. In this paper, a new lane marking detection algorithm for urban traffic is proposed. In the low-level phase, an iterative adaptive threshold method is used for image segmentation, which is especially suitable for the blurred and weakened lane markings caused by low illumination or wear. In the middle-level phase, the algorithm clusters the candidate pixels into line segments, and the upper and lower structure is used to cluster the line segments into candidate lanes, which is more suitable for curve and dashed lane markings. In the high-level phase, we compute the highest scores to get the two optimal lane markings. The optimal strategy can exclude interference similar to lane markings. We test our algorithm on Future Challenge TSD-Lane dataset and KITTI UM dataset. The results show our algorithm can effectively detect lane markings under multiple disturbance, occlusions and sharp curves.},

The proposed method solves the problems of varying text sizes and the text being obscured in the image. Compared with the original Faster R-CNN, the multilevel Inception-ResNet network model presented in this study can extract deeper text features. The extracted feature map is further sparsely represented by Reduction B, Inception ResNet C and Avg Pool, and then is fused with text regions obtained by the text feature mapping lower layer network to acquire the exact text regions.

Traditional hydrodynamic models, which have a rigorous physical mechanism for flood routine, have been widely adopted for water level prediction of rainwater pipe network. However, with the amount of pipes increasing, both the running speed and data availability of hydrodynamic models would be decreased rapidly. To achieve a real-time prediction for the water level of the rainwater pipe network, a new framework based on a machine learning method was proposed in this paper. The spatial and temporal autocorrelation of water levels for adjacent manholes was revealed through theoretical analysis, and then a support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning model was developed, in which the water levels of adjacent manholes and rivers-near-by-outlets at the last time step were chosen as the independent variables, and then the water levels at the current time step can be computed by the proposed machine learning model with calibrated parameters. The proposed framework was applied in Fuzhou city, China. It turns out that the proposed machine learning method can forecast the water level of the rainwater pipe network with good accuracy and running speed.},

Active learning technique, in this respect, can be useful as it automatically finds only few most informative (or confusing) samples to get their class labels from the experts and those are added to the training set, which can improve the accuracy of the prediction consequently. A novel active learning technique using fuzzy-rough nearest neighbor classifier (ALFRNN) is proposed in this paper for cancer classification from microarray gene expression data. The proposed ALFRNN method is capable of dealing with the uncertainty, overlapping and indiscernibility often present in cancer subtypes (classes) of the gene expression data. The performance of the proposed method is tested using different real-life microarray gene expression cancer datasets and its performance is compared with five other state-of-the-art techniques (out of which three are active learning-based and two are traditional classification methods) in terms of percentage accuracy, precision, recall, F 1 -measures and kappa. Superiority of the proposed method over the other counterpart algorithms is established from experimental results for cancer prediction and results of the paired t -test confirm statistical significance of the results in favor of the proposed method for almost all the datasets.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition, as a research hot topic, still faces many challenges. This paper proposes a new face recognition method by fusing the advantages of fuzzy set theory, sub-image method and random sampling technique. In this method, we partition an original image into some sub-images to improve the robustness to different facial variations, and extract local features from each sub-image by using fuzzy 2D-Linear Discriminant analyzis (LDA) which makes use of the class information hidden in neighbor samples. In order to increase the diversity of component classifiers and retain as much as the structural information of the row vectors, we further randomly sample row vectors from each sub-image before performing fuzzy 2D-LDA. Experimental results on Yale A, ORL, AR and Extended Yale B face databases show its superiority to other related state-of-the-art methods on the different variations such as illumination, occlusion and facial expression. Furthermore, we analyze the diversity of our proposed method by virtue of Kappa diversity-error analyzis and frequency histogram and results show that the proposed method can construct more diverse component classifiers than other methods.},

In view of the fact that the traditional computer vision identification technology cannot meet the requirements of real-time accuracy, the TSR algorithm has been proposed on the basis of improved Lenet-5 algorithm. Firstly, we performed picture noise elimination and image enhancement on selected traffic sign images. Secondly, we used Gabor filter kernel in the convolution layer for convolution operation. In the convolution process, we added normalization layer Batch Normality (BN) after each convolution layer and reduced the data dimension. In the down-sampling layer, we replaced Sigmoid with the Relu activator. Finally, we selected the expanded GTSRB traffic sign database for the comparison experiment on the Caff platform. The experimental results showed that the proposed improved Lenet-5 network test set had the recognition accuracy of 96%, which was better than the method that combined Gabor with Support Vector Machine (SVM) in terms of recognition accuracy and real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {The most significant part of any autonomous intelligent robot is the localization module that gives the robot knowledge about its position and orientation. This knowledge assists the robot to move to the location of its desired goal and complete its task. Visual Odometry (VO) measures the displacement of the robots’ camera in consecutive frames which results in the estimation of the robot position and orientation. Deep Learning, nowadays, helps to learn rich and informative features for the problem of VO to estimate frame-by-frame camera movement. Recent Deep Learning-based VO methods train an end-by-end network to solve VO as a regression problem directly without visualizing and sensing the label of training data in the training procedure. In this paper, a new approach to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the regression problems, such as VO, is proposed. The proposed method first changes the problem to a classification problem to learn different subspaces with similar observations. After solving the classification problem, the problem converts to the original regression problem to solve using the knowledge achieved by solving the classification problem. This approach helps CNN to solve regression problem globally in a local domain learned in the classification step, and improves the performance of the regression module for approximately 10%.},

The experimental models were divided into 24-color plates and 4-color cubes printed by ProJet 860 3D printer, then impregnated according to preset parameters, at last measured by a spectrophotometer and observed using both a digital microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The results revealed that the samples manifested higher saturation and smaller chromatic aberration ( Δ E ) after postprocessing. Moreover, the brightness of the same color surface increased with the increasing soaked surface roughness. Further, reduction in surface roughness, impregnation into surface pores, and enhancement of coating transparency effectively improved the accuracy of color reproduction, which could be verified by the measured values. Finally, the chromatic aberration caused by positioning errors on different faces of the samples was optimized, and the value of Δ E for a black cube was reduced from 8.12 to 0.82, which is undetectable to human eyes.},

  abstract     = {Traditional automatic lip-reading systems generally consist of two stages: feature extraction and recognition, while the handcrafted features are empirical and cannot learn the relevance of lip movement sequence sufficiently. Recently, deep learning approaches have attracted increasing attention, especially the significant improvements of convolution neural network (CNN) applied to image classification and long short-term memory (LSTM) used in speech recognition, video processing and text analysis. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture, which integrates CNN and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for lip reading. First, we extract key frames from each isolated video clip and use five key points to locate mouth region. Then, features are extracted from raw mouth images using an eight-layer CNN. The extracted features have the characteristics of stronger robustness and fault-tolerant capability. Finally, we use BiLSTM to capture the correlation of sequential information among frame features in two directions and the softmax function to predict final recognition result. The proposed method is capable of extracting local features through convolution operations and finding hidden correlation in temporal information from lip image sequences. The evaluation results of lip-reading recognition experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms conventional approaches such as active contour model (ACM) and hidden Markov model (HMM).},

Automated defect detection and classification algorithm for categorizing the defects in the steam generator tube (SGT) of nuclear power plants using magnetic flux leakage (MFL) technique has been developed. MFL detection is one of the most prevalent methods of pipeline inspection. Comsol 4.3a, a multiphysics modeling software has been used to obtain the simulated MFL defect images. Different thresholding methods are applied to segment the defect images. Performance metrics have been computed to identify the better segmentation technique. Shape-based feature sets such as area, perimeter, equivalent diameter, roundness, bounding box, circularity ratio and eccentricity for defect have been extracted as features for defect detection and classification. A feed forward neural network has been constructed and trained using a back-propagation algorithm. The shape features extracted from Tsallis entropy-based segmented MFL images have been used as inputs for training and recognizing shapes. The proposed method with Tsallis entropy segmentation and shape-based feature set has yielded the promising results with detection accuracy of 100% and average classification accuracy of 96.11%.},

This study aims to present a novel approach of verifying an individual’s signature through offline images of handwriting. The approach proposed here relies on a global method which considers signature images as waveforms. First, image decompositions are in terms of a series of wavelet sub-bands at some specific levels. Wavelet sub-bands are then extended so as to obtain waveforms. Each waveform is quantized by two Nonlinear Dynamics Tools in order to generate feature vectors. Multi-Resolution Box-Counting (MRBC) fractal dimension algorithm as well as probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) are applied separately to signature waveforms. In the training and verification phase, we propose the one-class Gaussian process (GP) priors based on writer-independent approach. As one of the main parameters, optimal decision threshold is selected from False Accept Rate (FAR) and False Reject Rate (FRR) curves. The presented system was tested on two Persian databases (PHBC and UTSig) as well as on two Latin databases (MCYT-75 and CEDAR).

The latent structure model is a causal model from the latent parent node to the latent child node. Meanwhile, MM’s link is from latent variable parent node to observed variable child node. However, researchers should determine the initial causal order between variables based on experience when applying SEM. The main reason is that SEM does not fully construct causal models between observed variables (OVs) from big data. When the artificial causal order is contrary to the fact, the causal inference from SEM is doubtful, and the implicit causal information between the OVs cannot be extracted and utilized. This study first objectively identifies the causal order of variables using the DirectLiNGAM method widely accepted in recent years. Then traditional SEM is converted to expanded SEM (ESEM) consisting of SM, MM and observation model (OM). Finally, through model testing and debugging, ESEM with good fit with data is obtained.},
