  abstract     = {Although there is much discussion on the evaluation of the dissemination ability of sci-tech periodicals, there is no perfect evaluation method system in the existing studies, and especially the evaluation model is not operable. This paper converts the qualitative evaluation of the dissemination ability into a multi-criteria decision-making problem, and proposes a research method of sci-tech periodicals dissemination ability based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic. Firstly, this paper systematically combs the research progress of the evaluation of dissemination ability of sci-tech periodicals and multi-criteria decision-making under uncertainty. Then, a multi-criteria decision-making method based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic correlation is proposed, which fully considers the preferences of decision makers and effectively integrates the incomplete compensation hypothesis. Finally, the periodical topic planning, knowledge popularization recognition, publishing market operation ability and supporting discipline construction are selected as empirical conditions to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the model. At the same time, in order to make the empirical results more objective and scientific, the density clustering results of the questionnaire are used instead of the decision-maker membership score in the evaluation of dissemination ability. Theoretical analysis and empirical results show that the method proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the evaluation of the dissemination ability of sci-tech periodicals.},

  abstract     = {Social media conveys a reachable platform for users to share information. The inescapable practice of social media has produced remarkable volumes of social data. Social media gathers the data in both structured-unstructured and formal-informal ways as users are not concerned with the exact grammatical structure and spelling when interacting with each other by means of various social networking websites (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.). People are increasingly involved in and dependent on social media networks for data, news and opinions of other handlers on a variety of topics. The strong dependence on social media network sites contributes to enormous data generation characterized by three issues: scale, noise, and variety. Such problems also hinder social network data to be evaluated manually, resulting in the correct use of statistical analytical methods. Mining social media data can extract significant patterns that can be advantageous for consumers, users, and business. Pattern mining offers a wide variety of methods to detect valuable knowledge from huge datasets, such as patterns, trends, and rules. In this work, data was collected comprised of users’ opinions and sentiments and then processed using a significant number of pattern mining methods. The results were then further analyzed to attain meaningful information. The aim of this paper is to deliver a summary and a set of strategies for utilizing the ubiquitous pattern mining approaches, and to recognize the challenges and future research guidelines of dealing out social media data.},

Today, with the help of improved technologies at our disposal, many solutions have been found to create many intrusion detection systems. However, it is difficult to identify the perfect solution from the vast options we have available. Hence, motivated by the need of a better security system, this paper presents a survey of different published solutions that have been developed and/or researched on the topic of intrusion detection techniques during the period from 2000 to 2019, including the accuracy of the output.

  abstract     = {In a power distribution system, faults occurring can cause voltage sag that can affect critical loads connected in the power network which can cause serious effects in the oil and gas industry. The objective of this paper is to design and implement an efficient and economical dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) to compensate for voltage sag conditions in the oil and gas industry. Due to the complexity and sensitivity of loads, a short voltage sag duration can still cause severe power quality problems to the entire system. Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is a static series compensating type custom power device. The overall efficiency of the DVR largely relies on the effectiveness of the control strategy governing the switching of the inverters. It can be said that the heart of the DVR control strategy is the derivation of reference currents. This paper deals with the extraction of reference current values using a controller based on a combination of probabilistic and fuzzy set theory. The basis of the proposed controller is that Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) which is a probabilistic approach can be translated to an additive fuzzy interface system i.e. Generalized Fuzzy Model (GFM). The proposed controller (GMM-GFM) initially optimizes the membership functions using GMM and the final output is calculated using GFM in a single iteration i.e. with no recursions. In the control scheme two control loops are used: a feed-forward loop that uses the Proportional and Integral (PI) controller and the feedback loop uses GMM-GFM based controller. The controller is implemented and respective simulations are performed in the MATLAB SIMULINK environment for three-phase, three-wire distribution system with various issues. A comparative analysis is then done amongst all the three controllers which are based on the T-S, ML, and GMM-GFM modes respectively. The simulation results of this comparison rank the DVR with the GMM-GFM controller first, followed by the fuzzy logic Mamdani model and then with the fuzzy logic T-S model.},

In recent years, researchers are using the same idea to solve many problems through the so-called Monte-Carlo Tree Search family of algorithms, which provide the possibility of storing and reusing previously calculated results to improve precision in the calculation of future outcomes. However, developers and researchers working in this area tend to have to carry out software developments from scratch to use their designs or improve designs previously created by other researchers. This makes it difficult to see improvements in current algorithms as it takes a lot of hard work. This work presents JGraphs, a toolset implemented in the Java programming language that will allow researchers to avoid having to reinvent the wheel when working with Monte-Carlo Tree Search.

  abstract     = {In many practical applications, the dynamics of different quantities is reasonably well described by linear equations. In economics, such linear dynamical models are known as vector autoregressive (VAR) models. These linear models are, however, only approximate. The deviations of the actual value of each quantity from the predictions of the linear model are usually well described by normal or Student-t distributions. To complete the description of the joint distribution of all these deviations, we need to supplement these marginal distributions with the information about the corresponding copula. To describe this dependence, in the past, researchers followed the usual idea of trying copulas from several standard families: Gaussian, Student, Clayton, Frank, Gumbel, and Joe families. To get a better description, we propose to also use convex combinations of copulas from different families; such convex combinations are known as mixed copulas. On the example of the dynamics of US macroeconomic data, including GDP, unemployment, consumer price index, and the real effective exchange rate, we show that mixed copulas indeed lead to a better description of the actual data. Specifically, it turns out that the best description is obtained if we use a convex combination of Student and Frank copulas.},

  abstract     = {One of the main objectives of econometrics is to predict future values of important economics-related quantities, such as unemployment level, stock prices, currency exchange rates, etc. — and especially to predict how different possible economy-boosting measures will affect these quantities. To perform this prediction, we design a model of such effect and train it on the available data. Usually, the daily (or weekly) data are used for this training. However, economics-related quantities fluctuate all the time. So, for each moment of time (e.g., for each day) instead of a single value of the corresponding quantity, we have smallest and largest daily values — i.e., the interval range of daily values. At first glance, it may seem that using both endpoints of this interval for training will lead to more accurate predictions, but in reality, predictions become less accurate. Predictions become more accurate if we only use midpoints of the corresponding intervals. Several recent papers showed that even more accurate predictions are possible if we allow general convex combinations of the intervals’ endpoints — and select the corresponding coefficients so as to best fit the data.

The coverage probability (CP), average length (AL), and lower and upper error rates were the performance measures applied for assessing the methods through a Monte Carlo simulation. A numerical evaluation showed that BCI h -UB had much better CP and AL than the others even with a large difference between the variances and with a high proportion of zero. Finally, to illustrate the efficacy of BCI h -UB, the methods were applied to two sets of medical care costs data.},

  abstract     = {In many practical situations, it is desirable to predict binary (“yes”–“no”) decisions made by people. The traditional approach to this prediction assumes that the utility linearly depends on the corresponding parameters, and that the distribution of the difference between predicted and actual utility is symmetric — usually normal or logistic; the corresponding techniques are known as, correspondingly, probit and logit. In real life, utility often non-linearly depends on the parameters, and the corresponding distributions are asymmetric (skewed). There are techniques for dealing with non-linearity; the most widely used such technique — called kink regression — uses piece-wise linear approximations to the utility. There are also techniques that take into account the distribution’s asymmetry; usually, they are based on using special asymmetric distributions: skew-normal and skew-logistic. In this paper, we show how these two techniques to be combined to take into account both non-linearity and asymmetry. On a real-life example, we show that the new technique indeed leads to a better description of human binary decision-making.},

In the last decade, in many application areas, deep learning has shown to lead to more accurate predictions than the parametric models. Deep learning-based predictions are reasonably accurate, but not perfect. How can we achieve better accuracy? To achieve this objective, we propose to combine neural networks with parametric model: namely, to train neural networks not on the original data, but on the differences between the actual data and the predictions of the parametric model. On the example of predicting currency exchange rate, we show that this idea indeed leads to more accurate predictions.},

In practice, they provide a good estimate for the price, but the problem is that their original derivation is based on many simplifying statistical assumptions which are, in general, not valid for financial time series. The fact that these equations are effective way beyond their usual assumptions leads to a natural conclusion that there must be an alternative derivation for these equations, a derivation that does not use the usual too-strong assumptions. In this paper, we provide such a derivation in which the only substantial assumption is a natural symmetry: namely, scale-invariance of the corresponding processes. Scale-invariance also allows us to describe possible generalizations of Black-Scholes equations, generalizations that we hope will lead to even more accurate estimates for the corresponding prices.},

  abstract     = {The currently observed developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its influence on different types of industries mean that human-robot cooperation is of special importance. Various types of robots have been applied to the so-called field of Edutainment, i.e., the field that combines education with entertainment. This paper introduces a novel fuzzy-based system for a human-robot cooperative Edutainment. This co-learning system includes a brain-computer interface (BCI) ontology model and a Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)-based Reinforcement Learning Agent ( FRL-Agent ). The proposed FRL-Agent is composed of (1) a human learning agent , (2) a robotic teaching agent , (3) a Bayesian estimation agent , (4) a robotic BCI agent , (5) a fuzzy machine learning agent , and (6) a fuzzy BCI ontology . In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, the FRL-Agent is used as a robot teacher in a number of elementary schools, junior high schools, and at a university to allow robot teachers and students to learn together in the classroom. The participated students use handheld devices to indirectly or directly interact with the robot teachers to learn English. Additionally, a number of university students wear a commercial EEG device with eight electrode channels to learn English and listen to music. In the experiments, the robotic BCI agent analyzes the collected signals from the EEG device and transforms them into five physiological indices when the students are learning or listening. The Bayesian estimation agent and fuzzy machine learning agent optimize the parameters of the FRL agent and store them in the fuzzy BCI ontology. The experimental results show that the robot teachers motivate students to learn and stimulate their progress. The fuzzy machine learning agent is able to predict the five physiological indices based on the eight-channel EEG data and the trained model. In addition, we also train the model to predict the other students’ feelings based on the analyzed physiological indices and labeled feelings. The FRL agent is able to provide personalized learning content based on the developed human and robot cooperative edutainment approaches. To our knowledge, the FRL agent has not applied to the teaching fields such as elementary schools before and it opens up a promising new line of research in human and robot co-learning. In the future, we hope the FRL agent will solve such an existing problem in the classroom that the high-performing students feel the learning contents are too simple to motivate their learning or the low-performing students are unable to keep up with the learning progress to choose to give up learning.},

To characterize the fuzzy competitive allocations of the FXE-CA, we define the indifference fuzzy core of a FXE-CA as the set of all fuzzy allocations that cannot be dominated by any coalition of agents. We also propose the Mas-Colell indifference fuzzy bargaining set, in which no coalition has a justified objection at a fuzzy allocation against any other coalition. Finally, we verify that the indifference fuzzy core and the indifference fuzzy bargaining set of a FXE-CA coincide with the set of all fuzzy competitive allocations under some conditions, respectively. This indicates that the agents unanimously distribute the fuzzy competitive allocations of a FXE-CA.},

Up to now, only collaborative approaches had been proposed for Profile Expansion. However, content-based techniques can also be used. We perform a manual analysis of a movie dataset to analyze how content features behave. According to this analysis, we propose a content-based approach, which is also combined with collaborative information. Concretely, we expose the advantages and disadvantages of the combination with a popularity feature. Moreover, a comparison to pure collaborative approaches is performed. Our approach is evaluated in a new system situation. That is, not only the active user has few ratings, but also most of the users. The results show that content-based information is useful for rating prediction. In addition, recommendations are less personalized as popularity feature acquires more relevance for item selection.},

The common sequential rules present the relationship between unordered itemsets in which all the items in the antecedent part have to appear before the ones in the consequent part. All existing algorithms for mining common sequential rules can not apply to quantitative sequence databases. Furthermore, the common sequential rules found so far did not yet reveal the time gap about the apperance of itemsets in its antecedent and consequent parts. The purpose of this article is to overcome the two disadvantages mentioned above. Specifically, the article proposes an algorithm called IFERMiner to discover common sequential rules in quantitative sequence databases, where the time gap about appearance of two attribute sets in its antecedent and consequent parts is taken account. This algorithm was developed from the ERMiner algorithm that is the most efficient algorithm to discover common sequential rules in transactional sequence databases now. The computational complexity of the IFERMiner algorithm is also shown in the article and it is polynomial. The FCSI rules found out by the IFERMiner algorithm are useful for marketing domain and market analysis.},

The criteria evaluations are measured by using the likelihood of satisfying the targets of criteria. To aggregate the target-oriented criteria evaluations, the target-oriented OWA operator is firstly introduced, in which the target-oriented criteria evaluations are reordered and then aggregated by using the weight vector associated with the position of criteria evaluations. Four types of targets about criteria evaluations and four types of attitudinal characters about criteria weight vector are introduced, based on which, models are given to identify the potential best alternative(s), and estimate the ranges of attitudinal characters about criteria weight vector for each potential best alternative. The proposed models can not only analyze the sensitivity of each potential best alternative, but also can explore the impact of targets about criteria evaluations and attitudinal characters about criteria weight vector on the decision results. Models are further established to find the best and worst ranking orders of each alternative based on targets about criteria evaluations, and give decision analysis by considering specific ranking orders of alternatives. The proposed method considers the targets about criteria evaluations and attitudinal character about criteria weight vector at the same time and can provide decision makers more choices. Several examples are given to illustrate the proposed methods.},

This combination of the typical characteristics of investment on the capital market can be addressed by means of fuzzy multi-attribute decision making methods. These methods effectively quantify the vague elements by using fuzzy numbers. However, the applicability of a relevant method sufficiently depends on the actual investment decision making problem. This article focuses on open unit trusts because this market is recently becoming more popular in the Czech Republic. Unfortunately, under all the practical and theoretical specifics of this type of investment, there is no known evaluation method that can satisfactorily solved this problem. Therefore, the main aim of this article is to propose a novel fuzzy multi-attribute decision making method that works for all investment conditions. Its algorithm is inspired by some principles of the outranking methods. The evaluation of open unit trusts offered by the Česká spořitelna, clearly demonstrates all of the benefits of the proposed concept compared to the existing methods.},

This method shows some significant advantages in the simplicity with a less requirement of comparison data and reliability with better consistency. This paper proposes a new consistency measure method based on the distance of the vectors of reference comparisons in BWM because the difference of the preference in two vectors directly affects the reliability of results. Through the establishment of the threshold of consistency ratio, we supplement the definition of satisfactory consistency of the comparisons in BWM. With comparisons satisfying the acceptable consistency, we use linear programming models to find all possible priority weights between the preferences given by decision maker and derive interval weights. For comparisons with unacceptable consistency, another approach is presented to find the interval weights meeting the consistent requirement. At last, several examples are used to illustrate the details of process.},

The recent introduction of modal intervals helps to overcome those limitations. In this paper, we apply modal intervals to the field of probability, including properties and axioms that form a theoretical framework applied to the Markovian analysis of Bonus-Malus systems in car insurance. We assume that the number of claims is a Poisson distribution and in order to include uncertainty in the model, the claim frequency is defined as a modal interval; therefore, the transition probabilities are modal interval probabilities. Finally, the model is exemplified through application to two different types of Bonus-Malus systems, and the attainment of uncertain long-run premiums expressed as modal intervals.},

This is a hard problem which can be solved by a deletion algorithm with max marginalization, having a complexity similar to the one of computing conditional probabilities. When this approach is unfeasible, an alternative is to carry out an approximate deletion algorithm, which can be used to guide the search of the most probable explanation, by using A * or branch and bound (the approximate+search approach). The most common approximation procedure has been the mini-bucket approach. In this paper it is shown that the use of probability trees as representation of potentials with a pruning of branches with similar values can improve the performance of this procedure. This is corroborated with an experimental study in which computation times are compared using randomly generated and benchmark Bayesian networks from UAI competitions.},

So this paper explores the Chapman-Richards growth model which is one of the widely used growth models with imprecise observations under the framework of uncertainty theory. The least squares estimates of unknown parameters in this model are given. Moreover, cross-validation with imprecise observations is proposed. Furthermore, estimates of the expected value and variance of the uncertain error using residuals are given. In addition, ways to predict the value of response variable with new observed values of predictor variables are discussed. Finally, a numerical example illustrates our approach.},

  abstract     = {Over the years, the literature on individual data anonymization has burgeoned in many directions. While such diversity should be praised, it does not come without some difficulties. Currently, the task of selecting the optimal analytical environment is complicated by the multitude of available choices and the fact that the performance of any method is generally dependent of the data properties. In light of these issues, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, based on recent insights from the literature and inspired by cryptography, it proposes a new anonymization method that shows that the task of anonymization can ultimately rely only on ranks permutations. As a result, the method offers a new way to practice data anonymization by performing it ex-ante and independently of the distributional features of the data instead of being engaged, as it is currently the case in the literature, in several ex-post evaluations and iterations to reach the protection and information properties sought after. Second, the method establishes a conceptual connection across the field, as it can mimic all the currently existing tools. To make the method operational, this paper proposes also the introduction of permutation menus in data anonymization, where recently developed universal measures of disclosure risk and information loss are used ex-ante for the calibration of permutation keys. To justify the relevance of their uses, a theoretical characterization of these measures is also proposed.},

The fuzzy c partitions concept is embedded into the change-point regression model so the fuzzy c-regressions and fuzzy c-means clustering can be employed to obtain the estimates of change-points and regression parameters. The M estimation with a robust criterion is used to make the estimators robust to the presence of outliers and heavy-tailed distributions. We create two robust algorithms named FCH and FCT by using Huber’s and Tukey’s functions as the robust criterion respectively. Extensive experiments with numerical and real examples are provided for demonstrating the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show the proposed algorithms are resistant to atypical observations and outperform the existing methods. The proposed FCH and FCT are generally comparable but FCT performs better in the presence of extremely high leverage outliers and heavy-tailed distributions. Real data applications show the practical usefulness of the proposed method.},

Sentiment analysis has become an increasingly important natural language processing (NLP) task to help users make sense of what is happening in the Internet blogosphere and it can be useful for companies as well as public organizations. However, most existing sentiment analysis techniques are only able to analyze data at the aggregate level, merely providing a binary classification (positive vs. negative), and are not able to generate finer characterizations of sentiments as well as emotions involved. This paper describes a new opinion analysis scheme, i.e., a multi-level fine-scaled sentiment sensing with ambivalence handling. The ambivalence handler is presented in detail along with the strength-level tune parameters for analyzing the strength and the fine-scale of both positive or negative sentiments. It is capable of drilling deeper into text in order to reveal multi-level fine-scaled sentiments as well as different types of emotions.},

  abstract     = {Within the field of supervised classification, the naïve Bayes (NB) classifier is a very simple and fast classification method that obtains good results, being even comparable with much more complex models. It has been proved that the NB model is strongly dependent on the estimation of conditional probabilities. In the literature, it had been shown that the classical and Laplace estimations of probabilities have some drawbacks and it was proposed a NB model that takes into account the a priori probabilities in order to estimate the conditional probabilities, which was called m -probability-estimation. With a very scarce experimentation, this approximation based on m -probability-estimation demonstrated to provide better results than NB with classical and Laplace estimations of probabilities. In this research, a new naïve Bayes variation is proposed, which is based on the m -probability-estimation version and takes into account imprecise probabilities in order to calculate the a priori probabilities. An exhaustive experimental research is carried out, with a large number of data sets and different levels of class noise. From this experimentation, we can conclude that the proposed NB model and the m -probability-estimation approach provide better results than NB with classical and Laplace estimation of probabilities. It will be also shown that the proposed NB implies an improvement over the m -probability-estimation model, especially when there is some class noise.},

The proposed vectorized KFCM (VKFM) algorithm maps the input (crisp or non-crisp) features to crisp ones and applies the KFCM (with prototypes in feature space) on them. Finally the resulted crisp prototypes in the mapped space are influenced by an inverse mapping to obtain the prototypes’ (centers’) parameters in the input features space. The performance of the proposed method has been compared with the conventional FCM and KFCM and other new methods, to show its effectiveness in clustering of gene expression data and segmentation of land-cover using satellite images. Simulation results show good accuracy of proposed method in compare to other methods.},

  abstract     = {Interval type-2 fuzzy sets provide us with additional degrees of freedom to represent the uncertainty and the fuzziness of the real word than traditional type-1 fuzzy sets. Interval type-2 fuzzy numbers ranking has an important role in the decision making analysis. In this paper, the probatilistic mean value and variance of interval type-2 fuzzy numbers are proposed based on the Mellin transform for type-1 fuzzy numbers. The interval type-2 fuzzy number with the higher mean is ranked higher. If the mean values are equal the one with the smaller variance is judged higher rank. On this basis, some new distance measures and possibility degree formula are proposed to comparing interval type-2 fuzzy numbers based on their Mellin mean value and variance. Some benchmarking numerical examples are given, and some interpretation issues are explained.},

  abstract     = {The problem of belief change is considered as a major issue in managing the dynamics of an information system. It consists in modifying an uncertainty distribution, representing agents’ beliefs, in the light of a new information. In this paper, we focus on the so-called multiple iterated belief revision or C-revision, proposed for conditioning or revising uncertain distributions under uncertain inputs. Uncertainty distributions are represented in terms of ordinal conditional functions. We will use prioritized or weighted knowledge bases as a compact representation of uncertainty distributions. The input information leading to a revision of an uncertainty distribution is also represented by a set of consistent weighted formulas. This paper shows that C-revision, defined at a semantic level using ordinal conditional functions, has a very natural representation using weighted knowledge bases. We propose simple syntactic methods for revising weighted knowledge bases, that are semantically meaningful in the frameworks of possibility theory and ordinal conditional functions. In particular, we show that the space complexity of the proposed syntactic C-revision is linear with respect to the size of initial weighted knowledge bases.},

  abstract     = {Trade-off problems concentrate on balancing the main parameters of a project as completion time, total cost and quality of activities. In this study, the problem of project time-cost-quality trade-off is formulated and solved from a new standpoint. For this purpose, completion time and crash cost of project are illustrated as fuzzy goals, also the dependency of implementing time of each activity and its execution-quality is described by a fuzzy number. The overall quality of the project execution is defined as the minimum execution-quality of the project activities that should be maximized. Based on some real assumptions, a three-objective programming problem associated with the time-cost-quality trade-off problem is formulated; then with the aim of identifying a fair and appropriate trade-off, the research problem is reformulated as a single objective linear programming by utilizing a fuzzy decision-making methodology. Generating a final preferred solution, rather than a set of Pareto optimal solutions, and having a reasonable interpretation are two most important advantages of the proposed approach. To explain the practical performance of the proposed models and approach, a time-cost-quality trade-off problem for a project with real data is solved and analyzed.},

Some common goodness-of-fit criteria are also used to examine the performance of the proposed regression model. The potential application of the proposed method are illustrated and compared with the intuitionistic partial logistic regression model through two numerical examples.

Previous work converts such problems to classical (linear) optimisation problems and eliminates uncertainty by converting the linear programming under uncertainty problem to a decision problem using imprecise probability and imprecise decision theory. Our aim here is to generalise this approach numerically and present three methods to calculate the solution. We investigate what numerical results can be obtained for interval and fuzzy types of uncertainty models and compare them to classical probabilistic cases — for two different optimality criteria: maximinity and maximality. We also provide an efficient method to calculate the maximal solutions in the fuzzy set model. A numerical example is considered for illustration of the results.},

In this paper, we introduce the system of reasoning based on a fine-grained, hyperintensional analysis. To this end we apply Tichy’s Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL) with its procedural semantics. TIL is a higher-order, hyperintensional logic of partial functions, in particular apt for a fine-grained natural-language analysis. Within TIL we recognise three kinds of context, namely extensional, intensional and hyperintensional, in which a particular natural-language term, or rather its meaning, can occur. Having defined the three kinds of context and implemented an algorithm of context recognition, we are in a position to develop and implement an extensional logic of hyperintensions with the inference machine that should neither over-infer nor under-infer.},

  abstract     = {The fuzzy linear assignment problem (FLAP) is an extension of the classical linear assignment problem (LAP) to situations in which uncertainty in the cost coefficients is represented by fuzzy numbers. FLAP applications range from the assignment of workers to tasks to multiple-criteria decision analysis in fuzzy environments and many other engineering applications. Most FLAP formulations assume that all cost coefficients are fuzzy numbers of the same type ( e.g . triangular, trapezoidal). The standard solution approach is the defuzzification of the cost coefficients, thus transforming the FLAP into a crisp LAP that can be solved by classical assignment algorithms such as the Hungarian method. It is known that defuzzification methods suffer from lack of discrimination when comparing fuzzy numbers which may lead to suboptimal assignments. The solution approach proposed in this paper is based on the theory of algebraic assignment problems and total orderings in the set of all fuzzy numbers, and it allows to solve FLAPs with different types of fuzzy numbers. More specifically, the FLAP is transformed into a lexicographic linear assignment problem (LLAP) which is solved in its place. We show, both theoretically and numerically, how this transformation overcomes the limitations present in existing approaches.},

Promisingly, the confidentiality of data is ensured against the data mining methods. The ultimate goal of this paper is to build an effective sanitization algorithm for hiding the sensitive rules given by users/experts. Meanwhile, this paper concentrates on minimizing the four sanitization research challenges namely, rate of hiding failure, rate of Information loss, rate of false rule generation and degree of modification. Moreover, this paper proposes a heuristic optimization algorithm named Self-Adaptive Firefly (SAFF) algorithm to generate the small length key for data sanitization and also to adopt lossless data sanitization and restoration. The generated optimized key is used for both data sanitation as well as the data restoration process. The proposed SAFF-based algorithm is compared and examined against the other existing sanitizing algorithms like Fire Fly (FF), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) algorithms and the results have shown the excellent performance of proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm is implemented in JAVA. The data set used are Chess, Retail, T10, and T40.},

The knowledge structure of a given tolerance knowledge base is first introduced by means of set vectors. Then, the dependence and independence between knowledge structures of tolerance knowledge bases are depicted. Next, the measurement uncertainty of tolerance knowledge bases is investigated. Finally, to obtain two tolerance knowledge bases with additional data, two information systems from the UCI Repository of machine learning databases are selected to construct two numerical experiments, and an effectiveness analysis is performed from the perspective of statistics to show the feasibility of the proposed measures.},

  abstract     = {Out of several generalizations of fuzzy set theory for various objectives, the notions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) is very useful in modeling real life problems. In existing fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) models, the inputs and outputs are limited to fuzzy input and fuzzy output data. In real life problems, the input data and output data can be considered as linguistic/vague characterized by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). So, in the present study, we extend FDEA to intuitionistic FDEA (IFDEA) in which the input and output data are taken as IFNs, in particular triangular IFNs (TIFNs). In this study, we develop models to measure the efficiencies of each DMU in intuitionistic fuzzy environment using α and β -cuts and we get IF interval efficiencies. The ranking of FNs has been studied by many authors and extended to IFNs because of its applicability in real life problems. The ranking of IF interval efficiency plays an important role in DEA where the interval analysis is essential. Further, in this paper a new method for ranking IF interval efficiencies has been proposed and compared with other existing methods. A new general minimax approach is proposed to compare and rank the IF efficiency intervals of DMUs. One numerical example is provided to show the applications of the proposed IFDEA model and the proposed ranking approach. Moreover, we present an application of the proposed approach to the public health sector.},

The regression function is based on Dombi’s Kappa function, which is well known in fuzzy theory. Here, we discuss how the Kappa function relates to the Logistic function as well as how it can be used to approximate the Logistic function. We introduce the so-called Generalized Kappa Differential Equation and show that both the Kappa and the Logistic functions can be derived from it. Kappa regression, like binary Logistic regression, models the conditional probability of the event that a dichotomous random variable takes a particular value at a given value of an explanatory variable. This new regression method may be viewed as an alternative to binary Logistic regression, but while in binary Logistic regression the explanatory variable is defined over the entire Euclidean space, in the Kappa regression model the predictor variable is defined over a bounded subset of the Euclidean space. We will also show that asymptotic Kappa regression is Logistic regression. The advantages of this novel method are demonstrated by means of an example, and afterwards some implications are discussed.},

In this work, two experiments are conducted using four binary classification datasets related to medical domain. The feasible number of hidden neurons is found from the first experiment using relevant performance parameters. In the second experiment, the classifier with feasible number of hidden neurons is further evaluated with the ten-fold cross-validation method based on its computation time and classification accuracy. In both the experiments, the proposed classifier performance compared with that of other four similar hybrid approaches. It is also statistically compared using Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed rank test based on the area under curve and accuracy values respectively.

This EEG based recognition is normally an effective model for many of the real-time applications, especially for disabled people. A number of researchers are in progress to make the recognition model more effective in terms of accurate emotion recognition. However, it is not so satisfactory in the precise accurate progressing. Hence this paper intends to recognize the human emotional states or affects through EEG signals by adopting advanced features and classifier models. In the first stage of recognition procedure, this paper exploits 2501 (EMCD) and Wavelet Transformation to represent the EEG signal in low dimension as well as descriptive. By EMCD, the EEG redundancy can be neglected, and the significant information can be extracted. The classification processes using the extracted features with the aid of a classifier named Deep Belief Network (DBN). The performance of the proposed Wavelet-EMCD (WE) approach is analyzed in terms of measures such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, False positive rate (FPR), False negative rate (FNR), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), False Discovery Rate (FDR), F1Score and Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) and proven the superiority of proposed work in recognizing the emotions more accurately.},

  abstract     = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a mathematical programming approach with widespread applications in productivity and efficiency analysis. Compared with traditional DEA models, two-stage DEA models show the performance of each process and make available more information for decision making. In an article by Kao and Liu, models were proposed for combining a two-stage process to achieve overall fuzzy efficiency measures. Their method follows the simple geometric average approach and uses the product of two efficiencies. The present article applies a different angle for efficiency analysis in the two-stage fuzzy DEA. We suggest that the overall efficiency score of a decision-making unit (DMU) is defined as total weight of stage efficiencies, not as the simple product of their efficiency. Moreover, the proposed fuzzy DEA models are different from the model by Kao and Liu for fuzzy data in that our models are linear without the need for additional changes in variables and use the same set of constraints to measure the efficiency of DMUs with fuzzy input and output data. While the models by Kao and Liu are a nonlinear optimization problem that need additional changes in variables, and use different sets of constraints to measure fuzzy efficiencies. Additionally, our proposed approach evaluates the performance of DMUs from both optimistic and pessimistic viewpoints. Finally, using the proposed approach, the Taiwanese non-life insurance company problem will be investigated.},

The algorithm addresses the high computational complexity of solving large Dec-POMDPs by generating a compact fuzzy rule-base for each agent. In our method, each agent uses its own fuzzy rule-base to make the decisions. The fuzzy rules in these rule-bases are incrementally created and tuned according to experiences of the agents. Reinforcement learning is used to tune the behavior of each agent in such a way that maximum global reward is achieved. In addition, we propose a method to construct the initial rule-base for each agent using the solution of the underlying MDP. This drastically improves the performance of the algorithm in comparison with random initialization of the rule-base. We assess the performance of our proposed method using several benchmark problems in comparison with some state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves better or similar reward when compared with other methods. However, from the runtime point of view, our method is superior to all previous methods. Using a compact fuzzy rule-base not only decreases the amount of memory used but also significantly speeds up the learning phase.},

  abstract     = {As web-based social network allows anyone to post the content without any restriction, the trustworthiness of the content creator plays an important role before using the content. An effiective way to find the trustworthiness is, by analyzing the web resources related to the content creator. Therefore the trustworthiness is assessed using the provenance based ontological model called W7 model. Since it is a real time data, the computed trust for each reviewer using the ontological model is uncertain and vague. An appropriate way to classify such data is using the fuzzy logic with gradual trust level. As the computed trust data are feature-based and non-symbolic, the classification ambiguity need to be reduced greatly. This is achieved with the fuzzy decision tree approach, which is a fusion of fuzzy sets with decision tree. The truth of the rule is crucial in trustworthy user classification, as highly truthful rules really increase the credibility of the user in their domain. Therefore, in the proposed model, degree of truth is used as a pruning criteria that classifies the users with minimum number of fuzzy evidence or knowledge. This paper proposes a semantic provenance based gradual trust model to classify the trustworthy reviewers in a book-based social networks using fuzzy decision tree approach. Performance analysis of the proposed model in the terms of classifier accuracy, precision, recall, the number of rules generated and its time complexity are discussed. The analysis shows that the proposed learning model outperforms other classification models. This method is also applied to other data sets and the performance of the classifier is assessed.},

Model1 centers on the improvement of quality. The optimal attribute values are obtained as the first item of a classification rule from both the items and their complements. While in Model2, quantity is taken into consideration, so it constructs two candidate sets and uses the one-versus-many strategy to generate several rules at one time. The experiment results demonstrate that CMCM can achieve higher classification accuracy than the proposed classification approaches. CMCM can extract sufficient high-quality rules for imbalanced data. Meanwhile, it can also obtain sufficient latent information for classification.},

Generally, Online Social Media Sites (OSMS) is used with the intention of developing and categorizing illegal behavior in social networking. Therefore, we decided to identify the malicious consumer nodes by the help of ANN through evaluating the response of the chat discussion/remark situation. At last, the ‘Protégé’ tool is used to illustrate the exchange of messages from the distrustful node for upcoming large-scale indication. The anticipated method is executed in the functioning platform of JAVA among Big Data Analytics with Hadoop.},
