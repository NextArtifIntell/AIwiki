  abstract     = {The genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most common solutions to solve many optimisation problems. Its distributed version, Island Model GA (IMGA), was introduced to overcome more complex and scalable cases. However, there is a recurrent problem in IMGA called premature convergence as a consequence of selection in the migration. This process is a mechanism of migrating individuals from one into another island to keep population diversity. The primary cause is the structural similarity of a migrated individual because of the genetic operator configurations are identical. Localised IMGA (LIMGA) tries to implement different island characteristics to avoid premature convergence. The main motivation of this paper is to investigate the performance of LIMGA capability in maintaining population diversity. In detail, the contributions of this research are (1) to prove LIMGA concept in handling general optimisation problem, (2) to analyse the performance LIMGA in diversity preservation, and (3) compare LIMGA performance with the current solvers. By harmonising three different GA cores, LIMGA could overcome computationally expensive functions with a great result and acceptable execution time. Moreover, because of its success in maintaining the diversity, Localised Island Model Genetic Algorithm (LIMGA) could lead to the among other current solvers for this case.},

The usefulness of knowledge representation (KR) schemes and availability of advisors at different layers is exploited through this model. Two main aspects are addressed: a. the importance of having abstract high-level information to the IRL framework in terms of semantic object affordance and b. deductively exploring the utility of a state at different temporal abstractions.

  abstract     = {This paper presents new analytic and numerical analysis of signalling games that give rise to informational bottlenecks – that is to say, signalling games with more state/act pairs than available signals to communicate information about the world. I show via simulation that agents learning to coordinate tend to favour partitions of nature which provide maximal information transfer. This is true despite the fact that nothing from an initial analysis of the stability properties of the underlying signalling game suggests that this should be the case. As a first pass to explain this, I note that the underlying structure of our model favours maximal information transfer in regard to the simple combinatorial properties of how the agents might partition nature into kinds. However, I suggest that this does not perfectly capture the empirical results; thus, several open questions remain.},

  abstract     = {Recently, graphics processing unit (GPU) gained lots of attention from academia and industry for its applicability in high-performance computing. It has been successfully applied to many fields, such as image processing, machine learning, object detection, etc. In our previous work, GPU was adopted to accelerate the computation of rough set approximation (RSA), which is the core step in most of the rough sets based tasks, e.g. attribute reduction. The method is essentially a CPU-GPU cooperative paradigm. That is to say, there are lots of data exchanged between host memory and GPU memory, which greatly degrades the performance of the system. This paper introduces a unified GPU framework for parallel attribute reduction, in which two critical steps in attribute reduction, i.e. computation of equivalence class and attributes significance, are both executed on GPU. Moreover, the algorithm is well designed by exploiting the architectural characteristics of the modern GPU architecture. Experiments were carried out on data sets with different sizes. The results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform the CPU-GPU cooperative algorithm on large data sets.},

  abstract     = {A number of software programms are developed in several releases. Before developing any new release, a set of requirements is suggested for inclusion in the release. Having multiple constraints, it is impossible to develop all the requirements proposed in the next release. The presence of competing companies, replication of product ideas, shortening of the development time and lack of project funding will reduce the cost of developing a release. Developer teams should select a subset of the proposed requirements for development that would provide their clients with the highest amount of satisfaction despite the deadline limitations or cost constraints. The existence of conflicting goals and other constraints makes this choice very complicated. In this paper, an algorithm is introduced which is based on a fuzzy inference system to determine the suitability of each requirement for development in the next release. The proposed algorithm, rather than the developer team, takes the responsibility to select the optimal subset of requirements for the development of the next release. Experimental results of the proposed algorithm are then compared with the results of the genetic algorithm. The subset selected by the proposed algorithm provides much more satisfaction than the genetic algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are commonly used in analysing the brain activity. The EEG signals have small amplitude and hence, they are often affected by the artefacts. For the efficient processing, it is necessary to remove the artefacts from the EEG signals. This paper develops a technique through deep learning scheme for removing the artefacts present in the EEG signal. Initially, the EEG signals are pre-processed and provided to the feature extraction process, where the wavelet features are extracted from the signal by applying the wavelet transform. The extracted features are provided to the proposed classifier, namely deep-ConvLSTM, for removing the artefacts from the EEG signal. Here, the deep learner is trained based on the proposed Cat Swarm Fractional Calculus Optimisation (CSFCO) algorithm, which is the integration of Cat Swarm Optimisation (CSO) and Fractional Calculus (FC). Experimentation of the proposed technique is carried out by introducing artefacts, such as ECG, EMG, EOG and random noise on the EEG signal. Simulation results carried out on the proposed deep-ConvLSTM depict that the proposed framework has better performance than the comparative techniques with the values of 3888.362, 62.356, and 69.939 dB, for the MSE, RMSE, and SNR, respectively.},

  abstract     = {As the generalisation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS), the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) is more useful to express fuzzy and ambiguous information. Meanwhile, to consider human’s hesitance, the concept of q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set (q-ROHFS) is presented, which can be more valid for handling real multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. To fuse the information in q-ROHFS more effectively, in this article, based on power average (PA) operator and generalised Heronian mean (GHM) operator, some q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy power generalised Heronian mean (q-ROHFPGHM) operators which can consider the relationships between being fused arguments are defined and studied. Evidently, the new proposed operators can obtain more exact results than other existing methods. In addition, some precious properties of these operators are discussed. Afterwards, the defined aggregation operators are used to MADM with q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy numbers (q-ROHFNs) and the MADM decision-making model is developed. In accordance with the defined operators and built model, the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy weighted power generalised Heronian mean (q-ROHFWPGHM) operator and the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy weighted power generalised geometric Heronian mean (q-ROHFWPGGHM) operator are applied to deal with green supplier selection in supply chain management, and the availability and superiority of the proposed operators are analysed by comparing with some existing approaches. The method presented in this paper can effectually solve the MADM problems which the decision-making information is expressed by q-ROHFNs and the attributes are interactive.},

By defining the failure load as the load that breaks the bridge, in the process of construction and testing, only bridges that were broken have been added to the database. The developed database was employed to train and validate the artificial neural network with three hidden layers particularly designed for this research. Four different activation functions were tested. The results obtained from Logistic sigmoid activation function were comparatively better. The designed artificial neural network was optimised through genetic algorithm. The benefit of using genetic algorithm was that several solutions were obtained. The artificial neural network with the lowest error for both training and validation data was selected.

  abstract     = {In the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), multi-objective optimisation by ratio analysis (MOORA) plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA) are a useful method, which has the flexibility and robustness properties. The aim of this paper is to present a more robust method of MULTIMOORA to solve the MCDM evaluations with interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVPFSs). More specifically, considering the mutual support relationship among the input arguments, we firstly extend the power average (PA) and power geometric (PG) operators to accommodate the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy environment. For this, we propose four aggregation operators, including the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy power average (IVPFPA), the weighted interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy power average (WIVPFPA), the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy power geometric (IVPFPG) and the weighted interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy power geometric (WIVPFPG). With the aid of WIVPFPA and WIVPFPG, we further put forward a new robustness of the ranking method, i.e., the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy power average-based MULTIMOORA (IVPFPA-MULTIMOORA). Due to the availability and vast diversity among open-source electronic health record (EHR) systems, choosing an appropriate system is a challenge for many health-care institutions under the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Based on these above-mentioned research findings, we successfully utilise the IVPFPA-MULTIMOORA method to solve the selection problem of hospital open-source EHRs systems for MedLab in Ghana. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some comparative analyses.},

  abstract     = {We propose a nonmonotonic Description Logic of typicality able to account for the phenomenon of the combination of prototypical concepts. The proposed logic relies on the logic of typicality 𝒜 ℒ 𝒞 + T R A L C + T R ALC+TR , whose semantics is based on the notion of rational closure, as well as on the distributed semantics of probabilistic Description Logics, and is equipped with a cognitive heuristic used by humans for concept composition. We first extend the logic of typicality A L C + T R by typicality inclusions of the form p :: T ( C ) ⊑ D , whose intuitive meaning is that ‘we believe with degree p about the fact that typical C s are D s’. As in the distributed semantics, we define different scenarios containing only some typicality inclusions, each one having a suitable probability. We then exploit such scenarios in order to ascribe typical properties to a concept C obtained as the combination of two prototypical concepts. We also show that reasoning in the proposed Description Logic is ExpTime -complete as for the underlying standard Description Logic A L C .},

  abstract     = {In satisfiability (SAT) the task is to determine whether a propositional formula can evaluate to true under some assignment to its variables. The formula is either represented in CNF or in circuit form. Solvers are available for both representations with comparable performance. CNF-based approach, being simpler in encoding and solver design, is more popular, in which a circuit is translated into CNF and then solved. Translation to CNF, however, increases the size of the encoding, and is not practical for some constraints such as the cardinality constraint. Circuit-based approach lacks simplicity of implementation; however, circuit representation remains compact in size and also captures problem structure where domain-specific knowledge can be exploited. An important application of SAT solving is in the area of model-based diagnosis . Our contribution in this paper is twofold enhancing the state-of-the-art in SAT solving as well as model-based diagnosis. To simplify and encourage development in circuit-based approach, we propose a new solver which can be extended with minimal effort. The solver which has been built using object-oriented paradigm allows adding a new gate by simply inheriting from existing classes and overriding some functions, hiding great deal of complexity. Then, we demonstrate its effectiveness on the problem of computing minimum-cardinality diagnoses using ISCAS-85 circuit benchmarks. We show that the new solver can solve 28 more (out of 1000) cases than its CNF-based counterpart.},

The first is a framework that systematically exposes where and how discrepancies between human and artificial rationalities can arise. The second is a test that utilises the insight gained from applying the framework in testing the ability of an artificial agent to represent human decision-making. To demonstrate the usefulness of the test, the article describes its application in testing the ability of a set of Individual Evolutionary Learning agents to represent human decision-making in a social psychology experiment, called the Voluntary Contributions Mechanism. In contrast to the results of a prior test that relied on a behaviour-based method, the results of this test show that the ability of these artificial agents to replicate the behaviour of their human counterparts is not a reliable indicator of their ability to represent their decision-making. The article then uses insight from the test to suggest how to improve the ability of Individual Evolutionary Learning agents to represent human decision-making in the Voluntary Contributions Mechanism.},

Many research papers have been presented and summarised. In this review, a general overview of MFO is presented at first. Then, different variants of MFO are described which are classified into three classes: modified, hybridised, and multi-objective. Furthermore, applications of MFO in Engineering, Computer Science, Wireless Sensor Networks, and other fields are discussed. Finally, many possible and future directions are provided.},

  abstract     = {In Automated Planning, generating macro-operators (macros) is a well-known reformulation approach that is used to speed-up the planning process. Nowadays, given the number of existing techniques, a large number of macros is already available or can be easily extracted. Most of the macro generation techniques aim for using the same set of generated macros for each planner and every problem instance in a given domain. Although they provide ‘general improvement’, the effect of macros might vary a lot for different planners. Moreover, the impact of macros on structurally different problem instances than the training ones can be potentially very detrimental. Evidently, this limits the exploitation of macros in real-world planning applications, where the structure of problem instances can often change as well as the exploited planning engine can change from time to time. In this paper, we propose the Macro sets Evolution (MEvo) approach. MEvo has been designed for overcoming the aforementioned issues in order to improve the performance of domain-independent planners by dynamically selecting promising macros – taken from a given pool – while solving continuous streams of problem instances. Our extensive empirical study, involving more than 1,000 planning problem instances and 8 state-of-the-art planning engines, demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of MEvo.},

  abstract     = {Speech recognition performance of the machine has been greatly improved using artificial intelligence. However, compared with the superior recognition ability of human auditory system, the machine still has some problems to deal with. Based on the existing physiological principle of human auditory system, this paper proposes a novel emergent auditory model. This model simulates each key part of the human auditory pathway with a deep developmental network (DDN). Furthermore, this model simulates the function of the superior colliculus in the thalamus, i.e., context integration, as an additional layer in the DDN. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are used to extract the speech signal features to be inputs of the DDN. This work is different from other previous models as we emphasise the mechanism that makes a system to develop its emergent representations from its operational experience, i.e., the internal unsupervised neurons of the DDN are utilised to depict the short contexts, and competitions among them afford an interpretation of how such internal neurons denote the different speech contexts when they are not supervised by the external world. Experimental results show the advantage of the proposed DNN compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the recognition accuracies of English words and phrases.},

  abstract     = {Scores of machine learning algorithms depend on a good distance measure to achieve high performance. The inverted specific-class distance measure, simply ISCDM, is proposed to find reasonable distance measure between each pair of instances with nominal attributes only. ISCDM does not depend on the attribute value of the training instance, which makes it less sensitive to missing values in the training set and more robust to non-class attribute noise. However, in ISCDM, all attributes are assumed to be fully independent. It is obvious that the attribute independence assumption in ISCDM is rarely true in reality, which would harm its performance in the applications with complex attribute dependencies. In this paper, we single out an improved inverted specific-class distance measure by relaxing its unrealistic attribute independence assumption. We call it averaged one-dependence inverted specific-class distance measure, simply AODISCDM. We experimentally tested it on 29 classification problems from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) repository and found that it significantly outperforms ISCDM in terms of the negative conditional log likelihood (-CLL) and the root relative squared error (RRSE). Besides, the proposed AODISCDM maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterise ISCDM.},

The migration transition introduces while its realisation, into a society or societies, a set of macro, micro, and meso-level dynamics depending upon whether migration process is realised externally (at inter-societal level), internally (at intra-societal level), or at coalition (group level). In this paper, a set of software measurements (called migration metrics) are proposed to measure the complexity and dynamics existing in the vital migration transition in artificial agent societies at macro (inter-societal) level. The proposed set of metrics measure the dynamics of migration transition by measuring population distribution, change and structuring during realisation and perpetuation of migration transition in artificial agent societies at run-time. Furthermore, a set of dynamic software measurements (called population metrics) are proposed in this paper, which is used to measure the population count and complexity of fertility and mortality transitions occurring in artificial agent societies. The above-proposed sets of metric suites are then verified and validated by using case studies modelled in a dual-unit artificial world in NetLogo.},

This paper presents an application of classifier algorithm to predict weak welded tube during real production process. Real-time data with 86 independent variables are trained using logistic regression as classifier. A logistic regression model is validated on real-time test data with capability of predicting failure 82.55% of the time (often termed as sensitivity). Operating ranges for mill parameters are estimated with the help of model results. Significant yield improvement has been observed after deployment of model recommended operating ranges as recipe in manufacturing unit.

This paper proposes a stigmergetic target search method based on vector pheromone for swarm robots. Robots generate vector pheromones according to the target signal and release them to the environment for other robots to read, so as to achieve the indirect transfer of information. The method is extended from our previous work which has some shortcoming especially in the updating process of pheromones. This paper improves the previous search method by designing a hybrid pheromone updating rule to achieve more efficient and accurate information exchange. Moreover, the improved search method contains a robot navigation algorithm and a pheromone map building algorithm for guiding robots’ motion and building the pheromone map. Numerical experiments are performed to compare the performance of the improved method with the previous one. Results show that the improved method can enhance the robot’s efficiency and success rate in finding the static and dynamic targets. Meanwhile, it can also improve the speed of map building and the accuracy of the pheromone map.},

Globally, WHRs can describe a word with several other words representing the basic attributes. The WHR model is an extended continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) neural language model with perceptual grouping and attention mechanisms. We further use WHRs to generate document representations, that are more expressive than some widely used document models, such as latent topic and deep learning models.

  abstract     = {Over recent decades, it has been asserted that the essence of developmental learning processes is change through learning. However, capturing the essence of change in learning processes remains an open question. To study learning processes, we take up a maze problem and conduct an experiment in which a participant draws a route for the maze problem over 10 sessions. To understand how a participant learns to draw a route, we draw learning curves by plotting, for each session, the number of mazes for which a participant succeeds in drawing correct routes. To analyze the learning process, we introduce a new metric called behaviour-based entropy , which quantifies the extent of how intensively a participant is devoted to drawing a route. A crucial finding is that substantial improvement in performance is preceded by a few sessions ( plateau ) during which the behaviour-based entropy is quite high. We run a program that simulates drawing of routes, and thereby obtain a learning curve based on the simulation. The resultant learning curves turn out to coincide roughly with the corresponding learning curves based on the experiment, which demonstrates the plausibility of the computational model for the simulation.},

  abstract     = {The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) is a well-known combinatorial optimisation problem used to design an optimal route for a fleet of capacitated vehicles based at a single depot, to serve a set of customers. Over the few past years, the interest in solving real-world applications of the CVRP, especially in transportation and logistics, has grown tremendously. The Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is among the most effective employed techniques for finding the CVRP’s global optimums. However, because of its lack of flexibility, the SA algorithm may have some weakness, like its slowness and its wandering near the global minimum in the final stage of the search. For this reason, we define in this paper the Empirical-Type Simulated Annealing (ETSA) as a new dynamic version of the SA for effectively solving the CVRP and any other vehicle routing problem. The method operates incrementally by exploiting the last portion of worse feasible solutions, which are fitted using a parametric density function, to update the SA’s Boltzmann acceptance criterion. This leads to a more accurate decision within the searching process, and consequently, optimums are more rapidly reached. A comparison to state-of-the-art approaches has proven that the new algorithm is capable of locating all optimums while improving the convergence of the SA algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Arrhythmia classification is an interesting research field that serves as the solution for most of the cardiac-related diseases. The patients with cardiac diseases are experiencing the greatest risk rate of death, and hence, there is a need to identify the presence of arrhythmia in patients to reduce the fatality rate. This paper proposes an arrhythmia classification method, which offers better classification accuracy and releases the time spend for classifying the patients. The proposed method of arrhythmia classification uses the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal to classify the patients with and without arrhythmia. Initially, the wave components are identified from the ECG signal and are subjected to the feature extraction. The spectral and statistical features are extracted from the wave components that yield the texture and the geometric nature of ECG such that classification of ECG becomes effective. The classification is carried out using the Actor-Critic (AC) Neural Network that is trained using the Proposed Taylor-Sine Cosine Algorithm (Taylor-SCA). The Proposed Taylor-SCA algorithm is the integration of Taylor series and SCA. The experimentation is performed using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits the maximum accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.9545, 0.77, and 0.9375, respectively.},

A particularly challenging problem is to not only identify truth from deception, but also discriminate misinformation, i.e. errors, from deception. Misinformation has generally been ignored in the study of deception detection, but through analysing the foundations of deception, it may be possible to pinpoint a fundamental difference between deception and all other benign communications – namely, the intent of the speaker. We present a detection model that captures a speaker’s intent by measuring his patterns of reasoning. The reasoning patterns of deceivers may serve as indicators of intentional deception. Through empirical studies, these intent-driven reasoning patterns can identify as well as explain deceptive communications.},

  abstract     = {Supervised classification and target recognition of Hyperspectral images (HSI) is a challenging task due to high dimensionality and spectral mixing. Straightforward cognitive computation and target classification lead to high computation cost and low recognition accuracy. Limited availability of training samples makes the recognition process very slow and inaccurate. The main purpose of this work is to improve the classification accuracy for high-dimensional images by the fusion of posterior probability obtained from the two-stage probabilistic framework. The first stage addresses the issue of high dimensionality and the second stage addresses the spectral mixing problem. Both stages provide the prediction probability of pixels in a particular class. In stage-1, we have addressed the imbalance between dimensionality and training samples problem for which we have integrated the deep CNN based spatial and spectral features in combined data-cube form, using ‘off-the-shelf’ CNN models. Subsequently, a graph-based non-linear manifold embedding has performed to extract and fuse the region-wise external information. A probability of prediction has obtained by using LDA classifier. These probabilistic values have denoted as a global probability, as an outcome of stage-1. In the stage-2, the spectral mixing issue was addressed by computing the regional probabilities of class mixing for each pixel. The regional probabilities have calculated by using a regional subspace regression approach. Subsequently, the probabilistic output, obtained from stage-1 and stage-2, has been combined with a linear decision fusion method using regularizers. The experiments have conducted on three real Hyperspectral images, i.e. Indian pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), Salinas Valley (SV) datasets. The probabilistic fusion of stage-1 and stage-2 yields to the maximum overall accuracy of 97.38%, 95.10%, and 99.88% for IP, PU and SV datasets. The over-all accuracies have compared with past methods, and it has found that the proposed framework is providing higher prediction accuracies than previous state-of-art methods.},

The optimal design of the robot gripper is a non-linear, multicriteria and multi-constraint problem. Evolutionary computational methods are introduced to overcome the difficulty associated while finding the optimal dimensions of the gripper. In this study, an Improved Multi-objective Antlion Optimisation Algorithm (I-MOALO) has been proposed to find the optimal dimensions of three different robotic gripper mechanisms. The multi-objective optimisation problem (MOOP) is formulated from a geometric model of the gripper configuration with conflicting objectives. The primary objective is to find optimum force at the tip of the gripper while grasping the object while satisfying the constraint using the improved multi-objective antlion optimisation algorithm. A comparative analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed algorithm with well-established multi-objective algorithms. The performance analysis for comparing multi-objective algorithm has been carried out using some of the well-recognised performance metrics such as hypervolume, diversity metric, optimiser overhead, and the ratio of non-dominated individuals. From the result obtained after the performance metric study, it is concluded that the multi-criteria design optimisation problem of robotic gripper effectively solved using the proposed I-MOALO algorithm.},

Many of them are region-specific and unable to exhibit the alterations in significant drought inducing elements. Internet of Things (IoT) is well-suited for continuous monitoring, collection and analysis of different environmental phenomena. The dimensionality of the data collected about drought inducing attributes temperature, humidity, precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater, soil moisture at different depths, streamflow and season is reduced using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) at fog layer. Cloud layer estimates the drought severity level using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) whose parameters are optimised with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to get more accurate system and ARIMA method is used to forecast the drought for different time frames.

However, in order to be applied, its tendency to overfit the data is one of its main issues. The use of a validation dataset is a common alternative to prevent overfitting in many Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including GP. But, there is one key point which differentiates GP and other ML techniques: instead of training a single model, GP evolves a population of models. Therefore, the use of the validation dataset has several possibilities because any of those evolved models could be evaluated. This work explores the possibility of using the validation dataset not only on the training-best individual but also in a subset with the training-best individuals of the population. The study has been conducted with 5 well-known databases performing regression or classification tasks. In most of the cases, the results of the study point out to an improvement when the validation dataset is used on a subset of the population instead of only on the training-best individual, which also induces a reduction on the number of nodes and, consequently, a lower complexity on the expressions.},

  abstract     = {This work, primarily, addresses the problem of automated diagnosis of lung cancer by classifying malignant nodules present in the lung, if any. To achieve the goal, we have posed a weighted dual objective optimisation problem so as to reduce the feature subset required for automated classification of malignant lung nodules and at the same time, we endeavour to increase the classification accuracy to minimise the false impression. The values of the respective weights associated with the discriminating feature subset and the classification accuracy have been evaluated in such a way that the accuracy of nodule classification increases with the help of a small discriminating feature subset. The strategic weight selection methodology, presented in this work, helps attain an optimal combination of these two objectives. As a solution methodology, subsequently, we propose a new adaptive weighted aggregation strategy based on an evolutionary optimisation technique, popularly known as Group Improvised Harmony Search (GrIHS). An adaptive K NN classifier has also been embedded with the GrIHS method to determine the optimal number of neighbourhoods, in the search space, that would further aid in increasing the nodule classification accuracy. The proposed method has been successfully applied to classify the lung nodules from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) database. The experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy efficacy of the proposition with sensitivity of 97.59% and 97.78% blind testing accuracy using only 12 discriminating features. Hence, the proposed methodology can be used to support the diagnosis pronounced by the radiologists interpreting manually the lung computed tomography images.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep learning has developed rapidly and contributed in many fields like the classification in radar and sonar applications. In some special fields like the underwater acoustic signals, the dataset for training may be scarce due to the reason of security or other restrictions, which affects the performance of the deep learning methods as those need a big dataset to ensure high accuracy. Furthermore, the original dataset is in some formats like audio, which makes those methods difficult to capture features, especially in insufficient sample case because of the interference. In this paper, we present a novel framework that applies the LOFAR spectrum for preprocessing to retain key features and utilises Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the expansion of samples to improve the performance classification. Firstly, our framework selects proper preprocessing method based on the evaluation of the spectrum methods. Secondly, our framework revises a GAN to generate samples and built an independent classification network to ensure the quality of those. Finally, our framework applies the existing classification networks to evaluate the performance and selects the best one for real utilisation. The experimental results show that the generated samples have high quality, which can significantly improve the classification accuracy of the neural models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider a new neural network model to simply solve the convex second-order cone constrained variational inequality problem. Based on a smoothing method, the variational inequality (VI) problem is first converted to a convex second-order cone programming (CSOCP). Using a high-performance model, the obtained convex programming problem is solved. According to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of convex optimisation, the equilibrium point of the proposed neural network is proved to be equivalent to the optimal solution of the CSOCP problem. By employing Lyapunov function approach, it is also shown that the presented neural network model is stable in the sense of Lyapunov and it is globally convergent to an exact optimal solution of the original optimisation problem. The capability of the method is demonstrated by several numerical results.},

By using a shortlist-based breakmarriage strategy to rapidly generate all the stable neighbour matchings of all k -best stable matchings, the forward local search finds the solutions while moving towards the woman-optimal matching and the backward local search finds the solutions while moving towards the man-optimal matching.

Language identification (LID) is the process of identifying the language spoken by some unknown speaker using a given speech sample. In this article, textural descriptors extracted from spectrogram image and evolutionary feature selection is presented for Indian language identification. Language-specific long-term cues and prosodic information present in various frequency zones of the spectrogram image can efficiently modelled using textural descriptors. Firstly, an input audio sample is converted into a spectrogram visual representation which characterises the band of frequencies of a signal with respect to time. Then, completed local binary pattern (CLBP), local binary pattern histogram Fourier (LBPHF) and discrete Wavelet transform based texture descriptors are used to extract the features from the spectrogram image. Later, using grey wolf optimiser (GWO) feature selection, irrelevant and redundant features are removed, and only optimal features are selected from the dataset. GWO-based feature selection supports to construct the classification model with optimal features and the performance of the classifier is optimised. Finally, using the artificial neural network classifier and Indic-TTS database 96.9659% accuracy was obtained.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents aggregation operators which encapsulate the interaction among the criteria and preferences under complex intuitionistic fuzzy (CIF) conditions. The current extensions of fuzzy set theory handle the uncertain data by representing the satisfaction and dissatisfaction degrees as real values and can trade with only one-dimensional problems due to which some important knowledge may be lost in some situations. A modification to these, CIF sets are portrayed by complex-valued degrees of satisfaction and dissatisfaction and handle two-dimensional data concurrently in one set using additional terms, called phase terms, which usually give knowledge related with periodicity. Motivated by the features of the CIF model, we present some aggregation operators, namely, generalised CIF Bonferroni mean and generalised CIF weighted Bonferroni mean. Some features related to proposed operators are addressed. In light of the developed operators, a decision-making method is put forward and is drawn with the aid of an example. The reliability of the presented decision-making method is examined with the help of a validity test and by comparing the results of the example with several predominating studies.},

  abstract     = {Stock movement prediction is regarded as one of the most difficult, meaningful, and attractive research issues in the field of financial markets. The stock price data have non-stationary, noisy, and non-linear characteristics which make the movement and its prediction a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a framework to predict the stock price movement using phase space reconstruction (PSR) and extreme learning machines (ELM). The uniqueness of the framework is reflected by its feature transformation technique which computes the information distance from the transformed features in phase space. The distance from phase space dimensions are modelled with ELM to predict the stock price movement. A decision-level fusion is performed on the ELM models trained using each category of features to improve the prediction performance. The framework has been validated on one of the challenging Borsa Istanbul (BIST 100) dataset which is a widely used dataset in stock price prediction studies. The results from the proposed framework are compared with the conventional machine learning pipeline as well as the baseline methods, i.e., random and Naïve approach to show the effectiveness in prediction performance. Experimental results reveal that the framework improves predictive performance by 4.5% in terms of F-measure values.},

This paper presents a novel algorithm, called Neural Network Boosting (NNBOOST) to improve the classification performance of neural networks using ensembling technique. The ensembling technique proposed here is based on the boosting concept to ensemble classifiers. A boosting algorithm sequentially learns a new model by reassigning pattern weights. NNBOOST algorithm adapts a new technique to assign weights to patterns based on the Euclidean distances of patterns from the centroids of respective classes. It assigns more weight to patterns closest to the centroid. The pattern weights are updated subsequently after building or learning a neural network model, based on the updated centroids to build the next neural network model. Weighted Majority voting scheme is used to combine all the learned neural network models. Weight or confidence of a learned neural network model is calculated as the ratio of correctly classified to misclassified training patterns. The algorithm is validated with six real life data sets taken from UCI repository. Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm in ensembling neural networks.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art means of intelligent support of decision-making at dispatching the geospatial processes that use the digital cartographic data sets do not allow for an operative and adequate enough consideration of the rapidly varying natural environment’s characteristics influencing upon the dispatching decisions being made when controlling the complexly distributed geospatial processes’ totalities. At that dispatching is an overall manifestation of a versatile process of geospatial processes’ management. As a rule, the task of managing the objects realising geospatial processes is solved in isolation from the current state of their natural environment, and does not consider the environment radio, physical and other characteristics’ variability. The issues of changes in navigational and meteorological conditions, as well as the issues related to ensuring spatial security, are exclusively subjected to the consideration. Under current conditions becomes meaningful a more complex version of the spatial processes dispatching problem, when the environment variability determines the unique conditions for dispatching at each point of the coordinated geographical space. This statement of a problem is especially relevant under an introduction of modern adaptive means intended for monitoring and sensing the natural environment, like subsystems for monitoring the corresponding systems of spatial processes dispatching. The novelty both of this formulation and the method of this version problem-solving consists in the data fusion from the representation of spatial processes subject domain and those corresponding to the standard models of digital data sets, the integration of software mechanisms for working with information on geospatial processes and programmes for working with cartographic data sets. Development of a reasonable problem statement and a method for this problem’s version solving is the essence of this article.},
