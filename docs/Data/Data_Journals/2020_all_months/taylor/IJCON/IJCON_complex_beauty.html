Lur&#39;e systems have a linear and nonlinear component and arise as the feedback interconnection of a linear control system and a static nonlinearity. Discrete-time Lur&#39;e systems arise in, for example, sampled-data control and integro-difference models. We provide conditions, reminiscent of classical absolute stability criteria, which are sufficient for a range of incremental stability properties and input-to-state stability (ISS). Consequences of our results include sufficient conditions for the converging-input converging-state (CICS) property, and convergence to periodic solutions under periodic forcing.},

Under certain conditions, the analytic optimal reinsurance-investment policy is derived, and the corresponding verification theorem is provided.

Two novelties characterize the considered class of systems: (i) the state equation is subject to output injection involving future output values (not accessible to measurement); (ii) the injected output values come in the state equation not only through a driving term but also through the state matrix. These novel characteristics entail the loss of the system state-affine nature and lead to a new observer design problem never investigated so far. The solution we develop in this paper is a sampled-data based observer of Kalman-like type, augmented with inter-sample predictors and signal saturations. Using both Lyapunov and small-gain arguments, we show that the observer is exponentially convergent for sufficiently small sampling interval and delay, provided an observability condition is satisfied.},

Contrary to existing finite-time and fixed-time schemes, an upper bound of the settling time is an easily tuneable control parameter. Then, these results for first and second order systems are used to design a switching strategy, which guarantees the predefined-time stability of the closed-loop system.

Up to now, almost all existing works about robust boundedness and robust stability require that stochastic perturbations are rooted in continuous time observations of systems states. However, compared with the continuous time noises case, stochastic perturbations of discrete time noises are not only appropriate but also reasonable. Hence, this brief proposes and explores the problems of robust boundedness and robust stability of discrete time noises for stochastic systems satisfying the linear growth condition. The destination of this brief is to answer the question: how much stochastic perturbations of discrete time noises can a bounded or stable system tolerate guaranteeing stochastically perturbed system remains asymptotically bounded or stable. In addition, this brief discusses the application of our results in neural networks.},

The proposed approach is based on the use of successive derivatives in continuous time (or forward measurements in discrete time) in an algebraic (or local) interval observer. The main advantage of such an observer is that it relaxes the Metzler assumption widely used in the literature of cooperative interval observers. Moreover, no prior knowledge on the initial condition is needed, and no stability nor convergence issue do appear as the estimation is local. After introducing such an observer for Linear Time Variant (LTV) systems with bounded disturbances, some extensions are proposed for Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems as well as for functional systems and systems affected by Unknown Input (UI). Some examples illustrate the theoretical contributions.},

  abstract     = {Producing electrical energy from wind power is a growing sector owing to efficient renewable energy characteristics and positive environmental impacts of these type of energy conversion systems. Recent researches have shown that the power efficiency of this production can be maximised via variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs). Controlling the rotor speed of VSWTs appropriately is one of the most feasible ways to reach this purpose. In this study, a novel full-state-feedback robust adaptive controller is designed to reach this purpose. This nonlinear control design is based on backstepping approach by considering the relevance of this approach to the structure of VSWTs. Using the adaptive structure of the designed controller, most of the uncertain parameters are adaptively compensated during the control process while the robust structure of the controller is protected by using constant best-guess estimates of remaining parameters. The stability of the closed-loop error dynamics is theoretically proven via Lyapunov-based arguments while the performance demonstration of the designed controller is realised via simulation studies. In the simulation studies, different cases about the designed controller and the controlled system are examined.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the elegant anti-disturbance saturation control problem is discussed for a class of stochastic systems with multiple heterogeneous disturbances, which include three kinds of disturbance. One is the disturbance with partially known information. The other one is satisfying H 2 H 2 H2 -norm bounded. And the third one is white noise. A stochastic disturbance observer (SDO) is constructed to estimate the disturbance with partially known information. Based on the SDO and the characteristics of other two kinds of disturbance, a disturbance observer-based elegant anti-disturbance saturation control (DOBEADSC) scheme is proposed by combining disturbance observer based saturation control (DOBSC) and H ∞ control. With the proposed DOBEADSC scheme, the desired system robustness performance and higher anti-disturbance control accuracy can be achieved. Finally, two simulation examples, including a wind turbine system, are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

A constructive robust adaptive control technique is provided by exploiting the parameter separation technique and backstepping and the average dwell time method. A modified dynamic signal is designed to dominate the dynamic uncertainties. Also, adaptive partial-state feedback controllers of subsystems are constructed explicitly, which guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system remain bounded under a class of switching signals with average dwell time, while the system output converges to a small neighbourhood of the origin. Meanwhile, the problem of adaptive output-feedback control of a class of switched nonlinearly parameterised systems is solved by constructing a switched observer.

Then, the Recomposable Restricted Finite State Machine is defined, and its optimality investigated; it can handle unpredictably dynamically changing environments, by reacting to environment changes. In general, the local optimal policies do not generate the global optimal policy of the Recomposable Restricted Finite State Machine and global optimality cannot be achieved without knowledge of future. Thus, a heuristic method, Limited Breath First Search, is developed.

Generators and retailers make decisions of the energy quantity in the spot market in the lower level with respect to the contracts signed in the futures market, while they determine contracts in the upper level with respect to the latest information from the spot market. After verifying the existence of the hierarchical equilibrium, we develop a decentralised algorithm to implement the equilibrium with only local information available for both generators and retailers.

A trajectory tracking control strategy is proposed based on a virtual closed-loop system. The proposed control architecture is based on a virtual closed-loop system used to generate the virtual reference trajectory that the AUV should follow instead of the original desired trajectory. At first, in the virtual closed-loop system, a fixed feedback controller is designed based on an approximation dynamic model of the AUV to relieve the chattering phenomenon of control input at the early stage. Then, a robust controller based on a generalised saturation function is combined with neural network estimation to allow the AUV to track the generated virtual reference trajectory. Finally, simulations with different trajectories are performed on an AUV to evaluate the performance of the new design.},

Then, all reachable states are enclosed by two decoupled, point-valued initial value problems (IVPs). This evaluation, however, becomes more challenging if the IVPs are, furthermore, subject to uncertain parameters. In the simplest case, to which this paper is restricted, the ODEs are linear with uncertain system and input matrices. Besides actually linear dynamics, also nonlinear input-affine state-space representations can be accounted for after embedded them into a polytopic uncertainty model representing a conservative convex combination of extremal system realisations. To perform the reachability analysis for closed-loop control structures without significant computational effort, it is reasonable to impose constraints during control synthesis so that the closed-loop ODEs remain cooperative. Suitable design procedures based on linear matrix inequalities are derived in this paper together with a validation for a prototypical heat transfer process.},

Therefore, based on the information of the upper and lower limits of the initial condition, the uncertain parameters, the disturbance and the measurement noise, an interval observer that generates an envelope enclosing every feasible state trajectory is developed. After that, based on the centre of the obtained interval observer, flatness feedforward control, combined with estimated feedback control, is proposed to improve the tracking performance of the quadrotor subject to bounded uncertainties. The closed-loop stability of the system is proven analytical using the Lyapunov theorem.

To prepare intervention strategies in a timely manner, tracking the evolution of these diseases is critical. For this purpose, public health services have access to noisy counts of infected people, which we use here to design a state estimator for a nonlinear discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemic model. We consider the practical case in which only sets of admissible values are known for the model&#39;s disturbances, uncertainties and parameters. Moreover, no bounds are available for the uncertain transmission rate from the ‘susceptible’ to the ‘exposed’ stage of the illness. We estimate the set of possible values of the state using an interval observer and characterise the stability and size of the estimation errors using linear programming. Furthermore, we propose an epidemic outbreak detector that leverages these state interval estimates. We demonstrate the observer&#39;s performance in numerical simulations.},

This parameter drift is viewed as an unknown input, whose reconstruction allows the estimation of the degradation state. Model-based prognosis is divided into a filtering step where the current degradation state is estimated, and an uncertainty propagation step where the future degradation state is predicted. During these two steps, model uncertainty and measurement uncertainty are taken into account within the set-membership framework using interval techniques. The filtering step is performed with an interval unknown input observer for linear time-invariant discrete systems. Then, based on a set-membership constraint satisfaction methodology, interval propagation is performed to estimate the bounds that include the future degradation state until some failure threshold is reached, allowing the deduction of the interval including the remaining useful life. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model-based prognosis methodology, the degradation of a suspension system is studied.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an interval sliding mode observer (ISMO)-based sliding mode actuator fault accommodation (FA) framework for non-minimum phase linear-parameter-varying (LPV) systems involving online control allocation (CA) problem. Firstly, a specifically designed coordinate transformation is introduced to deal with the non-minimum phase issue. Then, an ISMO is proposed to estimate the set of admissible values for the states of the faulty LPV systems, which combines the interval observer technique and the sliding mode observer technique. A fault-tolerant control (FTC) law with an online CA scheme is subsequently designed by stabilising the ISMO instead of the original faulty LPV system. Finally, a simulation for an inverter used in China Railway High-speed (CRH) is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Such systems will undergo a profound change because novel seats for autonomous driving contain expanded safety systems and are more voluminous and heavy. Automated guided vehicles are a promising means of transportation in these systems, but they require dedicated and advanced control systems. This rises new challenges because such an assembly system can dispose both shared resources and redundant elements. This paper presents a fault-tolerant control framework, which allows dealing with systems containing shared resources as well as redundancies.

Second, an auxiliary system with both disturbances and actuator faults is constructed and its corresponding autonomous system is actually an asymptotical stable system. Third, for the auxiliary uncertain system, an interval observer, which is robust to disturbances but sensitive to actuator faults in a sense of interval estimation, is developed. Furthermore, based on the interval observer, a computation of the interval estimation of the output is given and then a residual-based actuator fault detection scheme is proposed.

  abstract     = {Solutions to the interval observation problem for delayed impulsive and switched systems with L 1 L 1 L1 -performance are provided. The approach is based on first obtaining stability and L 1 × ℓ 1 -to- L 1 × ℓ 1 performance analysis conditions for uncertain linear positive impulsive systems in linear fractional form with norm-bounded uncertainties using a scaled small-gain argument involving time-varying D -scalings. Both range and minimum dwell-time conditions are formulated – the case of constant and maximum dwell-times can be directly obtained as corollaries. The conditions are stated as timer/clock-dependent conditions taking the form of infinite-dimensional linear programmes that can be relaxed into finite-dimensional ones using polynomial optimisation techniques. It is notably shown that under certain conditions, the scalings can be eliminated from the stability conditions to yield equivalent stability conditions on the so-called worst-case system , which is obtained by replacing the uncertainties by the identity matrix. These conditions are then applied to the special case of linear positive systems with delays, where the delays are considered as uncertainties, similarly to as in (Briat (2018a). Stability and performance analysis of linear positive systems with delays using input-output methods. International Journal of Control , 91 (7), 1669–1692). As before, under certain conditions, the scalings can be eliminated from the conditions to obtain conditions on the worst-case system, coinciding here with the zero-delay system – a result that is consistent with all the existing ones in the literature on linear positive systems with delays. Finally, the case of switched systems with delays is considered. The approach also encompasses standard continuous-time and discrete-time systems, possibly with delays and the results are flexible enough to be extended to cope with multiple delays, time-varying delays, distributed/neutral delays and any other types of uncertain systems that can be represented as a feedback interconnection of a known system with an uncertainty.},

An interval observer is designed in order to guarantee both stability and cooperativity of the upper and lower observation errors. For the proposed observer, sufficient input-to-state stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, adopting firstly common quadratic Lyapunov functions, under arbitrary switching signals and secondly multiple quadratic Lyapunov functions, under average dwell time (ADT) switching signals.

A Distributed Zonotopic and Gaussian Kalman Filter (DZG-KF) is proposed where each network node implements a local state estimator using symbolic Zonotopes and Gaussian noise Mergers (s-ZGM), a class of Set-membership and Probabilistic Mergers (SPM). Each network node communicates its own state information only to its neighbours. The proposed system includes a dedicated service called Unique Symbols Provider (USP) giving unique identifiers. It also includes Matrices with Labelled Columns (MLC) featuring column-wise sparsity, and symbolic zonotopes (s-zonotopes). This significantly enhances the propagation of uncertainties and preserves global dependencies that would otherwise be lost (or impeded) by the peer-to-peer communication through the network. A number of other network-related constraints can be managed within this framework. Numerical simulations show significant improvements compared to a non-symbolic approach.},

Although there are many excellent design methods of interval observers, it is still a worth discussing problem to construct the cooperativity of observer error dynamics. Firstly, under the full consideration of anti-interference point, a general approach to design a reduced-order interval observer is proposed, and the complexity of constructing the system cooperativity is decreased. Secondly, a parametric design method of the reduced-order interval observers is further built on the above one by solving a type of generalised Sylvester equations, which ensures the existence of the reduced-order interval observers, and the calculation problem of linear matrix inequalities is avoided effectively. Besides, one further novelty is the consideration of the parameters whose influence on the observer performance, such as the convergence rate of the output interval and robustness. Meanwhile, a constructive procedure to obtain a reduced-order interval observer is advanced. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical simulations.},

As an application, we obtain some new pinning impulsive control methods for the stabilisation of stochastic neural networks. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel adaptive filtering scheme is first proposed to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear Wiener–Hammerstein systems with hysteresis, which is derived by exploiting the filtering technique and cost function framework. Different from the conventional cost function, the cost function of this paper involves estimation error information term and initial estimate term. In this scheme, the filtering technique is utilised to produce the estimation error information by using a group of auxiliary variables. The estimation error information term can improve the estimation accuracy. Based on developed cost function framework, the parameter update law is derived. Furthermore, the convergence of the proposed scheme is proved under the persistent excitation condition (PE). The efficiency and applicability of the proposed scheme are validated through the simulation and experiment.},

The presence of unknown coefficients can reduce the rigorousness of system modelling and enlarge the scope of the systems, whereas it could give rise to essential difficulties to control problems. Mainly due to the latter, certain new initiative, such as uncertainty compensation, should be considered to solve the stabilisation problem. For this, by infinite-dimensional backstepping method combining with adaptive compensation technique, an adaptive control scheme is proposed. Then, an adaptive state-feedback controller is constructed which guarantees that all the closed-loop system states are bounded while the original system states converge to zero.

Relying on generalised Sylvester-type equations, a set of all stabilising controllers is characterised, explicitly exhibiting the impacts of the reference signal and the output weight on the resulting controllers. Based on this specific parameterisation, additional disturbance attenuation is tackled, and both full-order and reduced-order controller synthesis are discussed. It is observed that the multiobjective problem is equivalent to a standard problem for an auxiliary system constructed from the original weighted system with the control input matrix and measurement output matrix being augmented by solutions to generalised Sylvester-type equations.

By combining command-filtered backstepping, a novel adaptive neural control scheme is proposed to guarantee that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded and all states stay in the predefined bounded regions. Subsequently, by verifying the partial persistent excitation condition of the radial basis function neural network, neural weight estimates are proven to converge to the ideal weights and the convergent weights are stored in the constant values. Using the stored knowledge, a neural learning control scheme is developed for similar control tasks, which can improve control performances without the violation of full state constraints.

The agents share their position errors and filter-output signals, instead of actual velocity errors, over a directed communication network, in the presence of time-varying delay. Besides, balanced communication topology is also not required. The proposed adaptive control mechanism ensures the position synchronisation among agents, as well as the tracking of each agent to given desired trajectory, under the effects of time-varying communication delay, parametric uncertainty and unknown external disturbance, simultaneously. By employing a classical Lyapunov approach and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals, it is concluded that the suggested control structure yields semi-global asymptotic convergence of all closed-loop errors, including synchronisation errors. The simulation results, on a six-marine vessel network system, are presented to validate the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach to mixed-integer model predictive control (MPC) of uncertain hybrid systems with binary and real valued control inputs. The stability condition of the hybrid system is obtained by using the Lyapunov function and then a sufficient state feedback control law is achieved so that guarantees the closed-loop stability and also minimises an infinite horizon performance index. The primal optimisation problem is convex, therefore, a convex relaxation is investigated by introducing the Lagrange dual function. The real and binary control inputs are obtained by solving the dual of the dual problem in the framework of LMIs. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed MPC approach and the duality gap of the convex relaxation are studied through simulation results of a hybrid system with mixed real and binary inputs.},

  abstract     = {The Large Gain Theorem is an input-output stability result with intriguing applications in the field of control systems. This paper aims to increase understanding and appreciation of the Large Gain Theorem by presenting an interpretation of it for linear time-invariant systems using the well-known Nyquist stability criterion and illustrative examples of its use. The Large Gain Theorem is complementary in nature to the Small Gain Theorem, as it uses a lower bound on the gain of the open-loop system to guarantee closed-loop stability, rather than an upper bound on the gain of the open-loop system. It is shown that the stipulations of the Large Gain Theorem ensure that the multi-input multi-output Nyquist stability criterion is satisfied. Numerical examples of minimum gain and systems that satisfy the Large Gain Theorem are presented, along with examples that make use of the Large Gain Theorem to guarantee robust closed-loop stability.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new set-membership observer design method for discrete-time linear parameter varying systems. The real process is assumed to be perturbed by unknown but bounded disturbances. The proposed set-membership observer provides a deterministic state interval that is build as the sum of the estimated system states and its corresponding estimation errors bounds. The observer design process is based on the offline solution of a finite number of linear matrix inequalities conditions that provide both the observer parameters and the ellipsoidal robustly positive invariant (RPI) sets for the estimation error dynamics. The main feature of the proposed approach concerns the fact that these RPI sets are used to frame, at every time-instant, the estimation error in an explicit way. Another novelty concerns the fact that the approach includes uniformly distributed random disturbances which belongs to the family of bounded disturbances. The a posteriori steady-state covariance matrix of the estimation error dynamics, perturbed by such disturbances, is used during the observer synthesis providing small RPI sets. Two numerical examples illustrate the behaviour of such observer and its easy implementation.},

We present a smooth time-varying controller able to stabilise a wide class of reference trajectories that include converging ( parking problem ) and persistently exciting ( tracking problem) ones, as well as set-points . For the first time in the literature we establish uniform global asymptotic stability for the origin of the closed-loop system in the kinematics state space. We also show that the kinematics controller renders the system robust to perturbations in the sense of integral-input-to-state stability. Then, we show that for the case in which the velocity dynamics equations are also considered (full model), any velocity-tracking controller with the property that the error velocities are square integrable may be used to ensure global tracking or stabilisation even under parametric uncertainty.},

The controller gives priority to the control of the aircraft&#39;s altitude before controlling the lateral displacement, fact from which interesting features as less thrust effort and less aggressive manoeuvres for roll moment are gained. The fundamental idea for the development of the proposed controller is based on the selection of the target dynamic system in accordance with the nature of the translational motion system to then stabilise the off-manifold dynamics by using the rotational motion system. It is proved that the proposed control scheme is globally asymptotically stable. Simulation results validate our proposal.},

The methodology is grounded in a direct optimisation approach and relies on the minimisation of spectral abscissa and ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ cost functions, as a function of the controller or design parameters. First, an approach applicable to generic MIMO systems is presented, which imposes a suitable sparsity pattern with the possibility of fixing elements in the controller parameterisation. Second, if the system to be controlled has the structure of a network of coupled identical subsystems, then it is shown that this structure can be exploited by an improved algorithm for the design of decentralised controllers, thereby improving computational efficiency and scalability with the number of subsystems. Several numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology, and its extension towards consensus type problems.},

The prescribed trio of poles is considered in form of one pair of complex conjugates and a real pole and it is shown that this option is not a matter of choice but necessary constraint for control design with delay in the loop. The prescribed poles are determined by the damping and root ratios with a natural frequency derived from the ultimate frequency of the plant. The three-pole assignments are determined by two similarity numbers λ 1 , λ 2 considered as coordinates of the map. The limitation of admissible damping ratio due to the dominance condition is one of the original results presented in the paper.

For this purpose, we present the notion of majority-controllability of a global specification, and show that it is a crucial condition for the existence of local supervisors achieving a progressive global specification. Using the presented control theory, we analyze how the federal estate tax in the Unites States was repealed in 2010.},

Under the fixed topology, consensus convergence conditions are obtained based on matrix theory and graph theory for the agents under our proposed persistent-hold strategy, and the results show that our proposed strategy has less conservative converging conditions than the usual intermittent control. Besides, consensus convergence conditions are also obtained for the agents under the switching topologies. Numerical simulations show the correctness of theoretical results.},

First, conditions for L 2 L 2 L2 -gain analysis of sampled-data PLPV systems are derived using a modified Krasovskii functional in which the distance between the real and measured parameters are considered as uncertainties. The resulting conditions are formulated in terms of parameterised linear matrix inequalities (PLMI). Second, a solution approach for satisfying PLMI conditions over the set of whole parameters and uncertainties is proposed using the sum-of-squares decomposition method. Third, conditions for robust H ∞ sampled-data controller synthesis for nonlinear systems described by PLPV models are derived in terms of parameterised bilinear matrix inequalities (PBMI) with the maximum allowable sampling period as the parameter. To make the resulting bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) problems tractable, an iterative algorithm is developed and utilised to solve the problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified using several real-world examples.},

In particular, in the analysed class a single evaluation of a nonlinear function of the consensus error is performed per each node. The classical assumption of switching among connected graphs is dropped here, allowing to represent failures and intermittency in the communications between agents. Thus, conditions to guarantee finite and fixed-time convergence, even while switching among disconnected graphs, are provided. Moreover, the algorithms of the considered class are computationally simpler than previously proposed finite-time consensus algorithms for dynamic networks, which is an essential feature in scenarios with computationally limited nodes and energy efficiency requirements such as in sensor networks. Simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed consensus algorithms. In the presented scenarios, results show that the settling time of the considered algorithms grows slower than other consensus algorithms for dynamic networks as the number of nodes increases.},

The derived stability conditions are applied to a single-user pHRI system including this human model. The results indicate that these conditions are very conservative.

  abstract     = {This study examines the finite time annular domain stability (FTADS) and stabilisation of a class of Itô stochastic impulsive systems with asynchronous switching controller. The asynchronous switching means that the controller switching does not accurately coincide with system switching in delayed time interval. The design of the controller depends on the observed jumping parameters, which cannot be precisely measured in real-time because of switching delay. Our results apply to cases where some subsystems of the switched systems are not necessarily stable under the influence of input delay. When the subsystem is stable in the synchronous switching interval and unstable in the asynchronous case, a compromise among the average impulsive interval, the upper bound of delay, and the decay/increasing rate of Lyapunov function in the synchronous/asynchronous switching interval respectively is given. By the mode-dependent parameter approach (MDPA) and allowing the increase of the impulses on all the switching times, the extended FTADS criteria for Itô stochastic impulsive systems in generally nonlinear setting are derived first. Then, we focus on the case when the system in both synchronous and asynchronous switching intervals are unstable. By reaching a tradeoff among average impulsive interval, the upper bound of delay, the magnitude of impulses and the difference between the increasing rate of Lyapunov function in the synchronous and asynchronous switching interval, new sufficient conditions for existence of the state feedback controller are also developed by MDPA. In addition, we consider the effect of different impulsive strengths (harmful and beneficial impulses) and obtained less conservative results because the Lyapunov function may be non-decreasing during switching interval. Moreover, we extend the conclusion from nonlinear stochastic impulsive switching systems to linear case. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the results obtained in this study.},

Finite-dimensional implementation of the suggested criteria is considered via a two-step truncation approach. The finite-dimensional criteria are implementable either graphically with locus plotting, or numerically without locus plotting, besides retaining the aforementioned technical advantages. Furthermore, also exploiting the complex scaling technique, stabilisation of LCP systems with static state feedback is worked out in the internal or external stability sense, whose alternative interpretations in terms of the small-gain theorem and the Gronwall inequality are explicated.

To formulate conditions for the construction of the observer gains, stability results for nonlinear singularly perturbed systems are utilised. The nonlinear observer is designed directly in the given coordinates, where the error dynamics between the plant and the observer becomes singularly perturbed by a high-gain part of the observer injection, and the information of the slow manifold is exploited to construct the observer gains of the reduced-order dynamics. This is in contrast to typical high-gain observer approaches, where the observer gains are chosen such that the nonlinearities are dominated by a linear system. It will be demonstrated that the considered approach is particularly suited for self-sensing electromechanical systems. Two variants of the proposed observer design are illustrated for a nonlinear electromagnetic actuator, where the mechanical quantities, i.e. the position and the velocity, are not measured.},

Only sensors with limited ranges can provide the robots with the relative displacements to nearby robots. The robots themselves are fully independent with exchangeable positions in the predefined formations. Thus the robot team is distributed both physically and in their information flow. To deal with the lack of communication, a distributed control strategy is proposed to drive the robots to a potentially flawed formation. Then, a coordination protocol is presented to detect the imperfections such that the locally desired formations are transformed into a globally desired formation. An evaluation method is given to impose a weak restriction on the predefined formation, rendering it almost arbitrary. The minimal local topology is proposed to enhance the robustness. The coordination protocol is then modified by introducing probability to reduce the computation burden and avoid the infinite trajectory loop.},

  abstract     = {In this paper a model free sliding mode controller (SMC) based on a novel reaching law for SISO nonlinear systems is provided. The novelty of the work lies in the approach used to achieve the reaching law. The proposed reaching law is more general than those proposed in recent works. Naturally, it is consistent with the proposed control law, which is composed of an optimal term and an exponential switching term. A proper cost function forces the sliding variable and its derivative to vanish. The switching part consists of an exponential term, which decreases the quasi-sliding domain. It is shown analytically that the sliding function enters and remains in the quasi-sliding bound. In addition, the UUB stability of error is rigorously proved. Computer simulation in different scenarios and comparison to the simple model free SMC and model free adaptive control methods has been provided to show better performance of the proposed method, compared with the mentioned methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the fault-tolerant control problem of air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (AHVs) by using the adaptive method. A tractable control-oriented model is first derived for AHVs with uncertain parameters, flexible dynamics as well as sensor and actuator faults, which gathers the concerned uncertain factors in a processable linearly parameterised form. The followed design combines the classic dynamic surface control with a novel bound estimation mechanism to circumvent the ‘explosion of complexity’ introduced by the recursive procedure and the time-varying uncertain parameters involved in the parameterised model. The resulting adaptive controller also compensates for the possible saturation of fuel-to-air equivalency ratio and the inevitable quantisation of elevator deflection angle, along with a relatively simple algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is evaluated by a simulation study.},

Such high dimensional systems appear for example when discretizing a stochastic partial differential equations in space. We study a particular model order reduction technique called balanced truncation (BT) to reduce the order of spatially-discretised systems and hence reduce computational complexity. We introduce suitable Gramians to the system and prove energy estimates that can be used to identify states which contribute only very little to the system dynamics. When BT is applied, the reduced system is obtained by removing these states from the original system. The main contribution of this paper is an L 2 -error bound for BT for stochastic bilinear systems. This result is new even for deterministic bilinear equations. In order to achieve it, we develop a new technique which is not available in the literature so far.},

Meanwhile, in order to save network resources, event-triggered mechanism has been introduced into this CPS. By exploiting the relationship between cyber system and physical system, we aim to design the resilient controller and resilient control strategy to tolerate a class of DoS signals characterised by probability without serious hazard to the stability and performance of CPS. Furthermore, considering that the transition probability of cyber state is unknown, the on-policy reinforcement learning method – SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) – is used to solve this problem. Thus a resilient control algorithm that integrates game theory, robust control theory, event-triggered control method and SARSA learning method is presented to enhance the security and robustness of the CPS. At last, the numerical simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

Since the system states are unmeasurable and the output can only be measured at the sampling instants, an observer is designed to estimate the state. By adopting the multiple Lyapunov function method and the backstepping technique, a virtual controller is constructed, then a sampled-data controller is obtained by discretizing the designed virtual controller. With appropriate choice of a switching law and an allowable sampling period, it is proved that the designed sampled-data controller renders the corresponding closed-loop system to be globally practically stable.

It stands as an extension of the standard subspace-based algorithm which is well established in the linear time invariant (LTI) case. The formulation is close to the LTI identification scheme and simply involves frequency-domain data obtained at different operating points (the parameters are frozen during each experiment). The proposed algorithm allows to identify directly a parameter-dependent model instead of interpolating multiple local models as in traditional local approaches. Another contribution is that it is possible to impose the poles location through linear matrix inequalities (LMI) constraints, extending what has been done in the LTI case. This technique is applied to a numerical example and to real industrial frequency-domain data originating from an open-channel flow simulation for hydroelectricity production.},

A sufficient condition on the existence of such a filter is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which provides an effective way to obtain an appropriate filter inheriting the same graph as the plant.

For this, a state feedback regulator achieving output regulation in minimum time is determined. In order to obtain an output feedback regulator, finite-time reference and disturbance observers are designed. The latter observer achieves the estimation of the disturbance model and plant states in minimum time. For this, only an additional ODE has to be added to the usual asymptotic-time disturbance observer. The combination of the state feedback regulator with these observers results in an output feedback regulator, for which minimum time output regulation is verified. The output regulation approach is formulated for general signal models, that need not be diagonalisable, and is applied to an unstable 5 × 5 hyperbolic system. The comparison of the obtained results with an asymptotic-time design confirms the performance increase gained by the solution of the minimum time output regulation problem.},

These projectors are then used in (i) constructing a Lyapunov function and (ii) deriving another criterion to identify the presence of poles (finite) of the system to the right of a given vertical line in the complex plane. The latter criterion is required to analyse whether the dominant low-frequency electro-mechanical modes, that cause oscillatory instability in the power network, settle down within a specified time limit. Using the derived criteria, linear matrix inequality feasibility problems are formulated to analyse small signal instability and oscillatory instability.

  abstract     = {An optimal predictive control algorithm is introduced for the control of linear and nonlinear discrete-time multivariable systems. The controller is specified in a ‘restricted structure’ form involving a set of given linear transfer-functions and a set of gains that minimise a Generalised Predictive Control ( GPC ) cost-index. The set of functions can be chosen as proportional, integral and derivative terms, however, a wide range of controller structures is possible. This is referred to as Restricted-Structure GPC control. The multi-step predictive control cost-function is novel, since it includes weightings on the ‘low-order’ controller gains and the rate of change of gains. This considerably improves the numerical computations ensuring critical inverse computations cannot lead to a singular matrix. It also provides the option of adding soft or hard constraints on the controller gains which provides additional flexibility for control design. The ability to include a plant model that can include a general nonlinear operator is also new for restricted structure control solutions. The low-order controller provides a potential improvement in robustness, since it is often less sensitive to plant uncertainties. The simple controller structure also enables relatively unskilled staff to retune the system using familiar tuning terms, and provides a potentially simpler QP problem for the constrained case.},

For the case that the target acceleration is bounded, the relative distances and velocities between missiles and target are used as consensus variables. The communication graph and missile-target dynamics are decoupled by using neighborhood information and adaptive coupling gain coefficients. Without knowing the global information, the simultaneous hitting of the maneuvering target can be achieved by the designed fully distributed adaptive guidance law. On that basis, a cooperative guidance law with optimal performance is designed, which achieves simultaneous attack and ensures minimum attack error with minimum control and communication cost. The fully distributed adaptive and optimal cooperative guidance law can be combined to apply to a variety of attack scenarios. Numerical examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.},

Then, aiming the feature of the each subsystem, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode control and a nested saturation approach are employed to construct the trajectory tracking algorithm for fully actuated steering subsystem and underactuated longitudinal subsystem of the WIP vehicle, respectively. Besides, the closed-loop system&#39;s stability and asymptotical convergence of tracking error are proven in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory.

Unlike other algorithms that need repeated training in the choice of parameters, the proposed approach obtains all the required parameters automatically through learning. By integrating segmental options with the traditional hierarchy reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithm, the potential field hierarchy is built. The potential field is implemented in the parameters of the HRL, which provides with reasonable paths of the target search for the unexplored environments. In search tasks, the designed method can control the multi-AUV system to find the target effectively.

Such a robust control strategy is able to deal with any formation scheme such that there exists a directed spanning tree from the leader agent to all other agents. The proposed output-control strategy is based on a Continuous Sliding-Mode Control ( Continuous -SMC) approach which is composed of a Finite-Time Sliding-Mode Observer (FT-SMO) and hierarchical cascade Continuous -SMCs. It is assumed that only the positions and angles of each Quad-Rotor are available to measure. Despite the disturbances acting on all the Quad-Rotor dynamics, this control strategy provides uniform finite-time stability for the altitude and yaw angle tracking and formation errors, and uniform exponential stability for the forward and lateral tracking and formation errors. Moreover, four different types of Continuous -SMCs can be used in the proposed strategy. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a probabilistic multimodal adaptive control approach for systems that are characterised by temporal multimodality where the system dynamics are subject to abrupt mode switching at arbitrary times. In this framework, the control objective is redefined such that it utilises the complete probability distribution of the system dynamics. The derived probabilistic control law is thus of a dual type that incorporates the functional uncertainty of the controlled system. A multi-modal density model with prediction error-dependent mixing coefficients is introduced to effect the mode switching. This approach can deal with arbitrary noise distributions, nonlinear plant dynamics and arbitrary mode switching. For the affine systems focussed upon for illustration in this paper the approach has global stability. The theoretical architecture constructs are verified by validation on a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {In symmetric discrete-event systems, the system complexity is reduced by relabelling to the same symbol events fulfilling the same task. In this paper, we divide specifications into two classes: public specifications and private specifications. The public specifications are independent of the details of components; thus, the corresponding decentralised supervisors can be generated by the inverse relabelling image of their counterparts at the relabelled level. As the private specifications are dependent on the details of certain components, the decentralised supervisors for private specifications are computed according to the decentralised approach in the Supervisory Control Theory framework. We propose a composite supervisory control paradigm for the concurrent operation of these supervisors. The approach is applied to two representative discrete-event systems examples.},

Based on the designed MTN state observer, and by combining the backstepping technique with dynamic surface control (DSC), an adaptive MTN decentralised output-feedback tracking control scheme is developed. It is proved that the proposed control approach can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability, and the tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood around the origin in the sense of mean quartic value. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method promises desirable real-time performance and tracking control.},

The external disturbance is assumed to be unmeasurable and modelled as the output of uncertain autonomous linear system. A scheme with two different algorithms of adaptive disturbance compensation is proposed. The scheme is based on special disturbance observer and predictor. The first algorithm involves the conventional gradient algorithm of adaptation with restricted convergence properties. The second algorithm represents the modification of gradient algorithm and accumulates information about disturbance over past period of time. Accumulation is implemented via a preselected linear operator with memory and gives dramatically improved parametric convergence. For algorithms of adaptation, the influence of input delay is completely compensated by the use of a special scheme of error augmentation. The problem of plant stabilisation is resolved by involving the state predictor. The performance of the proposed schemes of disturbance compensation is demonstrated via simulation and compared in conclusion.},

  abstract     = {Given a state transition matrix (STM), we reinvestigate the problem of constructing the sparsest input matrix with a fixed number of inputs to guarantee controllability of the associated system. A new and simple graph-theoretic characterisation is obtained for the sparsity pattern of input matrices to guarantee controllability for a general STM admitting multiple eigenvalues, and a deterministic procedure with polynomial time complexity is suggested for constructing real valued input matrices satisfying the controllability requirement with an arbitrarily prescribed sparsity pattern. Based on this criterion, some novel results on sparsely controlling a system are obtained. It is proven that the minimal number of inputs to guarantee controllability equals the maximum geometric multiplicity of the STM under the constraint that some states can not be directly actuated by inputs (provided such problem is feasible), extending the existing results. Moreover, the minimal sparsity of an input matrix to ensure system controllability can be affected by the number of independent inputs. Furthermore, a graphic submodular function is built, leading to a greedy algorithm which efficiently approximates the minimal states needed to be directly actuated by inputs to ensure controllability for general STMs. To approximate the sparsest input matrices with a fixed number of inputs, we propose a simple greedy algorithm (non-submodular) and a two-stage algorithm, and demonstrate that the latter algorithm, inspired from graph colouring, has a provable approximation guarantee. Finally, we present some numerical results to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approaches.},

The paper suggests control strategies for formation flights in a 3D space. The concepts of flat system and virtual formation play important roles in the current approach. We assume that accurate information needed to control a quadrotor in formation flights is available to the control system. Despite of system uncertainties the control law ensures that the error of the attitude subsystem relative to a required reference attitude converges exponentially to zero. Regarding the translational uncertain subsystem the solutions of the associated error dynamics are ultimately bounded and the ultimate boundedness of the error between the actual trajectory and the desired one in the flying formation can be guaranteed. The control scheme allows formation splitting and merging and formation switching in flight. Simulation results and discussions conclude the paper.},

A distributed control protocol is firstly introduced to ensure that the agents can reach a median-related consensus in finite time in a collaboration network, meaning that all edge-weights of the communication network are non-negative. We then generalise the results to cooperation–competition networks, where the communication network is divided into predetermined collaboration subnetworks allowing possibly negative weights.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of navigation control of a general class of 2nd order uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems in a bounded workspace, which is a subset of R 3 , with static obstacles. In particular, we propose a decentralised control protocol such that each agent reaches a predefined position at the workspace, while using local information based on a limited sensing radius. The proposed scheme guarantees that the initially connected agents remain always connected. In addition, by introducing certain distance constraints, we guarantee inter-agent collision avoidance as well as collision avoidance with the obstacles and the boundary of the workspace. The proposed controllers employ a class of Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (DNMPC) under the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of the proposed framework.},

In addition, the stability of car-following model is studied when the vehicle is subjected to external stochastic disturbance.

The estimations decouple approximately the system after cancelling stochastic total disturbance in the feedback loop. As a result, we are able to design an ESO-based stabilising output-feedback and prove the practical mean square stability for the closed-loop system with constant gain ESO and the asymptotic mean square stability with time-varying gain ESO, respectively.

The system states are restricted inside a given polytope and a classical Luenberger observer is used to reconstruct the unmeasurable states from output observations. Based on the observed states, a state feedback is proposed as the control input. The stability analysis and the control design are done using an extended version of the attractive ellipsoid method (AEM) approach. To avoid the violation of state constraints, this work proposes a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) based analysis. The control parameters are obtained throughout the solution of some optimisation problems such that the BLF ensures an approximation of the constraints by a maximal ellipsoidal set and the AEM provides the characterisation of a minimal ultimately bounded set for the closed-loop system solutions. Numerical simulations show the advantages using the BFL-AEM methodology against classical sub-optimal controllers in academic second order and third order examples. Then, the proposed control strategy is applied over a Buck DC-DC converter. In all the cases, the method proposed here prevails over the other controllers.},

We develop a distributed adaptive control law composed of a distributed observer and a purely decentralised adaptive control law.

This stability result leads to a novel distributed observer for the leader system which estimates the leader&#39;s signal using the output of the leader system locally and passes the estimated leader&#39;s signal to each follower.

In this paper, we have proposed a control framework to ensure end-effectors position tracking while satisfying sub-task control in the presence of the nonlinear dynamics for the telemanipulators, bounded time-varying delays in the communication channels and saturation in the actuators. We have shown that in free motion and when the operator applies a bounded force to the local robot, the proposed controller not only guarantees the position convergence of the end-effectors but also guarantees the accomplishment of the sub-task control. The efficiency of the proposed control algorithm is validated showing a number of numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the zero-sum differential game problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear pure-feedback systems with output constraints and unknown external disturbances. A barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to tackle the output constraints. By constructing an affine variable at each dynamic surface control design step rather than utilising the mean-value theorem, the tracking control problem for pure-feedback systems can be transformed into an equivalent zero-sum differential game problem for affine systems. Then, the solution of associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation can be obtained online by using the adaptive dynamic programming technique. Finally, the whole control scheme that is composed of a feedforward dynamic surface controller and a feedback differential game control strategy guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system, and the tracking error is remained in a bounded compact set. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

First, B-spline characterisations of the flat output allow for optimal trajectory generation subject to waypoint constraints, thrust and angle constraints while minimising the trajectory length. Second, the proposed tracking control strategy combines feedback linearisation and nested saturation control via flatness. The control strategy provides bounded inputs (thrust, roll and pitch angles) while ensuring the overall stability of the tracking error dynamics. The control parameters are chosen based on the information of the a priori given reference trajectory. Moreover, conditions for the existence of these parameters are presented. The effectiveness of the trajectory planning and the tracking control design is analysed and validated through simulation and experimental results over a real nano-quadcopter platform, the Crazyflie 2.0.},

Motivated by adaptive control of systems with nonminimum-phase (NMP) zeros and taking advantage of the fact that zeros are not moved by feedback, the performance metric is the accuracy of the estimates of the NMP zeros of the plant. Assuming known plant order, single-input, single-output, infinite-impulse-response models are constructed in the presence of process and sensor noise. Least squares provides the baseline estimation technique, and prediction error methods are used to account for correlation between the model input and noise. The goal is to compare the accuracy of the NMP-zero estimates obtained from each method and for each architecture.},

In this paper, we first show that a strongly passive system always admits a unique storage function. We then provide a closed-form expression for this unique storage function. Using the closed-form formula of the unique storage function we characterise the ‘lossless’ trajectories of strongly passive systems and show that such systems admit impulsive lossless trajectories on the half-line; we call them fast lossless trajectories .

The proposed method offers new sufficient conditions based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) for designing the switching strategy. In order to provide extra free dimensions in the solution space, some conditions become a special class of Bilinear Matrix Inequalities (BMIs). Therefore, the hybrid algorithm Differential Evolution–Linear Matrix Inequality is proposed for obtaining feasible solutions of this NP-hard problem.

Applying the relation, we transform the time-varying linear matrix differential equation into eigenvalue differential equation. Furthermore, by using singular value decomposition and majorisation inequalities, we derive upper and lower bounds on eigenvalue summation of the solution for the Lyapunov matrix differential equation, which improve the recent results. As an application in control and optimisation, we show that our bounds could be used to discuss the stability of a class time-varying nonlinear system. Finally, we give a corresponding numerical example to show the superiority and effectiveness of the derived bounds.},

  abstract     = {This paper revisits the robust cooperative output regulation problem for a class of linear uncertain multi-agent systems. In particular, it is assumed here that the agents in the system can only access incomplete measurements of the exosystem, and the local regulated error signals are not available to the agents to be used in control. Under these assumptions, the agents in the system cannot independently reconstruct the exosystem dynamics, or rely on their own local measurements to achieve the objectives of the output regulation problem. The solution to the regulation problem proposed in this paper is a distributed dynamic control law that reconstructs the exosystem states, given a mild collective detectability assumption. Furthermore, the proposed distributed control law incorporates an internal model of the exosystem to allow for uncertain dynamics of the multi-agent system. A numerical example is offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control solution.},

Specifically, using incremental supply rate as well as a state dissipation inequality in expectation, a stochastic version of exponentially incremental dissipativity is presented. The sufficient conditions for nonlinear stochastic switched systems to be exponentially incrementally dissipative are given by the designed state-dependent switching law. Furthermore, the extended Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov conditions are derived by using two times continuously differentiable storage functions. Moreover, the incremental stability conditions in probability for nonlinear stochastic switched systems are derived based on exponentially incremental dissipativity. The exponentially incremental dissipativity is preserved for the feedback-interconnected nonlinear stochastic switched systems with the composite state-dependent switching law; meanwhile, the incremental stability in probability is preserved under some certain conditions.

The observation error and observation speed of TDESO are also discussed. Then a nonlinear active disturbance rejection control system improved by TDESO for a linear plant is transformed into a Lurie system. Moreover, the circular criterion is used to analyse the absolute stability of the transformed Lurie system. Finally, TDESO is optimised and an improved linear state error feedback (PLSEF) is proposed to improve the rapidity of the system by using simulation and time domain analysis.

To achieve the optimal flight, the performance functions for each deputy satellite that can describe the satellite&#39;s contribution to the task are introduced. Here, the performance functions can be time varying, which generally changes the problem from finding the fixed optimal point to tracking the optimal trajectory.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a sliding mode control (SMC) based framework to design a stabilizing controller for uncertain fractional order time-delay systems (FOTDS) using the Lambert W function technique. This technique is exploited to design the fractional order (FO) sliding manifold which provides a constructive method to design an FO sliding manifold as compared to the other methods. A stabilizing switching controller is derived, that ensures the finite time reachability of the system trajectories to the sliding manifold for all subsequent time. Moreover, the conventional SMC technique can be readily applied to a particular class of FOTDS with delay free sliding mode dynamics obtained through a specific transformation. A Duffing oscillator is considered here to illustrate the proficiency of the proposed approach. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in the presence of time delay and uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Battery emulation is essential for reliable testing of powertrains of electric and hybrid vehicles under repeatable conditions. For that purpose, a DC voltage controller provides fast reference tracking capabilities. Due to imperfect conversion of AC current to DC current, the DC voltage source of the battery emulator does not provide constant voltage but is subject to periodic fluctuations. This disturbance is propagated through the system to the battery emulator&#39;s output. In this paper, an observer-based compensation strategy is deployed. As the structure of the multiplicative perturbation is known, it is integrated into the battery emulator model yielding a state-affine system. An appropriate observer provides asymptotically correct estimates of the disturbance, which are then used to adequately manipulate the control variable without interfering with stability properties of the closed-loop system. Simulation and experimental results show the improvements achieved by the disturbance rejection.},

A novel robust distributed filter is proposed which takes stochastic parameter and topology uncertainties into full consideration but does not depend on any specific structure of uncertainties. By proper designing of the filter gain, the trace of estimation error covariance is minimised at each time step, where the new stochastic analysis and augmentation transformation techniques are developed to handle the challenges resulting from multiplicative stochastic uncertainties and sparse topology.

The main purpose of the problem under consideration is to design sampling-interval-dependent fault detection filters such that, in the simultaneous presence of nonuniform sampling, dynamic quantization, intermittent faults as well as missing measurements, the robustness of residuals with respect to the disturbance and the sensitivity of the residuals against the fault are guaranteed.

In this framework, each agent makes a decision to meet its own private objective with a given mask during state observation of the system and such a decision can be changed by the influence of other agents connected through a directed network. Agents with an initial decision of enabling or disabling of an event do not change their decision, but those agents reserving their decision in an undetermined way can change their decision to either enabling or disabling depending on the influence from other agents. We derive a condition for convergence of the decision of all agents. Based on the individual decision of each agent, the final decision for enabling or disabling of an event is made by majority rule.

The minimum-phase condition, as a common condition required for fault estimation, is released in the proposed methods. Method I implements fractional power of the so-called switching term to make it robust against matched faults and disturbances. Compared with previous terminal scheme, this method covers a wider class of systems. In Method II , fractional power sliding variable is considered to achieve finite time convergence of estimation errors and their derivatives.

The online computation of EMPC is to find the corresponding control law according to a given state, this is called the point location problem. This paper deals with efficient point location in larger polyhedral data sets. The authors propose a hybrid data structure, grid k-d tree (GKDT), which is constructed by the k-dimensional tree (k-d tree), hash table and binary search tree (BST). The main part of GKDT is a multiple branch tree which constructs subtrees by splitting the polyhedral region into several equal grids based on the k-d tree and is traversed by the hash function on each level. GKDT has a high search efficiency, even though it needs much more storage memory. A complexity analysis of the approach in the runtime and storage requirements is provided. Advantages of the method are supported by two examples in the paper.},

Leader-following heterogeneous multi-agents of first order having inherent nonlinear dynamics have been analysed to demonstrate efficacy and robustness of the proposed controller. In the first part, states of the follower agents have been attempted to be kept in consistence with those of the virtual leader using sliding mode control. In the second part, an event-based implementation of the control law has been incorporated to minimise the computational load on, and energy expenditure of the computational device equipped with the agents, while ensuring that the desired closed-loop performance of the system is not compromised. The advantage of using such a scheme, i.e. an event-based sliding mode controller, lies in the robustness capabilities of sliding mode controller and reduced computational expense of event-based mechanism.

Different from previous results, taking cases of randomly disconnected interconnections among these subsystems into account, a switched scheme is introduced to address the problem of failed interconnection. Meanwhile, an arbitrary switching signal is introduced to denote which one subsystem is activated at the instant of disconnection of interconnection. The filter is designed to guarantee the finite-time boundedness and the achievement of the H ∞ performance to the fault detection system. Sufficient conditions on the existence of desired filter are presented in term of feasible linear matrix inequalities by using the switched Lyapunov functional approach based on stochastic functional. Two examples are finally given to show the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a gain scheduling approach for achieving the consensus tracking of multi-agent systems with actuator saturation. We first construct a series of nesting ellipsoid invariant sets associated with consensus errors. When the consensus errors stay between the two ellipsoid invariant sets, the feedback gains keep constant, but when the consensus errors enter into the smaller ellipsoid invariant set, the feedback gains abruptly become larger. By combining this gain scheduling technique and the parametric Lyapunov equations, we, respectively, design state and output feedback gain scheduling protocols. Their main advantage, in comparison with the fixed case, is that the convergence rate of consensus tracking can be enhanced by scheduling the gain parameters. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.},

To this end, a game is formulated between the central planner and the sensors. Using this game, it is established that the central planner can enhance the quality of the estimate by rewarding each sensor based on the distance between the average of the received measurements and the measurement provided by the sensor. Optimal contracts are designed from the perspective of the budget required to achieve a specified level of error performance.},

The proposed boundary control achieved the fact that the vibration of the blade can still be suppressed even when the actuator fails, and the bending and torsional deformation is eventually reduced to zero.

Remarkably, the disturbance may be non-periodic, non-differentiable and/or of unknown magnitude, and hence some critical requirements on the disturbance in the existing related literature are successfully removed. Recognising that the strategies of disturbance compensation, such as internal model principle, sliding mode control method, learning method and active disturbance rejection control method, are quite hard or even impossible to apply, a time-varying design scheme is developed in the paper. Moreover, the serious unknowns and time-variations reflected in the growth rate of the system are also dealt with by the proposed scheme. By designing a time-varying output-feedback controller, all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are globally bounded, and the original system state and the observer state ultimately converge to zero.},

The aim of the reconciliator is to detect the presence of faults on the existing physical sensors and hide the corrupted measurements in the generation of a virtual output, which one would like to be generated in a reliable way in spite of fault occurrences and hence trustfully usable for control purposes. The sensor faults here considered are limited to variations of both sensor gain and offset values. The proposed approach envisages the use of an unknown input observers coupled with an ‘ad-hoc’ parameters estimator used to estimate online the sensor effectiveness matrix at each time instant. In the paper, two design methodologies are described, based one on the linear parameter varying polytopic formulation and the other on the linear fractional transformation paradigm. All main properties of the considered schemes are investigated and rigorously proved.},

Based on the estimates of the fuzzy observer, an Integral Terminal Sliding Mode Controller that guarantees finite time convergence of the states to a small neighbourhood of zero, even under impaired conditions, is developed. Stability analysis was carried over using the Lyapunov method. The proposed approach was implemented to a quadrotor UAV and its performance was assessed under nominal conditions, and by subjecting the quadrotor to disturbances, simultaneously occurring actuator faults and input saturation limits.

Algorithms have been developed to find sets of sensors that make faults detectable and isolable under ideal circumstances. However, due to model uncertainties and measurement noise, different sets of sensors result in different achievable diagnosability performance in practice. In this paper, the sensor selection problem is formulated to ensure that the set of sensors fulfils required performance specifications when model uncertainties and measurement noise are taken into consideration. However, the algorithms for finding the guaranteed global optimal solution are intractable without exhaustive search. To overcome this problem, a greedy stochastic search algorithm is proposed to solve the sensor selection problem. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the greedy stochastic search in finding sets close to the global optimum in short computational time.},

For a given high-order system that is stable and NI, our goal is to approximate it by a low-order NI system so that the H 2 H 2 H2 norm of the approximation error system is minimised. By using the Galerkin projection, the H 2 H 2 H2 model reduction problem is formulated as a minimisation problem over the Stiefel manifold. The first-order necessary condition is derived for the construction of a local optimal reduced-order system. A gradient descent algorithm is provided to solve the first-order necessary condition. The resulting reduced-order system preserves the stability and the NI structure of the original system. Finally, two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed H 2 model reduction method.},

In this setup, all agents coordinate with their neighbours to seek the consensus point that minimises the network&#39;s global objective function. In the current paper, we consider agents with single-integrator and double-integrator dynamics. Further, it is supposed that agents&#39; movements are limited by some convex inequality constraints.

  abstract     = {We revisit the issue of quadratic gain-scheduled and robust state-feedback control with a focus on linear matrix inequalities widely used in the literature. It has been established that for continuous-time linear parameter-varying systems which depend affinely on the scheduling parameter, gain-scheduled stabilisability implies robust stabilisability. In other words, as far as stabilisation is concerned, using a more complex gain-scheduled controller is not advantageous. The proof of such equivalence is non constructive and, although very general, limited to stabilisability. One contribution of the present paper is to establish constructive proofs in the quadratic case that can be extended to performance optimisation in terms of quadratic H 2 and H ∞ norms. One issue investigated in detail is the strategy of using pre-filters to handle parameter-variation in the input matrix. Our results show that said technique, which has been popular since the 1980s, is rarely productive in the sense that solvability of quadratic gain-scheduled control design problems for the original system augmented with an arbitrary pre-filter implies existence of a lower-dimensional quadratic robust controller for the original system, which we construct explicitly via projections.},

This results in impulsive effects on the overall tracking errors. The relationship of finite time interval against desired overall tracking errors and control parameter is derived quantitatively for the multi-agent relay tracking system. Moreover, stability conditions for the system with disturbances and impulsive effects are obtained. Performance of proposed relay tracking strategy and correctness of derived results on stability over finite time intervals are demonstrated by a set of simulations.},

And here, internal delays, white noise and Lévy noise are considered in the networks. To ensure stability of SCSTLN with a periodically intermittent controller, several simple and useful criteria are obtained by establishing a new differential inequality and using a graph-theoretic approach. The intensity of control is closely related to the coupling strength and the perturbed intensity of white noise and Lévy noise. In particular, the stabilisation of stochastic coupled oscillators with time-varying delays and Lévy noise on a network as a practical application of our theoretical results is studied. Finally, a numerical example about oscillators network is carried out to show the validity and feasibility of our analytical results.},

The considered class of large-scale systems consist of physically interconnected and generally heterogeneous modules, where local control signals can only be applied to a subset of these modules (i.e. active modules) and the rest do not admit any control signals (i.e. passive modules). Specifically, based on a set-theoretic model reference adaptive control approach predicated on restricted potential functions, we design and analyse decentralised command following control laws for each active module such that they can effectively perform their tasks in the presence of unknown physical interconnections between modules and module-level system uncertainties. The key feature of our framework allows the system error trajectories of the active modules to be contained within a-priori, user-defined compact sets. Thus, they are guaranteed to achieve strict performance guarantees, where this is of paramount importance for practical applications. In addition to our theoretical findings and research contributions, the efficacy of the proposed decentralised adaptive control architecture is demonstrated in an illustrative numerical example.},

The exposed solution is based on quaternion representation and self-adapts to the characteristics of the payload it tries to stabilise. Proposed control law ensures the stability of the system whatever the required orientation path is. Although only simulation has been performed to check the performances of such control, results look very promising compared to non-adaptive controls and may help to construct more polyvalent and efficient gimbals which would further facilitate their expansion.

For discussing the problem, positive definite matrices without neglecting any element are employed to construct a novel parameter-dependent Lyapunov function. Based on the Lyapunov function, some relaxed sufficient conditions are derived to hold the freedom in searching feasible solutions. Furthermore, an extended projective lemma is developed to convert those conditions into Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) form. Solving these LMI conditions, controller gain and observer gain can be simultaneously obtained in one-step procedure via using convex optimization algorithm. Therefore, an observer-based controller can be established to guarantee the asymptotical stability of the multiplicative noised LPV systems in the sense of mean square. At last, two numerical examples are used to show effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design method.},

First, based on the controllable state set, a controllability criterion is obtained in terms of the controllability matrix corresponding to the switching sequence. Next, by virtue of the subspace sequence, two necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions are established for controllability in terms of the system matrices corresponding to all the possible topologies. Furthermore, controllability is considered from the graphic perspective. It is proved that the system is controllable if the union graph of all the possible topologies is controllable. With respect to observability, two sufficient and necessary conditions are derived by taking advantage of the system matrices and the corresponding invariant subspace, respectively. Finally, some simulation examples are worked out to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, both linear extended state observer (ESO) and nonlinear ESO with homogeneous weighted functions are proposed for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems composed of coupled subsystems with large stochastic uncertainties. The stochastic uncertainties in each subsystem including internal coupled unmodelled dynamics and external stochastic disturbance without known statistical characteristics are lumped together as the stochastic total disturbance (extended state) of each subsystem. The linear ESO and nonlinear ESO are designed separately for real-time estimation of not only the unmeasured state but also the stochastic total disturbance of each subsystem. The practical mean square convergence of these two classes of ESOs are developed. Some numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ESOs with the advantages of smaller peaking values and more accurate estimation by the nonlinear ESO.},

The exosystems are extended to generate ramp signals and general family of polynomial signals. The system decomposition is applied through the state transformation and yields a decoupled equivalent system. Based on the decoupled form, the backstepping transformation is applied and then in the new coordinate, the full state and output-feedback regulators are designed, respectively. For the state feedback regulator, the corresponding regulator equation is obtained and its solvability conditions are provided to facilitate the regulator design and feasibility. The design of observer-based regulator is based on the decoupling of the observer error system into a PDE subsystem and an ODE subsystem so that the backstepping approach achieves stabilisation by eigenvalue assignment leading to design of observer stabilizing gains.},

By incorporating adaptive control, neural networks (NNs), the high-gain observer (HGO) and the minimal learning parameter (MLP) algorithm in the backstepping procedure, a novel adaptive output-feedback formation control scheme is developed. We show that formation errors can be guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) with the proposed controller. Compared with existing methods, the formation can be achieved only with position and yaw angle of both leader and follower. Meanwhile, the developed scheme can enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system with less computational effort, where only two online parameters need to be tuned.

Its essence is the decomposition of the partial-observation monolithic supervisor into partial-observation local controllers for individual controllable events. In this paper, we extend the partial-observation supervisor localisation to large-scale DES, for which the monolithic supervisor may be incomputable. Specifically, we first employ an efficient heterarchical supervisor synthesis procedure to compute a heterarchical array of partial-observation decentralised supervisors and partial-observation coordinators . Then, we localise each of these supervisors/coordinators into partial-observation local controllers . This procedure suggests a systematic approach to the distributed control of large-scale DES under partial observation. The results are illustrated by a system of automatic guided vehicles serving a manufacturing workcell.},

The goal is to achieve desirable tracking performance with a simple and low-cost control strategy. By introducing a new form of parameter estimation error, together with an error transformation, a robust adaptive and fault-tolerant control scheme is developed without the need for fault information nor precise robotic mathematical model. It is shown that, with the proposed control, the tracking error is ensured to converge to an adjustable residual set within prescribed finite time at a user pre-assignable decay rate. The appealing feature of the developed control also lies in its simplicity in structure (i.e. PID form) and effectiveness in dealing with modelling uncertainties as well as actuation faults.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the challenges of designing feedback controllers for spatially distributed systems, we present an efficient approach to obtaining the frequency response of such systems, from which low-order models can be identified. This is achieved by combining the frequency responses of constituent lower-order subsystems in a way that exploits the interconnectivity arising from spatial discretisation. This approach extends to the singular subsystems that arise upon spatial discretisation of systems governed by PDAEs, with fluid flows being a prime example. The main result of this paper is a proof that the computational complexity of forming the overall frequency response is minimised if the subsystems are merged in a particular fashion. Doing so reduces the complexity by several orders of magnitude; a result demonstrated upon the numerical example of a spatially discretised wave-diffusion equation. By avoiding the construction, storage, or manipulation of large-scale system matrices, this modelling approach is well conditioned and computationally tractable for spatially distributed systems consisting of enormous numbers of subsystems, therefore bypassing many of the problems with conventional model reduction techniques.},

This paper provides a new, different method to solve absolutely minimal realisation problems. By methods of limits and algebraic techniques, without using the symbolic approach by Gröbner basis, the requirements of absolutely minimal realisation are transformed into a system of equations represented by the determinants. Since the equations for first-degree 2D systems are solvable by quadratic equations and the conditions for higher-dimensional realisations can be expressed by the results of 2D systems, the absolutely minimal realisations for n D systems can be found by using the realisations of n ( n − 1)/2 2D systems. Furthermore, the conditions for existence and construction of the absolutely minimal realisation for the lack of items and not missing two cases are derived from the Pfaffian function of the skew-symmetric matrix. Finally, two numerical examples for 3D and 4D systems are presented to illustrate the basic ideas as well as the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.},

The considered power network is partitioned into control areas, where each area is modelled by an equivalent generator including second-order turbine-governor dynamics, and where the areas are nonlinearly coupled through the power flows. Asymptotic convergence to the desired state is established by constraining the state of the power network on a suitably designed sliding manifold. This manifold is designed relying on stability considerations made on the basis of an incremental energy (storage) function.

In literature this task has been accomplished by adopting nonlinear model-based control strategies. To exploit the flexibility of the linear control design techniques, a linear model of the UCG process has been developed, which retains the dynamics of the nonlinear model around the operating point of interest. To account for external disturbance and modelling inaccuracies, an output-based robust multi-objective H 2 / H ∞ control law integrated with pole placement has been proposed. The problem is solved by formulating linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints for performance and robustness. The simulation results show that the designed controller gives adequate performance in the presence of modelling inaccuracies and external disturbance. Moreover, it has been shown that performance of the designed controller is better as compared to the standard PI controller.},

We formulate the traffic allocation problem as a network utility maximisation problem with link capacity constraints. This optimisation problem is challenging because of the non-concavity of the utility functions and the lack of global information. We overcome the difficulty by designing a class of fully distributed traffic allocation control laws, which requires a minimum communication workload.

We hypothesise that travelling-wave oscillations observed in undulatory locomotion can be characterised as a natural oscillation of the locomotion dynamics and propose a formal definition of the natural gait for locomotion systems. We identify the essential dynamics and define the mode shape of natural oscillation by the free response of an idealised system. We then use body-environment resonance to define the amplitude and frequency. Explicit formulas for the natural gait are derived to provide insight into the mechanisms underlying undulatory locomotion. Examples of a swimming leech and a fictitious swimmer illustrate how undulatory gaits similar to those observed can be produced as the natural gait and modulated to achieve different swim speeds.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a numerical and experimental study of a setup which mimics the famous ‘sympathy’ of pendulum clocks experiment conducted by Christian Huygens. The setup consists of two pendula (metronomes) installed on a platform which can move either in horizontal or vertical direction. Existence and co-existence of different synchronisation regimes is studied both experimentally and numerically. The main contribution of the paper reveals that the stability onsets of those modes resemble behaviour of systems with auto-parametric resonance. Therefore, the resonances of translational frequency of the platform and rotational frequency of metronomes induce different types of synchronous behaviour. This novel approach turns out to be more insightful then an analysis of how the platform mass and/or the spring stiffness influence the stability onsets.},

  abstract     = {In Panteley and Loria (2017), a framework for the study of synchronisation and collective behaviour of networked heterogeneous systems was introduced. It was underlined that in such scenario an emergent collective behaviour arises, one that is inherent to the network and that is independent of the interconnection strength. Therefore, the natural way to make complete study of synchronisation is by investigating, on one hand, the stability of the emergent dynamical system and, on the other, by assessing the difference between the motion of each individual system and that of the emergent one. Thus, if all systems&#39; motions approach that of the emergent dynamics, we say that they reach dynamic consensus. In this paper, we study dynamic consensus of a fairly general class of nonlinear heterogeneous oscillators, called Stuart–Landau. We establish that the emergent dynamics consists in that of an ‘averaged’ oscillator with a global attractor that consists in a limit-cycle and, moreover, we determine its frequency of oscillation. Then, we show that the heterogeneous oscillators achieve practical dynamic consensus, that is, their synchronisation errors measured relative to the collective motion are ultimately bounded.},

By virtue of its ET nature, the algorithm can be used as the kernel of a robust networked control system. The design objective is indeed to reduce the number of transmissions over the network. The proposed ET-VSC also guarantees appropriate robustness properties, even in the presence of delayed transmissions. It is theoretically analysed, proving that the sliding variable associated with the controlled system results in being ultimately confined into a boundary layer of prescribed amplitude. As a consequence, it is proved that the state of the considered uncertain nonlinear system is ultimately bounded as well. Moreover, a lower bound for the time elapsed between consecutive triggering events is provided, which excludes the notorious Zeno behaviour. Finally, the designed ET-VSC control scheme is satisfactorily assessed in simulation.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a variable structure control design method for linear and nonlinear continuous-time systems with a special type of sliding sector using a new equivalent sector control. The PR-sliding sector is the subset of state space in which the derivative of the square P -norm of the state, ∥ x ∥ 2 P ∥ x ∥ P 2 ∥x∥P2 , is less than or equal to − x T R x − x T R x −xTRx with a positive semi-definite matrix R = C T C R = C T C R=CTC where ( A , C ) ( A , C ) (A,C) is observable. The new equivalent sector control provides the derivative of v = s ( x ) − δ ( x ) v = s ( x ) − δ ( x ) v=s(x)−δ(x) being negative. The design method of s ( x ) and δ ( x ) is proposed for the general linear single input system by using the Riccati equation. Under the proposed equivalent sector control, the state trajectory may jump at the particular uncontrollable states when ∂ v / ∂ u = 0 , and the control is set zero. If v becomes positive, the state is outside of the sector, and then the state shall be transferred to the inside of the sector by the discontinuous nonlinear control input. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method gives satisfactory results.},

The delay is assumed to be unknown, bounded, and it can be time-varying with no restriction on its rate of change. The observer uses auxiliary signals related to the constructibility Gramian of the system and it contains nonlinearities that provide a uniform fixed-time convergence to a bounded region in the estimation error coordinates. This means that the convergence time can be bounded by a positive constant which is independent from the initial conditions and the initial time. This property is new for the addressed class of systems. The ultimate bound of the estimation error depends on the maximum difference between the nominal output and the delayed one, and not directly on the delay size or its time derivative. These properties are illustrated in a numerical simulation.},

We exploit recent results related to the structural properties and normal forms of this class of systems and propose a robust control that asymptotically recovers, in practical terms, the performance of a nominal, though non-implementable, stabilising control. The proposed control combines a partial output feedback control, aimed at letting the system behave as a regular system, and a robust control, based on an extended observer, using which the dynamic of the closed loop system is rendered arbitrarily close to the one of a properly selected stable system. The extended observer, originally conceived in the context of standard differential systems, is here shown to be the key ingredient for robustly stabilising the targeted class of differential-algebraic systems.},

This paper presents a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for rollover prevention through active front steering. A new Rollover Index (RI) and a specified vehicle model are proposed to realise an effective rollover prevention approach. The new RI is represented by vehicle parameters and state variables so that it can be readily incorporated into the MPC objective function. Using a barrier cost function, the proposed MPC controller limits vehicle maneuvers within a safe region of rollover without sacrificing vehicle maneuverability under normal conditions. The roll dynamics, the tire nonlinearity, the lateral load transfer, and the road bank are considered for vehicle modelling to provide appropriate actions at the threshold of a rollover. An affine tire model is used to handle tire nonlinearity in the MPC structure. A high-fidelity CarSim model for an SUV is employed to evaluate the proposed RI and the MPC controller. Simulation results show the reliability of the proposed RI and the effectiveness of the proposed rollover prevention controller for different rollover situations.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates model predictive control (MPC) of linear systems subject to arbitrary (possibly unbounded) stochastic disturbances. An MPC approach is presented to account for hard input constraints and joint state chance constraints in the presence of unbounded additive disturbances. The Cantelli–Chebyshev inequality is used in combination with risk allocation to obtain computationally tractable but accurate surrogates for the joint state chance constraints when only the mean and variance of the arbitrary disturbance distributions are known. An algorithm is presented for determining the optimal feedback gain and optimal risk allocation by iteratively solving a series of convex programs. The proposed stochastic MPC approach is demonstrated on a continuous acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation process, which is used in the production of biofuels.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the problem of constraint management in Linear Periodic (LP) systems using Reference Governors (RG). First, we introduce the periodic-invariant maximal output admissible sets for LP systems. We extend the earlier results in the literature to Lyapunov stable LP systems with output constraints, which arise in RG applications. We show that, while the invariant sets for these systems may not be finitely determined, a finitely-determined inner approximation, which is periodically invariant, can be obtained by constraint tightening. We then analyze the geometric and algebraic relationship between these sets and show that these sets are related via simple transformations, implying that it suffices to compute only one of them for real-time applications. This greatly reduces the memory burden of RG (or other similar constraint management strategies), at the expense of an increase in processing requirements. We present a thorough analysis of this trade-off. In the second part of this paper, we present two RG formulations, and discuss their properties and algorithms for their computation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.},

While earlier work has indicated that the default solutions from conventional predictive control algorithms are often poor, very little work has proposed systematic alternatives. This paper proposes an embedding structure for utilising advance information on target changes within an optimum predictive control law. The proposed embedding is shown to be systematic and beneficial. Moreover, it allows for easy extension to deal with more challenging scenarios such as unreachable set points and guarantees of convergence/stability in the uncertain case.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a sampled-data nonlinear model predictive control scheme is developed. The control algorithm uses a prediction horizon with variable length, a terminal constraint set, and a feedback controller defined on this set. Following a suboptimal solution strategy, a defined number of steps of an iterative optimisation routine improve the current input trajectory at each sampling point. The value of the objective function monotonically decreases and the state converges to a target set. A discrete-time formulation of the algorithm and a discrete-time design model ensure high computational efficiency and avoid an ad hoc quasi-continuous implementation. This design technique for a fast sampled-data nonlinear model predictive control algorithm is the main contribution of the paper. Based on a benchmark control problem, the performance of the developed control algorithm is assessed against state-of-the-art nonlinear model predictive control methods available in the literature. This assessment demonstrates that the developed control algorithm stabilises the system with very low computational effort. Hence, the algorithm is suitable for real-time control of fast dynamical systems.},

  abstract     = {Linear model predictive control (MPC) can be currently deployed at outstanding speeds, thanks to recent progress in algorithms for solving online the underlying structured quadratic programs. In contrast, nonlinear MPC (NMPC) requires the deployment of more elaborate algorithms, which require longer computation times than linear MPC. Nonetheless, computational speeds for NMPC comparable to those of MPC are now regularly reported, provided that the adequate algorithms are used. In this paper, we aim at clarifying the similarities and differences between linear MPC and NMPC. In particular, we focus our analysis on NMPC based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme, as this technique has been successfully tested and, in some applications, requires computational times that are only marginally larger than linear MPC. The goal of the paper is to promote the understanding of RTI-based NMPC within the linear MPC community.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing deployment of battery storage devices in residential electricity networks, it is essential that the charging and discharging of these devices be scheduled so as to avoid adverse impacts on the electricity distribution network. In this paper, we propose a non-cooperative, price-based hierarchical distributed optimisation approach that provably recovers the centralised, or cooperative, optimal performance from the point of view of the network operator. The distributed optimisation algorithm provides important insights into the appropriate design of contracts between an energy provider and their associated residential customers, who can themselves act as energy providers as well as consumers (e.g. due to rooftop solar photovoltaics and batteries) depending on the time of the day and on real-time prices. To make the presentation self-contained, and to highlight key properties of the price-based optimisation algorithm, the dual ascent method and its convergence properties are reviewed. The performance of the proposed price-based optimisation algorithm is validated on recent measurement taken from an Australian electricity distribution company, Ausgrid. In addition to analysing the results of the open loop solution, we investigate the effect of real-time prices in the closed loop using a model predictive control framework.},

A structured algorithm is devised for computing the Newton-like steps of primal-dual interior-point methods for solving a particular re-formulation of the problem as a quadratic program. This algorithm has the following properties: ( i ) the computation cost scales linearly in the number of subsystems along the cascade; and ( ii ) the computations can be distributed across a linear processor network, with localised problem data dependencies between the processor nodes and low communication overhead. The computation cost of the approach, which is based on a fixed permutation of the primal and dual variables, scales cubically in the time horizon of the original optimal control problem. Limitations in these terms are explored as part of a numerical example. This example involves application of the main results to model data for the cascade dynamics of an automated irrigation channel in particular.},

  abstract     = {Real-time implementation of optimisation-based control and trajectory planning can be very challenging for nonlinear systems. As a result, if an implementation based on a fixed linearisation is not suitable, the nonlinear problems are typically locally approximated online, in order to leverage the speed and robustness of embedded solvers for convex quadratic programs (QP) developed during the last decade. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that, using simple standard building blocks from nonlinear programming, combined with a structure-exploiting linear system solver, it is possible to achieve computation times in the range typical of solvers for QPs, while retaining nonlinearities and solving the nonlinear programs (NLP) to local optimality. The implemented algorithm is an interior-point method with approximate Hessians and adaptive barrier rules, and is provided as an extension to the C code generator FORCES. Three detailed examples are provided that illustrate a significant improvement in control performance when solving NLPs, with computation times that are comparable with those achieved by fast approximate schemes and up to an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art interior-point solver IPOPT.},

Our heuristic is based on a variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), an algorithm for solving convex optimisation problems. We discuss the favourable computational aspects of our algorithm, which allow it to run quickly even on very modest computational platforms such as embedded processors. We give several examples for which an approximate solution should be found very quickly, such as management of a hybrid-electric vehicle drivetrain and control of switched-mode power converters. Our numerical experiments suggest that our method is very effective in finding a feasible point with small objective value; indeed, we see that in many cases, it finds the global solution.},
