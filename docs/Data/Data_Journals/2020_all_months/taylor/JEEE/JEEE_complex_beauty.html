We carried out this study to determine whether the variation of floral aperture, floral display and environmental factors throughout the day influence the foraging activity and composition of bee visitors in (G. Don) Dandy. This research was conducted at the Chamela Biological Station, UNAM, Jalisco, Mexico. During anthesis, we collected bees and recorded the foraging behavior hourly. We measured hourly the environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity), floral aperture, floral display and floral reward. Using generalized linear mixed-effects models we tested which of the factors have more influence on floral aperture and foraging activity. To determine the dissimilarity of the species composition between the hours sampled, we used a one-way analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). We found that light intensity and humidity affected the floral aperture. Likewise, floral aperture, light intensity, temperature and time of day had a higher influence on the frequency of visitation and composition of bee species. When flowers were fully open, we recorded a greater number of bees and species. We observed two types of foraging behavior: bees collecting resources from the top of the flower (pollen gatherers) and bees within the flower avoiding the anthers and stigma (nectar gatherers). The total number of pollen gatherers recorded during our observations was greater than nectar gatherers, suggesting that this is the main floral reward. The species that had the pollen gathering behavior were mainly big bees, and , these are the potential pollinators because of their direct contact with the reproductive parts of the flower. Our results show floral aperture and environmental factors in combination influenced the foraging activity of bees, promoting changes in bee community composition throughout the day.},

Here we studied the diet of three terrestrial frogs ( sp., and ) at a riverbank exposed only during the dry season in the Brazilian Cerrado biome. Diets overlapped more than expected by chance and were composed mainly of social insects (ants and termites). Prey volumes were not related to the size of frogs or their head measurements. Frogs at the riverbank ingested less prey categories and fewer prey items in comparison to studies conducted in more stable and complex environments. We suggest that frogs were attracted to riverbanks by the humidity and availability of reproductive sites, opportunistically ingesting prey available in the habitat. The abundance of social insects allowed the presence of frogs specialized in ants, such as the bufonid and the dendrobatid .},

Secondary sexual characters such as bird body size and plumage coloration are some of the traits which may indicate individual condition because they are negatively affected by parasites and thus ultimately influence mate choice. In this study, we tested if hemoparasite occurrence and infection intensity are negatively related to morphological traits, immunological stress condition and plumage coloration brightness of the White-necked thrush . We captured and banded birds, identified age, took body measurements and took a picture of their ventral surface to calculate throat and collar feather brightness. We prepared blood smears to count leukocytes and to detect hemoparasites, using both microscopy and PCR to amplify haemosporidians’ DNA. We detected haemosporidians, microfilaria and in blood smears. Both microfilaria and haemosporidian intensities were negatively related to body mass, and only the second was related to age. Interestingly, haemosporidians’ occurrence positively affected throat brightness. In our study population, parasites (microfilaria and haemosporidians) are likely affecting White-necked thrush health such that infected individuals with higher throat brightness might be tolerant to haemosporidians. In conclusion, our results indicate that body morphometric traits and plumage coloration of the White-necked thrush population can be used as a visual indicator of parasite resistance.},

In the tropics, this relationship will continue throughout the year. Our study was conducted in a cerrado environment in Brazil, using a shrub with glandular trichomes, (Leguminosae Caesalpinioideae). We recorded phenological information, as well as the herbivorous insects and spiders present, on two groups of plants: a control group in which spiders were present and an experimental group in which spiders were removed. The results indicated that spiders had a positive indirect effect on plants by reducing leaf area loss and increasing seed set production, confirming our hypothesis. The benefits were higher in the rainy season, coinciding with the peak abundance of the spider species . Our results indicate that protection against herbivory by spiders in the tropical savanna is conditional on the abundance of predators over time.},

The volume that eggs occupy in the female abdomen may decrease female foraging ability by making them slower. Although females of all species are subjected to these potential costs, it remains an unexplored matter in invertebrates. Females of the spider carry their egg sac after oviposition and thus represent a unique opportunity to evaluate gravidity costs because females carry an extra volume before and after laying eggs. We conducted foraging ability experiments using females on different treatments regarding gravidity and maternal care. We first hypothesized that internal egg load and egg sac carrying decrease female foraging ability. We also hypothesized that greater egg sac size decreases female foraging ability. We found that both internal egg load and egg sac carrying decreased female foraging ability, and females about to oviposit had a similar foraging ability to females carrying an egg sac. Egg sac size did not influence female foraging ability. Our results show that females’ foraging ability changes before the maternal care period and therefore may influence their life-history evolution. The little support for our second hypothesis may also suggest that the decrease in foraging ability is not due to the volume being carried per se, but possibly an associated physiological state.},

  abstract     = {The ecology of tropical wildlife remains unknown for most nocturnal species owing to difficulties in performing night surveys. To improve our understanding of the ecology of nocturnal tropical birds, we monitored the calling activity of two Neotropical nightjars, the Little nightjar () and the Common pauraque (), over an annual cycle at four sites in the Brazilian Pantanal. The calling activity of both species was restricted to the nocturnal period and showed peaks of activity just before dawn and just after dusk. The Little nightjar was detected from early June to late January owing to the migratory habits of the species, while the Pauraque was detected throughout the year. Our results suggest that the breeding season of both species starts in August, and the nesting phase probably takes place in September at the end of the dry season. This might be related to the typical increase in arthropod abundance after the first rains in tropical habitats with seasonal rainfall. Future surveys of these species should be performed in the last fortnight of August at 5 am, a period during which the calling activity of both nightjars was maximum. Autonomous sound recorders should be left in the field for a minimum of 9 days to record a reliable vocal activity rate. Acoustic monitoring, coupled with automated signal recognition, has proven to be a useful tool for monitoring tropical nightjars and may be useful to increase our knowledge about the ecology of other nocturnal tropical species.},

Occasional pollen consumption was demonstrated only in a handful of ant species that are mainly lower-ranked in the competitive hierarchy. We hypothesized that the consumption of pollen by subordinate ants might be enhanced by competitive pressure exerted by dominant species. In the frame of the current study, we assessed the food preference of ant species within a supercolony of the territorial wood ant by offering them pollen and animal protein baits. Subordinate ant species, especially ants, exploited both pollen and animal protein, while foraged only for animal protein. The ants exploited pollen sources more intensively on plots where dominated animal protein baits, thus interspecific competition was stronger. As suggested by our study, under suboptimal conditions, where food availability is hindered, e.g. by the presence of superior competitors, pollen can, indeed, be used as a food source by subordinate ants.},

Flight initiation distance (FID) and the distance at which birds detect a threat, alert distance (AD), have been used as indicators of the ability of birds to detect potential predators. In this study we compared the two aforementioned measures of risk reaction for the House sparrow and the Orange-breasted bunting, two bird species inhabiting the same urban areas, and assessed if they were related with sex, flock size, and environmental factors. We performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to explore the relationships between environmental factors and ADs and FIDs. Both behavioral responses were significantly lower for House sparrows. Although we did not find significant relationships between the assessed variables (sex, flock size, environmental factors) and bunting ADs and FIDs, we did find House sparrow males to be bolder (showing shorter ADs and FIDs), as well as larger ADs and FIDs for sparrows with increasing flock size. House sparrow ADs and FIDs were positively related with herbaceous plant cover and negatively related with minimum building height. In general, House sparrows showed to be bolder than Orange-breasted buntings, with differential responses of the sparrow related with sex, flock size, and different environmental factors. Having recorded bolder House sparrow males could be due to increases in aggressiveness related to the breeding season. Our results add to the lacking behavioral information available for the endemic Orange-breasted bunting and provide insights on the variation of the behavior of House sparrows in small urban areas.},

A principal component analysis determined the abiotic factors that explained most of the data variations, then a multivariate permutational variance analysis showed significant differences in abiotic variables between the dry and rainy periods. The shrimp were more abundant during the dry season compared to the rainy season, and the species was more abundant than the species across both periods. Additionally, redundancy analysis for each seasonal period indicated that seasonal abiotic factor variations caused different responses in the abundance of intrapopulation groups (females, males and juveniles) in the two studied shrimp species. The present results suggest that related shrimp species may present different responses to seasonal abiotic factor variations, suggesting these ecological differences may be crucial to ensure a stable coexistence. Moreover, high plasticity appears to provide and a good adaptation, especially to life in reservoirs, which are unstable environments.},

  abstract     = {The chamois is widely perceived as a strictly high-elevation ungulate, though its spatial behavior suggests fairly high phenotypic plasticity and long-range dispersal abilities. Here, we describe and discuss five events of ‘unconventional’ habitat use by chamois, i.e., individuals found swimming in the sea of Croatia and Spain, between 2004 and 2019.In four cases, sex, age, swimming distance and direction were recorded. The chamois were young males up to 5 years of age, with swimming distances of ca 300 to 3300 m. In Croatia, two individuals were found swimming across sea stretches and one towards the coast; in Spain the chamois was seemingly swimming towards the open sea.The reasons for such unusual behavior remain unknown. Although it might represent the outcome of a maladaptive combination of physiological needs (e.g., individual attempts to disperse) and constraining casualties (e.g., environmental or anthropogenic barriers), the limited information suggests caution in interpretation. Swimming behavior in chamois is not new. To our knowledge, however, this is the first reported information on the use of sea stretches, which suggests that even medium sized water courses and lakes are unlikely to fully block chamois movements.},

  abstract     = {In many species, males show anticipatory plasticity for sperm production, which they adjust to match perceived mating opportunities. While the strategic adjustment of sperm production is likely to be beneficial, it may be also associated with costs, including those arising from the expression of a phenotype that is poorly matched to the conditions that males will subsequently experience. Mismatch costs are exacerbated by trade-offs between investment in the ejaculate and investment in other traits and by trade-offs among individual ejaculate traits. Trade-offs, in fact, may determine a decrease in male competitiveness, due to impaired ability to obtain copulations or to reduced ejaculate quality. We explored mismatch costs using male guppies, which are known to increase sperm production, but reduce their investment in sexual behaviour, when maintained in the presence of females. Increasing ejaculate size in the absence of females could impose costs that would be paid when an opportunity to mate eventually arises. One of such costs may involve male post-copulatory competitiveness and may be associated with increased sperm senescence. To explore mismatch costs, firstly we induced two groups of males to differentiate their sperm production by exposing them or not to female stimuli. Then, we isolated them to prevent matings and have their sperm ageing. Finally, we compared ejaculate quality between the groups. Contrary to expectations, we found that female-stimulated males did not suffer from increased sperm senescence. These costs are probably minimized by the high level of plasticity associated with this trait, resulting in sperm production being quickly re-adjusted to a new environment. Other types of mismatch costs may be more relevant, for example, those related to trade-offs with sexual behaviour.},

Based on direct field observation, we recorded six interaction behaviors between mothers and their juvenile offspring at nighttime and during the daylight period. The frequencies and proportions of each behavior recorded were analyzed for both conditions, and qualitative descriptions of each behavior were made. Observations revealed that the percentage of proximity in the dyads tended to increase at nighttime compared to the daylight period. In one of the dyads, we observed that the percentage of grooming also showed an upward tendency at nighttime compared to the daylight period. The dyads remained together to sleep during all 8 days of the study and were seen to seek arm-in-arm contact and to perform grooming behaviors. Our results suggest that mother–juvenile interaction at the onset of the juvenile period in spider monkeys may be characterized by greater proximity and social grooming behaviors, while the nocturnal observations suggest a strong attachment between mothers and their juveniles in this stage.},

The brood reduction hypothesis predicts that hatching asynchrony is a strategy that facilitates the partial success of brood, as feeding to old and large nestlings which results in adaptive brood reduction under periods of food shortage. Using stochastic simulation, we tested and specified the outcome of the brood reduction hypothesis with various provisioning variables of birds to investigate under what conditions the brood reduction effectively explains the evolution of hatching asynchrony. Asynchronous hatching can be productive as provisioning by parents is preferentially feeding to old nestlings when food is not sufficiently available, while it did not create substantial differences in the number of nestlings fledged when food was equally allocated to all nestlings. Secondly, in the case where food items are large and fewer deliveries are needed, asynchronous hatching becomes more favoured compared to smaller, more frequently delivered, food items. Also, when parents provision less food than was needed on bad days, hatching asynchrony became favoured even when the bad days occur infrequently. Different life traits of each bird can change the expectation of the brood reduction hypothesis.},

This circumstance promotes male-male competition that in turns influences the copulatory behavior. Thus, olfactory and visual cues of rivals, in laboratory conditions, shorten the ejaculation latency. Other studies focusing in the presence of a rival found the increment in the sperm number. Until now it is unknown if the simultaneous presence of two males simultaneously influences the copulatory performance and seminal characteristics. Thus, the aim of the present work was to evaluate if sexual competition modifies the copulatory behavior, the sperm number and seminal plug. Sexually experienced Wistar rats were tested in two different copulatory contexts. Non-competitive mating (one male-one female), and competitive mating (two males-one female). The copulatory (mounts, intromissions and ejaculation) and seminal parameters (sperm count and copulatory plug) were analyzed. We found that under competition, there was a shortening of the ejaculation latency due to the reduction in the inter-intromission interval and in the number of intromissions. Respect to the ejaculate, the sperm number increased drastically but the seminal plug maintain its size and weight characteristics. Therefore, sexual competition in male rats affects copulatory behavior and sperm count but not the seminal plug.},

Several reports of declines come from Atlantic Forest, which currently holds only 1.62\% of natural vegetation under full protection. However, despite this degradation, the Atlantic Forest still shelters a great diversity of anurans with a high diversity of specific ecological characteristics. Thus, our objective was to identify which ecological characteristics of anurans from the Atlantic Forest can be associated to this extinction risk, in order to understand how these characteristics can promote the species persistence against environmental disturbance. For each species, we gathered biological/ecological characteristics from literature, as well the extinction risk based on the National List of Endangered Species of Wildlife. In 2015, 547 anuran species had been assigned to the Atlantic Forest, of which 406 had their extinction risk defined. However, we considered only 295 species in our analyses due to the availability of biological/ecological information. We observed that the clutch size and the altitudinal distribution are related to the extinction risk of anurans. Threatened species had a small clutch size and were distributed in low or high areas, whereas non-threatened species had a larger clutch size and were distributed in intermediate altitude areas. Studies that investigate ecological characteristics that determine the extinction risk of species can be useful to assist conservation actions, concentrating efforts to species more sensitive to environmental alterations, besides highlighting the importance of natural history and the ecology of organisms in conservation decisions.},

  abstract     = {Investigating biogeographical variations in diet composition can help understand the adaptability and generalism of species. Although the dietary adaptability of omnivorous mesocarnivores is well established, far less work has explored how more specialist hypercarnivores optimise their diets. By reviewing 11 studies of the leopard cat (), we quantitatively examined how dietary composition varies over the wide range of biomes they occupy in Asia. Specifically, we contrasted the diet of the Iriomote Island sub-species (south-western Japan), where native rodents are absent, with that of the mainland. Leopard cat diet typically comprised mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates. In Iriomote Island, however, the low relative frequency of occurrence of small mammals (only introduced rats) was compensated by higher frequencies of reptiles and amphibians compared to the mainland. Consequently, trophic diversity and dietary niche breadth were higher for leopard cats in Iriomote Island than for the mainland. This shows that even hypercarnivorous species can use trophic plasticity to adapt to local prey availability. Given that rodent numbers often fluctuate substantially over time, the availability of alternative prey, such as herptiles, may be vital for the conservation of the leopard cat, and especially the critically endangered Iriomote cat. More generally, the trophic versatility of hypercarnivores must be considered when assessing their vulnerability to environmental change.},

  abstract     = {Ascertaining the risks and benefits of different behaviors is a central goal of research on territoriality. Although most territorial behavior is ritualized, with concomitant reduced risks for both residents and intruders, this ritualization is generally found to be underpinned by rare, highly consequential, interactions. The agonistic behavior of the intertidal owl limpet, involves defense of a feeding territory, and includes a relatively explosive thrusting response by territory holders against intruding conspecifics. We here ask whether this thrusting behavior is capable of entirely dislodging intruders from their rocky wave-swept substratum, thereby ridding the resident of future challenges by that intruder. Our field measurements of the strength of territorial thrusts, as well as thrust resistance, indicate that territorial limpets are strong enough to overcome the resistance of small to medium sized (&lt;40 mm) conspecifics encountered on their territories. Interestingly, at least 44\% of the limpets dislodged from the rock substratum during a retreat or territorial response survived in a new location. Growth of these survivors was at least as rapid as that of undisturbed limpets in the old location.We conclude that shell thrusting during the territorial response of can reduce the cost of territorial defense by dislodging smaller conspecifics, thereby eliminating them from all future interactions. Conversely, the risk incurred by these smaller conspecifics while intruding onto territories of larger individuals is likely mitigated by the surprisingly high survival rate, and subsequent normal growth, of dislodged limpets.},

Here, we studied the immune ability of guard bees, which represent an intermediate stage between house bees working inside the nest and foragers collecting resources outside, to assess if their specific task is associated with an immune specialization. Through immune challenge with Gram-negative bacteria , we compared the guards ability to clear bacterial cells from their haemolymph with respect to house bees and foragers. Our findings demonstrate that guards do not show an immune specialization linked to their task but seem to represent a transition also in terms of immunity, since their anti-bacterial response appears intermediate between house bees and foragers.},

A total of 163 nests were exhumed at Kingere beach, revealing that only 16.7\% of eggs produced hatchlings. In the 59\% of the nests, more than half of the eggs were dead and attacked by invertebrates and 94\% had at least one egg affected by invertebrates. The rate of eggs and SAGs (yolkless eggs) affected by invertebrates within a clutch ranged from 0\% to 100\%, with an average proportion of 39\% and 52\%, respectively. The most common invertebrates interacting with the eggs were ghost crabs and insects that affected 51\% and 82\% of the nests, respectively. Crab and insect co-occurred in 33\% of the affected nests. Ants, identified as (Emery 1901) were found in 56\% of the excavated nests. However, it was not possible to determine if the ants predated alive eggs or scavenged dead eggs. Very often, hundreds of ants were found dead within dead eggs. Termites and other invertebrates were associated with the clutch environment and identified as opportunistic feeders. An unusual ecological interaction within the leatherback clutches between termites and ants was found in 11\% of the nests. The abrupt transition between the soil forest and the beach might be favouring a thriving microbial and invertebrate activity in the sand profile that colonises the nests.},

  abstract     = {Animals need to recognise predators to assess threats and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Acoustic cues produced to attract mates may also be intercepted by predators, and signallers can use both visual and acoustic cues to detect predators and initiate escape or defensive behaviours. Here, to test whether Ueno’s brown frogs () advertising during daytime are able to visually and aurally recognize predatory birds, we monitored calling activity at 27 active breeding sites where birds were also known to occur. Based on visual and aural observations, frogs were significantly less likely to be calling when birds were present than when absent. However, we failed to determine whether male distinguished among predator and non-predator species, responding to the presence of all bird species with cessation of calling. While daytime calling activity decreased in the presence of birds, the maximum egg clutch count per site used as a proxy for reproductive output was unaffected by daytime presence of birds. Our results suggest that uses visual cues to detect disturbances, but that its ability to visually assess the risks posed by individual species is minimal.},

However, few studies have examined the changes in species abundance as an urban area grows. During a 5-year period, we monitored two populations of burrowing owls () nesting in separate urban areas with contrasting development and evaluated the tolerance of this species to increasing urbanization. The study was carried out in two small touristic coastal villages: Mar Chiquita and Camet Norte (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina). We digitalized satellite images and evaluated the interannual advance of the urbanized area at each village while simultaneously recording the changes in the number and location of burrowing owl nests. During the study period, the area occupied by buildings showed a slight change in Mar Chiquita (+ 17\%) and a great expansion in Camet Norte (+ 269\%). However, the number of owl nests increased in similar proportion in Mar Chiquita (+ 25\%) and Camet Norte (+ 26\%), and the maximum nest density was also similar for both villages (~ 0.14 nests/ha). Our results indicate that, unlike many raptors that are negatively affected by urbanization, burrowing owls may not be adversely impacted by nesting in areas with moderate levels of urban development.},

Recently, researchers reported observations of two crocodilian species apparently using sticks as lures to aid in the capture of nesting birds, but the evidence for the behavior was anecdotal and correlative. To explore the behavior in a more controlled situation we designed an experiment to explicitly test the ability of crocodilians to tailor stick-displaying behaviors to specific environmental contexts using four captive pond-dwelling American alligator () populations, two of which reside near bird rookeries and two of which do not. During bird nesting season we added sticks to each pond and observed the frequency with which each population exhibited stick-displaying behaviors. We found that in most comparisons the frequency of stick-displaying behavior did not differ between rookery and no-rookery sites, while in one comparison the alligators at a no-rookery site actually displayed the behavior more frequently than a paired rookery site. Our results do not generally support the hypothesis that crocodilians tailor stick-displaying behaviors to specific environmental contexts, therefore the hypothesis that crocodilians are true tool users is also called into question. Furthermore, our results suggest that experiments on captive populations are not the ideal way to study stick-displaying behavior because of issues like unrealistic alligator densities and food provisioning.},

  abstract     = {For many species, the highest predation rates are on the earliest life stages, favoring the early development of predator detection mechanisms. Aquatic larvae of Spotted salamanders, suffer very high mortality rates and juveniles are vulnerable to a new suite of terrestrial predators after metamorphosis. In some species, adult salamanders assess predation risk via chemical cues released by damaged conspecifics and some heterospecifics (“alarm cues”), but responses of larvae and metamorphs have not been tested. Our first experiment confirmed that field-caught, experienced larvae responded with fright to chemical cues of damaged conspecifics, but not to control cues or alarm cues from toad tadpoles. Responses of sedentary hatchlings in the next experiment indicated that the alarm cue was not present in damaged tissues of hatchlings (1-day-old), but was present by the time the larvae reached the age of 1 month. The third experiment tested responses of naïve lab-reared, free-swimming larvae to alarm cue. In contrast to the other two experiments, these larvae without experience did not distinguish between conspecific alarm cues and control stimuli, suggesting that either embryonic learning or reinforcement learning as larvae may be required to develop or maintain the alarm response. In the fourth experiment, post-metamorphic juveniles raised from field-experienced larvae significantly avoided alarm cues from conspecifics but not control stimuli, indicating that the production and recognition of alarm cues can be retained after metamorphosis. Our study provides the first evidence of chemical alarm cues produced by both larval and juvenile salamanders and indicates that alarm responses may vary according to experience.},

Decision making regarding predator avoidance is influenced by many abiotic and biotic factors because of the trade-off between predator avoidance and other contextual behaviours. Attractive sexual signals may elicit responses not only from potential mates, but also from predators. Therefore, female escape behaviour will be affected by the attractiveness of male signals. I examined the effect of attractiveness of male calling songs on the components of female escape behaviour [i.e., responsiveness to artificial predatory stimuli, alternative escape tactics (jumping or forward locomotion), and locomotor distance] in the field cricket . Although song attractiveness did not affect female escape behaviour, behavioural components showed high inter-individual variation. The results showed that escape behaviour exhibited high repeatability, and the consistency affects decision-making in terms of escape behaviour in field crickets.},

  abstract     = {Male courtship signals often stimulate female sense organs whose sensitivities originally evolved under natural selection. In classic female choice models of sexual selection, females can benefit from increasing their sensitivity and responsiveness to male stimuli; but in sexually antagonistic models, increased female sensitivity or responsiveness to males could increase the costs that females are thought to suffer from male stimulation. We tested these contrasting expectations in a previously discovered sexually dimorphic trait in the spider : 12 elongate setae on the female’s sternum that are deflected by movements of the male’s cheliceral fangs during copulation. By removing these setae, we tested whether this stimulation induces female responses that favor the male’s chances of paternity. We found that these stimuli induced females to add a product crucial to the formation of copulatory plugs. These results do not fit expectations from sexually antagonistic coevolution models of sexual selection. This conclusion resembles the heretofore unappreciated implications of specialized female sense organs in other species, and of the temporary increases in female sensitivities and responsiveness to male stimuli during the breeding season in female fish and frogs.},

In this study, we first recorded variations in parental care by males of the glassfrog at two temporal scales (day vs night, and throughout embryo development). Second, we compared levels of embryo mortality in egg clutches attended and naturally unattended by males. Third, we performed field experiments to simulate the risk of predation by small invertebrates to test the level of male commitment to providing parental care. During 65 field trips (1–2 nights each) we recorded 87 males and 154 egg clutches in a population of from the Central Andes of Colombia. Parental care (measured as male egg brooding) was higher at night than at day, and it decreased from oviposition towards egg hatching as embryos developed. Embryo mortality was greater in naturally abandoned clutches, compared to those receiving male care. Most males caring for eggs but none of the solitary males exhibited defensive behavior, such as biting and kicking the predator stimulus. Preliminary results also suggest that caring males have a higher tolerance toward threatening stimuli before fleeing than did solitary males. Altogether, rates of natural mortality suggest that male care for eggs is likely adaptive in this species. Males protect their offspring from at least two causes of mortality: desiccation and predation. However, when and how much males care for the offspring varies between night and day, and through embryonic development.},

  abstract     = {Several sexually selected traits exhibit positive allometry. One of the explanations for this pattern suggests that positive allometry should be expected only for “pure” threat male signals, whilst isometry and negative allometry should occur in “pure” courtship signals. Wing pigmentation (WP) is a sexually selected trait exhibited by the males of several damselfly taxa (Odonata Zygoptera), which has been the focus of a number of studies of allometry. Whilst WP tends to exhibit positive allometry in many taxa, the pattern is not general. Previous studies have shown that in , a territorial species in which WP is used as a “pure” threat signal, positive allometry is common. However, little attention has been paid to the seasonal variation in the allometry of WP in this species. To address this research gap, we collected data from a full reproductive season, from a natural population of located in Central Mexico. Our results suggest that, first, male WP and body size generally increase throughout the season. Second, WP increases as the end of the season approaches, independently of body size. Finally, WP tends to be either not related to body size, or to exhibit isometry during the first half of the season (April–June), and positive allometry during the second half of the season (July–October). We suggest that our results may be explained by (i) the availability of resources critical to the development of larvae, as well as the duration of development, and (ii) an increase in the number or larger males towards the end of the season, which may favour the exaggeration of WP. Furthermore, the opportunity for sexual selection may vary, so that WP may be more relevant to male mating success towards the end of the reproductive season.},

  abstract     = {Many fish species typically assort into homogeneous groups and thus reduce the risk of predators targeting individuals that are phenotypically odd compared to the majority of the group. The confusion and oddity effect hypotheses predict, that phenotypically odd individuals in a group are preferentially targeted by predators. Therefore, heterogeneous groups of prey should be more vulnerable to predator attention and attacks than homogeneous (all prey is the same colour, size, etc.) groups. Predators might use different cues to select a target, depending on their sensory abilities (sound, smell, vision, etc.). Visual-hunting predators that can see colour, for example, may be more likely to select prey based on colour than size oddity of prey. Previous studies on the oddity effect have found support for the colour-oddity and predator response, and to a lesser extent on size oddity. We thus predicted that, given a choice, a group with an odd-coloured individual would be targeted more often by a predator than a group with an odd-size fish but not odd in colour. Heterogeneous groups of six zebrafish () containing either one odd-coloured (wildtype or red) or one odd-sized (large or small) individual were used as stimulus prey in dichotomous choice experiments examining prey preference in needlefish (). Needlefish preferred heterogeneous groups regardless of the colour of the odd individual and when the odd individual was smaller than the other group members. However, when the odd individual was larger than the rest of the group, the predators preferred homogeneous groups of small fish. These new findings are inconsistent with the predictions of the oddity effect and warrant investigation of alternative hypotheses for size-assorted grouping in fish.},

Ant colonies may have one (monogyny) or several queens (polygyny) which can mate once (monoandry) or several times (polyandry). In this study, we analysed the genetic structure and breeding system of the Mediterranean acrobat ant . Despite its widespread distribution and pivotal role in regulating arthropod communities, many details of the biology of this species have yet to be fully investigated. According to previous studies based on few observations, is monogynous and monandrous with a claustral foundation phase. We assessed the mating frequency and the number of queens in 40 colonies using highly polymorphic, species-specific nuclear DNA microsatellite loci. The number of queens in each colony was directly inferred from the relatedness of workers. Moreover, in order to determine the proportion of multiple matings by queens, we performed both parental reconstruction analysis using offspring data and direct analysis of the sperm stored in the queen’s spermathecae. We investigated relatedness between queens and their mated males. The results showed that, although the majority of the colonies were monogynous, polygyny occurred in 10\% of the nests. Monoandry was the norm: we found evidence of multiple paternity in just two out of 40 colonies. Finally, no relatedness was found between queens and their mates, indicating that the latter were from different colonies. This work is the first description of the genetic structure of the colonies of and provides new insight for further investigation on the social organization, behaviour and ecology of Mediterranean acrobat ants.},

The movement and the abundance of a population of the damselfly were monitored using the mark-recapture method at a breeding site located in a Mediterranean watercourse in Central Italy. The study area was a transect of 250 m along a ditch, subdivided into five stretches varying from 40 to 70 m each. A total of 849 adults was captured and 210 specimens of them were recaptured on a 17-day survey (from mid-June to early July 2018), corresponding to an estimation of population size of 5,600 specimens. Recapture and survival probabilities revealed no significant effect ensuing from handling and marking with different colours. Specimens of different stretches showed different sedentary rate. The recaptured individuals had a low vagility, with a high proportion of individuals which are incline to philopatry.},

  abstract     = {In amphibians, the study of trophic niche is important to better understand the species ecological adaptation, in particular along gradients or in heterogeneous habitats. In this framework, we analysed the trophic strategies of two populations of the endemic Corsican brook newt , one living in a Mediterranean lowland and the other in a mountain stream. In both sites, we performed dietary analysis using stomach flushing and assessed the available invertebrate prey community. Further, we estimated newt density using removal sampling. Streams were similar in invertebrate prey abundance ( = 0.15), but differed in prey diversity ( &lt; 0.001), the Mediterranean lowland site possessing a higher diversity of invertebrate prey. The newts’ trophic strategies were analysed at the population level and also at the individual one to assess in detail the trophic specialization. In both sites newt density was similar and the population realized trophic niche displayed a large overlap with the available prey community. Therefore, both populations behaved as broad trophic generalists. However, in the Mediterranean lowland stream, where available resources were more diverse, there was evidence of a significant degree of individual trophic specialization. This finding is consistent with the classic niche variation hypothesis, that predicts a higher individual differentiation in presence of high resource diversity.},

  abstract     = {Providing bird feeders is a very popular interaction between people and birds, and many aspects have been studied in detail. The utilisation of bird feeders in relation to the daylight pattern still needs more research, mostly due to technical problems. This is important for understanding optimal foraging and, in consequence, bird survival. The study was carried out in southern Poland during winter and early spring 2011. A total of 99 Great tits were tagged of which 50 individuals were recorded at the feeders (in total 2,771 records). The mean time spent at the feeder by Great tits was 4.3 ± 7.9 sec and was influenced by temperature. During the winter, both sexes showed a bimodal pattern of foraging activity: a first, early morning, peak and a second, evening, peak. In contrast, during early spring we found a significant bimodal pattern only for females with a sharp decrease before dusk. We confirmed that observed foraging patterns could be explained by the risk of starvation and by predator avoidance. Sexual differences in foraging are most probably related to their different activities in late winter/early spring, for example, time-consuming singing by males.},

  abstract     = {Egg retrieval is a common behaviour among ground-nesting birds and a key part of their parental care. This paper deals with an experimental study of that behaviour in four Sicilian populations of Stone curlew, considering not only the success in retrieving but also the time latency in the bird reacting to the sight of an egg displaced from its nest and the relative retrieval time, which are two parameters that have been ignored until now by other studies. Egg displacements were made in 36 nests at the same distance of 50 cm. In each nest, two egg displacements were made, one in the first and the other in the second half of the brooding period, at a mean distance of 12.5 ± 3.5 days. In only seven out of 67 valid tests, the egg remained unretrieved, confirming the ability of Stone curlew to roll in their eggs. None of the factors considered as predictors had a significant effect on the success of the retrieval. Latency and retrieval times resulted positively correlated to each other, and were not statistically different among the four populations tested, nevertheless, showing a high variability even within the same population. In nine cases the retrieval was performed by the two parents acting in turn, however, in these cases the retrieval and not the latency times turned out to be longer with respect to the retrievals made by only one bird. When the retrieval times of the first displacement were compared to those of the second, the latter were shorter. The retrieval times are influenced by the ground conformation, being shorter in agricultural sites where the ground is plain and levelled. Indeed the GLMM analyses suggest a significant influence of different external factors on both the latency and retrieval times.},

Hybrids showed higher plasticity for melanization (~ 58\%) and thermo-tolerance traits (CV = 39.14 for heat resistance and CV = 43.15 for cold resistance) at different growth temperatures. Acclimation effects were also significant in hybrids ( = 47.89 for heat resistance and = 56.87 for cold resistance) suggesting an adaptive potential. Results of this study imply that hybridization increases genetic variation which in turn leads to adaptation to new environments.

  abstract     = {Reproductive isolation is a fundamental part of speciation processes. The establishing of reproductive isolation in speciation with ongoing gene flow is unlikely unless divergent selection is overruling gene flow homogenization, which seems to be most effective when combined with non-random mating. We explored whether assortative mating via female mate-choice contributes to reproductive isolation between populations of the blind mole rat inhabiting abutting rendzina-soil and basaltic-soil areas in a microsite similar to one in which ecological speciation has recently been suggested as a possible model driving the divergence between mole rats from the different soils. We performed T-maze experiments with mole rats captured in early winter (i.e. premating season) of 2 consecutive years and found no existence of females from either soil type preferring males originating from their own soils based on olfactory cues. In addition, inconsistent preferences for males based on soil type in tests with females that were tested twice were found. This suggests that female mate choice based on olfactory cues is unlikely to be an isolating barrier between the mole rats from the two soil types. In such circumstances, ecological speciation would have to occur through other mechanisms of divergent selection, such as reproductive isolation due to strong habitat (soil) preferences, vocalisation or seismic communication.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial isopods have adapted to predatory pressures by evolving a variety of behaviors, which arise from a combination of specific traits, such as volvation and tonic immobility. Evolutionarily, these behavioral adaptations have been shown to increase the fitness of the individuals of the species who show them because the probability of being predated is reduced due to the loss of interest by the predator towards the immobile prey and the increase of interest towards the other mobile ones. Even if some of these behaviors have been shown to have a genetic basis, there is limited knowledge about the effects of environmental influences and predator-induced learning abilities on the antipredatory strategies of invertebrates, and isopods in particular. Our study aimed to understand the degree to which “nature” and “nurture” (i.e. environmental and genetic factors) and their interactions influence these antipredatory behaviors. There might be a difference in the behavior of wild and captive isopods in their volvation frequency and duration of tonic immobility due to environmental factors (i.e. predation) that induce learning-related behavioral changes. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis. We applied the three types of stimuli, which aim to simulate the interaction of the predator with the isopod. All three species showed a significant difference, between individuals collected in the field (wild) and raised in the laboratory (captive), in the reaction to the stimulus that simulates the fall from a bird’s beak or from the jaws of a lizard after a catch. Although volvation frequency was highly species- and stimulus-specific, the duration of tonic immobility and the delay in the response to each stimulus, when significant, was always higher in wild groups than captive ones. These substantial differences may reflect the evolutionary and ecological characteristics of each species and the importance of environmental pressures to shape the behavior of these invertebrates to optimize their life strategies.},

  abstract     = {Allometry is defined as differential growth of various body parts at distinct rates. Traditionally, two types of allometries have been studied in holometabolous insects: evolutionary and static. Polymorphic ants can represent a good model to study these two types of allometry. In this work, we investigated both static and evolutionary allometry in species, focusing on the Italian endemic taxon . We assessed: (i) the intracolonial size variability in ; (ii) the allometric relationships between body size, head size and leg size in ; (iii) evolutionary allometry in the genus, by comparing the ratio of metafemur length to mesosoma length (a measure of body size) across nine species originated from two colonization routes: northern (from Asia to Europe) and southern (from Asia to North Africa). We found some evidence of allometric growth between body parts in workers of , particularly between body size and head size. Furthermore, in line with previous studies, we also found some evidence in support of evolutionary allometry in the genus. Specifically, species originating in North Africa displayed significantly higher ratios of metafemur length (MFL) to mesosoma length (ML) than species originating in Europe, whereas the two groups of species did not differ with respect to MFL and ML. So, this result is consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of longer legs relative to body size is an adaptation to more arid environmental conditions, allowing ants to optimize foraging efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Among mammals, interspecific interference is common in carnivores, primates and rodents, but it seems to be a rare occurrence in ungulate communities. We summarised the knowledge on interspecific displacements through behavioural interactions between ungulate species in temperate areas to evaluate the conditions under which ungulate behavioural competitive interactions may occur. We found 18 studies reporting interspecific behavioural dominance between wild ungulates, for a total of 37 reports of interspecific displacement, involving 15 species. Only eight reports showed over more than 10 displacements. Over 60\% reports involved at least one alien species. The larger one displaced the smaller one in 69\% reports involving only native species and in 58\% reports involving at least one alien species. Among ungulates, resource exploitation rather than behavioural interference seems to be the main mechanism for interspecific competition. Behavioural interference may increase when non-coevolved species come into contact (e.g. alien taxa, or species expanding their distribution range following environmental changes), in turn generating the potential for interspecific competition.},
