  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an effective image retrieval approach using block truncation coding compressed data stream based on edge-based quantization (EQBTC). First, an image is compressed into corresponding quantisers and a bitmap image by EQBTC. Then, the quantisers are used for colour feature extraction, whereby the bitmap image and grey image are used for luminance and edge feature extraction. Subsequently, two image features, the colour histogram feature (CHF) and the overall structure feature (OSF), are computed to measure the similarity between two images using a specific distance metric computation. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the block truncation coding image retrieval scheme and some earlier proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Atom Search Optimisation (ASO) is a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm that has proved to work effectively on several benchmark tests. In this paper, we propose the binary variants of atom search optimisation (BASO) for wrapper feature selection. In the proposed scheme, eight transfer functions from S-shaped and V-shaped families are used to convert the continuous ASO into the binary version. The proposed BASO approaches are employed to select a subset of significant features for efficient classification. Twenty-two well-known benchmark datasets acquired from the UCI machine learning repository are used for performance validation. In the experiment, the BASO with an optimal transfer function that contributes to the best classification performance is presented. The particle swarm optimisation (PSO), binary differential evolution (BDE), binary bat algorithm (BBA), binary flower pollination algorithm (BFPA), and binary salp swarm algorithm (BSSA) are used to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of proposed approaches in feature selection. Our experimental results reveal the superiority of proposed BASO not only in high prediction accuracy but also in the minimal number of selected features.},

  abstract     = {The following aesthetic discussion examines in a philosophical-scientific way the relationship between computation and artistic creativity. Currently, there is a criticism about the possible artistic creativity that an algorithm could have. Supporting the above, the term computer-generated art (CG-Art) defined by Margaret Boden would seem to have no exponents yet. Moreover, it has been pointed out that, rather than a matter of primitive technological development, CG-Art would have in its very foundations the inability to exist. This, because art is considered as one of the most unique and exclusive human manifestations of our species. On the contrary, I propose that the denial of CG-Art has an anthropocentric bias. For this, I use the recent studies that, from the cognitive sciences, have been carried out on artistic creativity. In this way, I intend to convince the reader that behind the denial of the creative artistic capacity to the machines, a negationist mysticism of the current scientific advances necessarily lies.},

  abstract     = {Similarity-based generalisation is fundamental to human cognition, and the ability to draw analogies based on relational similarities between superficially different domains is crucial for reasoning and inference. Learning to base generalisation on shared relations rather than (or in the face of) shared perceptual features has been identified as an important developmental milestone. However, recent research has highlighted the context-sensitivity of generalisation: children and adults use perceptual similarity to make inferences in some cases and relational similarity in others, a finding that suggests people track the predictive validity of different types of inferences. Here we demonstrate that this pattern of behaviour naturally emerges over the course of development in a domain-general statistical learning model that employs distributed, sub-symbolic representations. We suggest that this model offers a parsimonious account of the development of context-sensitive, similarity-based generalisation and may provide several advantages over other popular structured or symbolic approaches to modelling relational inference.},

Proper adaptive control laws are used to estimate the uncertainty bound, unknown disturbance signal and system parameters. Stability of the closed-loop control system is proved using Lyapunov theory in both modes. Simulation results in MATLAB show the desired application of the proposed controllers in the presence of disturbance and parametric uncertainty.},

Base on this idea of to control the diversity of population to improve the performance of PSO, this paper proposes a novel PSO with mutation breeding (MBPSO), which performs a mutation breeding operation periodically, to control the diversity of the population to improve the global optimisation ability. The mutation breeding operation can be divided into two steps: breeding and mutation. The breeding step is to replace all of best previously visited positions of each particle with the global best previously visited position, and the mutation step is to perform a mutation operation for those new generated best previously visited positions. In addition, we adopt a new updating mechanism of the global best previously position to avoid falling into local optimum. The experimental results on a suit of benchmark functions verifies that the proposed PSO is a competitive algorithm when compare with other PSO variants.},

The implications of this assumption are analysed for the area of visual-word processing, in particular for position-specific top-down processes from a word – to a letter representation. These processes pose a problem to reviewed models of word reading and computational models in general. A solution in the form of a conceptual network is proposed. In this general model for cognitive brain processes, neural binding of identity and location and of identity and position play a fundamental role: temporary connections emerge during word recognition and are reactivated later, when a letter at given position has to be identified. It is shown how modules active in word recognition are “re-used” in letter identification. In simulations, the role of a critical threshold of cell-assemblies is shown and the selective propagation of activation loops at task-dependent time scales. Requirements for prospective studies on cognitive self-organisation and relations with new empirical work on visual-word processing are discussed.},

The article compares the role and capabilities of two Confucian teachers: Confucius and an imagined robot teacher (“Digital Confucius”). It is argued in this article that Digital Confucius, if developed, would be useful as an “AI partner” in transmitting the knowledge and skills. As “AI mind”, however, digital Confucius, would be weak in catering its teaching to suit the learner’s profiles and contextual needs as well as serving as an ethical-spiritual guide and role-model to its students. Two major implications are discussed in this paper. First, the study highlights the potential complementary function of AI in the transfer of information and the irreplaceable role of the human teacher in moral education. Secondly, rather than making spirituality redundant, the limitation of AI in Confucian teaching speaks of the continuous relevance and centrality of spiritual development for human beings.},

Therefore, in this paper, we solely study the role of exclusion as a part of multi-population methods in DOPs. For this purpose, a comprehensive review of the various exclusion strategies reported in the literature is provided. Four strategies are also introduced to reduce the shortcomings of exclusion operator. Experimental results show that proposed strategies compared to other schemes such as reinitialized midpoint check, hill-valley detection with three checkpoints, and merging information of collided populations have the same or even higher ability to improve the performance of the multi-swarm PSO algorithms in moving peaks benchmark.},

However, corners located at the centre of gradually greying blocks of information cannot be extracted using these algorithms. The edge feature points described by the algorithms are often affected by background changes, leading to significant differences in the descriptors for the same feature. These issues are detrimental to subsequent matching processes. Therefore, we propose a new feature detection method that will provide more useful corner information for subsequent tracking and detection processes, particularly for edge features. The edge information of corners is used to search for points that satisfy the requirements for inner greyscale consistency. The points are then used to construct point-symmetric structures. The zeroth-order inner greyscale data, first-order gradient orientation differences, and angular directions of the point-symmetric connections of the structures are considered structural attributes, which help search for feature points. Similar feature points are then clustered using a hierarchical clustering algorithm, followed by extracting the feature points from point pair features of the same type. It was experimentally demonstrated that the proposed point-symmetric structural features would help increase the number of valid feature points that can be extracted from an image.},

This is largely due to fears that commercialising sex in this way could could re-enforce existing gender inequalities, and sexual objectification. We argue that one possible risk mitigation strategy could be to develop ethical safeguards into sexual robots. In this paper we explore the problem of implementing artificial ethical agents through a review of the relevant literature. We begin by exploring the motivation to the problem, and the science fiction that has inspired it.

  abstract     = {The present paper aims to extend the potential learning method to overcome the problem of collective interpretation, which aims to interpret multi-layered neural networks by compressing them into the simplest ones. In the process of compression, positive, negative, and complicated weights have had unfavourable effects for interpretation. To deal with the problems of collective interpretation, the potential learning is extended only to use positive weights. In addition, to obtain more appropriate weights for interpretation, the number of candidate weights for higher potentialities is first increased as much as possible. Then, from among many candidates, more appropriate weights are selected as more important ones. This extended potentiality learning is expected to produce more stable and more simple representations for easy interpretation. The extended method was applied to three datasets, namely, an artificial dataset, a real eye-tracking dataset, and a student evaluation dataset. In all cases, it was observed that the selectivity of connection weights could be increased. Correspondingly, the majority of connection weights became positive, and the collective weights were quite similar to the regression coefficients of the logistic regression analysis. Finally, for the third dataset (student evaluations), the extended method could extract more explicit input-output relations, compared with the logistic regression analysis, while improving generalisation performance.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new approach which is a three-stage pipeline to fast and accurate segment hand from a single depth image. Firstly, a depth frame is segmented into several regions by histogram-based thresholds selection algorithm and tracing the exterior boundaries of objects. We found that MINIMUM, MEAN and MEDIAN are effective ways to separate objects and the threshold in the valley between two maxima similar to MINIMUM algorithm with a minimum error. Then, each segmentation proposal is evaluated by a 3-layers shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained as a binary classification function to predict whether it is a partition of hand. Finally, all hand components are merged as our hand segmentation result. In our experiment, we use a set of real data containing more than 200,000 frames of depth images. Compared with the results achieved by approaches based on RDF and SegNet, results demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance in high-accuracy (88.34% mean IoU) within shorter processing time ( ≤ 8 ms).},

  abstract     = {Water Wave Optimisation algorithm (WWO) is a new swarm-based metaheuristic inspired by shallow wave models for global optimisation. In this paper, an enhanced WWO, which combines with multiple assistant strategies (EWWO), is proposed. First, the random opposition-based learning (ROBL) mechanism is introduced to generate the initial population with high quality. Second, a new modified operation is designed and embedded into propagation operation to balance the global exploration and the local exploitation. Third, the covariance matrix self-adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is employed by the refraction operation to further strengthen the local exploitation. Furthermore, the diversity of the population is maintained in the evolution process by using a crossover operator. The experiment results based on CEC 2017 benchmarks indicate that the EWWO outperforms the state-of-the-art variant algorithms of the WWO and the standard WWO.},

  abstract     = {Deep networks have escalated the computational performance in the sensor-based high dimensional imaging such as hyperspectral images (HSI), due to their informative feature extraction competency. Therefore in this work, we have extracted the informative features from different CNN models for the benchmark HSI datasets. The deep features have concatenated with spectral features to increase the informative knowledge in the image datacube. The feature concatenation has massively increased the size of datacube. Therefore, we have applied an unsupervised maximum object identification-based salient feature selection to identify the most informative features of datacube and discard the less informative features to reduce the computational time without compromising the accuracy. It is an unsupervised feature selection approach that transforms the data into scale space and achieved robust and strong features. In the previous CNN-based methods, raw features have directly fed to the MLP (multilayer perception) layers for target prediction whereas we have provided our salient features into a multi-core SVM-based set-up and have achieved high accuracy with low computational time as compared to the previous state-of-art techniques.},

The purpose of this project is to build a framework that permits studying the relations between MEXICA’s processes, its knowledge structures and the features of the produced narratives. We describe a methodology to analyse the features of the agent’s knowledge-base, to further establish correlations between such features and a set of general characteristics of the tales that they produce. Next, we make use of those correlations to forecast some properties of the future tales to be developed by different MEXICAs agents with different knowledge-bases. For this task, we introduce the S-graphs, representations of the similarity and organisation of the knowledge-structures. The results we obtained indicate that we are able to correctly forecast some of the features of tales to be produced; however, much more work is required.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop a numerical method for solving the delay optimal control problems of fractional-order. The fractional derivatives are considered in the Caputo sense. The process begins with the assumption that the problem is first transformed into an equivalent problem with a fractional dynamical system without delay, using a Padé approximation. We then try to approximate the solution of the Hamiltonian conditions based on the Pontryagin minimum principle. The main feature is to implement nonlinear polynomial expansions in a neural network adaptive structure. The transfer functions of the employed neural network follow a fractional power series. The proposed technique does not use sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent nonlinear transfer functions commonly adopted in conventional neural networks at the output. Instead, linear transfer functions are employed which lead to explicit fractional power series formulae for the fractional optimal control problem. To do this, we use trial solutions for the states, Lagrange multipliers and control functions where these trial solutions are constructed by fractional power series neural network model. We then minimise the error function using an unconstrained optimisation scheme where weight parameters (or coefficients of the series) and biases associated with all neurons are unknown. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Vertex colouring is among the most important problems in graph theory which has been widely applied across different real-world problems. In vertex colouring problem (VCP), the goal is to assign a distinct colour to each vertex of the graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour. This paper presents a fuzzy irregular cellular automaton (FICA) for finding a near-optimal solution for the VCP. FICA is an extension fuzzy cellular automaton (FCA) in which the cells of the automaton can be arranged in an irregular structure. The aim of the proposed method is to reap the benefits of both FCA and irregular cellular automata while minimising their drawbacks. To evaluate the proposed method, various computer simulations have been conducted on a variety of graphs. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to achieve better results in terms of the minimum number of required colours and the execution time of the algorithm, compared to other peer algorithms.},

Incorporating deep residual learning module into Inception V3 can not only save the computational cost by factorising convolutions, but also mitigate the vanishing gradients causing the increasing depth of the network. Additionally, this combination can alleviate the degradation problem in the process of extracting features and providing proposals. Experimental results show that the modified approach can identify out different leaves with similar characteristics in one scene, and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over some state-of-the-art deep neural networks, when it comes to recognise foliage in complicated environments.},
