  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an emotional model for robots in a multi-robot system, in order to allow emerging behaviors. The emotional model uses four universal emotions: anger, disgust, sadness, and joy, assigned to each robot based on the level of satisfaction of its basic needs. These four universal emotions lie on a spectrum where depending where the emotion of the robot lies, can affect its behavior and of its neighboring robots. The more negative the emotion is, the more individualistic it becomes in its decisions (anger, sadness or disgust). The more positive the robot is in its emotion, the more it will consider the group and global goals (joy). Each robot is able to recognize another robot′s emotion in the system based on their current state, using the AR2P (AR2P for its acronym in Spanish: Algoritmo Recursivo de Reconocimiento de Patrones ) recognition algorithm. In this way, it can use this information of the emotions to decide with whom collaborate. Specifically, the paper addresses emotions’ influence on the behavior of the system, at the individual and collective levels, and the emotions’ effects on the emergent behaviors of the multi-robot system. The paper explores the emerging behavior in two multi-robot scenarios; nectar harvesting and object transportation. The results show that the emotions are important to the emergent behavior in a multi-robot system.},

Each mathematical model that is built has one of these two drawbacks: either some admissible outputs are not produced or some inadmissible outputs are produced. In this article, the authors aim to clarify to what point natural systems can be represented by formal languages. To this end, the concepts of consistent system and complete system are defined, from which it is demonstrated that the model system can be consistent and not complete. Initially, the authors define an axiomatic in which the inputs and outputs of natural systems and complex systems in general are classified, but from the point of view of the influence of objects from the system to the environment and vice versa. For each mathematical model that is generated, either of the two statements occurs: either some acceptable outputs are not produced, or some inadmissible outputs are produced. Finally, it is shown that if the set of inputs of the system is acceptable then the system is not complete or inconsistent.},

Besides, a general ten-instant Zhang et al. discretization (ZeaD) formula is derived, constructed and investigated, and the corresponding theoretical analysis is provided. Next, by applying this general formula to discretize the CTDMSR model, a general ten-instant discrete-time dynamic matrix square root (DTDMSR) model with sixth-order precision is further obtained. For comparison purposes, four DTDMSR models, with the second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order precision, are also acquired and presented, respectively, by using other ZeaD formulas.

  abstract     = {Electricity generation from burning fossil fuel is one of the major contributors to global warming. Renewable energy sources are a viable alternative to produce electrical energy and to reduce the emission from power industry. They have unlocked opportunities for consumers to produce electricity locally and use it on-site that reduces dependency on centralized generation. Despite the widespread availability, one of the major challenges is to understand their characteristics in a more informative way. Wind energy is highly dependent on the intermittent wind speed profile. This paper proposes the prediction of wind speed that simplifies wind farm planning and feasibility study. Twelve artificial intelligence algorithms were used for wind speed prediction from collected meteorological parameters. The model performances were compared to determine the wind speed prediction accuracy and model comparison for different sizes of data set. The results show, the most effective algorithm varies based on the data size.},

The algorithm consists of an improved leader selection scheme called multi-competition leader selection. Under this scheme, particles move to the winner among the elite particles for the social cognitive by comparing the nearest angle or the farthest angle of several randomly selected elite particles. Besides, as the inertia weight plays an important role in controlling the previous velocity of each particle, the competitive mechanism is applied to the inertia weight in order to investigate for the most suitable balance between the exploration and exploitation abilities of the algorithm during the search process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms four other popular multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms most of the time on thirty-seven benchmarks in terms of inverted generational distance. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied to the signalized traffic problem to optimize the effective green time of each phase, and the proposed algorithm performs better than other MOPSO algorithms for the traffic problem in terms of hypervolume.},

Firstly, compared with the existing control methods, the combination of sliding mode control and dynamic surface control improves the robustness of the system and avoids the “explosion of complexity” problems. Subsequently, the fuzzy logic system is introduced to estimate the unknown continuous function in power system, and the norm of the weight vector is used to replace the estimation of the entire weight vector. In this way, computational burden will be reduced. In addition, the influences of unknown time delays and dead-zones are considered. Finite cover lemma is introduced to deal with unknown time delays, which enables arbitrarily small L ∞ tracking performance. The unknown dead-zone is converted into the sum of linear dead zone and bounded nonlinear dead zone. Finally, the simulation results are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

However, due to its complex network structure, the intertwining of hyperparameters, and the time-consuming procedure for network training, finding an efficient network configuration for CNN is a challenging yet tough work. To efficiently solve the hyperparameters setting problem, this paper proposes a distributed particle swarm optimization (DPSO) approach, which can optimize the hyperparameters to find high-performing CNNs. Compared to tedious, historical-experience-based, and personal-preference-based manual designs, the proposed DPSO approach can evolve the hyperparameters automatically and globally to obtain promising CNNs, which provides a new idea and approach for finding the global optimal hyperparameter combination. Moreover, by cooperating with the distributed computing techniques, the DPSO approach can have a considerable speedup when compared with the traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Extensive experiments on widely-used image classification benchmarks have verified that the proposed DPSO approach can effectively find the CNN model with promising performance, and at the same time, has greatly reduced the computational time when compared with traditional PSO.},

  abstract     = {For stroke patients, hand function assessment is an important part of the hand rehabilitation process. The hand function assessment, however, requires the patient to complete a series of actions under the guidance of the therapist who then scores the patient’s performance. This type of assessment is both time-consuming and highly subjective. Therefore, in order to achieve a fast, objective and accurate assessment, this paper adopts a non-contact infrared imaging device, Leap Motion, to measure the patient’s motion information and then uses these motion information to infer the hand’s rehabilitation level. This paper improves the traditional way of hand function assessment from the following aspects. Only three coherent movements (finger opposition, lift wrist and stretch fingers) are required to complete the assessment, which makes the assessment time shorter and the assessment process easier. At the same time, an assessment algorithm based on the Ensemble Learning is proposed and integrated into the automatic hand function assessment system. In addition, the virtual reality game has been implemented in the assessment system to ensure a satisfactory interaction with patients, which makes the assessment process more interesting and convenient. Using this system, 50 stroke patients underwent clinical trials with the Brunnstrom and Fugl-Meyer assessment scales. The matching rate between the automatic assessment result and the manual Brunnstrom assessment result is 92%, while the matching rate with the Fugl-Meyer assessment result is 82%. Furthermore, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kappa test are also used to validate the consistency between the automatic assessment results and the manual assessment results. These experiments illustrate that this automatic assessment system is fast, comfortable and reliable.},

Our findings indicate that the exponential model fits the distributions of the seismic parameters much better than the normal model. Furthermore, in the whole seismicity case, the method requires at least 2100 to 2300 random samples to estimate the distributions of the seismic parameters of earthquakes occurred in 2017 with an estimation error less than 0.01; while in the aftershock-depleted case, a minimum number of random samples varying between 360 and 1470 occurred in 2014-2017 is required to estimate the distributions of the seismic parameters of earthquakes occurred in 2017 with an estimation error less than 0.01.},

  abstract     = {Governments are increasingly relying on private participation projects and foreign ownership to access technology and capital in infrastructure projects. As a result, the ubiquity of these projects in all regions of the world is a reality that has caught the attention of both managers and scholars. Predicting the final status (success/failure) of these projects in advance is a key element to be taken into account when deciding about participation. To support this kind of decision, the present paper proposes a multidimensional study where a set of heterogeneous classifiers have been applied to forecast the final success of private participation projects. They are applied to a real-life dataset, comprising information from the World Bank about projects all over the world and within four sectors (Energy, Telecommunication, Transport, and Water Sewerage). Classification results are compared under the scope of the sector and host region of the projects. Results show that the predictability of the success of private participation projects depends on the specific industry and region on which the project operates, with projects in the Telecommunication sector and Sub-Saharan Africa exhibiting the highest rates.},

The proposed approach fits in with current trends aiming at minimizing the space occupied by assembly lines along with reducing the number of stations. A hybrid method is proposed combining modified known heuristics of task assignments to workstations with bounding and backtracking techniques in order to determine the assignment of workers to tasks.},

  abstract     = {The development and integration of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) or edge computing devices is contributing to the formation of an increasingly digital, intelligent and connected world. As a result, there is a massive flow of data in different sectors of human activity. One example is intelligent buildings, where thousands of components, devices, systems and suppliers interact. In this context, failures in control and monitoring systems are frequent. To analyze this situation, this paper presents as a case study the problem of fault-tolerant robust adaptive monitoring control with state prediction performance for a class of IoT temperature systems subject to uncertainties of precision states and external disturbances. The authors propose a new control strategy based on consensus game theory and prediction of future precision states to reduce tracking error and improve algorithm efficiency. The authors present the development of a new algorithm that improves the functioning of monitoring and control of parcel networks. This has the purpose of increasing the energy efficiency of the same and ensure the effectiveness of our adaptive temperature control algorithm, compared to existing results. With the simulation presented in this research, it is possible to conclude that a new fault tolerant error tracking algorithm ensures robust monitoring of the reference model. It was shown that the predicted temperature signal is limited by a small range close to the collected temperature data. A case study result is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant adaptive monitoring control algorithm.},

In this context, the tools development for detecting the appearance of any kind of anomaly represents an important challenge. For this reason, the implementation of classifiers for anomaly detection tasks has been a significant trend in the scientific community. However, since the behavior of the potential anomalies that may occur in a plant is unknown, it is necessary to generate artificial outliers to assess these classifiers. This paper proposes the performance checking of different intelligent one-class techniques to detect anomalies in an industrial plant, used to obtain the main material for wind generator blades production. These classifiers are tested using anomaly data generated, giving successful results.},

Then, we created a measure to quantify trends, without being affected by scale, thus allowing to compare the occurrence of hepatitis in different regions in Brazil. Finally, we used concept drift to detect the changing point when the notification behavior has changed over time. As a consequence of this study, public policies can be developed to deal with the increasing number of cases, specially by considering sexual transmissions.},

The present study aims to extract the moving parts as well as its moving direction on the random-dot animations based on the local parallel computation of the pixel level. Assuming motion is captured in high frame rate, the variable range of an optical flow is restricted within a finite discretized area of pixels. Then, the system is constructed to select the suitable optical flow among the finite possibilities according to the reaction-diffusion equation dynamics, computed in a distributed manner. This process is one of the regularization methods and is described as the minimization process of the potential functional. Using the computation result of the previous frames, we attempted to reduce the computational iterations and to detect the plural objects moving at different speeds. These effects are demonstrated by computer simulations using actual random-dot animations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the counterexamples to the general theory related to the state-feedback IMC plants are given and investigated. It is shown, that the maximum-speed multivariable perfect control schemes do not necessitate the maximum-energy of the control input variables. In that way, the IMC peculiarities involving the nonzero perfect control closed-loop poles are indicated, which constitutes a solid counterweight to the well-known general system theory. A new geometric approach results in counterexamples for both full and non-full rank plants, giving rise to the introduction of a complete analytical paradigm in the nearest future. Numerical examples confirm the intriguing issues covering the paper.},

By the observation of a sequence of labels, we determine the set of possible MIMs related to a given L-PN through an approach based on GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) inspired method – GMIM. The objective is to get the maximum of feasible MIMs by exploring the search space and giving best solutions for real time cyber systems in short time. We consider four basic assumptions during the reasoning: ( i ) the L-PN structure is known; ( ii ) for each transition of L-PN, a label is associated, ( iii ) the label sequence is known, and ( iv ) all transitions of L-PN are observable. We show the validity and efficiency of our approach by applying the proposed GMIM metaheuristic to two validation examples: Initialization of two parallel machines (example widely cited in literature) and resources allocation in a monitoring problem via mobile robot network.},

  abstract     = {Data mining techniques have been successfully utilized in different applications of significant fields, including medical research. With the wealth of data available within the health-care systems, there is a lack of practical analysis tools to discover hidden relationships and trends in data. The complexity of medical data that is unfavorable for most models is a considerable challenge in prediction. The ability of a model to perform accurately and efficiently in disease diagnosis is extremely significant. Thus, the model must be selected to fit the data better, such that the learning from previous data is most efficient, and the diagnosis of the disease is highly accurate. This work is motivated by the limited number of regression analysis tools for multivariate counts in the literature. We propose two regression models for count data based on flexible distributions, namely, the multinomial Beta-Liouville and multinomial scaled Dirichlet, and evaluated the proposed models in the problem of disease diagnosis. The performance is evaluated based on the accuracy of the prediction which depends on the nature and complexity of the dataset. Our results show the efficiency of the two proposed regression models where the prediction performance of both models is competitive to other previously used regression models for count data and to the best results in the literature.},

Several control systems have been developed in the last years, many of them requiring meal announcements. Therefore, if the patients skip the meal announcement or make a mistake in the estimation of the amount of carbohydrates, the control performance will be negatively affected. In this extended version of our previous work, we present a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for the AP in which the meal is treated as a disturbance to be estimated by an Unknown Input Observer (UIO). The MPC constraints are expressed in terms of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications. Indeed, in the AP some requirements result in hard constraints (in particular, absolutely avoid hypoglycemia and absolutely avoid severe hyperglycemia) and some other in soft constraints (avoid a prolonged hyperglycemia) and STL is suitable for expressing such requirements. The achieved results are obtained using the BluSTL toolbox, which allows to synthesize model predictive controllers with STL constraints. We report simulations showing that the proposed approach, avoiding unnecessary restrictions, provides safe trajectories in correspondence of higher unknown disturbance.},

The suggested controller considers the state restrictions, via a nonstandard strong Lyapunov function, corresponding to the angular displacements and velocities at each articulation. This study implements an extended state terminal second order sliding mode controller with time dependent gains, to ensure the finite-time tracking trajectory of each articulation of the humanoid robot. The terminal sliding mode (TSM) is implemented in a virtual platform developed in a computer-aided design software.

These kernels still have some limitations, however. One goal of this paper is thus to propose other kernels with a power law type behavior that overcome these limitations. All these kernels are nonsingular and have a limited memory. They are then used to define a class of models adapted to capture input-output power law type long memory behaviors. The stability of this class of model is investigated. Finally, the paper shows that the fractional pseudo state space description, a fractional model widely used in the literature, is a special case of Volterra equations, equations introduced nearly a century ago. Volterra equations, whose memory length can be explicitly controlled, can thus be viewed as a serious alternative to fractional pseudo state space descriptions for power law type long memory behavior modeling, as fractional pseudo state space descriptions are known to exhibit serious drawbacks also discussed in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Model order reduction is a common practice to reduce large order systems so that their simulation and control become easy. Nonlinearity aware trajectory piecewise linear is a variation of trajectory piecewise linearization technique of order reduction that is used to reduce nonlinear systems. With this scheme, the reduced approximation of the system is generated by weighted sum of the linearized and reduced sub-models obtained at certain linearization points on the system trajectory. This scheme uses dynamically inspired weight assignment that makes the approximation nonlinearity aware. Just as weight assignment, the process of linearization points selection is also important for generating faithful approximations. This article uses a global maximum error controller based linearization points selection scheme according to which a state is chosen as a linearization point if the error between a current reduced model and the full order nonlinear system reaches a maximum value. A combination that not only selects linearization points based on an error controller but also assigns dynamic inspired weights is shown in this article. The proposed scheme generates approximations with higher accuracies. This is demonstrated by applying the proposed method to some benchmark nonlinear circuits including RC ladder network and inverter chain circuit and comparing the results with the conventional schemes.},

  abstract     = {RPA is used to complete repetitive tasks usually completed by humans. A robot is a software programed to mimic the operations of humans on computer systems. Robots are configured to accomplish these tasks using algorithms from the machine learning and artificial intelligence field. Using RPA leads to reduced errors in the processing of tasks and reduced completions times to carry out the tasks. This paper calculates the number of software licenses required to carry out thousands of transactions for financial services and proposes an assignment of the transactions to the robots. A two-phase linear integer optimization process is proposed. The first phase calculates the number of robots required to complete all of the tasks and the second phase assigns the tasks to the robots. Many different transaction types for financial services are to be completed, and each type has precise market operating hours, maximal delays in their treatment, different processing times and different volumes. The objective function minimizes the total number of robots, but also limits the number of robot startups and reconfigurations, since these operations take time to complete. The key behind the fast computing times to solve the problem is the formulation, where periods are defined at intersections of market operating hours. Preliminary tests are conducted on a real case provided by a bank in North America and a synthetic test case and show that the problem is solved quickly.},

  abstract     = {This work investigates the leader–follower formation control of multiple nonholonomic mobile robots. First, the formation control problem is converted into a trajectory tracking problem and a tracking controller based on the dynamic feedback linearization technique drives each follower robot toward its corresponding reference trajectory in order to achieve the formation. The desired orientation for each follower is selected such that the nonholonomic constraint of the robot is respected, and thus the tracking of the reference trajectory for each follower is feasible. An adaptive dynamic controller that considers the actuators dynamics in the design procedure is proposed. The dynamic model of the robots includes the actuators dynamics in order to obtain the velocities as control inputs instead of torques or voltages. Using Lyapunov control theory, the tracking errors are proven to be asymptotically stable and the formation is achieved despite the uncertainty of the dynamic model parameters. In order to assess the proposed control laws, a ROS-framework is developed to conduct real experiments using four ROS-enabled mobile robots TURTLEBOTs. Moreover, the leader fault problem, which is considered as the main drawback of the leader–follower approach, is solved under ROS. An experiment is conducted where in order to overcome this problem, the desired formation and the leader role are modified dynamically during the experiment.},

  abstract     = {The supply-chain based (SCB) concept applied to Mini Factories is a very relevant approach for current manufacturing. SBC, allows a network-like interconnectivity between assets by setting up factories inside the premises of the principal manufacturer, allowing more efficient machines utilization. The aforesaid assets need a proper representation and it is there where the core of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) comes to the rescue. According to I4.0, every asset (e.g. a machine, software, sensor or actuator, etc.), should be modeled via an Asset Administrative Shell (AAS). AAS is a knowledge structure that provides a description of the asset, its technical functionality and its relationships to other assets. It can be viewed as the as the data model from where the digital twin stems from. In this paper we extend our previously presented methodology meant for creating Asset Administrative Shells in Mini Factories with a focus on connectivity. By using our proposed methodology, Model Factory @ARTC has been able to quickly connect and integrate diverse assets into our factory of the future, demonstrating some of the enhanced capabilities of Industry 4.0.},

  abstract     = {Cognitive Vision Systems have gained a lot of interest from industry and academia recently, due to their potential to revolutionize human life as they are designed to work under complex scenes, adapting to a range of unforeseen situations, changing accordingly to new scenarios and exhibiting prospective behavior. The combination of these properties aims to mimic the human capabilities and create more intelligent and efficient environments. Contextual information plays an important role when the objective is to reason such as humans do, as it can make the difference between achieving a weak, generalized set of outputs and a clear, target and confident understanding of a given situation. Nevertheless, dealing with contextual information still remains a challenge in cognitive systems applications due to the complexity of reasoning about it in real time in a flexible but yet efficient way. In this paper, we enrich a cognitive system with contextual information coming from different sensors and propose the use of stream reasoning to integrate/process all these data in real time, and provide a better understanding of the situation in analysis, therefore improving decision-making. The proposed approach has been applied to a Cognitive Vision System for Hazard Control (CVP-HC) which is based on Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS) and Decisional DNA (DDNA) and has been designed to ensure that workers remain safe and compliant with Health and Safety policy for use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).},

The advantage of this method is that it is simple and thanks to this, the identifier is easy to retrieve after masking the identifiable data, e.g. when it is necessary to modify or update the micro-data. This can be done using public-key cryptography, i.e. encrypting some probabilistic context-free grammar with this method. In the case of public statistics, there is often a need to use an anonymised source value, for example when economic operators’ reports are verified by statistical officers. With appropriate information generated by context-free grammar, the verifier can easily identify an economic operator or a natural person. The idea of the anonymising algorithm used in the proposed method is presented by means of an example. According to the authors, the combination of the proposed method with asymmetric encryption of the definition of context-free grammar using public key infrastructure, makes it probable that its resistance to attacks will be quite high. This is because statistical methods that are used in the analysis of natural languages are not susceptible to attacks.},

Within a KBS, decision rules are a comprehensive and interpretable tool for classification and knowledge discovery from data. However, when the decision rules incorporated in a KBS are extracted from heterogeneous sources, they may suffer from several rule quality issues, which weakens the performance of a KBS. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a rule base refinement approach with considering rule quality measures. The proposed approach is based on a rule integration method for integrating the expert rules and the rules obtained from data mining. Within the integration process, rule accuracy, coverage, redundancy, conflict, and subsumption are the quality measures that we use to refine the rule base. A case study on a real-world data set shows the approach in detail.},

Focusing into MHUI mining, in this article, we present efficient approaches to directly mine MHUIs from transactional databases without generating any candidates. The proposed algorithms, which all execute in one phase, utilize many efficient data structures and pruning techniques such as EUCP combined with EUCS, CUIP combined with FUCS, and the P-set structure to significantly reduce the search space and remove nonpromising itemsets, thus, increase the performance of the MHUI mining process. Furthermore, while previous works assumed that the unit profit of items is fixed, which is not practical in many real-world applications, our work resolved this issue by applying a new utility calculation into the mining process to reflect the true nature of real-world databases, thus, generating more accurate results.},

  abstract     = {Retrieving relevant information from Twitter is always a challenging task given its vocabulary mismatch, sheer volume and noise. Representing the content of text tweets is a critical part of any microblog retrieval model. For this reason, deep neural networks can be used for learning good representations of text data and then conduct to a better matching. In this paper, we are interested in improving both representation and retrieval effectiveness in microblogs. For that, a Hybrid-Deep Neural-Network-based text representation model is proposed to extract effective features’ representations for clustering oriented microblog retrieval. HDNN combines recurrent neural network and feedforward neural network architectures. Specifically, using a bi-directional LSTM, we first generate a deep contextualized word representation which incorporates character n-grams form FasText. However, these contextual embedded existing in a high-dimensional space are not all important. Some of them are redundant, correlated and sometimes noisy making the learning models over-fitting, complex and less interpretable. To deal with these problems, we proposed a Hybrid-Regularized-Autoencoder-based method which combines autoencoder with Elastic Net regularization for an effective unsupervised feature selection and extraction. Our experimental results show that the performance of clustering and especially information retrieval in microblogs depend heavily on features’ representation.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid progress of information technologies, cars have been made increasingly intelligent. This allows cars to act as cognitive agents, i.e., to acquire knowledge and understanding of the driving habits and behavioral characteristics of drivers (i.e., driving behavioral fingerprint) through experience. Such knowledge can be then reused to facilitate the interaction between a car and its driver, and to develop better and safer car controls. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to extract the driver’s driving behavioral fingerprints based on our conceptual framework Experience-Oriented Intelligent Things (EOIT). EOIT is a learning system that has the potential to enable Internet of Cognitive Things (IoCT) where knowledge can be extracted from experience, stored, evolved, shared, and reused aiming for cognition and thus intelligent functionality of things. By catching driving data, this approach helps cars to collect the driver’s pedal and steering operations and store them as experience; eventually, it uses obtained experience for the driver’s driving behavioral fingerprint extraction. The initial experimental implementation is presented in the paper to demonstrate our idea, and the test results show that it outperforms the Deep Learning approaches (i.e., deep fully connected neural networks and recurrent neural networks/Long Short-Term Memory networks).},

To support this claim the article appeals to state-of-the-art technologies and emerging technologies concerning autonomous vehicle perception and decisionality, as a means to inform and frame ethical contexts.

We exemplify the game formulation in terms of nonlinear programing equations implementing the Lagrange principle. For ensuring the convergence of the game to an equilibrium point we employ the Tikhonov’s regularization method.
