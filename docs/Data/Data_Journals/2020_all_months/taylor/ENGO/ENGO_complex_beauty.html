  abstract     = {In this article, a new model is proposed for the operation of microgrids (MGs) using optimal distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) and optimal generation scheduling (OGS). The distributed generation units, electric vehicles and demand response (DR) are modelled in the presented model. The DR programs consider load shifting, load curtailing and time-of-use programs. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem and solved by the GAMS software package. The total operating cost is taken into account as the objective function and several operational constraints are used in the optimization problem. The simulation results of the 33-bus MG are shown, where considering OGS along with DFR leads to a lower operating cost. In addition, the load shifting of a DR program can reduce the total operating cost by smoothing the load profile and reducing the cost of power purchases from the main grid.},

  abstract     = {In the literature, line balancing is mostly investigated in deterministic environments. But production systems inevitably contain stochastic situations. In this study, the stochastic type-II assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) is considered. Firstly, a chance-constrained nonlinear mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation is developed from the well-known deterministic form. Then, a new linearized stochastic model is proposed by using some transformation approaches to reduce model complexity, and the model is solved. Finally, constraint programming (CP) models for deterministic ALBPs, nonlinear chance-constrained stochastic ALBPs and linearized chance-constrained stochastic ALBPs are developed, respectively. Problems from the literature are utilized to test the effectiveness of the proposed models and the results are compared with a bidirectional heuristic algorithm. The numerical results show that the CP models are more effective and successful for solving the stochastic ALBP. Some managerial implications are also suggested for industrial environments that consistently face ALBPs.},

A complex built-up system may be fabricated from many components which often differ greatly in materials and sizes. It may be subjected to many different wavelength structural deformations and may typically exhibit mixed mid-frequency behaviour which is very sensitive to uncertainties at higher frequencies. To perform optimization on the mid-frequency vibration of complex built-up systems, the hybrid finite element (FE)–statistical energy analysis (SEA) method, in which the deterministic and statistical subsystem are respectively modelled using FE and SEA, is implemented in this work. In this context, an efficient direct differentiation method for sensitivity analysis is derived.

Instead of using statistical energy analysis parameters as the uncertainty variables, material physical parameters, with a clearer physical meaning, are used; this is convenient for determining the perturbation interval and avoiding mutual coupling among the uncertain parameters. In this novel method, the derivative matrix of the loss factor matrix with respect to material parameters is derived, and the sensitivity during the uncertain transfer process is obtained analytically. This approach is more accurate than previous numerical methods. Using this interval statistical energy method, numerical examples are calculated and compared with results obtained using the Monte Carlo method, which shows that this method can effectively and accurately calculate the variation range of the system vibration energy under the condition of material uncertainty for structural–acoustic coupling systems.},

This may explain the simplicity of the relevant test problems in the academic literature in comparison with real structures. To address this challenge, this study advocates a customized optimization methodology which utilizes problem-specific knowledge. It improves upon a new bilevel truss optimization method to allow for an arbitrary trade-off between the stochastic upper level and the deterministic lower level search. Numerical simulations demonstrate that for large-scale truss design problems, the proposed method can find significantly lighter structures up to 300 times more quickly than the best existing metaheuristic methods. The remarkable findings of this study demonstrate the importance of using engineering knowledge and discourage future research on the development of purely metaheuristic methods for truss optimization.},

Although conventional robust design optimization (RDO) can effectively take into account these uncertainties under the specified robust requirement, it is less satisfactory in addressing these difficulties owing to the prohibitive numerical cost of finite element analysis of stiffened shells. To improve the efficiency of RDO of imperfect stiffened shells, a new hybrid surrogate model (HSM), taking full advantage of the efficiency of the smeared stiffener method and the accuracy of the finite element method, is developed in this article. Then, a new active learning method is constructed based on the HSM. Furthermore, a hybrid bi-stage RDO framework is proposed to alleviate the computational burden incurred by repeated structural analysis. An example of a typical 3 m diameter stiffened shell demonstrates the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

To determine whether the objective function is a strictly convex function, whether or not the Hesse matrix of the objective function is positive definite is considered, which could determine whether the constructed convex-programming problem has a unique global minimum. An analysis of various combinations of elastic constants for the dam and rock foundation shows that when the l 1 norm of the difference between the theoretical value and the measured value is used as the objective function, the Hesse matrix is not guaranteed to be positive definite, so the multi-parameter elastic-displacement inverse analysis of the concrete gravity dam gives no unique global minimum.},

To overcome the local minima problem, virtual target points are selected based on the rapidly exploring random trees method, which can consider the global information. The manipulator reaches the virtual target points one by one until the desired target is reached.

Each agent desires to minimize a certain cost function that depends only on its own tasks&#39; completion times. Different cost functions are considered for both agents, including the maximum of regular cost, total completion time, and (weighted) number of tardy tasks. The purpose is to determine a feasible solution for all tasks of the two agents that minimizes the cost value of the first agent while maintaining the cost value of the other agent, not exceeding a given threshold value.

  abstract     = {Cell formation plays an important role in the design of cellular manufacturing systems. Among many methods utilized to solve the cell formation problem, the similarity coefficient method is the most widely used owing to its high flexibility and low computational requirement. However, generalized similarity coefficients ignore material flow, which is closely related to operation sequence and repeated operations. Moreover, most similarity coefficient-based clustering algorithms focus on the number of inter-cell movements but disregard distinction of the movement effort. To overcome these limitations, this study improves the generalized similarity coefficient method to form part families. In addition, a new clustering algorithm is presented to assign machines to cells with minimum intensity of material inter-cell movement, which depends on the frequency, production volume and difficulty level of inter-cell movement. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has superior sensitivity and effectiveness for solving the cell formation problem.},

  abstract     = {To improve the complexity of traditional variable screening and the optimization efficiency of automotive lightweight design, an objective evaluation and screening method is proposed, using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (HMCDM) method combined with contribution analysis. Multi-objective optimization design is conducted for the static and dynamic performance of the cab-in-white (CIW). An implicit parametric model of the CIW was built to define complex shapes and size variables. The HMCDM and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods combined with regression analysis were used to determine the final optimization parameters of the CIW. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II was used to determine the optimal design parameters to improve the bending stiffness, torsion stiffness and mass of the CIW without reducing low-order natural frequencies. Compared with empirical and TOPSIS-based screening methods, HMCDM is closer to the design requirements. The CIW’s mass was reduced by 31.36 kg and performance was improved.},

At the mesoscale, the effective properties of planar unit cells with graded geometric feature parameters are evaluated via a numerical homogenization method. Communication between unit cells and global structures is established based on a set of property-fitting functions to approximate intermediate element properties. To enhance the manufacturing of the resulting designs, the minimum feature size is constrained and an additional solid layer is attached to the structural boundaries. The design of a cantilever beam is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The effects on mechanical performance of lattice materials with different topologies are numerically analysed and experimentally validated.},

To make a fair comparison, the parameters of each algorithm are tuned on five small roads using performance profiles. Then the algorithms are evaluated on 35 roads, ranging from small to very large roads. The results show that using multi-fidelity surrogates in optimization algorithms provide notable speed-up when compared to single-fidelity algorithms while preserving the quality of solutions (cost error &lt; 1 % ).

The proposed model is applied to a 3.5 km pavement (500 road sections) and leads to recommendations for the optimal pavement maintenance plans with appropriate possibilities. The results indicate that seven plans are the same as those obtained by the experience-based maintenance approach, while the other three are similar. The framework is also verified by comparison with the experience-based maintenance activities and is found to have limited reliability when dealing with a small quantity of solutions.

This paper develops a new mix-integer linear programming model (called M1) to integrate these problems. The model was validated by comparing it against two other benchmark models where both omit the IPCC planning. The second model (M2) combines OPMPS and truck fleet sizing, but the third one (M3) is a conventional model that deals with OPMPS and fleet sizing, separately.

In view of the randomness of earthquake actions, optimal control criteria should be established in a probabilistic sense. Considering the trade-off between control effectiveness and energy consumption, two sets of probabilistic criteria for stochastic optimal control of structures are therefore developed, on the basis of peak and root-mean-square values of objective quantities. In the proposed genetic algorithm, an effective selection policy, an improved binary single-point crossover and a new single-locus or two-locus mutation are adopted.

This algorithm is free from any algorithm-specific control parameters and requires only common control parameters. The natural frequencies and/or mode shapes are utilized in establishing an objective function. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated by two numerical examples, namely a television tower and a functionally graded material beam. A set of experimental work on a cantilever beam is studied for further veriﬁcation. Both numerical and experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed EBL algorithm in terms of convergence and accuracy for structural damage identiﬁcation, in comparison with particle swarm optimization, the cloud model-based fruit fly optimization algorithm, squirrel search algorithm and teaching–learning-based optimization.},

  abstract     = {A critical process in brass casting is the blending of pure and scrap materials to satisfy specified metal ratios. The primary focus in such blending problems has always been cost minimization. The optimal blends produced by mathematical models use large amounts of scrap materials, which are cheaper but have high variations in ingredient ratios. This gives rise to quality problems. This study aims at joint optimization of cost and quality. A chance-constrained nonlinear mathematical model is developed for maximizing the minimum process capability level for a fixed cost. Then parametric programming is used to run the model for different costs to produce a Pareto-optimal frontier. An application to data from a brass factory showed that the frontier is highly nonlinear, enabling the decision maker to select a competitive process capability and cost value combination. The proposed approach is applicable to any blending problem in which ingredient amounts have statistical variation.},

Similar results are demonstrated for the 810 multi-demand multidimensional knapsack problems (MDMKPs) in Beasley&#39;s OR-Library. Additionally, using these 270 MKP and 810 MDMKP problem instances, it is shown that even if only some of the variables have choice constraints imposed on them, the CPLEX solution times are drastically reduced. These results provide motivation for operations research practitioners to check whether choice constraints are applicable (even if only on some of the variables) when solving real-world problems involving generalizations of the 0–1 knapsack problem.},

However, the problem is complicated owing to process complexity and industrial noise. These factors make it difficult to obtain precise prediction results by a mechanism model in practical production. In this article, an integrated modelling approach is proposed through combining mechanism and data-driven models. This method constructs a generalized-kernel support vector regression (SVR) on new search space to improve the predictive performance of a mechanism model, in which the kernel matrix is a combination of multiple single kernels. The learning problem can be solved globally by a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. Numerical experiments using actual data from an iron and steel enterprise in China are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated method.},

Taking the maximum structural stiffness as the design objective, a concurrent method for determining the optimal distribution and orientation of orthotropic materials is proposed in this article. The method for determining material orientation theoretically overcomes the ‘repeated global minimum’ phenomenon, which often occurs in strain-based and stress-based methods, when the material is shear ‘strong’. Then, the concurrent optimization methodology for material distribution and orientation is developed by introducing an independent discrete topology variable and continuous material orientation angle. The optimized designs of material distribution and orientation are obtained concurrently by the gradient-based bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method and the proposed material orientation optimization method. Numerical two- and three-dimensional examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed concurrent optimization algorithm.},

The metric for the electric drive actuators&#39; energy for the BWB during cruising is characterized by summing the absolute hinge moments for all actuators. A local minimum is easily obtained for the optimization problem with a least absolute sum cost function when using a gradient-based optimizer. The minimization of the total actuator energy is converted to a linear programming problem by treating the absolute hinge moments as design variables. The induced and profile drags are considered to be the largest two contributions to the total drag. Design variables for the flap rotations and the absolute hinge moments with different orders of magnitude are scaled with respect to their maximum bounds in the optimization study to avoid numerical problems. Different VCCTEF configurations of varying deflection profiles and degrees of actuation independence and traditional flaps are studied and their performance is compared. For the BWB with four representative fuel levels, 80, 50, 20 and 0% of the maximum fuel loads, all during cruising, multiobjective optimization studies show that the VCCTEF with three individual segments can achieve a minimal total drag for the BWB while requiring a minimal total actuator energy to maintain its optimal shape for the minimal total drag.},

In this article, a design optimization case study from the automobile industry is narrated, stating three different problem solving scenarios arising sequentially after each problem is solved. The article shows how each problem description can be formulated as a suitable optimization problem and how a suitable and existing optimization algorithm can be modified to find the respective solutions of interest to the engineer. The sequential reformulation of problems and their solutions not only allow engineers eventually to discover the final solutions of interest, the whole process is extremely rewarding to them in terms of knowledge gathered about alternative potential solutions of the problem.

Then, an optimization model of the PMS with hybrid uncertainties is established based on the HPFDM, where the uncertain responses of the relevant NFs and DRs are taken to create optimization constraints and optimization objectives.

The most important criteria of sustainable supplier selection are developed to select the suppliers. The supplier selection process is conducted using an analytical hierarchy process. The order allocation process determines the optimum purchasing quantity of items from each supplier in each period. To achieve this, six objective functions, total cost, economic score, environmental score, social score, inflation rate and risk level, and the related constraints are considered in the model.

  abstract     = {The satellite photograph scheduling problem has attracted increasing attention owing to its difficulty of solution and remarkable economic importance. The optimization problem involves scheduling the on-board cameras of the Earth observation satellite to gain more profit from the oversubscribed photograph requests. To tackle the real-world problem, a hybrid heuristic algorithm is developed. The algorithm skilfully integrates the common genetic operators and a well-designed two-phase repair operator into the evolutionary framework of an artificial bee colony. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of three state-of-the-art metaheuristics on an open test suite consisting of 20 benchmark instances and a new test set composed of 10 randomly generated large-scale problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best performance.},

Maintenance activities require an enormous amount of energy consumption in engineering problems. For selective maintenance, many studies focus on the trade-off between system reliability and other resources, such as time and cost. The enormous energy consumption of maintenance processes has been ignored in previous research. In this work, a novel energy consumption model considering the actual maintenance process is proposed. Moreover, system reliability is added to the optimization model as a crucial constraint, which makes the optimization process of energy consumption meaningful. The selective maintenance process is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Hence, a hybrid differential evolution and gravitational search algorithm (DGSA) is proposed to solve the selective maintenance problem considering energy consumption. In addition, several experiments with DGSA, particle swarm optimization and differential evolution are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

A preferable strategy to deal with the multivariate output issue is the covariance decomposition approach based on the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) metamodel. However, since the PCE construction depends on the quality of experimental design to some extent, the selection of design points is significant in determining the accuracy of the sensitivity estimator. In this article, a PCE-based sequential experimental design is proposed to estimate the multivariate output sensitivity index. In this method, the optimal design point is sequentially selected to minimize the determinant of covariance matrix of the sensitivity estimator. To validate the performance of the proposed method, several numerical examples are presented, which show that the sequential design approach performs better than other prevalent methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

An RBDO model is formulated for the vehicle body crashworthiness problem based on a finite element model of a vehicle crash. Taking into account the correlation of random parameters, the optimal copula function is selected by the Bayesian method to model parametric correlation and build the joint probability distribution function.

To make the signal–response relationship insensitive to noise factors, the variation model and response model are developed using kriging models. In the variation model, the mean and standard deviation of the variation in response over the range of the signal factor are fitted and then synthesized as the robustness criterion, which is minimized to optimize the settings of control factors.

At the lower level, the price-anticipating microgrids determine the amount of dispatchable resources generated, the load and the storage serving while maximizing their payoffs. When setting price, the main grid needs to consider the microgrids’ response. By Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions and a smoothing method, the primal bilevel programming is transformed into an equivalent single-level optimization problem with only smooth equality constraints, and then a rolling penalty function algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal solution. The convergence of the smoothing method is demonstrated.

Vehicles attached to the depot are used to perform multiple trips owing to the relatively short delivery distance.

As the problem is a proven NP-hard problem, for solving large-sized instances quickly, an adaptive large neighbourhood search algorithm combined with a labelling procedure (ALNS-L) is proposed.

For the general case of the problem, heuristic and branch-and-bound procedures are developed to solve the problem. Computational experiments are also performed to examine the effectiveness and the efficiency of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {A hybrid optimization approach using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) combined with Taguchi-Grey has been developed and tested for the first time to optimize the stir–squeeze casting process parameters in the production of aluminium metal matrix composites reinforced with alumina for automotive brake disc application. The AHP method was used for assigning a weight to the response variables, which was based on experts’ opinion on the importance of the response variables for brake disc application. For producing brake discs, the optimum process parameters are found to be a squeeze pressure of 100 MPa, squeeze time of 45 s, die preheating temperature of 250°C and stirrer speed of 525 rpm. Also, a confirmatory analysis was carried out to validate these optimum process parameters, and the results indicated enhanced compressive strength of 433 MPa (18.5% increase) and reduced porosity of 5.29% (13.5% decrease) in the composite.},

The heat transfer structure is assembled by heat channels which are determined by width, start point and end point. Hierarchy growth consists of successive growth of principal channel and lateral channel. Specifically, the space colonization algorithm with temperature information (SCATI) is applied to the growth of the principal channels, and the law of minimal thermal resistance is applied to control the growth of the lateral channels. The superiority of the suggested method is demonstrated by three typical design problems. In addition, design parameters including the number of principal channels and the bifurcation exponent in Murray’s law are discussed, and the results prove the reasonability of the parameter selection based on natural branch systems. Finally, the thermal performance comparison between the structure designed by constructal theory and a dendritic heat transfer structure shows experimentally the effectiveness of the suggested method.},

In such a manner, an efficient approach for the MBDO-driven design of TO-based concepts is obtained. An implicit hypersurface representing the TO-based concept is generated by classifying the TO-solutions of zeros and ones by using the 1-norm SVM of Mangasarian. The implicit SVM-based hypersurfaces are then utilized to set up designs of experiments of nonlinear finite element analyses by morphing the TO-based concepts by using Boolean and blending operations. Finally, MBDO is performed by using an ensemble of metamodels consisting of quadratic regression, Kriging, radial basis function networks, polynomial chaos expansion and support vector regression models. The proposed MBDO framework is demonstrated by minimizing the mass of a three-dimensional design domain with a constraint on the plastic limit load. The performance of the approach is most promising.},

The proposed methodology applied to lifting structures aims to eliminate numerical instabilities due to the weight load while improving the overall solution quality. In this model, a power-law function is used to update the element density in the determination of the self-weight. The algorithm is tested and verified for a two-dimensional benchmark problem subjected to self-weight loads and a point force. Results show that the proposed method improves the discreteness of the design of structures subjected to lifting surface loads. Following the verification step, the proposed method is used to optimize the internal structure of an aircraft wing. The aerodynamic load is computed assuming a rigid wing body, and the loading condition is completed with the structure self-weight. Results show that, in this particular example, the self-weight load has a negligible influence on the optimal design.},

The EFG topology optimization model of anisotropic thermal structure was verified by benchmark examples based on the finite element method (FEM). The effects of the orthotropic factor and off-angle on EFG topology optimization results were studied. The results show that EFG optimal structures have better heat dissipation performance, and the boundary profiles are clearer than with FEM even without filtering techniques, enabling manufacture using 3D printing technology.

However, selecting one sampling point per cycle may result in large time consumption and loss of convergence accuracy. To this end, a kriging-based multi-point unconstrained global optimization (KMUGO) method is proposed. It extends the GEGO method with the improved constant liar (CL) strategy. For each cycle, the kriging model is first constructed or updated by the existing sampled data. Then, the enhanced alternative CL strategy is used to find multiple points, which will be further screened to identify the final expensive-evaluation points. Test results of numerical problems and an engineering simulation case show that KMUGO can deliver better convergence than GEGO, multi-point sampling method-based kriging (MPSK), hybrid and adaptive meta-model-based global optimization (HAM) and the kriging-based global optimization method using multi-point infill search criterion (KGOMISC).},

The expense of the analyses leads to the use of a surrogate modelling based optimization technique (multi-objective expected improvement using Kriging).

The parametric identification of four viscoelastic models attempted in this study includes the Kelvin–Voigt (K-V) model, the Zener model, and the Burger-I and Burger-II models. To identify the parameters accurately, a multi-objective optimization problem with conflicting objective functions has been solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). The obtained results indicate that the Zener model best captures the transmissibility variation.

Its potential drawback is its high computational cost, inhibiting the execution of EM-driven tasks requiring massive simulations. The applicability of equivalent network models is limited owing to the topological complexity of compact microstrip components because of EM cross-coupling effects. Development of alternative representations (surrogate models) is therefore necessary. This article proposes a two-level methodology for reliable modelling of compact microstrip components. The keystone is to define the surrogate domain using the first-level model approximating the set of pre-existing reference designs. This limits the volume of the parameter space region that needs to be sampled when constructing the second-level model. The presented approach provides far greater accuracy than conventional methods and is capable of establishing surrogates covering wide ranges of geometric parameters and operating conditions of a particular structure. Applications for parametric optimization are also provided.},

  abstract     = {The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is an intelligence-based technique that simulates the hunting behaviour of humpback whales in nature. In this article, an adaptation of the original version of the WOA is made for handling binary optimization problems. For this purpose, two transfer functions (S-shaped and V-shaped) are presented to map a continuous search space to a binary one. To illustrate the functionality and performance of the proposed binary whale optimization algorithm (bWOA), its results when applied on twenty-two benchmark functions, three engineering optimization problems and a real-world travelling salesman problem are found. Furthermore, the proposed bWOA is compared with five well-known metaheuristic algorithms. The experimental results show its superiority in comparison with other state-of-the-art metaheuristics in terms of accuracy and speed. Finally, Wilcoxon&#39;s rank-sum non-parametric statistical test is carried out at the 5% significance level to judge whether the results of the proposed algorithm differ from those of the other comparison algorithms in a statistically significant way.},

First, a new algorithm is proposed to determine the sublevels, which focuses on minimizing the development costs while maintaining access to the profitable portions of the ore-body. Then, the stope layout is planned between the sublevels. A new mixed-integer linear programming formulation for determining the ultimate stope limits is introduced.

The results show that the output of the stope layout plan is within the optimal mining limits, which confirms the validity of the approach.},

The CFSS is applied to automatically determine an adaptive search step in each iteration, thus enhancing the exploration capability of the CFSSDA. The performance of the CFSSDA is investigated on the basis of three widely used benchmark numerical examples. The results indicate that the proposed CFSSDA achieves a markedly improved convergence rate while maintaining a high accuracy. Furthermore, the CFSSDA is utilized to find the optimal parameters for an engineering frame structure problem with discrete variables under stress constraints. These results also show that the CFSSDA can rapidly generate an optimal structure with a weight that is reduced by 27.97% compared with the initial design.},

Therefore, only a reduced number of iterations is affordable for the optimization algorithm. However, using fewer iterations can lead to inaccurate solutions far from the real Pareto optimal front. In this article, different mechanisms are analysed and compared to improve the convergence of a preference-based multi-objective optimization algorithm called the Weighting Achievement Scalarizing Function Genetic Algorithm (WASF-GA).

First, the joint limit avoidance (JLA) and singularity avoidance (SGA) optimizations are employed. Owing to the complicated geometry of the welding path, despite using JLA and SGA optimizations, some constraints, such as joint angles, violate their allowable limits. Hence, functional redundancy (FNR) is employed as the best solution because it has no effect on the welding electrode direction. In this article, the FNR is used as an augmented task, which changes the desired path without affecting the electrode direction. To select the best FNR angle, two indices, i.e. the minimum joint angles movement and the singularity avoidance indices, are introduced. Simulation results show that the planned path using FNR not only satisfies all constraints, but also is smooth.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimization is an active field of research that has many applications. Owing to its success and because decision-making processes are becoming more and more complex, there is a recent trend for incorporating many objectives into such problems. The challenge with such problems, however, is that the dimensions of the solution sets—the so-called Pareto sets and fronts—grow with the number of objectives. It is thus no longer possible to compute or to approximate the entire solution set of a given problem that contains many ( e.g. more than three) objectives. On the other hand, the computation of single solutions ( e.g. via scalarization methods) leads to unsatisfying results in many cases, even if user preferences are incorporated. In this article, the Pareto Explorer tool is presented—a global/local exploration tool for the treatment of many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). In the first step, a solution of the problem is computed via a global search algorithm that ideally already includes user preferences. In the second step, a local search along the Pareto set/front of the given MaOP is performed in user specified directions. For this, several continuation-like procedures are proposed that can incorporate preferences defined in decision, objective, or in weight space. The applicability and usefulness of Pareto Explorer is demonstrated on benchmark problems as well as on an application from industrial laundry design.},

Note that the success of the proposed method is highly dependent on the choice of a few influential factors, including the maximal number of iterations for each player, the splitting and mapping schemes of design variables, and the allocation strategies of objective functions to different players. Therefore, the impacts of these factors are firstly assessed by a two-objective optimization case of the NACA0012 airfoil, and some useful inferences are produced for the choice of these factors.

Five types of local-resonance microstructure with the property of negative effective mass are applied on the sandwich structure to study the effects of different resonators on load attenuation. The theoretical and numerical results show that the multi-resonator model (MM) exhibits the best attenuation effect. The damping characteristic is added to the MM to further improve the structure responses. The analytical results clearly demonstrate that the combination of damping characteristic and local resonance of multi-resonators can significantly dissipate the impact energy and mitigate the dynamic load. Optimization analyses are also carried out to optimize the spring stiffness, lumped mass and damping coefficient. The performance of the sandwich panel structure is significantly improved with a relatively small structural mass.},

For two different due-date assignment methods— i.e. common (CON) due-date assignment and slack (SLK) due-date assignment—a bi-criteria analysis is provided wherein the first objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the absolute value in lateness with a common due date (a common flow-allowance), and the second objective is to minimize the weighted sum of resource consumption. Optimality properties and algorithms are proposed to solve three different versions of considering these two criteria.},

A min–max regret criterion-based robust scheduling model is established by taking both the robustness of total completion time and the tardiness of production into consideration simultaneously. To decrease the infinite number of scenarios to a limited level, a directed graph tool is applied to conduct worst case scenario analysis. In addition, since the PFSP is proved to be NP hard, a genetic algorithm is implemented to solve this robust scheduling model. Experimental simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of this model. Moreover, it could cover the drawback of the traditional uncertain scheduling models, which consider only the robustness of total completion time. This could help manufacturing enterprises to increase time delivery capability so as to enhance downstream customers’ satisfaction.},

The GA was capable of tackling the complicated fuzzy membership function and was used to seek optimal solutions by progressively evaluating the performance of the individual solutions; meanwhile, FCCP ensured that the fuzzy constraints were satisfied at specified confidence levels, leading to cost-effective solutions under acceptable risk magnitudes. A long-term regional waste management model of Zhongshan City, China, was formulated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed GAFCCP model.

One way to obtain such a flow distribution is by minimizing the variance of pipe flows. The available analytical method is critically studied, and observed to fail in providing global minimum variance of flow series. The analytical method accounts for the flow directions, while a variance evaluation requires that only the magnitude of flows is considered. A general nonlinear programming approach is tried, and it is observed that it requires correct knowledge of the flow direction. This article presents a genetic algorithm-based method to avoid this limitation. A linear programming-based algorithm is then suggested for selecting the optimal pipe sizes considering reliability.

Based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method, the J integral, as a criterion for predicting crack growth, is considered to prevent crack propagation and enhance the fracture strength of the structure. Several typical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the present method by considering different situations of length and location of the crack, and the interactions between crack, void and inclusion. The results suggest that combining the XFEM with BESO is a promising approach for optimizing the anti-fracturing mechanical properties of structures.},

Models are mostly available for two- and three-dimensional continuum structures. Recently, these models have been extended to laminated plates and shells. The goal of this article is to introduce constraints on local stresses to these new models. The associated optimization problems are highly nonlinear semidefinite programming problems that are known to be challenging for numerical tractability, and are solved by a primal–dual interior point method previously proposed for FMO problems without stress constraints. The algorithm utilizes the FMO problem structure, wherein the matrix inequality constraints involve small many block matrices. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the stress constrained models and the capability of the method to obtain solutions to these problems within a modest number of iterations.},

The proposed objective functions are solved with a novel metaheuristic optimization technique, the grey wolf optimization algorithm. Four numerical examples are studied to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. Moreover, studies are conducted not only to assess the robustness of the methods in more realistic circumstances, but also to justify the necessity of using these techniques.

Tight lower bounds and three heuristics are developed based on the problem’s properties. Then, a hybrid membrane computing metaheuristic called the HMC algorithm is proposed, in which a dynamic membrane structure is applied to perform effective exploration, and a variable neighbourhood search is embedded in each iteration. In addition, a problem-dependent speed-up neighbourhood is employed to improve the efficiency.

  abstract     = {Simulation-based optimization is a useful tool in the design of complex engineering products. Simulation models are used to capture numerous aspects of the design problem for the objective function. Optimization results obtained can be assessed from various perspectives. In this study, component and control optimization of a series hydraulic hybrid vehicle is used as an application, and different robustness and performance aspects are evaluated. Owing to relatively high computational loads, efficient optimization algorithms are important to provide sufficient quality of results at reasonable computational costs. To estimate problem complexity and evaluate optimization algorithm performance, the definitions for information entropy and the related performance index are extended. The insights gained from various simulation-based optimization experiments and their subsequent analysis help characterize the efficiency of the optimization problem formulation and parameterization, as well as optimization algorithm selection with respect to parallel computation capabilities for further development of the model and optimization framework.},

In addition, engineering systems are often comprised of several subsystems or disciplines. The coupling characteristic between different disciplines incurs the difficulty of solving multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems. In this article, a new method is proposed for multidisciplinary robust design optimization (MRDO) incorporating parameter and model uncertainties. In this method, the parameter uncertainty is described by an interval model. The model uncertainty is quantified by the Bayesian approach, which adds a bias function into the computer model to offset the output discrepancy between the actual physical system and the computer model. Meanwhile, Gaussian process models of the computer model and the bias function are constructed. Finally, an MRDO framework considering parameter and model uncertainties is established. The performance of the proposed method is tested through two MDO problems.},

  abstract     = {Traditional notch flexure hinges have been widely used in precision engineering, but the lumped notch configuration limits the range of motion. This article presents a synthesis method for designing flexure hinges with distributed configurations using topology optimization. In order to obtain a distributed configuration, an optimization model for the topology optimization of a distributed flexure hinge is developed first. The objective is to maximize the bending displacement while minimizing the axial displacement. The constraint for accomplishing the symmetry requirement is presented. Then flexure hinges having the desired performance are designed on the basis of a distributed configuration. In particular, this work offers optimization models for designing flexure hinges with prescribed compliances and with minimal parasitic motion. This method is implemented based on the popular Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method, and a number of numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. The results of the examples demonstrate that the flexure hinges obtained have distributed configurations and the desired performances (prescribed compliances or minimal parasitic motion).},

The proposed hybrid method integrates the concepts of saddlepoint approximation, the dimension reduction method (DRM) and copulas. The moment-based saddlepoint approximation enhanced by the DRM is used to calculate the component reliability. The copula method is adopted to realize the joint failure probability modelling between two failure modes. Reliability-based sensitivity analysis for the reliability-based robust design optimization is carried out as well. The structural system optimization model is established, including the Euclid norm of the reliability sensitivity as an optimization objective and system reliability as a constraint.

Secondly, an integration method of optimal Latin hypercube design and regression analysis is used to obtain the polynomial model, followed by sensitivity analysis. Thus, the key parameters affecting the dynamic response are identified. An interval uncertain optimization method for artillery structural dynamic responses considering robustness and interval economy is then proposed, based on nonlinear interval programming and the nested optimization solving strategy, which integrates the back-propagation neural network with the genetic algorithm as the inner optimizer, and uses the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II as the outer optimizer.

A statistical study of the performance of twelve different meta-heuristic algorithms and one gradient technique indicates that using the fittest solution in the meta-heuristic optimization process through generations allows finding more suitable controller parameters. Also, real tests with each of the best control gains obtained using algorithms are realized as a laboratory prototype.

An opposition-based tuned-chaotic differential evolution (OTCDE) technique is proposed to avoid premature convergence. This technique uses an opposition-based scheme for initialization and logistic mapping to generate chaotic sequences within the specified range for the mutation factor, because wrong parameter selection may lead to premature convergence and even stagnation.

LSGA adopts modified order crossover, probabilistic mutation and adaptive selection operators to enrich population diversity and speed up convergence. A local search strategy is also presented in the approach to enhance the search ability. The performance of the proposed method is compared with several established methods in three perspectives, namely space-filling quality, computational efficiency and predictive accuracy of the metamodel.

This article addresses such shortcomings by presenting an improved multi-objective heat transfer search algorithm (MOIHTS), which is capable of solving multi-objective problems while addressing the HTS updating problem.

  abstract     = {This article deals with an integrated optimization problem of production scheduling and common due-window assignment on a single machine. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which is a weighted sum function of earliness and tardiness, due-window starting time, and due-window size, where the weights only depend on their position in a sequence ( i.e. position-dependent weights). A polynomial time solution algorithm is provided for the corresponding problem. The problem can also be extended to slack due-windows assignment and general position-dependent processing times. It is proved that both these extensions remain polynomially solvable.},

In general, signomial programs are very difficult to solve for obtaining the globally optimal solution. This study reformulates the engineering design problem with discrete signomial terms as a mixed-integer linear program and finds all alternative global optima. Compared with existing exact methods, the proposed method uses fewer variables and constraints in the reformulated model and therefore efficiently solves the engineering problem to derive all global optima. Illustrative examples from the literature are solved to demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With continued growth in air traffic, airports worldwide are expanding their runway infrastructure. This leads to the problem of determining an appropriate location and height for an Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower that can provide the right vantage point for coordinating runway and taxiway movements. The challenge involves finding the right location and optimal height that can satisfy the visibility and obstruction constraints for a complex airport-airside environment with multiple runways and civil infrastructure under different weather conditions. This article formulates the ATC tower location and height problem as a Mixed-Integer-Programming (MIP) model while considering the visibility and obstruction constraints. Singapore Changi Airport&#39;s proposed third runway extension is used as a case study to determine the set of location and height of ATC Tower using the proposed approach. A visual analytic test is conducted in an ATC tower simulator for different tower locations and heights under varying visibility conditions.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of vehicle powertrains is usually based on specific drive cycles and is performed on testbeds under reproducible conditions. However, in real-world operation, energy consumption and emissions differ significantly from the values obtained in testbed environments, which also implies breaching legislative thresholds. Therefore, in order to close the gap between testbed and real world, it is necessary to take random effects, like varying road and ambient conditions or various traffic situations, into account during the engine calibration process. In this article a stochastic optimization approach based on risk measures, that quantify the prevalent uncertainties, is presented. Rather than optimizing a deterministic value for one specific scenario described by a drive cycle, the distribution of possible outcomes is shaped in a way that it reflects the risk aversion and preferences of the decision maker. Simulation results show that incorporating randomness in the optimization process yields substantially more robust and reliable results.},

This study investigates the effect of these parameters on the thermal buckling load of a composite plate with a quasi-square cut-out. Optimal values of the parameters are determined using a genetic algorithm to achieve the maximum buckling load. The composite used herein is a four-layer laminated composite plate. The stacking sequences of the plate are also studied. Stability equations are obtained using first order shear deformation theory. The results showed that a plate with a quasi-square cut-out is more resistant to thermal buckling than one with a circular cut-out; thermal buckling of a composite plate is dependent on various parameters, and the maximum thermal buckling load can be achieved by appropriate selection of these parameters.},

This problem is established on the basis of leader–follower games in the form of defender–attacker–defender. Moreover, attempts are made to make the model more realistic by considering a time horizon. To solve the problem, a combination of a genetic algorithm, simulated annealing and an exact method is used. Comparison of the solution method of the applied metaheuristic algorithm and the exact solution method in a number of small samples indicates the desirable performance of this algorithm in a reasonable time.},

An integer nonlinear mathematical programming model is proposed to describe this problem. Based on the model, a two-stage algorithm consisting of obtaining feasible solutions and a local search is proposed to solve the JS-LOB problem. The local search has two operators: the first is a neighbourhood structure based on a disjunctive graph model, and the second is similar to crossover in the genetic algorithm to avoid falling into local optima. Computational results are presented for a set of benchmark tests. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and indicate whether the processing time of the job conforms to a uniform distribution. When the proportion between the capacity of the buffer and the number of jobs is larger than 20%, the influence of the buffer becomes very small.},

The thermal resistance and the pumping power, considered as indicators of the thermal performance, have been approximated by surrogated models based on response surface approximation. The optimization task is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem. This approach has been implemented in GAMS. Sufficient details on both the single-criterion and multi-criteria formulation of the problem have been provided. The implications of the mathematical modelling formulation and the interrelationship between criteria and estimated quantities have been clarified.

Reliability-based design and robust design are probabilistic strategies traditionally used for this purpose. In the present contribution, reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) is formulated as a multi-objective problem considering the interaction of both approaches. The proposed methodology is based on the differential evolution algorithm associated with two strategies to deal with reliability and robustness, respectively, namely inverse reliability analysis and the effective mean concept. This multi-objective optimization problem considers the maximization of reliability and robustness coefficients as additional objective functions. The effectiveness of the methodology is illustrated by two classical test cases and a rotor-dynamics application. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is an alternative method to solve RBRDO problems.},
