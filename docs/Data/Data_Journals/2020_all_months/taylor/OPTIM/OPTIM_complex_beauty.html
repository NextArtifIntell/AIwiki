Moreover, we obtain an equilibrium EVP, where the perturbation contains a σ -convex subset and the quasi-metric. From the above two general EVPs, we deduce several interesting corollaries, which extend and improve the related known results. Several examples show that the obtained set-valued EVPs are new. Finally, applying the above EVPs to organizational behavior sciences, we obtain some interesting results on organizational change and development with leadership.

A particularly attractive class of nonsmooth problems, both from a theoretical and from an algorithmic perspective, are optimization problems in so-called abs-normal form as developed by Griewank and Walther. Here we generalize their theory for the unconstrained case to nonsmooth NLPs with equality and inequality constraints in abs-normal form, obtaining similar necessary and sufficient conditions of first and second order that are directly based on classical Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory for smooth NLPs. Several small examples illustrate the theoretical results. We also give some brief remarks on the intimate relationship of abs-normal NLPs with MPECs.},

Saddle point problems, after discretization, lead to a non-invertible system, whereas the regularized saddle point problems result in an invertible system. Regularization methods, in the context of saddle point problems, have also been used to mitigate the role of the Inf-Sup condition, synonymously, also called the Babuska-Brezzi condition. This work aims to analyze the impact of regularizing the saddle point problem on the inverse problem. We investigate the inverse problem by using the output least-squares objective. To exploit the use of regularization fully, we work under the assumption that the solution map is nonempty. We regularize the saddle point problem and consider a family of optimization problems using the output least-squares objective for the regularized saddle point problem where some noise contaminates the whole data set. We give a complete convergence analysis showing that the optimization problems, given for the regularized output least-squares, approximate the original problem suitably. We also provide the first-order and the second-order adjoint method for the computation of the first-order and the second-order derivatives of the output least-squares objective. We present some heuristic numerical results. In the context of the elasticity imaging inverse problem, we conduct detailed numerical experiments on synthetic data (to study the role of the regularization parameter) as well as on phantom data.},

A special case, the discrete Sugeno integral, defined with respect to a nonadditive measure (a capacity), enables accounting for the interdependencies between input variables. However, until recently the problem of identifying the fuzzy measure values with respect to various objectives and requirements has not received a great deal of attention. By expressing the learning problem as the difference of convex functions, we are able to apply DC (difference of convex) optimization methods. Here we formulate one of the global optimization steps as a local linear programming problem and investigate the improvement under different conditions.

This multiobjective version of the classical method also requires a penalty barrier for the feasible set and a sequence of nonnegative penalty parameters. Differently from the single-valued procedure, MBM is implemented by means of an auxiliary ‘monotonic’ real-valued mapping, which may be chosen in a quite large set of functions. Here, we consider problems with continuous objective functions, where the feasible sets are defined by finitely many continuous inequalities. Under mild assumptions, and depending on the monotonicity type of the auxiliary function, we establish convergence to Pareto or weak Pareto optima. Finally, we also propose an implementable version of MBM for seeking local optima and analyse its convergence to Pareto or weak Pareto solutions.},

Furthermore, we prove that this family of functions preserve some properties of concave functions and contains the whole family of pseudo-concave and semi-strictly quasi-concave functions that appear in the literature.

The SPDG algorithm generalizes the Spingarn’s partial inverse method by allowing scaling factors, a key strategy to speed up the convergence of numerical algorithms. In this note, we show that the SPDG algorithm can alternatively be analysed by means of the original Spingarn’s partial inverse framework, tracing back to the 1983 Spingarn’s paper. We simply show that under the assumptions considered in by Mahey, Oualibouch and Tao, the Spingarn’s partial inverse of the underlying maximal monotone operator is strongly monotone, which allows one to employ recent results on the convergence and iteration-complexity of proximal point-type methods for strongly monotone operators. By doing this, we additionally obtain a potentially faster convergence for the SPDG algorithm and a more accurate upper bound on the number of iterations needed to achieve prescribed tolerances, specially on ill-conditioned problems.},

This method only needs inexact computation of the projections onto the convex set for each iteration, consequently reducing the computational cost for projections per iteration. This feature is attractive especially for solving problems where the projections are computationally not easy to calculate. Global convergence guarantee and O ( 1 / k ) O ( 1 / k ) O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate of the optimality residual are provided under loose assumptions. We apply our proposed strategy to ℓ 1 -ball constrained problems.

For example, the well-known problem in finance of determining the global minimum variance portfolio with no short sales constraint can be transformed to a problem of this type. Although the projection problem does not admit a solution in closed form, various numerical techniques have been proposed for its solution. This paper introduces a simple and efficient new algorithm for the solution to this problem and compares its performance to other algorithms proposed in the literature. It is shown that the algorithm is very efficient and orders of magnitude faster than methods introduced, for example, in Barrios et al. [Projection onto simplicial cones by Picard&#39;s method.

We establish the convergence of the algorithm for a class of non-monotone and Lipschitz continuous operators, provided by the sequentially weak-to-weak continuity of cost operators. The rate of convergence of the algorithm is also proved under some standard hypotheses. Moreover, the new algorithm uses variable step-sizes which are updated at each iteration by a cheap computation without linesearch. This step-size rule allows the resulting algorithm to work more easily without the prior knowledge of Lipschitz constant of operator. Also, it is particularly interesting in the case where the Lipschitz constant is unknown or difficult to approximate. Several numerical experiments are implemented to illustrate the theoretical results and also to compare with existing algorithms.},

In this paper, smoothing approximations are employed to solve the constrained nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. After properties of the smoothing functions are analysed, a smoothing quadratic regularization algorithm is presented and studied. The proposed algorithm can be implemented efficiently since the closed form solution is available at each iteration. Convergence of the algorithm is shown, and the worst-case complexity is investigated for reaching an ε -Clarke stationary point.

Based on a new concept of non-trivial local solution, we get necessary conditions for a system of centroids to be such a local solution.

Route choices between an origin and a destination might involve direct main roads, shorter routes through narrow side streets, or longer but (potentially) faster journeys using motorways or ring-roads. In the absence of effective traffic control measures, an approximate equilibrium travel time may result between the routes available, which is generally expected to be far from optimal. In this paper, we investigate discrete and continuous optimization and equilibrium-type problems, for a simplified traffic assignment problem on a simple network with parallel links and fixed demand. We explore the interplay between solutions of certain optimization and equilibrium problems which can be solved by dynamic programming. The results are supported by numerical simulations, in which the price of anarchy is calculated to highlight the demand levels where there is a change in road choice and usage.},

Scalarization results for efficient and weakly efficient elements of these problems are proved, where especially Gerstewitz functionals and order unit norms are used. A surrogate for the weakly efficient point set is investigated, which is of special interest for domination sets with an empty algebraic interior. The study includes the consideration of perturbed problems. In general, we admit any linear space as image space of the vector optimization problem and do not assume convexity of the feasible point set or of the domination set. Nevertheless, several statements refer to the case that the domination set is an ordering cone. The results can be applied to determine optimal elements which are defined by relations, especially in decision making. Furthermore, they constitute a base for the systematic investigation of many scalarizing problems in multiobjective optimization. This is illustrated for the Hurwicz Rule in decision making under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {We use the theory of stochastic variational inequalities to develop a network equilibrium model of the whole supply chain of electricity markets: power generation, supply, transmission, and consumption. In particular, we take into account the case where the market demand functions are not exactly known but are affected by some kind of uncertainty. A discretization and truncation procedure is used to numerically solve the stochastic variational inequality model. Monotonicity properties of the operator are investigated and the affine case is analysed in detail. Finally, numerical experiments show the impact of different probability densities of the random variables on the approximated solutions and the scalability of the proposed numerical method for real-world sized problems.},

In these systems, the constraints depend both on the parameter as well as on the decision variable itself and they include, e.g. parameter-dependent quasi-variational inequalities and implicit complementarity problems. The result is based on a general condition ensuring the Aubin property of implicitly defined multifunctions which employs the recently introduced notion of the directional limiting coderivative. Our final condition can be verified, however, without an explicit computation of these coderivatives. The procedure is illustrated by an example.},

  abstract     = {Geoffrion proper optimality is a widely used optimality notion in multicriteria optimization that prevents exact solutions having unbounded trade-offs. As algorithms for multicriteria optimization usually give only approximate solutions, we analyze the notion of approximate Geoffrion proper optimality. We show that in the limit, approximate Geoffrion proper optimality may converge to solutions having unbounded trade-offs. Therefore, we introduce a restricted notion of approximate Geoffrion proper optimality and prove that this restricted notion alleviates the problem of solutions having unbounded trade-offs. Furthermore, using a characterization based on the infeasibility of a system of inequalities, we investigate the convergence properties of different approximate optimality notions in multicriteria optimization. These convergence properties are important for algorithmic reasons. The restricted notion of approximate Geoffrion proper optimality seems to be the only approximate optimality notion that shows favourable convergence properties. This notion bounds the trade-offs globally and can be used in multicriteria decision-making algorithms as well. Due to these, it seems to be a practical optimality notion.},

In each iteration of the algorithm, the objective function is approximated by a quadratic model constructed from interpolation points. The choice of the points leaves some degree of freedom in the model taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the Hessian matrix of the model. The new iterate is generally generated by minimizing the model in a trust-region using a null space truncated conjugate gradient method. Numerical results are presented which show that the proposed algorithm competes against some algorithms in the literature. Experiments show that starting with the point that minimizes the infinity norm subject to the linear equality constraints gives excellent results. A limit-type global convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved under some reasonable assumptions.},

In this paper, we specialize this study in the case of non-smooth convex minimization problems. We obtain convergence rates for values which have similarities with the results based on the Nesterov accelerated gradient method. The joint adjustment of inertia, relaxation and proximal terms plays a central role. In doing so, we highlight inertial proximal algorithms that converge for general monotone inclusions, and which, in the case of convex minimization, give fast convergence rates of values in the worst case.},

However, the convergence of the TSEGM was posted as an open question. In this paper, we answer this open question affirmatively for the case where the closed convex set can be represented as the lower level set of a continuously differentiable convex function. Censor&#39;s open question is thus partially answered.

In this paper, a novel method proposed here deviates from the other approaches listed is the splitting of the constraint D = A + E D = A + E D=A+E into two constraints, A = A 0 A = A 0 A=A0 and E = E 0 E = E 0 E=E0 , where A 0 A 0 A0 and E 0 E 0 E0 are the real low-rank and sparse part of data matrix D . This separation strategy is referred to as the separable surrogate function (SSF). In such case, two iterative methods are designed to solve this problem. Correspondingly, the convergence analysis of these two iterative methods is given respectively. Simulations about real-data examples and applications on images decomposition show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Recently, latent low-rank representation (LatLRR) graph has gained great success in subspace clustering. However, LatLRR only considers the global structure, while the local geometric information, which is often important to many real applications, is ignored. In this paper, we propose a locality regularized LatLRR model (LR-LatLRR) for semi-supervised subspace clustering problems. This model incorporates two regularization terms into LatLRR by taking the local structure of data into account. Then, we develop an efficient splitting algorithm for solving LR-LatLRR. In addition, we also prove the global convergence of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the LR-LatLRR model to a case of including the non-negative constraint. Finally, we conduct experiments on a synthetic data and several real data sets for the semi-supervised clustering problems. Experimental results show that our method can obtain high classification accuracy and outperforms several state-of-the-art G-SSL methods.},

Here, the assumption on lower semi-continuity of the objective function is replaced by a weaker one: sequentially lower monotony. And the assumption on lower boundedness of the objective function is taken to be the weakest of several different kinds. From the general set-valued EVP, we deduce a number of particular versions of set-valued EVP, which extend and improve the related results in the literature. In particular, we give several EVPs for approximately efficient solutions in set-valued optimization, which not only extend the related results from vector-valued objective functions into set-valued objective functions, but also improve the related results by removing a usual assumption for K -boundedness (by scalarization) of the objective function&#39;s range.},

In this paper, we apply this method for solving nonlinear semidefinite programming problems, in which subproblems have better properties than those from the augmented Lagrange method. We prove that, under the linear independence constraint qualification and the strong second-order sufficiency optimality condition, the rate of convergence of the proximal method of multipliers, for a nonlinear semidefinite programming problem, is linear and the ratio constant is proportional to 1/ c , where c is the penalty parameter that exceeds a threshold c ∗ &gt; 0 . Moreover, the rate of convergence of the proximal method of multipliers is superlinear when the parameter c increases to + ∞ .},

Consequently, it is possible to replace the overall semivectorial bilevel programming problem by means of a standard bilevel programming problem whose upper level variables comprise the set of suitable scalarization parameters for the lower level problem. In this note, we consider the relationship between this surrogate bilevel programming problem and the original semivectorial bilevel programming problem. As it will be shown, this is a delicate issue as long as locally optimal solutions are investigated. The obtained theory is applied in order to derive existence results for semivectorial bilevel programming problems with not necessarily finite-dimensional lower level decision variables.

In that context, we present a novel mathematical approach in order to assist gas network operators in managing increasing uncertainty with respect to customers gas nominations and in exposing free network capacities while reliability of transmission and supply is taken into account. The approach is based on the rigorous examination of optimization problems with nonlinear probabilistic constraints. As consequence we deal with solving a problem belonging to the class of probabilistic/robust optimization problems, which can be formulated with some joint probabilistic constraint over an infinite system of random inequalities. We will show that the inequality system can be reduced to a finite one in the situation of considering a tree network topology. A detailed study of the problem of maximizing bookable capacities in a stationary gas network is presented. The focus will be on both the theoretical and numerical side. The analytical part consists in introducing and validating a generalized version of the known rank two constraint qualification.

This choice, however, makes it impossible to postulate additional conditions on the control function&#39;s slope which is practically relevant in some situations. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a natural assumption would be to demand at least first-order Sobolev regularity for control functions. The present paper is devoted to the study of an elliptic optimal control problem whose control function is chosen from a Sobolev space and has to satisfy additional equality constraints on its weak gradient. Noting that the associated Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions do not provide a necessary optimality condition for the underlying optimal control problem in general, one cannot simply solve the problem of interest by considering the system of first-order optimality conditions. Instead a penalization procedure with strong convergence properties for the computational solution is suggested and its computational implementation is studied in detail. Particularly, some essential difficulties arising from the gradient constraints which do not appear in standard optimal control are discussed.},

Moreover, by means of linear (vector/scalar) separation functions, some Lagrangian-type sufficient robust optimality conditions are presented. Especially, under suitable restriction assumptions, we derive Lagrangian-type necessary robust optimality conditions in terms of nonlinear separation functions. These results obtained in this paper extend and improve some existing ones recently. Finally, several examples are given to show the effectiveness of the conclusions.},

Type-1 customers need service at station 1. After service at this station, a type-1 customer spends a random amount of time in the so-called pre-service area and then moves for service at station 2. Type-2 customers need service only at station 2 and have lower priority. A strategy of their admission depending on the current number of customers in the pre-service area and station 2 is offered. This strategy is defined by three integers (thresholds). Cost criterion, which defines the quality of the system operation, is the weighted sum of the mean numbers of lost customers from the pre-service area and type-2 customers per unit of time. The most difficult part of solving the problem of minimizing the cost criterion consists of computation of the stationary distribution of the system states under the fixed set of the thresholds. Numerical results are presented. Results can be used for optimization of various real-world systems such as manufacturing, transportation and health-care systems as well as for optimization of booking systems in HORECA (hotel/restaurant/cafe), museums, etc.},

This assumption is weaker than the Slater condition; therefore, the optimality conditions obtained in the paper are more general when compared with those usually used in LCP. We present an example of a problem in which the new optimality conditions allow one to test the optimality of a given feasible solution while the known optimality conditions fail to do this. Further, we use the immobile indices to construct a pair of regularized dual copositive problems and show that regardless of whether the Slater condition is satisfied or not, the duality gap between the optimal values of these problems is zero. An example of a problem is presented for which the standard strict duality fails, but the duality gap obtained by using the regularized dual problem vanishes.},

  abstract     = {A graph G with convex- QP stability number (or simply a convex- QP graph) is a graph for which the stability number is equal to the optimal value of a convex quadratic programme, say P ( G ) P ( G ) P(G) . The problem of recognizing in polynomial time whether or not a given graph is a convex- QP graph has resisted to be completely solved. In this paper, some progress recently made for trying to settle this open question is reported. Namely, if G is a graph such that the optimal solutions of P ( G ) P ( G ) P(G) are critical points of the objective function, some new necessary and sufficient conditions for G to be a convex- QP graph are proved. The practical value of two of these results is also exemplified.},

  abstract     = {We have Derringer and Suich&#39;s desirability functions in mind, especially, the two-sided ones in our analysis throughout this study. We propose and develop a finite partitioning procedure of the individual desirability functions over their compact and connected interval which leads to the definition of generalized desirability functions. We call the negative logarithm of an individual desirability function having a max-type structure and including a finite number of nondifferentiable points as a generalized individual desirability function. By introducing continuous selection functions into desirability functions and, especially, employing piecewise max-type functions, it is possible to describe some structural and topological properties of these generalized functions. Our aim with this generalization is to show the mechanism that gives rise to a variation and extension in the structure of functions used in classical desirability approaches.},

The main attention is paid to situations when there are intervals where optimal trajectory lies on a switching surface. It is shown that for such a situation the known optimality conditions degenerate: they are satisfied for any feasible control. Hence such conditions are not informative. New non-degenerate necessary optimality conditions in a form of Maximum principle are formulated and proved. Comparison of the obtained optimality conditions with ones known from the literature is presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to develop a robust multi-item EPQ formulation considering rework process and imperfect items. The mathematical model consists of two objective functions targeting minimization of total inventory costs and the total required warehouse space, respectively. Since, in real-world applications, parameters of the mathematical formulation are due to uncertainty, in this paper, Basic Chance Constraint Programming and Robust Fuzzy Chance Constraint Programming models are developed to handle uncertainties in both objective function and constraints. By solving examples, the superiority of the RFCCP over the BCCP model is showed and its ability to provide risk-averse solutions is ensured. Due to the nonlinearity of the RFCCP model and to provide the decision maker with the Pareto front, two algorithms, namely, Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimizer and Multi-Objective Water Cycle Algorithm, are used to optimize the decision variables. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated within different large-size test problems, using diversity, Spacing, number of non-dominated solutions and CPU-time. In the end, to investigate significant differences and to determine the best algorithm ANOVA test is implemented. In the end, we also offer new research directions, e.g. in terms of further ways of uncertainty modelling and risk management.},

  abstract     = {Systems of linear equations are studied with uncertainties in the coefficients, often representing imprecise data. Such imprecisions are seen as orders of magnitude. The orders of magnitude are not functionally modelled in terms of O ( . ) O ( . ) O(.) or o ( . ) o ( . ) o(.) , but within nonstandard analysis as neutrices and external numbers, convex external sets of nonstandard real numbers. In this setting, linear systems with external coefficients are solved by a parameter method. This method assigns a parameter to each imprecision and specifies its range. Then we obtain an ordinary linear system and solve by common methods. At the end we substitute each parameter by its range. We present general solution formulas, for an arbitrary number of equations and variables. We illustrate with a concrete system that the parameter method gives more precise results, under more general conditions, than dealing with propagation of errors in direct Gauss–Jordan elimination or the Cramer rule. We apply the results to linear optimization with uncertainties. In a general setting, nearly optimal solutions are obtained and the shape of the domains of validity of the nearly optimal solutions.},

Since the very beginning, where a convex quadratic programming upper bound on the stability number was introduced, a necessary and sufficient condition for this upper bound be attained was deduced. The recognition of graphs with convex quadratic stability number has been deeply studied with several consequences from continuous and combinatorial point of view. This survey starts with an exposition of some extensions of the classical Motzkin–Straus approach to the determination of the stability number of a graph and its relations with the convex quadratic programming upper bound. The main advances, including several properties and alternative characterizations of graphs with convex quadratic stability number are described as well as the algorithmic strategies developed for their recognition. Open problems and a conjecture for a particular class of graphs, herein called adverse graphs, are presented, pointing out a research line which is a challenge between continuous and discrete problems.},
