  abstract     = {A varying-parameter ZNN (VPZNN) neural design is defined for approximating various generalized inverses and expressions involving generalized inverses of complex matrices. The proposed model is termed as C V P Z N N ( A , F , G ) C V P Z N N ( A , F , G ) CVPZNN(A,F,G) and defined on the basis of the error function which includes three appropriate matrices A , F , G . The C V P Z N N ( A , F , G ) C V P Z N N ( A , F , G ) CVPZNN(A,F,G) evolution design includes so far defined VPZNN models for computing generalized inverses and also generates a number of matrix expressions involving these generalized inverses. Global and super-exponential convergence properties of the proposed model as well as behaviour of its equilibrium state are investigated. Main contribution of the defined model is its generality. Most important particular cases of the defined model are presented in order to show this fact explicitly. Presented simulation results illustrate generality and effectiveness of the discovered ZNN evolution design.},

In its ‘pure’ form it has fast convergence near the solution, but small convergence domain. On the other hand damped Newton method has slower convergence rate, but weaker conditions on the initial point. We provide new versions of Newton-like algorithms, resulting in combinations of Newton and damped Newton method with special step-size choice, and estimate its convergence domain. Under some assumptions the convergence is global. Explicit complexity results are also addressed. The adaptive version of the algorithm (with no a priori constants knowledge) is presented. The method is applicable for under-determined equations (with m &lt; n , m being the number of equations and n being the number of variables). The results are specified for systems of quadratic equations, for composite mappings and for one-dimensional equations and inequalities.},

In this paper we study an algorithm for computing distinct solutions of a variational inequality, without varying the initial guess supplied to the solver. The central idea is the combination of a semismooth Newton method with a deflation operator that eliminates known solutions from consideration. Given one root of a semismooth residual, deflation constructs a new problem for which a semismooth Newton method will not converge to the known root, even from the same initial guess. This enables the discovery of other roots. We prove the effectiveness of the deflation technique under the same assumptions that guarantee locally superlinear convergence of a semismooth Newton method. We demonstrate its utility on various finite- and infinite-dimensional examples drawn from constrained optimization, game theory, economics and solid mechanics.},

  abstract     = {The class of nonsmooth codifferentiable functions was introduced by professor V.F. Demyanov in the late 1980s. He also proposed a method for minimizing these functions called the method of codifferential descent (MCD). However, until now almost no theoretical results on the performance of this method on particular classes of nonsmooth optimization problems were known. In the first part of the paper, we study the performance of the method of codifferential descent on a class of nonsmooth convex functions satisfying some regularity assumptions, which in the smooth case are reduced to the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient. We prove that in this case the MCD has the iteration complexity bound O ( 1 / ε ) . In the second part of the paper we obtain new global optimality conditions for piecewise affine functions in terms of codifferentials. With the use of these conditions we propose a modification of the MCD for minimizing piecewise affine functions (called the method of global codifferential descent) that does not use line search, and discards those ‘pieces’ of the objective functions that are no longer useful for the optimization process. Then we prove that the MCD as well as its modification proposed in the article find a point of global minimum of a nonconvex piecewise affine function in a finite number of steps.},

  abstract     = {Graph partitioning is an important method for accelerating large distributed graph computation. Streaming graph partitioning is more efficient than offline partitioning, and it has been developed continuously in the application of graph partitioning in recent years. In this work, we first introduce a heuristic greedy streaming partitioning method and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art streaming partitioning methods, leading to exact balance and fewer cut edges. Second, we propose a cache structure for streaming partitioning, called an adjacent edge structure, which can improve the partition efficiency several times on a single commodity type computer without affecting the partition quality. Regardless as to whether the memory capacity is limited (local cache) or not (global cache), our strategy can also improve the partition quality by restreaming partitioning. Taking linear weight greedy streaming algorithm as an example, the experimental results on 19 real-world graphs show that the average partitioning time of the new method is 4.9 times faster than that of the original method, which proves the effectiveness and superiority of the cache structure mentioned in this paper.},

This problem has been widely studied in the case for which comparisons are performed independently. However, identifying the top- K rankings becomes a more intricate task when comparisons per se are performed along some temporal dimension. In this paper, we investigate potential impacts of temporality on sequences of top- K items and propose a time-homogeneous ranking scheme. Our framework relies mainly on tensor decompositions, rank centrality, and an innovative continuous extension of the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) model. The proposed continuous BTL model extends the win/loss nature of the logistic model to a continuous setting, further reflecting preference degrees that may exist among the compared items. Our computations, which pertain to the analysis of S&amp;P500 data from January 2008 to December 2017, confirm that the proposed top- K ranking scheme is an effective approach to optimize cardinality-constrained portfolios which involve large volumes of noisy and incomplete data.},

The problem has many applications in various areas when the outlier class, defined as the complementary set to the target class, is absent. In this paper, we develop a novel one-class classification algorithm called the one-class polyhedral conic functions (O-PCF) algorithm. In this algorithm, the decision boundary for the target class is defined by PCFs&#39; level sets. The level set of a PCF is a convex polyhedron; thus, only convex decision boundaries can be obtained with one PCF. However, the target class may have a non-convex structure. Thus, the O-PCF algorithm divides the target class into k clusters and obtains a PCF for each cluster. O-PCF constructs the final classifier as the minimum of k PCFs to generate non-convex separating surfaces. The performance of the O-PCF algorithm is presented in comparison with other methods in the literature. The test results lead us to conclude that the O-PCF algorithm outperforms the other methods in many cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies a class of two-stage distributionally robust optimization (TDRO) problems which comes from many practical application fields. In order to set up some implementable solution method, we first transfer the TDRO problem to its equivalent robust counterpart (RC) by the duality theorem of optimization. The RC reformulation of TDRO is a semi-infinite stochastic programming. Then we construct a conditional value-at-risk-based sample average approximation model for the RC problem. Furthermore, we analyse the error bound of the approximation model and obtain the convergent results with respect to optimal value and optimal solution set. Finally, a so-called stochastic dual dynamic programming approach is proposed to solve the approximate model. Numerical results validate the solution approach of this paper.},

We first formulate two kinds of inverse problems in the famework of the first kind Fredholm integral equations, and then build up a sparse inversion model combining the two inverse problems as well as the cross-gradient term. The cyclic gradient method for quadratic function minimization is extended for solving the corresponding optimization problem. We update the stepsizes in a cyclic way, by combining the approximated Cauchy steps and the fixed steplengths. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm converges R-linearly. Experimental tests show that the proposed joint inversion sparse model as well as the proposed cyclic gradient method improve the numerical performances effectively, compared to the state of the art.},

It then explores the existence of affine invariant descent directions for unconstrained minimization. While there may exist several affine invariant descent directions for smooth functions at a given point, it is shown that for quadratic functions, there exists exactly one invariant descent direction in the strictly convex case and generally none in the case where the Hessian is singular or indefinite. These results can be generalized to smooth nonlinear functions and have implications regarding the initialization of minimization algorithms. They stand in contrast to recent works on constrained convex and nonconvex optimization for which there may exist an affine invariant ‘frame’ that depends on the feasible set and that can be used to define an affine invariant descent direction.},

Two typical SVM models are the L1-loss model for support vector classification (SVC) and ε -L1-loss model for support vector regression (SVR). Due to the non-smoothness of the L1-loss function in the two models, most of the traditional approaches focus on solving the dual problem. In this paper, we propose an augmented Lagrangian method for the L1-loss model, which is designed to solve the primal problem. By tackling the non-smooth term in the model with Moreau–Yosida regularization and the proximal operator, the subproblem in augmented Lagrangian method reduces to a non-smooth linear system, which can be solved via the quadratically convergent semismooth Newton&#39;s method. Moreover, the high computational cost in semismooth Newton&#39;s method can be significantly reduced by exploring the sparse structure in the generalized Jacobian. Numerical results on various datasets in LIBLINEAR show that the proposed method is competitive with the most popular solvers in both speed and accuracy.},

At each iteration, IPSS inexactly solves a proximal subproblem constructed by using some positive definite matrix which could capture the second-order information of original problem. Proper tolerances are given for the subproblem solution in order to maintain global convergence and the desired overall complexity of the algorithm. Under mild conditions, we analyse the computational complexity related to the evaluations on the component gradient of the smooth function. We also investigate the number of evaluations of subgradient when using an iterative subgradient method to solve the subproblem. In addition, based on IPSS, we propose a linearly convergent algorithm under the proximal Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition. Finally, we extend the analysis to problems with weakly smooth function and obtain the computational complexity accordingly.},

We show that our mechanism can induce jobs to report truthfully their private information referred to myopic Bayes–Nash implementability by using a graph theoretic interpretation of the incentive compatibility constraints.

We develop a simplex strategy iteration where one player updates its strategy with a simplex step while the other player finds an optimal counterstrategy in turn, and a modified simplex strategy iteration. Both of them belong to a class of geometrically converging algorithms. We establish the strongly polynomial property of these algorithms by considering a strategy combined from the current strategy and the equilibrium strategy.

  abstract     = {We propose a new stepsize for the gradient method. It is shown that this new stepsize will converge to the reciprocal of the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, when Dai-Yang&#39;s asymptotic optimal gradient method (Computational Optimization and Applications, 2006, 33(1): 73–88) is applied for minimizing quadratic objective functions. Based on this spectral property, we develop a monotone gradient method that takes a certain number of steps using the asymptotically optimal stepsize by Dai and Yang, and then follows by some short steps associated with this new stepsize. By employing one step retard of the asymptotic optimal stepsize, a nonmonotone variant of this method is also proposed. Under mild conditions, R -linear convergence of the proposed methods is established for minimizing quadratic functions. In addition, by combining gradient projection techniques and adaptive nonmonotone line search, we further extend those methods for general bound constrained optimization. Two variants of gradient projection methods combining with the Barzilai-Borwein stepsizes are also proposed. Our numerical experiments on both quadratic and bound constrained optimization indicate that the new proposed strategies and methods are very effective.},

In this paper, we study sketching in the context of Newton&#39;s method for solving finite-sum optimization problems in which the number of variables and data points are both large. We study two forms of sketching that perform dimensionality reduction in data space: Hessian subsampling and randomized Hadamard transformations. Each has its own advantages, and their relative tradeoffs have not been investigated in the optimization literature. Our study focuses on practical versions of the two methods in which the resulting linear systems of equations are solved approximately, at every iteration, using an iterative solver. The advantages of using the conjugate gradient method vs. a stochastic gradient iteration are revealed through a set of numerical experiments, and a complexity analysis of the Hessian subsampling method is presented.},

  abstract     = {Linear least squares problems (LLSPs) routinely arise in many scientific and engineering problems. One of the fastest ways to solve LLSPs involves performing calculations in parallel on graphics processing units (GPUs). However, GPU algorithms are typically designed for one GPU architecture and may be suboptimal or unusable on another GPU. To design optimal algorithms for any GPU with little need for modifying code, tuneable parameters can simplify the transition of GPU algorithms to different GPU architectures. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of using derivative-free optimization (DFO) and simulation optimization (SO) to systematically optimize tuneable parameters for a GPU or hybrid CPU/GPU LLSP solvers. Computational experiments show that both DFO and SO can be effective tools for determining optimal tuning parameters that can speed up the performance of the popular LLSP solver MAGMA by about 1.8x, compared to MAGMA&#39;s default parameters for large tall and skinny matrices. Using DFO solvers, we were able to identify optimal parameters after enumerating an order of magnitude fewer parameter combinations than with direct enumeration. Additionally, the proposed approach is faster than a state-of-the-art autotuner and provides better tuning parameters.},

Nevertheless, a non-trivial and manual step after the differentiation is the initialization of the seed and retrieval of the output values from the differentiated code. Ambiguities in seeding occur in programs where the user is unable to expose the complete program flow with a single entry and single exit point to the AD tool. We present the ambiguities associated with seed initialization and output retrieval for adjoint transformation of halo and zero-halo partitioned MPI programs. We introduce a general framework to eliminate ambiguities in seeding and retrieval for shared-node reduction over +, and * operators using a conceptual master-worker model. The model shows the need for new MPI calls for retrieval and eliminate MPI calls for seed initialization. Different implementations for seeding manually assembled adjoints were inferred from the model, namely, partial and unique seeding. We successfully applied the seeding techniques to a 3D zero-halo partitioned unstructured compressible discrete adjoint solver and highlight the merits and demerits of each strategy.},

In order to exploit the structure of the problem, we define an equivalent formulation by duplicating the variables and we consider the augmented Lagrangian of this latter formulation. Following the idea of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we propose an algorithm where a two-blocks decomposition method is embedded within an augmented Lagrangian framework. The peculiarities of the proposed algorithm are the following: (1) the computation of the exact solution of a possibly nonconvex subproblem is not required; (2) the penalty parameter is iteratively updated once an approximated stationary point of the augmented Lagrangian is determined. Global convergence results are stated under mild assumptions and without requiring convexity of the objective function. Although the primary aim of the paper is theoretical, we perform numerical experiments on a nonconvex problem arising in machine learning, and the obtained results show the practical advantages of the proposed approach with respect to classical ADMM.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) problems are often posed as highly nonlinear and nonconvex unconstrained optimization problems. Methods for solving ML problems based on stochastic gradient descent are easily scaled for very large problems but may involve fine-tuning many hyper-parameters. Quasi-Newton approaches based on the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) update typically do not require manually tuning hyper-parameters but suffer from approximating a potentially indefinite Hessian with a positive-definite matrix. Hessian-free methods leverage the ability to perform Hessian-vector multiplication without needing the entire Hessian matrix, but each iteration&#39;s complexity is significantly greater than quasi-Newton methods. In this paper we propose an alternative approach for solving ML problems based on a quasi-Newton trust-region framework for solving large-scale optimization problems that allow for indefinite Hessian approximations. Numerical experiments on a standard testing data set show that with a fixed computational time budget, the proposed methods achieve better results than the traditional limited-memory BFGS and the Hessian-free methods.},

Piecewise monotonic approximation to n data is expressed as the minimization of some strictly convex function of the data errors subject to the restriction that the piecewise linear interpolant to the approximated values consists of at most k monotonic sections, where k is a prescribed positive integer. The major task is to determine automatically the positions of the joins of these sections, which is a combinatorial problem that can require about O ( n k − 1 ) combinations in order to find an optimal one. We state theorems which prove the remarkable property that the local maxima of optimal approximations with k −1 monotonic sections are separated by the local maxima of optimal approximations with k monotonic sections, and local minima are separated similarly. We describe briefly a suitable technique that makes use of this property and gives the global solution in O ( n 2 + k n log 2 ⁡ n ) computer operations. Some numerical results show large gains in efficiency over existing methods. Further, as an illustration, we apply the technique to 39,082 observations of daily sunspots.},

We give numerical examples to illustrate how to compute a second-order directional stationary point by the smoothing method.},

Specifically, we show that ADMM, when employed to solve problems with multiaffine constraints that satisfy certain verifiable assumptions, converges to the set of constrained stationary points if the penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian is sufficiently large. When the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (K–Ł) property holds, this is strengthened to convergence to a single constrained stationary point. Our analysis applies under assumptions that we have endeavoured to make as weak as possible. It applies to problems that involve nonconvex and/or nonsmooth objective terms, in addition to the multiaffine constraints that can involve multiple (three or more) blocks of variables. To illustrate the applicability of our results, we describe examples including nonnegative matrix factorization, sparse learning, risk parity portfolio selection, nonconvex formulations of convex problems and neural network training. In each case, our ADMM approach encounters only subproblems that have closed-form solutions.},

We also give conditions under which the iterates f ( x k ) → − ∞ , using a specific Armijo–Wolfe bracketing line search. Our experimental results demonstrate that our analysis is reasonably tight.},

The first occurs in distributed computing environments where some of the computational nodes devoted to the evaluation of the function and gradient are unable to return results on time. A similar challenge occurs in a multi-batch approach in which the data points used to compute function and gradients are purposely changed at each iteration to accelerate the learning process. Difficulties arise because L-BFGS employs gradient differences to update the Hessian approximations, and when these gradients are computed using different data points the updating process can be unstable. This paper shows how to perform stable quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting, studies the convergence properties for both convex and non-convex functions, and illustrates the behaviour of the algorithm in a distributed computing platform on binary classification logistic regression and neural network training problems that arise in machine learning.},

However, it has been observed that DICOPT has difficulties solving instances in which some of the nonlinear constraints are so restrictive that nonlinear subproblems generated by the algorithm are infeasible. This problem is addressed in this paper with a feasibility pump algorithm, which modifies the objective function in order to efficiently find feasible solutions. It has been implemented as a preprocessing algorithm, which is used to initialize both the incumbent and the mixed-integer linear relaxation of the outer-approximation algorithm. Computational comparisons with previous versions of DICOPT on a set of convex MINLPs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of solution quality and solution time.},
