The proposed method guarantees the global asymptotic stability of the zero equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Different from the existing ODHR-based control-switching strategy, the control law designed in this paper allows multiple control inputs to work simultaneously. Moreover, it is verified that the peak values of the control inputs and the energy consumed by the control inputs are both much smaller compared to the conventional method. A numerical example is considered and comparative simulations are carried out to verify the effect and superiority of the proposed method.},

For the full state constraints problem, the nonlinear transformation function is used to transform the constraint problem into a non-constraint problem. A new adaptive control framework is proposed for asymptotic tracking of nonlinear systems with unknown virtual control coefficients (UVCC). Under the proposed control scheme, the effects of UVCC and unknown nonlinear functions are compensated by the introduction of some well-defined smoothing functions and boundary estimation methods. In addition, a new Lyapunov function is constructed, which successfully achieves the tracking error of the closed-loop system converge to zero and all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. In the meanwhile, all states are always keep in their asymmetric time-varying constraints. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Non-Gaussian noise processing is a difficult and hot spot in the study of filters. A currently effective method to deal with non-Gaussian noise is replacing the minimum mean square error criterion with the maximum correntropy criterion. Based on the maximum correntropy criterion, maximum correntropy Kalman filter, which usually uses the Gaussian kernel function to define the distance between vectors, is developed. However, when the non-Gaussian noise is multi-dimensional, maximum correntropy Kalman filter tends to break down due to the appearance of singular matrices. To overcome the drawback, a novel filter named Cauchy kernel-based maximum correntropy Kalman filter is proposed, which utilises the Cauchy kernel function to define the distance between vectors. Due to the insensitive feature to the kernel bandwidth and thick-tailed characteristic of the Cauchy kernel function, Cauchy kernel-based maximum correntropy Kalman filter can effectively avoid filter faults and has a better stability. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods, such as Kalman filter, ideal Kalman filter, Huber-based filter, Gaussian sum filter and maximum correntropy Kalman filter.},

The bounds are known in advance, and they can be ascertained using the feedback control gains. The first step is to construct a state observer that can estimate the unmeasurable states. The second step is to design an adaptive fuzzy PI output feedback bounded controller by using backstepping method and fuzzy logic systems technique. To guarantee the virtual control laws and a final controller with a specific range, hyperbolic tangent functions and projection operator are introduced.

The method proposed in this paper emulates the genericity of the Linear Matrix Inequalities framework while keeping the feedback gain separated from any matrix with direct or indirect connection to the Lyapunov function.

Then, a dynamical observer is designed to estimate both the system state and the unknown fault signal simultaneously. A fault estimation-based FTC approach is then given to remove the effects generated by unknown actuator faults, which guarantees that the faulty closed-loop systems are asymptotical stable with a disturbance attenuation level γ . By theory analysis, the Zeno phenomenon is excluded in this study. Finally, a real aircraft engine example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed integrated FE and FTC method.},

First, multiple multiplicative actuator faults are equivalently transformed into the form of multiple additive actuator faults for the sake of obtaining the simplified faulty residual set explicitly. Then, two different generalised MDF for different multiple actuator faults are, respectively, defined, which can be computed via solving simple linear programming (LP) problems. Moreover, we propose three detectability conditions to guarantee the detection of multiple multiplicative actuator faults by using the invariant set-based method. Finally, we provide effective selection guidance for the detection of different multiple multiplicative actuator faults by systematically analysing the conservatism and characteristics of these three guaranteed detectability conditions.

The optimisation problem is to minimise a global objective function, which is composed of the sum of a set of local objective functions. Recent researches on this problem have made significant progress by using primal-dual methods. However, the inner link among different algorithms is unclear. This paper shows that some state-of-the-art algorithms differ in that they incorporate the slightly different last dual gradient terms based on the augmented Lagrangian analysis. Then, we propose a distributed Nesterov accelerated optimisation algorithm, where a doubly stochastic matrix is allowed to use, and nonidentical local step-sizes are employed. We analyse the convergence of the proposed algorithm by using the generalised small gain theorem under the assumption that each local objective function is strongly convex and has Lipschitz continuous gradient. We prove that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm linearly converge to an optimal solution if the largest step-size is positive and less than an explicitly estimated upper bound, and the largest momentum parameter is nonnegative and less than an upper bound determined by the largest step-size. Simulation results further illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

Then, based on the AFD model, a P-type ILC law and an extended D-type ILC law with data-driven determining techniques for learning gains are presented. It is noted that comparing with the conventional D-type ILC law, the newly proposed extended D-type ILC law exhibits superior tracking characteristic due to involving the frequency information during the ILC process.

The network output is subject to uniform quantisation and then the quantised signal is sent to the filter through redundant channels with random delays. The aim of the proposed problem is to design a set-membership filter such that, at each time instant, the filtering error dynamics is confined within a closed domain whose boundary is a hyper-ellipsoid. Sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the existence of addressed set-membership filter in terms of certain recursive matrix inequality. Subsequently, an optimisation problem is proposed to minimise the hyper-ellipsoid (containing the true network state) in the sense of trace and a computational algorithm is then provided. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

The nonlinear feedback controller can not only deal with the discontinuous activations but also the mixed time-varying delays.

In technique, different from pole-zero cancellation (i.e. in force of multiplication/division), this study proposes a pulling principle (i.e. in force of summation/subtraction) to relocate zeros and poles through Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, then introduces a U-model based universal control framework with invariant controller plus U-model inverter so that it separates the treatment of NMP issue from stable control system design. By integration of the above techniques, this study presents a systematic procedure to complement those classical approaches in designing NMP control systems. The associated properties and performance are proved analytically and demonstrated numerically (with Matlab simulation of bench test examples). To follow the study, the computational experiment results provide a user-friendly step by step procedure for the readers/users with interest in their ad hoc applications.},

In this regard, the set stabilisation-based approach is utilised and the proper Lyapunov function is taken concerning the geometric shape of the desired limit cycle. Firstly, the state feedback control is designed to create the desired limit cycle in the second-order subsystem and then, extended to the arbitrary n order system through the adaptive backstepping technique. Besides, the explosion of a complex problem, which happens during the backstepping implementation in high-order systems, is handled. In the final stage, the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals is guaranteed via Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is demonstrated by a simulation example.},

Then, a PID-FONTSM surface is designed to further enhance the control performance. The proposed PID-FONTSM surface uses the FONTSM error dynamic as its inner loop and utilises a PID-type surface with FONTSM variable as its outer loop. Benefitting from this structure, the proposed PID-FONTSM surface enjoys the advantages from both PID and FONTSM simultaneously. Afterwards, an adaptive algorithm is developed, to timely and precisely regulate the control gain for the robust term. The proposed control method is model-free , highly accurate and essentially continuous thanks to the TDE technique and developed PID-FONTSM surface and adaptive algorithm. The stability of the closed-loop control system under TDE and PID-FONTSM dynamics is proved using Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, comparative simulations were conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiorities of our proposed control method over the existing methods.},

Further, we develop an approach to design the event-triggering mechanism and H ∞ output tracking controller. The parameters of event-triggering mechanism and the gains of output tracking controller are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, we extend the results of the event-triggered control to the self-triggered H ∞ output tracking control.

In chemical process, some quality variables, in the sense of measuring, often have an important characteristic resulting from the time taken for samples collection. These kinds of measurements are obtained based on sample of materials that are collected in a period of time. So, the measurement indicates the average property of the measurand in the period of samples collection, which is called Slow-Rate inTegrated Measurement (SRTM). In this paper, our goal is to estimate the fast-rate instantaneous states using available SRTM. Bayesian estimation approach is reformulated to acquire this goal. First, new Bayesian formulation is provided which ends to some complex integral formula. Then, with using the idea of Monte Carlo sampling method a numerical solution is presented for this problem. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can deal with integrated measurement problem in a broader range of models with nonlinearity and non-Gaussian noise. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated through simulation and empirical experiment on a level-flow laboratory-scale plant.},

Its basic principle is to utilise the consensus of the multi-agent systems consisting of generators and loads, which will work cooperatively such that the optimal incremental cost and optimal power output could be obtained to solve the economic dispatch problem. The consensus analysis of the proposed systems focused on the following two physical scenarios: (i) containing the power balance constraint but without generation limit; (ii) the power balance constraint and with generation limit. The corresponding effective distributed event-triggered controller is designed respectively to avoid the continuous communication between the agents, the state updating of each agent depending on its own state and its neighbouring agents at their last triggering time. Compared with the centralised event-triggered mechanism, the proposed distributed scheme could reduce the frequency of information exchange between the agent and its neighbours and save the bandwidth and energy.

Next, a continuous-discrete 2D model is established to make use of the 2D characteristics in the modified repetitive-control system. Then, a sufficient stability condition is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Three parameters are used to balance continuous control and discrete learning actions: one in a repetitive loop and two in a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional.

One of the major problems encountered in this configuration is transmission delay which can degrade the synchronisation. In this paper, we focus on the synchronisation problem of nonlinear chaotic systems in the presence of output transmission delay. In the new proposed method, the slave system is made up of a super-twisting sliding mode observer and a predictor arranged in cascade in order to compensate for the delayed transmission signal from the transmitter to the receiver. The observer estimates the delayed states and the predictor provides the estimated states at the current time. The convergence conditions of the proposed method are established.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the boundary stabilisation problem of an underactuated system of coupled time-fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) with different space-dependent diffusivity by state and observer-based output feedback. For this underactuated system, there are n fractional equations, and n −1 of n equations are actuated at the boundary inputs, i.e. n −1 available inputs control the entire system of n fractional equations. In other words, we do not need to control all equations. Using the backstepping mapping, the Dirichlet boundary controller is derived to enable the Mittag–Leffler stability of the closed-loop system with the aid of the Lyapunov direct method. The Mittag–Leffler convergence of designed boundary observer and output feedback stabilisation are subsequently proved. Finally, a fractional numerical example is provided to support the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis for the case when the kernel matrix PDE has not an explicit solution.},

The proposed control strategy can compensate for quantisation error, actuator faults, actuator dead-zone as well as external disturbances effectively, and guarantee the trajectory of the attitude tracking error converge to the equilibrium point along the designed sliding surface.

A local robust observer is established to identify the bound of the unknown interconnections. Then, based on the observer-critic architecture, the decentralised optimal control policy is achieved by solving local Hamiltonian–Jacobi–Bellman equation via local policy iteration algorithm.

Backstepping with the property of fast finite-time convergence exhibits fast transient convergence both at a distance from and at a close range of the equilibrium. Moreover, finite-time disturbance observers based on multivariable super-twisting are employed to counteract the effect of perturbations. Aiming at the adverse effect of input saturation, a novel auxiliary system is developed to avoid the singularity by transforming auxiliary variables for three times. In addition, the framework is also applied into helicopter control problem, in which thrust magnitude and thrust direction are used as intermediate control variables, connecting external translational dynamics and internal angular dynamics. A rigorous proof of finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is derived from Lyapunov theory. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework are verified by comparative simulation.},

A set of adaptive sampling based on distributed sensors rather than a centralised sensor is applied to measure and sample the system&#39;s local signals. Moreover, it can enable local sensors to sample and transmit measured data asynchronously. In order to reasonably distribute network resources, decentralised event-triggering mechanisms (DETMs) are utilised. Furthermore, a data buffer is used to rearrange the released data from different channels to guarantee timely data utilisation. Then, under the proposed DETMs based on adaptive sampling and data buffer, a time-delay closed-loop uncertain switched T-S fuzzy system is developed by applying a modelling method. Subsequently, by utilising the average dwell time and piecewise Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the state of closed-loop uncertain switched T-S fuzzy system is exponentially stable with an H ∞ performance level. For the coupling between switching instants and event-triggered instants in the system, their impact on the system is discussed in detail. Accordingly, the conditions for the co-design of state feedback controllers gains and event-triggering parameters are presented. Finally, simulations verify the proposed design approach.},

The coopetition network associated with the multi-agent system is represented by a signed graph, where positive/negative edges denote cooperative/competitive interactions. We assume the decision mechanism of the agents are model free and each agent has to make a distributed decision by learning the input and output data from himself/itself and his/its neighbours. The individual decision is developed with the neighbours&#39; state information and a performance index function. A policy iteration (PI) algorithm is proposed to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and obtain the optimal decision strategy.

Different from the closely related works, the system parameters are spatially varying and only one boundary measurement is available for feedback, which brings essential difficulties to the analysis and synthesis of event-triggered control. To solve the problem, by using the time-varying strategy and the infinite-dimensional backstepping technique, a novel event-triggered output-feedback controller is designed for the systems. Particularly, a time-varying event-triggering mechanism, with an extra decaying signal introduced into the threshold, is determined. It is rigorously shown that the designed event-triggered controller can guarantee that all the states of the resulting closed-loop system exponentially converge to zero in the sense of L 2 norm while no Zeno phenomenon occurs. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the established boundary control strategy.},

  abstract     = {This work studies the event-based fault-tolerant control issue of networked control systems with actuator saturation, resilient event-triggering, randomly occurring nonlinearities, and denial-of-service jamming attacks (DoS-JAs). Initially, we aim to design a resilient event-triggered (ET) communication scheme under the attacks, proposed by the known period of the jamming signal. The period values occur in uniform lower bounds for the jammer&#39;s sleeping time. Next, a closed-loop networked control system is constructed as a switched-control strategy subject to state-delay, in addition to actuator saturation, actuator faults, DoS jamming attack, parameter uncertainty and resilient ET control schemes. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, piecewise property and Wirtinger-based integral inequality, a set of sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure that the resulting closed-loop switched system is exponentially stable against DoS jamming attacks and satisfies mixed H ∞ and passivity performance index. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulated examples based on the two practical applications of satellite control systems and aircraft flight control systems.},

The key feature in this work is that the state transmission among followers may be subject to channel fading. In order to cope with the adverse factor, this work introduces the statistical information of channel fading into the measure function on the consensus tracking errors. Meanwhile, a feasible distributed sliding mode controller is designed by means of the received fading states. And then, both the reachability and the stability of sliding mode dynamics are analysed, under which the consensus tracking for followers to the leader is attained.

These tuning parameters can be appropriately chosen such that the proposed algorithm has faster convergence performance than some previous algorithms.

Based on a connection topology between the leader and agents and relative degree of the system, the sliding surfaces are defined in terms of the error signals. Then, a performance index is defined to realise the exponential reaching law and minimum control effort. By considering the actuator limits, a constrained Quadratic Programming (QP) problem is derived. The solution of the QP is calculated using PRNN, which is developed based on Variational Inequality (VI) problem. The structure of PRNN is composed of a dynamic and an algebraic equation, in which a projection operator acts as an activation function. The convergence analysis of PRNN as a numerical optimiser has been performed using Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, the sufficient conditions are derived for ensuring the robust stability of the closed-loop system.

First, it decomposes the search behaviour into the roaming search state and coordinated search state based on the detection of target signals by a swarm of UAVs. Second, a nearest neighbour exclusion diffusion (NNED) algorithm is introduced for the UAV of the wander search state, and a 3D adaptive inertia weight extended particle swarm algorithm (IAEPSO) is proposed by combining the motion characteristics of UAV with a 3D particle swarm algorithm aiming at the UAV with coordinated search state. Finally, the 3D-simplified virtual force model proposed based on the concept of the 2D-simplified virtual force model by the rotation matrix is introduced to solve the model parameters and the control strategy under the UAV of wander search state and coordinated search state is established, which effectively solves the real-time obstacle avoidance problem. Moreover, this paper sets the comparison mode of the three search methods; compared to Mode1, the search time T and energy consumption S can be significantly reduced, and the numerical simulations verify its effectiveness.},

Using some matrix transformations and lemmas, sufficient conditions of robust stabilisation are derived in the form of a set of relaxed LMIs guaranteeing an optimal value of the H ∞ performance level. The proposed LMI constraints are solved using particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm to obtain the robust controller and observer gains. The proposed method has the advantage of having less predefined parameters against the available methods in the literature. The obtained H ∞ control scheme ensures asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system as well as strong disturbance attenuation based on the quadratic Lyapunov function, a fuzzy observer and a fuzzy controller.

In the tracking error equations on the adaptive fuzzy backstepping control, the future virtual controls are replaced as the current virtual controls to obtain the actual control in a simple structure. The nonlinear uncertainties included in the systems are approximated as the fuzzy logic systems, and the number of the fuzzy IF–THEN rules is reduced based on the simplified extended single input rule modules.

  abstract     = {The purpose of detecting changes in the operating regime of a system is to identify abrupt changes from one regime to another. This paper proposes a new detection method which can detect regime change instants in sequential time series data. Our approach is based on a sensitivity study of a global model combining, with a multiplicative effect, local models describing the different operating modes without knowing their parameters. More precisely, the operating mode change detection indicator corresponds to the direction of the gradient of the global model of the system (i.e. including all its operating modes) with respect to the variables characterising the system. The proposed procedure is illustrated by the analysis of a dynamic system with several measurable inputs and outputs, which makes it possible to consider auto- and inter-redundancy relationships between inputs and outputs.},

  abstract     = {Based on a distributed state observer, the problem of output feedback synchronisation control for a class of discrete-time delayed complex dynamical networks is studied. In order to solve the energy consumption and communication constraints, dynamic event-triggered mechanisms on sensor and controller sides are proposed by introducing two internal dynamical variables, respectively. Compared with traditional static event-triggered schemes, it effectively reduces the frequency of controller and observer update. Meanwhile, the effects of quantisation occurring in both input and output channels are considered. By means of the linear matrix inequality approach, the distributed state observer and output feedback controller of delayed complex dynamical networks can be designed simultaneously. The exponentially ultimately boundedness of synchronisation errors and estimation errors of complex dynamical networks is guaranteed via the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the circuit realisations for the proposed dynamic event-triggered synchronisation control approach are given, and the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results is demonstrated through the simulation.},

The communication likes are established when the event-triggered function is satisfied. Furthermore, suppose that each topology contains a directed spanning tree, it is shown that the consensus tracking of autonomous unmanned systems can be achieved under some conditions and the dwell time is bounded by a positive threshold.

Unlike the infinite-horizon, the difficulty of finite-horizon optimal control problem is that the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is time-varying and must meet certain terminal boundary constraints, which brings greater challenges. At the same time, the partially unknown system dynamics have also caused additional difficulties. The main innovation of this paper is the proposed cyclic fixed-finite-horizon-based reinforcement learning algorithm to approximately solve the time-varying HJB equation. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of two phases: the data collection phase over a fixed-finite-horizon and the parameters update phase. A least-squares method is used to correlate the two phases to obtain the optimal parameters by cyclic. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed cyclic fixed-finite-horizon-based reinforcement learning algorithm.},

Sufficient conditions and sufficient relaxed conditions of a reduced-order sliding mode dynamics are derived, and desired sliding surfaces in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are also given.

Aiming to addressing the non-affine and non-linear characteristics of the systems, a linear data model (LDM) is constructed in iteration domain without introducing any physical interpretation but only for the purpose of the subsequent algorithm design and analysis. The iteration-varying initial values and disturbances are incorporated as a total non-repetitive uncertainty of the LDM. Both an iterative learning observer and a parameter estimator are proposed to address the total non-repetitive uncertainties and unknown parameters of the established LDM, respectively. Then, an observer-based learning control law is developed using the estimated output to compensate the impact of the non-repetitive uncertainties on the control performance, where a saturated function is employed to deal with the input constraints. The convergence of proposed ObDDILC is proved by using contraction mapping as the basic tool.

Since the multiplicative property of the FD system would drastically increase the number of the stability conditions, a method of decoupling based on dimension expansion is used. By decoupling, the number of LMI-based stability conditions is reduced to r from r 2 by the conventional method. Then, the fuzzy FD filter is designed. The corresponding fuzzy FD system is proved to be mean-square asymptotically stable and satisfies the H ∞ attenuation level for all disturbances. In addition, a theorem is proposed to prove that the stability conditions based on decoupling method are equivalent to those of conventional method. Finally, simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed design methods.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the tracking control problem of non-affine stochastic nonlinear systems with input saturation constraints, the event trigger control (ETC) based on Radial basic function neural networks (RBFNNs) and prescribed performance control (PPC) is considered. First, the mean value theorem is used to decouple the non-affine terms existing in the system. Second, the design process of PPC is reconstructed for a class of stochastic nonlinear systems, because the existence of stochastic disturbances has not been fully considered in previous literature on PPC, so that the system output is not to violate the set constraint bound by preset function. Finally, unlike the existing event triggering results, a special event triggering strategy is designed, which further takes into account the error between the preset function and the system output and the errors in all states of stochastic nonlinear systems, so it is expected that the amount of communications will be further reduced. Also, the proposed adaptive PPC scheme with event triggering mechanism can guarantee that all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) in probability within the appropriate compact sets. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a practical example.},

By merging sampled-data model predictive control and sliding mode control in-between samples, the effect of the uncertainty is reduced efficiently. The computational complexity of the proposed robust model predictive control is the same as for the model predictive control while asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is achieved.

By using multiple Lyapunov functions method and algebraic graph theory, it is proved that second-order consensus is guaranteed by choosing the control and rest durations appropriately in each time interval. This result provides high flexibility in control gain design, allowing multiple switching with different gains in arbitrarily-chosen time intervals. As a result, it not only encompasses many existing intermittent control schemes but can also manage practical situations, such as recovery from occasional control failures.

Similar to the driving preference of human, the driving path and speed can be determined separately. This paper is concerned with speed profile optimisation problem for dynamic obstacle avoidance given the reference path. The optimisation consists of smoothness, risk, and efficiency terms with obstacle constraints. For task formulation, the s - t motion space is constructed to describe the motion of the ego vehicle and obstacles. Then the high-dimensional trajectory space is mapped to the low-dimensional s - t space for computational efficiency. The speed optimisation problem is transformed into a path searching problem considering collision avoidance and searching efficiency. RRT-based algorithm is proposed to search for the optimal speed profile in the s - t space asymptotically. In each searching step, node extension strategy is designed for the space exploring efficiency; then the tree structure is locally refined for asymptotic optimisation. The optimal speed profile is generated after the searching process converges and the speed profile is planned periodically. For performance evaluation, simulation tests in typical traffic conditions are conducted based on the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) platform. Results show the effectiveness and efficiency of this method.},

Such a type of electric machines is widely used in traction of Maglev electric trains, in several mechatronic systems, as well as in electric power generation through wave energy conversion. First a neural network with Gauss–Hermite activation function is used for modelling the dynamics of the PMSLM. The neural network is used as the fault-free model of the PMLSM. Next, to perform fault diagnosis, the output of the neural network is compared against the output that is measured in real-time from the PMLSM, when both the NN and the electric machine receive the same input. Thus, the residuals&#39; sequence is generated. It is proven that the sum of the squares of the residuals&#39; vectors, being weighted by the inverse of the associated covariance matrix, is a stochastic variable (statistical test) that follows the χ 2 distribution. The 96\% or the 98\% confidence intervals of the χ 2 distribution with degrees of freedom to be equal to the dimension of the residuals&#39; vector provide a statistical test for inferring with a high confidence level if the PMLSM has undergone a failure or not.},

Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting reduced order system can preserve a certain number of discrete Laguerre coefficients of output variables in the time domain. We also derive the error bound in the time domain. Furthermore, in order to obtain the moments of the system, we approximate the transfer function of the discrete time-delay system by Taylor expansion. The basis matrices of the higher order Krylov subspace are deduced by a iterative process. Further, we prove that the reduced order system can match a desired number of moments of the original system. The error estimation is obtained in the frequency domain.

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of achieving time-varying formation for second-order multi-agent systems with actuator hysteresis, unknown system dynamics and external disturbances. A novel adaptive dynamic sliding mode scheme is developed to control a group of agents to follow desired trajectories. First, a dynamic sliding mode approach based on local formation tracking error is utilised to reject external disturbances and obtain smooth and chattering-free control input. Then, Chebyshev neural network is employed to estimate the nonlinear function related to the system&#39;s dynamic equation. A smooth projection law is also applied to regulate the output of the neural network. Moreover, a Bouc–Wen hysteresis compensator has been added to the current control law to offset the known actuator hysteresis effect. Finally, a numerical simulation based on a multiple omni-directional robot system is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control law.},

The proposed semi-variogram exhibited all of the characteristics of a typical semi-variogram in the fuzzy domain. A non-parametric kernel-based method was proposed to remove the trend across the fuzzy data. Some common goodness-of-fit criteria were employed to examine the performance of the proposed kriging prediction method. The proposed method was then put to test using a simulated set of fuzzy data. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this approach, it was applied to a set of pH data in the fuzzy domain to investigate the quality of groundwater.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a unified theory is proposed for the fractional control of the non-minimum phase plus dead time systems via the introduction of the fractional filter-PID control and stability inequality. More precisely, three Theorems from a fractional system-theoretic viewpoint are developed. The first Theorem deals with the controller design through the notion of generalised internal model control. That embeds the fractional filter-PID controller coupled with the unified form of the Smith predictor and the inverse compensator. The second Theorem designs a bound on the fractional filter parameter that leads to a stable feedback system. The third Theorem deals with the stability of a fractional quasi-characteristic polynomial of the commensurate order arising from the control of non-minimum phase systems with dead time. Two illustrative second-order plus dead time non-minimum phase systems are presented to test the efficacy of the resulting fractional filter-PID controller that obeys the stability bound. Controller and sensitivity performance indices for the nominal as well as mismatch cases reveal the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for enhanced closed-loop performance. Thus, the generalised inverse compensator, the fractional filter-PID controller and the stability inequality in corroboration with numerical simulations demonstrate the better control of non-minimum phase systems with dead time.},

Using the gradient descent algorithm for designing a fuzzy estimator makes the tune of controller’s parameters possible in different physical situations and uncertainties. Thanks to the voltage control strategy and fuzzy systems, there is no need for designers to have the knowledge of robots and actuators’ dynamics. In addition, the force feedback is not employed in the structure of control law. Using the Lyapunov-like stability analysis, not only the exponential convergence of error signal and its time derivative to zero are guaranteed in the decentralised form but also the boundedness of all signals is ensured. To confirm the efficiency of proposed control algorithm, several simulations as well as a comparison with a positioned-based impedance controller and a regressor-based adaptive impedance controller are conducted on a two-link planar robot manipulator considering a tunable desired trajectory and different stiffness of environment. Additionally, the proposed adaptive impedance controller is applied to a six degree of freedom revolute-joint manipulator to provide better evaluation.},

Furthermore, the initial values of the states of the secondary layer subgraphs have no effect on the consensus equilibria of any agent in the network.

  abstract     = {Maximising yield and minimising time are two top priorities for biotechnological industry. In this paper, we model the 1, 3-PD uncoupled fed-batch fermentation process with a 10-dimensional nonlinear switched system. By taking both maximising 1, 3-PD concentration and minimising the terminal time of fermentation as the objectives, we propose a multi-objective optimisation problem with the flow rates of glycerol and alkali, the switched times among four modes and the mode sequence as the decision variables. To solve the multi-objective optimisation problem, we use the convex weighted sum to transcribe the multi-objective optimisation problem into a sequence of single-objective optimisation problems. Then the time-scaling transformation, the binary relaxation approach and the exact penalty method are applied to solve these single-objective optimisation problems. The numerical results show that, by optimising the flow rates of glycerol and alkali, the switched times among four modes and the mode sequence, the optimum fed-batch time and the higher 1, 3-PD concentration can be obtained. The obtained numerical results can provide reference for the actual fermentation experiment.},

Firstly, the dynamical model of exoskeleton is converted into a linear discrete model by compact form dynamic linearisation (CFDL) with iteration method. Then, based on the linear model, an MFAISMC algorithm is proposed to control the system tracking the desired time-varying trajectories, which just depends on the iterative input and output data of each joint of the exoskeleton. It is proved that the convergence of both tracking error and time-varying parameters can be guaranteed with the increasing iterative numbers. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method are verified by related simulation results.},

The event-triggered transmission protocol is introduced to schedule the data transmission and so the communication network burdens can be mitigated. The state saturation restraints can be removed by means of transforming the original model into a new polyhedron system via a convex hull description approach. By considering two coupling cases between the mode switching signal and the event triggering signal, the sufficient finite-time H ∞ performance analysis criterion is provided based on average dwell time (ADT) analysis technique. Then, an event-triggered state-feedback controller is designed to ensure that the closed-loop system is finite-time bounded and satisfies the specified H ∞ disturbance attenuation performance. The desired controller can be obtained by solving a set of convex optimisation problems. Finally, a numerical example shows the usefulness of the theoretical results.},

Finding an association between changes of weight functions of LDOS and variation of its BIBO stability boundary is the other aim of this paper. To achieve these goals, the tangential lines of the BIBO stability boundary for the extremely high and low frequencies are founded in the first step. Then, the additive identity and the multiplicative identity for the weight function maintaining the stability boundary intact are determined. In addition, it is proved that multiplying a set of multiplication factors in the form of polynomials to the weight functions would guarantee the increment of the stability region. To validate the presented results, comparisons among the stability boundary of several different LDOS are performed. Simulation outcomes are in agreement with the extracted results.},

This article presents an internal model control (IMC)-based series cascade control system for different time delay process models. The novelty of the work lies in the use of fractional order IMC filter of the first order and higher order for designing controller in the outer loop based on specific maximum sensitivity. The design also considers different approximations for the time delay term. The controller designed for the inner loop assumes the standard PID controller structure and the outer loop controller takes a fractional filter PID structure. The proposed method gives improved performance for set point tracking and disturbance rejection. Further, the proposed method gives robust performance for noise in the measured signal. Also, the robustness analysis is performed to know the insensitivity of the closed-loop system for process parameter variations. The fragility of the controller is investigated for perturbations in the controller parameters.},

For estimating the unmeasurable states, we derive a new state estimator by using the preceding parameter estimates to take the place of the unknown system parameters in the Kalman filter. Furthermore, we propose a filtering-based multi-innovation extended stochastic gradient (F-MI-ESG) algorithm to achieve the higher parameter estimation accuracy. Finally, we provide two simulation examples to test and compare the performance of the proposed algorithms. The simulation results indicate that the F-ESG algorithm and the F-MI-ESG algorithm are effective for parameter estimation, and that the F-MI-ESG algorithm is able to achieve more accurate parameter estimates than the F-ESG algorithm.},

The framework consists of two parts: an offline detector building and an online trajectory detection. The former employs a popular route concept to process massive trajectory data and adapts the mapping grid-based anomaly detection method by taking into account spatial and temporal characteristics of the trajectory dataset. The latter maps ongoing trajectory points and detects whether the ongoing driving route is anomalous or reliable. The proposed trajectory anomaly detection method is faster than the existing methods as it involves only simple activities of trajectory point mapping and retrieval procedure, without requiring extra distance or density calculation. In addition, the proposed method has detection accuracy comparable to that of the existing high-performance methods. The application and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated using extensive experiments on real datasets.},

The objective of this paper is todesign a set of filter gains such that the augmented dynamics satisfies the desirable ellipsoid constraint in the simultaneous presence of stateconstraints, censored measurements and RR protocol. A sufficient condition for the existence of piecewise linear filters is obtained and aconvex optimisation method is presented to derive the minimized ellipsoid in the sense of matrix trace. Finally, a simulation example is givento verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.},

The proposed optimal PI tracker consists of both a modified state estimator and the newly modified equivalent input disturbance (EID) estimator. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) The conventional EID estimator is significantly modified to improve the tracking performances of a system with unknown disturbances; and (2) The improved EID estimator can be simply regarded as a plug-in component of the compensator, to perform on-line optimal tracking control of square/non-square servo systems with unknown disturbances.},

A new smooth function in non-affine form is firstly proposed to approximate the non-smooth input deadzone and saturation and transformed into an affine form by the mean-value theorem. The unknown nonlinear functions and external disturbances are estimated by fuzzy logic systems. An improved funnel error is given and embedded in the procedure of controller design. Based on the backstepping method, an adaptive fuzzy funnel controller is constructed, which guarantees that the output tracking error falls within a pre-set funnel and all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly and ultimately bounded. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed controller.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, the smoothness of the distributed consensus control (DCC) protocols of multi-agent systems (MAS) with inherent nonlinear dynamics is investigated. Different from the traditional consensus protocols where variable structure control is considered for robust control, a continuous DCC is presented to achieve consensus tracking without control chattering. Using certain types of exponential functions, it is shown that different smooth DCC schemes can be constructed to achieve asymptotic consensus tracking with smooth control input for MAS with connected directed/undirected and fixed/switched communication topologies. Second, the formation control problem of nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots (WMR) is solved via the continuous DCC. By converting the formation problem into consensus problem using the agents’ kinematics, the formation speed-control problem in planar motion is formulated and solved. The translational and rotational speeds inputs to the WMR are computed using continuous distributed consensus protocols to reduce chattering in the control inputs of mobile robots. The distinctive feature of the proposed consensus and formation algorithms is the high tracking precision with smooth control input to agents’ dynamics. In simulation studies, different numerical examples are illustrated to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed DCC.},

A good estimate of the upper bound for the line integral type LKF is achieved, based on which, the conditions of stochastic asymptotic stability and extended dissipativity are derived. A comparison has been drawn between the conditions derived by line integral type LKF and the ones by the quadratic LKF in a numerical example, to indicate that the conditions by line integral approach are more general than the ones via quadratic method. Meanwhile, these conditions are of nonlinear form with respect to some matrix variables which makes the determination of the extended dissipative controller difficult. Inspired by cone complementarity linearisation algorithm and a novel matrix decoupling method, the state feedback controller is developed by transforming the nonlinear matrix inequalities into a quadratic optimisation problem with linear matrix inequality constraints. Finally, two examples are given to show the validity of our proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper proves the ultimately boundedness analysis for the trajectory tracking problem between the states of an uncertain nonlinear system represented by a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) system and a given set of desired trajectories. The design of an output feedback controller includes a weighted contribution of the models included in the T–S design. The proposed T–S fuzzy estimates the state variables based on the output information, exclusively. The output-based controller design uses a time-dependent Lyapunov function yielding the characterisation of ultimate boundedness for the trajectory tracking error. Sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence of positive-definite solutions for two coupled time-varying matrix Riccati equations, which are needed to solve the tracking problem. A simplified scheme determines the gains for the feedback controller and observer. The proposed control law solves the trajectory tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle. In this case, numerical solutions show that the controller forced the convergence of the tracking error after 2.0 seconds. An alternative control design approach based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is used for comparison purposes. The suggested controller forces a faster convergence of the tracking error than the LMI-based one and provides a smaller ultimate bound.},

The main purpose of this paper is to design the MFDF such that, for all nonlinearities, external disturbances and randomly occurring deception attacks, the resultant augmented system is finite-time stable and attains the H ∞ performance. Accordingly, some sufficient conditions are developed to guarantee the existence of the desired fault detection filter parameters, where the solvability of the addressed problem is verified by the feasibility of certain matrix inequalities. Moreover, in order to show that the MFDF has better detection performance, a non-memory fault detection filter (NMFDF) is constructed to compare with the MFDF.

However, TKSVC is sensitive to noises or outliers due to the use of the Hinge loss function. To reduce the negative influence of outliers, in this paper, we propose a more robust algorithm termed as Ramp loss for twin K -class support vector classification (Ramp-TKSVC) where we use the Ramp loss function to substitute the Hinge loss function in TKSVC. Because the Ramp-TKSVC is a non-differentiable non-convex optimisation problem, we adopt Concave–Convex Procedure (CCCP) to solve it. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional multi-classification methodologies, the TKSVC is utilised as a core of our Ramp-TKSVC. In the Ramp-TKSVC, the outliers are prevented from becoming support vectors, thus they are not involved in the construction of hyperplanes, making the Ramp-TKSVC more robust. Besides, the Ramp-TKSVC is sparser than the TKSVC. To verify the validity of our Ramp-TKSVC, we conduct experiments on 12 benchmark datasets in both linear and nonlinear cases. The experimental results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the other five compared algorithms.},

Moreover, high precision and fast convergence and good robustness against lumped disturbance can be effectively obtained using the NTSM manifold and combined adaptive reaching law. Stability of the closed-loop control system is analysed using Lyapunov theory. Comparative numerical simulations and experimental studies were performed.

  abstract     = {A real-world topological network consists of multiple entrances along its source nodes. Routing appropriate percentages of pedestrians from these entrances to the particular available routes with relevant arrival rates will improve the network’s performance. This paper presents a framework for finding the optimal arrival rates of pedestrians from all available entrances and routes to downstream nodes maximising the network’s throughput. The calculation of the arrival rates and movement directions is based on M/G/C/C analytical and simulation models and the network flow model and considers the real distances of the entrances along the source nodes. The framework was tested on the Tuanku Syed Putra Hall, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia. Extensive analyses of the performances of its available nodes especially on the achievable optimal throughputs were documented and discussed. Quantitative results show that the hall’s throughput is optimised when pedestrians’ arrival rates to all the available entrances and their movement directions are controlled within certain ranges.},

  abstract     = {Wiener model structures have attracted considerable attentions due to their powerful modelling abilities to solve industrial problems. This paper considers a new class of Wiener model structure, which consists of a linear transfer function and a radial basis function (RBF) network. Based on this structure, the unstable zero-dynamics, the added disturbances and the approximation errors problems can be dealt with. Since the model parameters are assumed unknown, we develop a new indirect adaptive control scheme. It is a consensus that the certainty equivalence principle is the key that connects the adaptation algorithm with the control law. This paper explains that, for indirect adaptive control of Wiener model, this principle may not be applied directly. The main contribution of this paper is to address this issue by presenting a rigorous theoretical analysis. Representative examples including a simulated pH process control problem are studied to test the control performance. Comparison results indicate that the proposed controller has much wider applicability than some alternative methods, especially for its improved performance and smoother adaptation.},

To deal with the difficulties arising from unmeasurable states, a fuzzy logic observer based on delayed outputs is firstly employed. Then, based on the delayed output, observed states and filtered virtual control signals, proper change of coordinates is defined for the purpose of designing dynamic surface control. By introducing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals in the design procedures, a controller and adaptation laws are obtained for the control strategy of nonlinear systems subject to output delay. Moreover, by selecting design parameters and matrices based on the acquired stability criteria, it is proved that the proposed adaptive fuzzy dynamic surface output feedback control approach is able to guarantee the uniformly ultimately boundedness of all the signals in the closed loop unknown nonlinear output-delay systems. Finally, the theoretic achievements are applied to three well-known benchmark systems to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

Such an approach permits the system to track formation protocols made of multiple complicated trajectories, and allows the designer to change the trajectories on-line according to the surrounding environment. The estimation part of the proposed approach is conducted using the newly developed smoothed regularised least-squares observer. This observer provides highly accurate predicted state estimates that are essential in generating the desired control strategy. The stability of the proposed observer-based controller is analysed.

Compared to the scenario of a single rigid-body, for the strategy employed, the multiple rigid bodies scenario, a stronger requirement on the hysteresis half-width is necessary.

By virtue of the limit theorem and the developed evolution rule, a sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee that the error dynamics are almost surely asymptotical stable. Furthermore, gain variations are handled by utilising the well-known S-procedure, and the desired estimator gains are designed via a set of solutions of matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed results is illustrated by a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Many identification strategies for closed loop system structure assume that an open loop system is closed by a feedback mechanism, which contains a known and linear controller. This assumption means these identification strategies are feasible under some prior knowledge of feedback controller. To relax this assumption for some complex systems with unknown controller or nonlinear controller, a new stealth identification strategy is proposed to tackle the identification problem for closed loop system with unknown controller or nonlinear controller. Stealth identification modifies closed loop system, so that the new prediction error and inverse covariance matrix are all independent of the unknown controller or nonlinear controller. This independence simplifies the problem of estimating parameter vector and designing optimal input. The Robbins-Monro algorithm is applied to identify the unknown parameter vector in closed loop system with unknown controller, and the nonlinear controller is replaced by its equivalent linear time invariant controller. Some consideration about the linear approximation to nonlinear system are studied, and two linear approximation forms are constructed to approximate the nonlinear system. The effectiveness of our proposed stealth identification strategy is demonstrated through simulation example.},

By the event-triggering strategies, only necessary samplings of feedback signals are determined to be released. The advantages are that redundant transmissions and updates can be reduced. By the adopted switching law, each sub-system will work for a minimum dwell time, and then a state-dependent switching starts to work. Specifically, by using discrete event-triggering strategies and considering the effects of transmission delays, a time-delay closed-loop switched system is first established. Then, by utilising multiple Lyapunov functions method, sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the stability of the closed-loop switched system with a certain H ∞ performance level. In particular, since the switching instants and the event-triggered instants may be coupled, typical cases are discussed in detail. Moreover, the co-design conditions for state-feedback sub-controller gains and event-triggering parameters are developed.

Then, with the help of the homogeneous domination approach, homogeneous output feedback controllers are designed with series scaling gains. By successfully constructing an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional for the stability analysis, it is shown that the resulted closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable.

For each axis of the subsystem with uncertainties, the prescribed performance control technique is adopted to ensure a moderate control performance. Then a disturbance observer is constructed to enhance the corresponding controller to achieve a sufficiently small ultimate error. Not only the control performance of the overall control system, but also the behaviour of all the internal error signals are analysed rigorously.

Due to the fully actuated feature, the reference pose for ODMR is easily planned as compared with the under-actuated mobile robots. Subsequently, the reference motor current (RMC) is designed by the first switching surface. To make the motor current asymptotically track the RMC, a variable structure tracking control (VSTC) with the saturated output is designed by the second switching surface. The consideration of motor dynamics is to deal with the high-frequency motion behaviours of trajectory tracking, e.g. time-varying terrain, inaccurate friction model, discontinuous reference pose. The larger roughness of time-varying terrain, discontinuity of the reference pose or inaccurate friction model, the larger high-frequency amplitude of control input. In summary, the proposed stratified variable structure saturated control (SVSSC) includes the RMC and VSTC with the saturated output. The simulations for the circular trajectory with different nominal friction force and torque of each wheel and uncertainties by the SVSSC are satisfactorily achieved. The corresponding experiments with the mat on the reference trajectory and different reference pose for ODMR validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practicality of the proposed control.},

The proposed method always generates stable reduced-order models, and also it retains the zeroth-order interval time moment. Four numerical examples exemplify the accuracy of the method and computational simplicity. Furthermore, the difficulties associated with the extension of Routh-based approximations to interval systems for obtaining stable reduced-order models are discussed. The stability of interval systems is verified by using Kharitonov&#39;s theorem.},

Based on a new differential inequality with mixed delays and Markovian switching, two stability criteria are derived, which weakens the restriction on parameter that determines exponential convergence rate and reduces the conservativeness. The intensity of stochastic perturbations, coupling in multi-links and intermittent control gain have a great influence on these stability criteria. Different from the previous work that studying multi-links systems, we utilise Lyapunov method and the tree-cycle identity in graph theory integrating differential inequality techniques. Furthermore, the main results are applied to the stochastic hybrid multi-links oscillators with mixed delays.

The hierarchical controller has an outer-inner loop structure. The outer loop controls the position of the quadrotor and generates desired roll and pitch angles for the inner loop corresponding to desired position, velocity and heading angle. The inner loop controls the attitude of the quadrotor. A disturbance observer based backstepping controller is designed for the outer loop to compensate for disturbances and guarantee robust position tracking. An adaptive non-singular terminal sliding mode controller is designed for the inner loop to ensure the attitude angles converge to their desired values in finite time and deal with the parametric uncertainties. The stability and online estimating capability of the proposed controller are proved by using Lyapunov theory.

  abstract     = {Stick–slip vibrations are widespread and hazardous phenomena in drilling practice. The objective of this paper is to develop a simple and general control strategy to minimise such vibrations together with unknown disturbances. Taking into account the transmission delay of the torsional energy from the surface to downhole, a neutral-type drill-string model is established and applied rather than a lumped-parameter model that cannot provide satisfactory modelling precision. Based on this neutral-type model, the major contribution consists of the combination of disturbance estimator and smith predictor to develop a robust vibration control scheme for drill-string systems. One conspicuous advantage of this scheme is that the effects of stick–slip vibrations and external disturbances are estimated without the need for any prior knowledge in the control input channel, and are offset correspondingly. Simulations confirm that this control scheme can achieve effective suppression of stick–slip vibrations with good tracking and disturbance rejection performance.},

Based on the structural characteristic of the NHSSs, the closed-loop system under the output feedback controller is transformed equivalently into slow subsystem and fast subsystem. Different criterions are identified to guarantee that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and the γ -dissipative inequalities holds in the presence of disturbances, respectively.

By analysing the reachability graph (RG) of an original net ( N 0 , M 0 ) ( N 0 , M 0 ) (N0, M0) with deadlocks, this DCA firstly find all deadlock markings (DMs) and then the corresponding CTs are solved on the basis of the proposed CTE. Secondly, a linear programming problem that can minimise the number of CTs is applied to these CTs. In addition, in order to furtherly simplify the structure of these CTs, the reconstruction of the necessarily added CTs is performed by a circulating sequence number method. Finally, a live controlled system ( N C , M C ) with the simpler structure is obtained by adding the desired CTs to ( N 0 , M 0 ) , which can reach the same number of states as the original plant model ( N 0 , M 0 ) , i. e. live maximally reachable number. The proposed DCA is different from deadlock prevention policies using control places (CPs) in most existing literature and whose correctness and efficiency are verified via the theoretical analysis and the relevant several examples.},

These uncertainty phenomena, common in network systems, have traditionally been described by independent Bernoulli random variables. We propose a model that is more general and therefore has greater applicability to real-life situations. The model has two particular characteristics: firstly, the sensor gain degradation is represented by a white sequence of random variables with values in [0, 1]; in addition, the absence or presence of delays in the transmission is described by a homogeneous three-state Markov chain, which reflects a possible correlation of delays at different sampling times. Furthermore, assuming that the measurement noise is one-step correlated, we obtain recursive prediction, filtering and fixed-point smoothing algorithms using the first and second-order moments of the signal and the processes present in the observation model. Simulation results for a scalar signal are provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithms, using the estimation error variances as a measure of the quality of the estimators.},

The design relies on additive-state decomposition, by which the output-feedback RC problem is decomposed into an output-feedback RC problem for a linear time-invariant component and a state-feedback stabilisation problem for a nonlinear component. Thanks to the decomposition, existing controller design methods in both the frequency domain and the time domain are employed to make the robustness and discretisation for a continuous-time nonlinear system tractable.

  abstract     = {A reference model of an adaptive control law defines how a closed-loop dynamical system under consideration has to asymptotically (or approximately) behave in the presence of system uncertainties. While it is of common practice to use reference models with linear dynamics, this can lead to limitations on the achievable closed-loop dynamical system performance – especially for applications involving highly capable dynamical systems such as highly manoeuvrable aircraft, missiles, and space launch vehicles. Because, linear reference models for these applications can only approximate the desired closed-loop behaviour of these nonlinear dynamical systems in narrow regions of the state-space. Motivated from this standpoint, this paper&#39;s contribution is to present a new adaptive control architecture for uncertain dynamical systems based on nonlinear reference models. Specifically, we analytically show that the system error between the uncertain dynamical system and the nonlinear reference model asymptotically vanishes in steady-state and its performance is guaranteed during the transient-time. We further discuss the practicality of our approach and provide numerical examples to demonstrate its efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated controllers for coal-fired ultra-supercritical (USC) boiler-turbine power units in the new flexible-operation mode face many challenges, such as faster load-following rate over wider-range operations, nonlinear dynamics with long time delay and multiple disturbances from strong-coupled multivariable processes. Hence, to improve the coordinated controller of the USB power unit, this paper proposes an internal-model robust adaptive control (IM-RAC) approach to handle nonlinearity, multiple variables, unknown uncertainties and long-time delay. The proposed IM-RAC augments an internal model with the framework of an L 1 robust adaptive control to predict the time-delay variable. In addition, the proposed IM-RAC uses a dual-feedback adaptive law instead of a single-feedback adaptive law. Based on the proof by contradiction, the stability of the IM-RAC control loop is proved, and stability conditions and performance bounds are derived. Furthermore, an IM-RAC coordinated controller is designed for a 1000 MW coal-fired USC power unit. By simulations, we show that the proposed IM-RAC outperforms an advanced model predictive controller in the presences of fast and wide load-following, long-time delay and uncertainties. With less modelling requirements, the IM-RAC control approach is a promising solution to improve the operational flexibility of USC power units.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the input-to-state stability (ISS) problem for a scalar continuous-time linear system with measurement noise under event-triggered sampling. The feedback information is transmitted through a digital communication network with bounded delay. Due to measurement noise, it is difficult to perfectly capture the system&#39;s state, which may harm the performance, and even destabilise the system. In order to deal with the measurement noise, a state observer is incorporated into the event generator. By designing the event-triggering strategy based on the observed state, the input-to-state stability of the concerned system can be ensured. We quantitatively analyse the required stabilising bit rate, which is mainly determined by the network delay and the system&#39;s dynamics. By selecting appropriate parameters of the event-triggered sampling strategy, the required stabilising bit rate is lower than the one by the conventional periodic sampling strategies. Due to the existence of measurement noise, extra bit rate is required compared with the case with perfect state. The bit rate increase of measurement noise can be arbitrarily reduced at the cost of the degraded control performance, which is measured by the ultimate upper bounds on the state. Simulations are done to illustrate the obtained stabilising bit rate conditions},

In the setting, the vehicles are initially located at multiple depots in a two-dimensional space and the objective of planning is to minimise a weighted sum of the total tour cost of the group and the largest individual tour cost amongst the vehicles. While the presented formulation takes the form of a mixed-integer linear programme (MILP) for which off-the-shelf solvers are available, the MILP solver easily loses the tractability as the number of tasks and agents grow. Therefore, a memetic algorithm tailored to the presented formulation is proposed. The algorithm features a sophisticated encoding scheme to efficiently select the order of performing tasks. In addition, a path refinement technique that optimises detailed tours with the sequence of visits fixed is proposed to finally obtain further optimised trajectories. Comparative numerical experiments show the validity and efficiency of the proposed methods compared with the previous methods in the literature.},

In this paper, we propose a new method combining entropy weight and DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) to manage emergency alternative selection under group decision makers. Firstly, IFN (intuitionistic fuzzy number) is introduced to represent linguistic assessment of decision makers under different criteria. Secondly, based on belief entropy, the weight of decision makers is determined and then applied in IFWA (intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging) operator to fuse group assessment. Thirdly, with the weight of criteria calculated by DEMATEL, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is used to rank emergency alternatives. Two case studies are illustrated to demonstrate the efficiency and practicability of the proposed method through the comparison of other existing methods. The proposed method has three advantages: (1) Via IFN and IFWA operator, it is simple and efficient to address the representation and fusion of linguistic assessment under uncertain information. (2) DEMATEL can help decision-makers weight the importance of criteria considering their direct and indirect effects; (3) Belief entropy can well measure the uncertainty of information and is capable of determining the weight of experts objectively.},

A key point is to set up the almost output regulation model reference adaptive control strategy to achieve the tracking and the disturbance rejection performance. First, we design a switched identification model to estimate the plant uncertain parameters, by which more accurate plant parameters will be obtained. Secondly, based on the switched identification model, controllers with combined adaptive laws and a state-dependent switching law are designed to solve the almost output regulation model reference adaptive control problem for switched systems. Finally, a sufficient condition is given, which guarantees that the problem of the almost output regulation model reference adaptive control for switched systems is solvable in spite of the problem of almost output regulation model reference adaptive control for each subsystem is not solvable.},

The time-varying weighted topology matrix is modelled as a linear combination of a finite number of constant Laplacian matrices with time-varying coefficients. The proposed back-stepping sliding-mode controller guarantees that all the signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability and the norm of sliding trajectories converge almost surely in finite-time to an arbitrary small neighbourhood of origin, which can be called almost-surely practical finite-time formation.

A fuzzy-regulated adaptive optimal control (FRAOC) scheme is derived to realise chaotic synchronisation under both structure and parameter uncertainties. In the proposed scheme, the uncertain chaotic dynamics is firstly captured and estimated using a self-organising learning algorithm in an online fuzzy rule database. Based on the complicated and uncertain chaotic information, control strategy is adaptively regulated and configured in the form of weighting matrix for the subsequent optimal controller by the use of fuzzy logic inference. An adaptive optimal controller is then developed, so that its control behaviour and performance are adaptively adjusted for the chaotic synchronisation and compound uncertainty compensation. A supervisory compensator with recursive adaptation law is also designed to attenuate the residual compensation error and guarantee the synchronisation stability. Chaotic synchronisation convergence using the proposed approach can be mathematically ensured and speeded up with satisfactory robustness. Simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method in comparison with robust quadratic optimal control based on linear matrix inequality approach.},

  abstract     = {Iterative learning control (ILC) is an effective strategy to deal with repetitive tasks and has been widely applied in industrial systems. Many methods have been proposed to improving the performance of ILC system against iteration-invariant disturbances. While iteration-varying disturbances, which has more practical meaning, do not get enough researches. An observer is designed to estimate the system states and the total disturbances which include the system uncertainties and external disturbances. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is given to estimate separately the disturbances from input and non-input channels. Then robust D-type ILC with disturbances compensation is proposed to improve the performance of systems with iteration-varying and time-varying disturbances. The convergence of proposed robust ILC system is proved, and the control parameters design is guided. Finally, simulation and comparison with other method are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Fault identifiability plays a key role in the fault diagnosability performance analysis of a system. However, considering the need for an accurate model, the design of control systems and fault diagnosis systems based on fault identifiability performance suffers from a limited application range because accurate models are rarely available for complex processes or plants, whereas substantial quantities of offline and online data can be obtained from systems with ease. This situation constitutes the motivation to develop a data-driven analysis method for determining the identifiability of faults in dynamic systems. The fault identifiability analysis problem is reformulated as the quantification of the difficulty associated with estimating an unknown value from a regression analysis perspective. Moreover, the proposed identification scheme for a stable kernel representation provides a direct way to identify the matrices required to compute the proposed measure, the estimability, which effectively reduces engineering costs in practical applications. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a vehicle lateral dynamic system to exemplify how to analyse the fault identifiability performance of a dynamic system.},

The typical achievable tasks for these multi-AUV systems equipped with optical sensors mainly include to study the seabed sediments, search small objects at the seabed, collect colourful biological samples, and monitor the underwater infrastructures, etc. The purpose of this research is to develop a new coordination strategy to make a fleet of AUVs build a geometrical pattern suitable for optical sensing at the seabed. This new coordination strategy includes two parts: designing a predefined pattern (a planar pyramid pattern) and proposing an associated formation control method (an improved asynchronous discrete consensus algorithm with a time-variant digraph via the displacement-based control, inspired from the fish schooling problem) to update the trajectories of AUVs in real-time and reach this pattern from a disorder distribution. Before it is tested at sea with six AUVs, the performance of this new coordination method is verified in the simulation environments constructed in Blender and Matlab respectively.

First, a scheduling-parameter-dependent reduced-order simultaneous state/fault estimator is designed based on model transformation method, unknown input observer theory, estimator parameterisation, and robustness optimisation. Second, a novel robust fault tolerant preview tracking control policy is constructed by integrating fault signal compensation, state feedback, preview action of reference signals, and integral regulation of tracking errors. Compared with the relevant studies, the merits can be summarised in two aspects. On one hand, the proposed design method of reduced-order estimator can be applied to more general LPV models because it does not depend on the traditional constraint operations, such as decomposition of system output equation, separated estimations of actuator and sensor faults, or derivative of output equation. On the other hand, the optimal preview policy including preview action and integral regulation is introduced to increase the design degree of freedom, which contributes to the optimisation of fault tolerant tracking performance even under influences of fault estimation errors and disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by three case studies.},

To be more specific, a state observer in the bilinear form is established by minimising the state estimation error covariance matrix in the same way of a Kalman filter on the condition that the parameters are known. Then, a bilinear state observer based recursive least squares algorithm is developed using the least squares method. Moreover, for the purpose of improving the computational efficiency, a bilinear state observer based two-stage recursive least squares algorithm and a bilinear state observer based multi-stage recursive least squares algorithm are proposed by decomposing the system into several subsystems based on the hierarchical identification.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the problem of adaptive fault tolerant tracking control for uncertain nonlinear systems in the event of external disturbances, actuator faults and input saturation. In order to guarantee the transient and steady-state control performance, the prescribed performance function is employed to impose the anticipant performance criterion on the output tracking error. By using the error transformation, the original inequality error constraint is converted to an unconstrained issue. For the conversion systems, the negative effect resulting from the external disturbances is restrained via the adaptive control approach. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is adopted to handle the unknown nonlinear functions. The Nussbaum gain technique is utilised to deal with the nonlinear terms arising from the actuator faults and input saturation. Combining with the backstepping control strategy, an adaptive neural fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme is developed for the uncertain nonlinear systems. It is rigorously proved that the proposed controller is capable of ensuring the boundness of all closed-loop signals as well as the specified tracking performance. Simulation results on two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented control approach.},

In this paper, a novel notion of fuzzy random variable was proposed to model fuzziness and randomness in a statistical procedure. For this purpose, a frequently used family of probability distributions called location and scale were first employed as the origin of randomness. Then, α -values of fuzzy numbers were combined with randomness to describe the fuzziness in the nature of the processes to produce a new concept of fuzzy random variable called location and scale fuzzy random variables. Then, some essential statistical features of the proposed fuzzy random variables including fuzzy cumulative distribution function, fuzzy expectation, exact variance and imprecise probability of an interval were discussed. The classical method of moment estimator was also developed to estimate the location and scale parameters. The developed technique was illustrated via several numerical evaluations. As an real-life application of the proposed fuzzy random variable, the reliability functions of k -out-of- n system and some reliability evaluation criteria were introduced and interpreted. Some numerical examples were also presented to illustrate the calculation of the proposed fuzzy system reliability criteria.},

The existence of both two kinds of uncertainties makes it difficult to directly apply traditional recursive identification methods based on parametric systems. In this paper, first, an improved information concentration (IC) estimator is introduced for estimating unknown parameters of parametric uncertainty part by using historical data, and an adaptive sliding mode controller based on the proposed IC estimator is investigated for the speed control system of a robot arm. Second, the stability of adaptive sliding mode control based on the proposed IC estimator for the speed control system of a robot arm is analysed. Finally, two simulation examples are carried out.

For the nonlinear and coupling dynamic, unmodeled uncertainties and external disturbances, an effective linear extended state observer is designed to estimate them. Then, the overall quadrotor system is divided into two subsystems: translational subsystem and rotational subsystem. For the rotational subsystem, the attitude controller is designed with a dual-loop integral sliding mode control method, and the designed controller is able to track the desired attitudes and angular velocities simultaneously. For the translational subsystem, a globally asymptotic stability position controller based on the hyperbolic functions is designed, and the application of hyperbolic functions can provide a bounded and smooth control input. In the end, both simulation and experiment results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the designed control strategy.},

The main contributions are twofold. First, when the state variables can be obtained exactly, necessary and sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the existence of the strategies. Second, the optimal LQG controller in terms of three decoupled equations (two Riccati equations and one Lyapunov equation) is obtained. The key technique is to apply the Stackelberg game approach by treating the disturbance as the follower and the control input as the leader respectively.

To save the resource of bandwidth limited network, a dynamic event-triggered scheme is proposed. The technique of redundant channels is employed to improve the successful rate of the communication network, which are modelled as two mutually independent Bernoulli-distributed random variables. A hidden Markov model is proposed to formulate the asynchronisation phenomena between the system modes and the controller modes, which results in the fact that the closed-loop system is a singular hidden Markov jump system. The criteria of regular, causal and stochastically stable with a certain H ∞ performance for the closed-loop system are obtained. The co-design of asynchronous controllers and the dynamic event-triggered scheme is proposed in terms of a group of feasible linear matrix inequalities.

A new discontinuous protocol, which combines a singular communication function with a weighted sum of sign functions of the relative velocities among agents, is proposed to guarantee that the agents can attract and repel with each other. Since the communication weight is singular, the existence and uniqueness theorem cannot be applied directly. However, by imposing some suitable conditions on the initial states and using the skill of the proof by contradiction, the existence of the global smooth solution is obtained. Furthermore, employing a finite time stability theory and constructing a Lyapunov function ingeniously, a flocking with least distance for the multi-agent system is acquired within a finite-time. Moreover, the bound of settling time can be estimated by the parameters and the initial states and this relationship show that the more the number of particles, the larger the bound of convergence time.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a method to actively reject aperiodic disturbances and to suppress uncertainties in a modified repetitive-control (RC) system, based on an equivalent-input-disturbance (EID) approach. The influences of aperiodic disturbances and uncertainties on the input channel are estimated by an EID estimates and then rejected by incorporating the estimation into a repetitive control law. First, how to construct an EID-based modified repetitive-control system is described, in which a correction is introduced to the amount of the delay of the repetitive controller to enhance the steady-state tracking performance. Next, a linear-matrix-inequality-(LMI)-based stability criterion is derived by employing the Lyapunov functional method. Two tuning parameters introduced in the LMI can manipulate the preferential adjustment of the robust stability and learning efficiency and thus improve both transient and steady-state performances. Then, an optimisation algorithm is presented to produce optimal controller gains. Finally, simulations exhibit the design procedure in detail, and the superiority of the proposed method in this paper is demonstrated through comparisons with some conventional RC and H ∞ RC methods.},

  abstract     = {We address a solution of the sensorless high-speed tracking control problem for surface-mount permanent magnet synchronous motors under load torque variations. Since the only available measurements are the stator currents, the proposed scheme consists of a second-order sliding-mode observer interconnected with an ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ controller. Thus, disregarding the use of additional sensors to measure the mechanical variables. The observer-controller interconnection is robust against uncertainties and unknown load torque variations. First, the observer estimates rotor angular position and speed variables, theoretically, in finite-time. Then, an H ∞ controller attenuates the effects of uniformly bounded disturbances. Sufficient conditions are provided to ensure that the closed-loop system is stable. Moreover, it is internally asymptotically stable in the absence of uncertainties and external disturbances. The analysis shows that the observer-controller system possesses an L 2 -gain less than a priori given disturbance attenuation level. Emulation trials showed the feasibility of the method.},

Based on the networked predictive control systems, an adaptive event-triggered dynamic output predictive control strategy is presented. And a networked delay compensator method is employed to compensate the communication delay actively. Furthermore, the problem we addressed can be transformed into the delay-dependent stability and stabilisation problem of networked control systems. Finally, the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality method are introduced to solve the expected solution. Both the results of numerical simulations and experiment are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problems of stabilisation and ℋ ∞ H ∞ H∞ control are addressed for switched port-controlled Hamiltonian (SPCH) systems with unstable modes and actuator saturation (AS) via energy-based multiple Lyapunov functions methods. Firstly, by a switching state feedback controller with truncation-inequality techniques, the considered system is transformed into an unforced SPCH system with asymptotically stable, stable and unstable modes. Then, by developing an alternative switching law with slow/fast mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) switching scheme, new sufficient conditions are obtained for stabilisation of the SPCH system. Secondly, by designing a new switching H ∞ feedback controller, revealing the characteristics of alternative switching signals and defining an indicative function, a new criterion for H ∞ control of the SPCH systems with unstable modes and AS is achieved via the slow/fast MDADT switching scheme. Moreover, based on the obtained results and the indicative function, H ∞ control conditions for the corresponding SPCH system are also derived under a slow MDADT switching scheme and a traditional average dwell time scheme, respectively. Finally, some numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},
