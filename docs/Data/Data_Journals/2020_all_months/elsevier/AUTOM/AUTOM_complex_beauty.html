  abstract     = {This article introduces the Tensor Network B-spline (TNBS) model for the regularized identification of nonlinear systems using a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) approach. Tensor network theory is used to alleviate the curse of dimensionality of multivariate B-splines by representing the high-dimensional weight tensor as a low-rank approximation. An iterative algorithm based on the alternating linear scheme is developed to directly estimate the low-rank tensor network approximation, removing the need to ever explicitly construct the exponentially large weight tensor. This reduces the computational and storage complexity significantly, allowing the identification of NARX systems with a large number of inputs and lags. The proposed algorithm is numerically stable, robust to noise, guaranteed to monotonically converge, and allows the straightforward incorporation of regularization. The TNBS-NARX model is validated through the identification of the cascaded watertank benchmark nonlinear system, on which it achieves state-of-the-art performance while identifying a 16-dimensional B-spline surface in 4 s on a standard desktop computer. An open-source MATLAB implementation is available on GitHub.},

In the first piece, some local optimization controllers are designed for the agents such that each agent converges to its local cost function’s minimizer in the unified fixed time under an arbitrary initial state. In the second piece, based on state information transmissions between neighboring agents and the local cost functions’ Hessian matrices, some distributed optimization controllers are developed for the agents such that they converge to the global cost function’s minimizer together in fixed time. Under the proposed algorithm, all the agents reach the global cost function’s minimizer in fixed time. Moreover, this fixed settling time is independent of the agents’ initial states and it can be predetermined according to the task demands. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed distributed fixed-time optimization algorithm.},

Cooperative agents in the network can potentially be influenced by uncooperative neighbors, who are knowledgeable, anonymous and able to spread misinformation. We formulate the resilient constrained consensus problem for high-dimensional multi-agent systems. A projection based resilient constrained consensus protocol is presented so that the agent’s state will be pushed back to the constraint set when it approaches the boundary. We show that resilient constrained consensus can be reached for robust networks when the constraint sets are convex and share a non-empty overlap. The proposed algorithm is of low complexity, purely distributed, and can be performed in tandem with a max-consensus process to estimate the allowed number of uncooperative neighbors.},

  abstract     = {We study stability of linear systems with fast almost periodic coefficients that are piecewise-continuous in time. The classical averaging method guarantees the stability of such systems for small enough values of parameter provided the corresponding averaged system is stable. However, it is difficult to find an upper bound on the small parameter by using classical tools for asymptotic analysis. In this paper we introduce an efficient constructive method for finding an upper bound on the value of the small parameter that guarantees a desired exponential decay rate. We transform the system into a model with time-delays of the length of the small parameter. The resulting time-delay system is a perturbation of the averaged system. The averaged system is supposed to be exponentially stable. The stability of the time-delay system guarantees the stability of the original one. We construct an appropriate Lyapunov functional for finding sufficient stability conditions in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The upper bound on the small parameter that preserves the exponential stability is found from the LMIs. Two numerical examples (stabilization by vibrational control and by time-dependent switching) illustrate the efficiency of the method. Moreover, we apply the time-delay approach to persistently excited systems that leads to a novel quadratic time-independent Lyapunov functional for such systems. We further extend our method to input-to-state stability (ISS) analysis. Finally the results are extended to linear fast-varying systems with time-varying delays.},

Each local operator is only privately accessible to each agent, and all agents constitute a network. To seek a fixed point of the global operator, it is indispensable for agents to exchange local information and update their solution cooperatively. To solve the problem, two algorithms are developed, called distributed Krasnosel’skiĭ–Mann (D-KM) and distributed block-coordinate Krasnosel’skiĭ–Mann (D-BKM) iterations, for which D-BKM is a block-coordinate version of D-KM in the sense of randomly choosing and computing only one block-coordinate of local operators at each time for each agent. It is shown that the proposed two algorithms can both converge weakly to a fixed point of the global operator. Meanwhile, the designed algorithms are applied to recover the classical distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithm, devise a new block-coordinate DGD algorithm, handle a distributed shortest distance problem in the Hilbert space for the first time, and solve linear algebraic equations in a novel distributed approach. Finally, the theoretical results are corroborated by a few numerical examples.},

We propose a method which is applicable to boundary or non-local sensing together with non-local actuation, or to Dirichlet actuation with non-local sensing. We use a modal decomposition approach. The dimension of the controller, N 0 , is equal to the number of modes which decay slower than a given decay rate δ &gt; 0 . The observer may have a larger dimension N ≥ N 0 . The observer and controller gains are found separately by solving N 0 × N 0 -dimensional Lyapunov inequalities. We suggest a direct Lyapunov approach to the full-order closed-loop system and provide linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for finding N and the exponential decay rate of the closed-loop system. We prove that the LMIs are always feasible for large enough N . The proposed method is different from existing qualitative methods that do not give easily verifiable and efficient bounds on the observer-based controller dimension and the resulting closed-loop performance. Numerical examples demonstrate that our LMI conditions lead to non-conservative bounds on N and the resulting decay rate.},

The proposed controller protects the individual privacy by imposing random noises upon the interactive information. Based on the stochastic approximation method, we employ a series of time-varying control gains to relax the existing mechanisms which require the privacy noises to be exponentially decaying with time. Using non-decaying privacy noises, the delivered information can keep random with an invariant variance, and the real information cannot be directly exposed to the eavesdropper along with time. We further develop a method to design the control gain such that the heterogeneous systems can achieve asymptotically unbiased output average consensus with the desired accuracy and meet the predefined differential privacy index.

Furthermore, we provide Lyapunov and converse Lyapunov theorems for finite-time stability of discrete autonomous systems involving scalar difference fractional inequalities and minimum operators. In addition, lower semicontinuity of the settling-time function capturing the finite settling time behavior of the dynamical system is studied and illustrated through several examples. In particular, it is shown that the regularity properties of the Lyapunov function and those of the settling-time function are related. Consequently, converse Lyapunov theorems for finite time stability of discrete-time systems can only assure the existence of lower semicontinuous Lyapunov functions.},

Most relevant results in the literature have two main restrictions: R1) some constraints need to be imposed on powers and growth conditions have to be established for the nonlinear functions of the system; R2) nonlinear bounding functions must be derived based on repeated derivations of virtual control variables during the design process. By integrating an improved technique of adding a power integrator with a dynamic surface control (DSC) method, we develop a systematic tracking control scheme that eliminates both of the above restrictions. Moreover, with an improved time-varying nonlinear transformed function introduced for high-order systems, the proposed scheme can be regarded as a unified tool in the sense that it works no matter whether the constraint is symmetric, asymmetric, or even without a constraint. The above results are also extended to systems with uncertain gain functions, and the proposed scheme estimates only one adaptive parameter. The simulation results of two deterministic practical applications show that the proposed control scheme is effective not only for high-order systems, but also for high-order-free systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of finding optimal output feedback strategies for solving linear differential zero-sum games using a model-free approach based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). In contrast to their discrete-time counterparts, differential games involve continuous-time dynamics and existing ADP approaches to their solutions require access to full measurement of the internal state. This difficulty is due to the fact that direct translation of the discrete-time output feedback ADP results requires derivatives of the input and output measurements, which is generally prohibitive in practice. This work aims to overcome this difficulty and presents a new embedded filtering based observer approach towards designing output feedback ADP algorithms for solving the differential zero-sum game problem. Two output feedback ADP algorithms based respectively on policy iteration and value iteration are developed. The proposed scheme is completely online in nature and works without requiring information of the system dynamics. In addition, this work also addresses the excitation bias problem encountered in output feedback ADP methods, which typically requires a discounting factor for its mitigation. We show that the proposed scheme is bias-free, and therefore, does not require a discounting factor. It is shown that the proposed algorithms converge to the solution obtained by solving the game algebraic Riccati equation. Two numerical examples are demonstrated to validate the proposed scheme.},

However, in the presence of partial unknown input, the corresponding system identification problem turns out to be challenging and sometimes unidentifiable. This paper provides the identifiability conditions in terms of the structural properties of the state–space model and presents an identification method which successively estimates the system states and the affinely parameterized system matrices. The estimation of the system matrices boils down to solving a bilinear optimization problem, which is reformulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problem and handled by the sequential convex programming method. The effectiveness of the proposed identification method is demonstrated numerically by comparing with the Gauss–Newton method and the sequential quadratic programming method.},

This paper derives an asynchronous distributed voltage control strategy based on the partial primal–dual gradient algorithm, where both active and reactive power of DERs are considered. Different types of asynchrony due to imperfect communication or other practical limits, such as random time delays and non-identical sampling/computation rates, are fitted into a unified analytic framework. The proposed asynchronous algorithm is then converted into a fixed-point problem by leveraging the operator splitting method, which leads to the convergence proof. Moreover, an online implementation method is introduced to make the controller adjustable to time-varying environments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out on a rudimentary 8-bus and the IEEE-123 bus system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By introducing the modification signals into the user-specified performance functions, we propose a flexible performance-based control scheme, featuring the capability of avoiding the violation of the resulted modified performance functions (MPFs) due to the input saturation. These modification signals are associated with input saturation errors (the errors between the actual and desired control inputs) and generated by a novel auxiliary system in which all the states are guaranteed to be nonnegative. Consequently, the MPF can degrade the user-specified tracking performance when saturation happens and can recover it when no saturation occurs. Furthermore, the disturbance observer is utilized to estimate external disturbances and relieve the burden on the selection of control gains. With the developed control scheme, it is theoretically shown that the output can always track the reference signal and satisfy the constraints of the MPFs. Finally, the numerical simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

In this paper, we complete this design by introducing an adaptive unit tuning the regulator online by employing system identification algorithms selecting the “best” parameters according to a certain optimization policy. Instead of focusing on a single identification scheme, we give general conditions under which an algorithm may be used in the framework, and we develop a particular least-squares identifier satisfying these requirements. Closed-loop stability results are given, and it is shown that the asymptotic regulation error is related to the prediction capabilities of the identifier evaluated along the ideal error-zeroing steady-state trajectories.},

The paper starts by considering the impulse response of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition for establishing upper bounds of the sought peak is proposed by embedding the trajectory onto the level set of a polynomial and by introducing a projection technique for evaluating the extension of this set. This condition is sufficient for any degree of the polynomial, which has to be chosen a priori, and is also necessary whenever this degree is large enough. Hence, the proposed methodology is extended to address the impulse response of polytopic linear time-varying (LTV) systems, in particular, linear systems affected linearly by structured time-varying uncertainty constrained into a polytope. Lastly, generalizations to various responses and specializations to some structures are also presented. As shown by several examples, which include randomly generated systems and physical systems, the proposed conditions may provide significantly less conservative results than the existing LMI methods.},

  abstract     = {An aggregative game involving double-integrator agents is investigated. In this game, the dynamics of all players are subjected to unknown time-varying disturbances and unmodeled terms, and are also influenced by networked attacks on the communication topology. To seek a Nash equilibrium for such games, a novel distributed robust Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm is proposed and the complete closed-loop system is modeled as a hybrid system using an average dwell-time automaton and a time-ratio monitor to constrain attacks. Then, to analyze stability for the proposed algorithm, a Lyapunov function is constructed and uniform asymptotic stability is obtained under a local Lipschitz assumption on the gradients of the payoff functions. In addition, global uniform asymptotic stability is obtained under a global Lipschitz assumption on the gradients. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the results.},

Based on this observation, we introduce several constructive algorithms which enable us to associate a transfer function matrix to a switched linear system given in general form. The strict positive realness test of the resulting transfer function matrix can be easily achieved by available known algebraic conditions.

  abstract     = {In multiagent dynamical systems, privacy protection corresponds to avoid disclosing the initial states of the agents while accomplishing a distributed task. The system-theoretic framework described in this paper for this scope, denoted dynamical privacy, relies on introducing output maps which act as masks, rendering the internal states of an agent indiscernible by the other agents. Our output masks are local (i.e., decided independently by each agent), time-varying functions asymptotically converging to the true states. The resulting masked system is also time-varying, and has the original unmasked system as its limit system. It is shown that dynamical privacy is not compatible with the existence of equilibria. Nevertheless the masked system retains the same convergence properties of the original system: the equilibria of the original systems become attractors for the masked system but lose the stability property. Application of dynamical privacy to popular examples of multiagent dynamics, such as models of social opinions, average consensus and synchronization, is investigated in detail.},

For linear and nonlinear systems, a learning method is presented that makes use of basic analytic properties of the cost function and is proven to learn the MPC control law and the value function on the limit set of the closed-loop state trajectory. The main idea is to generate a smart warm start based on historical data that improves future data points and thus future warm starts. We show that these warm starts are asymptotically exact and converge to the solution of the MPC optimization problem. Thereby, the suboptimality of the applied control input resulting from the real-time requirements vanishes over time. Numerical examples show that existing real-time MPC schemes can be improved by storing optimization data and using the proposed learning scheme.},

Two event-triggered attitude consensus protocols are designed under the absolute attitude and relative attitude measurement, respectively. For the first case, the gnomonic projection is utilized to project the attitude to the Euclidean plane almost globally. Then, a distributed attitude consensus protocol based on the projections is proposed under the event-triggered mechanism. By using the proposed protocol and event-triggered condition (ETC), the almost global attitude consensus is achieved on a positively invariant set. Next, in order to remove the requirement of the absolute attitude information, we propose an event-triggered attitude protocol with relative attitude measurements. The Riemannian gradient descent approach is utilized to design the attitude consensus protocol on a geodesically convex set of attitude configuration space. Moreover, to overcome the continuous monitoring in the event-detection, a self-triggered strategy is presented based on the event-triggered protocol only with the relative attitude measurement. Finally, simulation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},

Without state constraints, the optimal control of the multiple integrator with only input saturation is well solved in classic optimal control theory. However, if state constraints are considered, it is still challenging to obtain a global time optimal analytical solution for multiple integrator systems with even higher than second order, e.g., a double integrator plant. In this paper, the global time optimal control law for triple integrator with input saturation and full state constraints is considered. The system has a serial structure of three integral elements, while the control input and system states are within box constraints. A bang-singular-bang time optimal control law is synthesized according to Pontryagin minimum principle. Then, costates and jump conditions are analyzed in detail. Based on Bellman’s principle of optimality, switching surfaces and curves in phase space are obtained through dynamic programming method. The time optimal control law is then obtained in analytical state feedback form, and its global convergence property is proved. Through the comparison with numerical solutions, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified. The proposed scheme will be useful for trajectory planning under input saturation and full state constraints in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Suitable continuity and boundedness assumptions on the function f defining the dynamics of a time-varying nonimpulsive system with inputs are known to make the system inherit stability properties from the zero-input system. Whether this type of robustness holds or not for impulsive systems was still an open question. By means of suitable (counter)examples, we show that such stability robustness with respect to the inclusion of inputs cannot hold in general, not even for impulsive systems with time-invariant flow and jump maps. In particular, we show that zero-input global uniform asymptotic stability (0-GUAS) does not imply converging input converging state (CICS), and that 0-GUAS and uniform bounded-energy input bounded state (UBEBS) do not imply integral input-to-state stability (iISS). We also comment on available existing results that, however, show that suitable constraints on the allowed impulse–time sequences indeed make some of these robustness properties possible.},

  abstract     = {Many vehicle control systems depend on the body sideslip angle, but robust and cost-effective direct measurement of this angle is yet to be achieved for production vehicles. Estimation from indirect measurements is thus the only viable option. In the paper, a sideslip estimator is obtained through the identification of a linear parameter varying (LPV) model. Although inspired by physical insights into the vehicle lateral dynamics, the structure of the LPV estimator is not parametrized beforehand. Instead, the estimator is learned by means of a state-of-the-art non-parametric method for linear parameter varying identification, namely least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). Its performance is assessed over an extensive and heterogeneous set of experimental data, showing the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.},

  abstract     = {A technique of linearizing what we call expectation-based inequality conditions is proposed for control of discrete-time linear systems with stochastic dynamics. In particular, the coefficient random matrices of the systems are assumed to be represented with random polytopes, and the linearization technique is discussed so as to appropriately deal with associated uncertainties. Our expectation-based inequality is an inequality that involves decision variables contained in the expectation operation, and has a unique difficulty in direct linearization, in general. Hence, two key lemmas are provided so that the decision variables can be taken out from the expectation operation. The combinational use of such lemmas and the conventional linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, which is nothing but our linearization technique, is expected to be useful for transforming various kinds of expectation-based nonlinear inequality into numerically solvable standard LMIs. As a demonstration, new robust stability conditions are derived with the technique, whose effectiveness is confirmed numerically.},

  abstract     = {New methods are developed for the stabilization of a linear system with general time-varying distributed delays existing at the system’s states, inputs and outputs. In contrast to most existing literature where the function of time-varying delay is continuous and bounded, we assume it to be bounded and measurable. Furthermore, the distributed delay kernels can be any square-integrable function over a bounded interval, where the kernels are handled directly by using a decomposition scenario without using approximations. By constructing a Krasovskiĭ functional via the application of a novel integral inequality, sufficient conditions for the existence of a dissipative state feedback controller are derived in terms of matrix inequalities without utilizing the existing reciprocally convex combination lemmas. The proposed synthesis (stability) conditions, which take dissipativity into account, can be either solved directly by a standard numerical solver of semidefinite programming if they are convex, or reshaped into linear matrix inequalities, or solved via a proposed iterative algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, no existing methods can handle the synthesis problem investigated in this paper. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.},

  abstract     = {This study considers the problem of periodic event-triggered (PET) cooperative output regulation for a class of linear multi-agent systems. The advantage of the PET output regulation is that the data transmission and triggered condition are only needed to be monitored at discrete sampling instants. It is assumed that only a small number of agents can have access to the system matrix and states of the leader. Meanwhile, the PET mechanism is considered not only in the communication between various agents, but also in the sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator transmission channels for each agent. The above problem set-up will bring some challenges to the controller design and stability analysis. Based on a novel PET distributed observer, a PET dynamic output feedback control method is developed for each follower. Compared with the existing works, our method can naturally exclude the Zeno behavior, and the inter-event time becomes multiples of the sampling period. Furthermore, for every follower, the minimum inter-event time can be determined a prior , and computed directly without the knowledge of the leader information. An example is given to verify and illustrate the effectiveness of the new design scheme.},

In the approximated function space, uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) condition for the weights of the general multi-layer NNs weights is obtained.

Considering the coupling between priority assignment and control, this paper presents a method to co-design priority assignments and control laws for each control system, which aims to minimize the overall performance degradation caused by contentions. The co-design problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem with a very large search space, rendering difficulty in computing the optimal solution. To solve the problem, we develop a novel contention-resolving model predictive control method to dynamically assign priorities and compute an optimal control. The priority assignment can be determined using a sample-based approach without excessive demand on computing resources, and optimal controls can be computed iteratively following the order of the assigned priorities. We apply the proposed contention-resolving model predictive control to co-design scheduling and controls in networked control systems.

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen several new directions in the design of sparse control of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) driven by the objective of reducing communication costs. One common assumption made in these designs is that the communication happens over a dedicated network. For many practical applications, however, communication must occur over shared networks, leading to two critical design challenges, namely — time-delays in the feedback and fair sharing of bandwidth among users. In this paper, we present a set of sparse H 2 control designs under these two design constraints. An essential aspect of our design is that the delay itself can be a function of sparsity, which leads to an interesting pattern of trade-offs in the H 2 performance. We present three distinct algorithms. The first algorithm preconditions the assignable bandwidth to the network and produces an initial guess for a stabilizing controller. This is followed by our second algorithm, which sparsifies this controller while simultaneously adapting the feedback delay and optimizing the H 2 performance using alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM). The third algorithm extends this approach to a multiple user scenario where an optimal number of communication links, whose total sum is fixed, is distributed fairly among users by minimizing the variance of their H 2 performances. The problem is cast as a difference-of-convex (DC) program with mixed-integer linear program (MILP) constraints. We provide theorems to prove the convergence of these algorithms, followed by validation through numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Techniques known as Nonlinear Set Membership prediction or Lipschitz Interpolation are approaches to supervised machine learning that utilise presupposed Lipschitz properties to perform inference over unobserved function values. Provided a bound on the true best Lipschitz constant of the target function is known a priori, they offer convergence guarantees, as well as bounds around the predictions. Considering a more general setting that builds on Lipschitz continuity, we propose an online method for estimating the Lipschitz constant online from function value observations that are possibly corrupted by bounded noise. Utilising this as a data-dependent hyper-parameter gives rise to a nonparametric machine learning method, for which we establish strong universal approximation guarantees. That is, we show that our prediction rule can learn any continuous function on compact support in the limit of increasingly dense data, up to a worst-case error that can be bounded by the level of observational error. We also consider applications of our nonparametric regression method to learning-based control. For a class of discrete-time settings, we establish convergence guarantees on the closed-loop tracking error of our online learning-based controllers. To provide evidence that our method can be beneficial not only in theory but also in practice, we apply it in the context of nonparametric model-reference adaptive control (MRAC) . Across a range of simulated aircraft roll-dynamics and performance metrics our approach outperforms recently proposed alternatives that were based on Gaussian processes and RBF-neural networks .},

  abstract     = {A method is presented to estimate the region of attraction (ROA) of stochastic systems with finite second moment and uncertainty-dependent equilibria. The approach employs Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansions to represent the stochastic system by a higher-dimensional set of deterministic equations. We first show how the equilibrium point of the deterministic formulation provides the stochastic moments of an uncertainty-dependent equilibrium point of the stochastic system. A connection between the boundedness of the moments of the stochastic system and the Lyapunov stability of its PC expansion is then derived. Defining corresponding notions of a ROA for both system representations, we show how this connection can be leveraged to recover an estimate of the ROA of the stochastic system from the ROA of the PC expanded system. Two optimization programs, obtained from sum-of-squares programming techniques, are provided to compute inner estimates of the ROA. The first optimization program uses the Lyapunov stability arguments to return an estimate of the ROA of the PC expansion. Based on this result and user specifications on the moments for the initial conditions, the second one employs the shown connection to provide the corresponding ROA of the stochastic system. The method is demonstrated by two examples.},

The shaper robustness in terms of zeroed or upper-bounded residual vibration function for the modes to be precompensated is imposed via the equality and inequality constraints. As the main result, an additional degree of freedom in the shaper design is introduced via parametrization of the quadratic form cost matrix and utilized to modulate the amplitude frequency response over a given frequency range. In particular, this allows to embed the high-frequency roll-off to the shaper and improve its insensitivity to modelling errors by adjusting its stop-band response. The proposed shaper design is demonstrated and experimentally validated on a problem of positioning a flexible manipulator arm with multiple oscillatory modes.},

By using Pontryagin’s maximum principle and analyzing the necessary conditions for state inequality constraints, the geometric properties of the shortest bounded-curvature paths are established. These geometric properties not only allow restricting the shortest bounded-curvature path within a sufficient family of 26 candidates but also enable us to devise a completely analytic solution for finding the candidate path. As a consequence, the shortest bounded-curvature path can be computed in a constant time by checking the path lengths of these 26 candidates. Finally, numerical examples validate the developments in the paper and highlight its importance in addressing some Dubins Traveling Salesman Problems with Neighborhoods.},

We show that this problem can be decomposed into an unconstrained optimization problem with the same cost function as the original problem and a constrained optimization problem with a modified cost function and dynamics that have been precompensated according to the solution of the unconstrained problem. In the case of linear systems subject to a quadratic cost, the unconstrained problem has the familiar LQR solution and the constrained problem reduces to a minimum-norm projection. This implies that solving linear MPC problems is equivalent to precompensating a system using LQR and applying MPC to penalize only the control input. We propose to call this a constraint-separation principle and discuss the utility of both constraint separation and general decomposition in the design of MPC schemes and the development of numerical solvers for MPC problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses tracking problems of 2nd-order single-input, single-output nonlinear plants via proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers. A new design scheme of PID controllers based on adaptive updating rules and data-driven (DD) techniques is presented. First, with the help of dynamic linearization models, a new adaptive PID control rule is proposed. A rigorous Lyapunov-based proof of stability is provided to ensure the convergence of tracking errors when the initial states belong to a compact set. Subsequently, the relationship between stability regions and reference signals is analyzed. Based on this relationship, a new DD PID control algorithm with adaptive updating rules is proposed to improve the stability regions by invoking historical data. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {As a recursive state estimation algorithm, the Kalman filter (KF) assumes initial state distribution is known a priori , while in practice the initial distribution is commonly treated as design parameters. In this paper, we will answer three questions concerning initialization: (1) At each time step, how does the KF respond to measurements, control signals, and more importantly, initial states? (2) What is the price (in terms of accuracy) one has to pay if inaccurate initial states are used? and (3) Can we find a better strategy rather than through guessing to improve the performance of KF in the initial estimation phase when the initial condition is unknown? To these ends, the classical recursive KF is first transformed into an equivalent but batch form, from which the responses of the KF to measurements, control signal, and initial state can be clearly separated and observed. Based on this, we isolate the initial distribution by dividing the original state into two parts and reconstructing a new state-space model. An initialization algorithm is then proposed by employing the Bayesian inference technique to estimate all the unknown variables simultaneously. By analyzing its performance, an improved version is further developed. Two simulation examples demonstrate that the proposed initialization approaches can be considered as competitive alternatives of various existing initialization methods when initial condition is unknown.},

As the inherent property of geometric similarity, the proposed formation has the adaptability of similarity transformations, including translation, rotation and scaling, which provides great flexibility of formation control. To describe the expected formation shape mathematically, three different approaches with two different geometric variables are proposed, and the corresponding conditions of uniquely determining the formation shape are derived. The distributed formation control laws with different kinds of similarity constraints are designed to make the formation locally converge to the desired formation shape with desired orientation and scale. Simulations demonstrate the validity of the approaches of defining similarity-based formation and the effectiveness of formation control laws.},

We utilize the pseudo-random number as a watermarking to encrypt and decrypt the data transmitted through the wireless network. Via the proposed method, the transmitted data in the normal operation can be recovered. Since the data modified by the attacker can be marked with the watermarking, the χ 2 detector is capable of detecting the attack. For three different attack scenarios, we analyze the evolution of the remote estimation error covariances and the detection performance, respectively. In the sense of minimizing the estimation error covariance, the optimal parameter set of the watermarking is derived. Furthermore, the proposed method can even be extended to detect the false data injection attack and the replay attack. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the derived results.},

By incorporating the lower bounds of virtual control coefficients into the barrier Lyapunov functions (BLFs), two adaptive backstepping control design schemes are proposed based on tuning function method, bound estimation approach and some smooth functions, which makes the controller powerful enough to compensate the unknown virtual control coefficients and parametric uncertainties. We also show that the overall control strategy achieves three objectives on system performance: (a) the asymptotic convergence with zero tracking error is ensured; (b) all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded; and (c) the full-state constraints are not violated for all the time.

In this paper, we present a collection of cloud-aided consensus-based Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) estimators. The approaches are tailored to handle linear and nonlinear consensus constraints and limitations on parameter ranges. All the methods are designed so that raw measurements collected at the device level are processed by the device itself, requiring minimal changes to (possibly pre-existing) RLS estimators.

A continuous adaptive controller is constructed by utilizing a new barrier function and a serial of nonnegative integral functions equipped with sign functions, which guarantees that the output is restricted in a prescribed region and the state converges to zero in a faster speed compared to some traditional finite-time stabilizers. Unlike some existing control schemes developed for systems with the output constraint, the proposed method unifies finite-time control design in dealing with both constrained and unconstrained systems for the first time by taking the structure of the high-order system into consideration.

  abstract     = {This paper presents several observer-based detection and identification strategies to characterize sensor attacks for descriptor type cyber–physical systems (CPSs). In contrast to recent works we do not consider state estimators relying on centralized paradigms, but propose distributed and decentralized state estimators to characterize sensor attacks. We also show a set of sufficient conditions to ensure exponential convergence of the estimation errors in the absence of malicious attacks, along with a bound on the convergence rates. We then design algorithms to solve the attack detection and identification problem for a large-scale CPS. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are performed on the IEEE-6 and 118 bus power systems.},

The measurement, which is one internal point of the state of the wave equation, is fluxed into the compensator while the output of the compensator is forced into the boundary of the wave equation. The well-posedness of the closed-loop system is proved by using the semigroup method. By choosing appropriate controller parameters and adopting Nyquist criterion for distributed parameter systems, the eigenvalues of the closed-loop systems are shown to be inside the left-half complex plane. Then the closed-loop system is proved to be exponentially stable by using the Riesz basis approach. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed compensator.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose the design of event-triggered sliding mode control (SMC) for a high-order system via a reduced-order model based design. It comprises a triggering mechanism with a reduced-order state vector and a controller based on a reduced-order model which stabilizes the (high-order) plant against perturbation. Apart from its low order synthesis of the controller, the proposed technique possesses many other advantages. The important one is the sampling pattern, which could be sparser by the use of a reduced-order vector in the event condition than with a full vector itself. This observation comes from the fact that the triggering instants explicitly depend on the state vector and its behavior over time, and thereby relaxing a few components of the state vector in the triggering mechanism may decrease its rate of the violation. Another significant outcome of this strategy is that the transmission of the reduced-order vector, particularly in a network-based implementation can outperform the full-order based design owing to the severe challenges that persistently occur in the data network. The event-triggered SMC is considered to achieve a robust performance for the closed-loop system. We show that our proposal guarantees the stability of the full-order plant with the reduced-order triggering mechanism, which does not admit a triggering sequence with Zeno behavior. The simulation results are given for a practical example to illustrate the performance and benefits of the proposed method.},

First, a sparse parameter identification algorithm is introduced based on L 2 norm with L 1 regularization, where the adaptive weights are adopted in the optimization variables of L 1 term. Second, estimates generated by the algorithm are shown to have both set and parameter convergence. That is, sets of the zero and nonzero elements in the parameter θ can be correctly identified with probability one using a finite number of observations, and further estimates of the nonzero elements converge to the true values almost surely. Third, it is shown that the results are applicable to a large number of applications, including variable selection, open-loop identification, and closed-loop control of stochastic systems.

  abstract     = {For nonlinear estimation, the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator using the original measurement is the best of all estimators linear in the measurement. Recently, it has been proven that an LMMSE estimator using a stacked measurement vector composed of the original measurement and its nonlinear conversion (transformation or function) outperforms the original LMMSE estimator. However, to find an optimal conversion for various nonlinear problems is very difficult, because it involves functional optimization. Recognizing that the conversion affects estimation performance only through conversion-dependent quantities needed by the augmented LMMSE-based estimator, this paper proposes an optimized conversion-sample filter (OCF), which optimizes all these quantities to optimize estimation performance. These quantities are much easier to obtain than the optimal conversion itself. Using deterministic sampling, obtaining these quantities amounts to determining the converted values at both the deterministic sample points and the measurement value. In the OCF, these values are obtained optimally and analytically by solving a constrained Rayleigh quotient problem. The proposed OCF has a simple and analytical form and can be generally applied to nonlinear estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OCF compared with some popular nonlinear estimators, including several LMMSE-based filters, a recently-proposed uncorrelated conversion based filter, and a particle filter.},

We show that, exactly as in the case of zero feedthrough matrices, this solution maximizes the number of assignable eigenvalues of the closed-loop. Since in this framework we are allowing every feedthrough matrix to be nonzero, an issue of well-posedness of the feedback interconnection arises, which affects the way the solvability conditions are structured. We show, however, that the further solvability condition which originates from the problem of well-posedness is well-behaved in the case where we express such condition in terms of self bounded and self hidden subspaces.},

We show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not contractive, the Lipschitz constant and β -smoothness of the objective function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction error minimization.},

Based on the Kronecker canonical form (KCF) of a matrix pencil, some matrix rank based necessary and sufficient conditions are established respectively for the regularity and complete controllability/observability of the NDS, in which the associated matrix depends affinely on both subsystem parameters and subsystem connections. These conditions keep the property that all the involved numerical computations are performed on each subsystem independently, which is attractive in the analysis and synthesis of a large scale NDS.

Both the fir model parameter and the latent variables in the noise model are treated as parameters of our statistical model and moreover, the scale of the noise variance is treated as a hyper-parameter besides the hyper-parameters used to parameterize the priors of the impulse response and the latent variables. Then a variational expectation–maximization algorithm is proposed for inference of the parameters and hyper-parameters of the statistical model, and the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point. Monte Carlo numerical simulations show that when the relative size of outliers is small, the proposed approach performs comparably to a state-of-the-art method and when the relative size of outliers and/or the occurrence probability of outliers is large, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method.},

Adaptive distributed observer, reinforcement learning (RL) and output regulation techniques are integrated to compute an adaptive near-optimal tracker for each follower. First, under the output regulation theory, the cooperative adaptive optimal output regulation problem is decomposed into a feedforward control design problem which can be addressed by solving nonlinear regulator equations, and an adaptive optimal feedback control problem. Different from general adaptive optimal stabilization problem of nonlinear DT systems, the value function of the optimal output regulation problem is positive semidefinite. This paper analyzes the stability of the closed-loop system without relying on the Lyapunov stability theory and also proposes a policy iteration (PI) approach to approximate the value function with the convergence proof. Then, an adaptive distributed observer is designed for each follower so that they can estimate the state of the leader. A model-state-input structure is developed to find the solutions to regulator equations for each follower and a critic–actor structure is employed to solve the optimal feedback control problem using the measured data based on the neural network (NN) and RL. It is shown that using the estimate values, the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Our development gives rise to a sign projected gradient method employing only “coarse” information, which has finite-time convergence capability and preserves the simplicity and elegance of gradient descent. Our primary objective is to understand the design principle of the projection matrix in the nonsmooth setting and to investigate some key features of the method, such as convergence time. Specifically, we offer a set of convergence results via nonsmooth analysis, revealing that the algorithm guarantees finite-time convergence for a wide range of cost functions, including strongly convex, strictly convex, and convex functions, provided that the proposed design criteria and conditions are satisfied. The results suggest that the choice of the projection matrix might not be unique, which motivates the optimal design issue of the projection matrix to minimize convergence time. We show that the problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved readily by existing optimization tools. We discuss the possibility of employing the proposed method to solve unconstrained optimization problems, which in turn gives an initial feasible solution to the sign projected gradient flow. We apply the algorithm to solve a formation control problem, and the numerical results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

To guarantee the validity of the approximation, state variables in approximated unknown functions need to stay in a compact set. However, in most existing results, the existence of the compact set has not been correctly proven; therefore, the proof is not actually complete in these existing works. In this paper, we analyze the existence of compact sets for two typical nonlinear systems with novel neural network-based controllers and show the strict proof for the semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system.},

The sampling interval is allowed to be time-varying with known upper and lower bounds. A so-called component-based DETT scheme is adopted to determine the transmission instant at which an individual sensor sends the measurement to the estimator through certain communication network. Then, a time-varying MH estimator is designed with the corresponding estimation error dynamics characterized by a linear discrete time-varying system whose time-varying parts induced by the non-uniform sampling are modeled by certain norm bounded uncertainties. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the estimation error. Moreover, within the established theoretical framework, the desired estimator parameter is calculated by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed MH estimation method.},

If the optimal control history that transfers the system from an arbitrary initial state to the origin is known, either analytically or numerically, then the new results provide a method to solve the problem of minimum-time control between two arbitrary states and moreover, to find all of the extremal controlled trajectories. A criterion of existence is also given for the solution of the minimum-time control between two arbitrary states.

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to be a major component of the smart grid. The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on the existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs, thus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid. In this paper, a novel distributed control framework based on noncooperative game theory for routing of EVs within the smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to control and balance the electricity load in a distributed manner across the grid while taking into account the traffic congestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is formulated as a repeated game, and it is shown that the selfish behavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price of anarchy upper bounded by the ratio of the variance of the ground load to the total number of EVs in the grid. In particular, it is shown that any achieved Nash equilibrium substantially improves the load balance across the grid. Moreover, the results are extended to capture the stochastic nature of induced ground load as well as the subjective behavior of the EV owners using the behavioral framework of prospect theory. Simulation results provide new insights on efficient energy pricing at charging stations and under realistic grid conditions.},

An interpretation of the model admits a system of first-order hyperbolic (transport) PDEs with actuation at the boundary of one PDE. The unactuated second PDE exhibits recirculation phenomena. The recirculation coupling of these two PDEs gives rise to a stabilization problem with nonlocal terms that prior has not been considered. In this paper, we consider a general class of 2 × 2 hyperbolic PDEs where both the unactuated PDE and the actuated PDE have strict-feedback recirculation (from the outlet in the “upstream direction”). In addition, the state of the unactuated PDE feeds, in a non-local fashion, into the domain of the actuated PDE. We introduce a novel set of transformations through which we arrive at a simple target system with desirable exponential stability characteristics. A backstepping observer and output feedback controller design are also given for this 2 × 2 hyperbolic PDE system. We then apply our control design to the string-and-midway-antidamper application found in Guo and Jin and illustrate the result with simulations.},

After rewriting the time-delay dynamics as a transport PDE of which the left boundary connects with the sandwiched system, a state observer is built to estimate the states of the overall system of ODE-heterodirectional coupled hyperbolic PDEs–ODE–transport PDE using the right boundary state of the last transport PDE. An observer-based output-feedback controller acting at the first ODE is designed to stabilize the overall system using backstepping transformations and frequency-domain designs. The exponential stability results of the closed-loop system, boundedness and exponential convergence of the control input are proved. The obtained theoretical result is applied to control of a deepwater oil drilling construction vessel as a simulation case, where the simulation results show the proposed control design reduces cable oscillations and places the oil drilling equipment to be installed in the target area on the sea floor. Performance deterioration under extreme and unmodeled disturbances is also illustrated.},

In this work we prove that additive noise does not hinder stability of output-feedback PETC of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Then we build an STC strategy that estimates PETC’s worst-case triggering times. To accomplish this, we use set-based methods, more specifically ellipsoidal sets, which describe uncertainties on state, disturbances and noise. Ellipsoidal reachability is then used to predict worst-case triggering condition violations, ultimately determining the next communication time. The ellipsoidal state estimate is recursively updated using guaranteed state estimation (GSE) methods. The proposed STC is designed to be computationally tractable at the expense of some added conservatism. It is expected to be a practical STC implementation for a broad range of applications.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful kernelized methods for non-parametric regression used in many applications. However, their use is limited to a few thousand of training samples due to their cubic time complexity. In order to scale GPs to larger datasets, several sparse approximations based on so-called inducing points have been proposed in the literature. In this work we investigate the connection between a general class of sparse inducing point GP regression methods and Bayesian recursive estimation which enables Kalman Filter like updating for online learning. The majority of previous work has focused on the batch setting, in particular for learning the model parameters and the position of the inducing points, here instead we focus on training with mini-batches. By exploiting the Kalman filter formulation, we propose a novel approach that estimates such parameters by recursively propagating the analytical gradients of the posterior over mini-batches of the data. Compared to state of the art methods, our method keeps analytic updates for the mean and covariance of the posterior, thus reducing drastically the size of the optimization problem. We show that our method achieves faster convergence and superior performance compared to state of the art sequential Gaussian Process regression on synthetic GP as well as real-world data with up to a million of data samples.},

In particular, the posterior distribution of all the unknown variables characterizing the jump BJ model is derived and then maximized using a coordinate ascent algorithm. The resulting estimation algorithm alternates between Gauss–Newton optimization of the coefficients of the BJ submodels, a method derived based on an instance of prediction error methods tailored to BJ models with switching coefficients, and approximated dynamic programming for optimization of the sequence of active modes.

In particular, a network localization scheme is developed based directly on the measured directions between an agent and its neighboring agents in the network. The proposed position and orientation localization algorithms are implemented through differential equations which simultaneously compute poses of all followers by using locally measured directional vectors and angular velocities, and actual pose knowledge of some leader agents, allowing some tracking of time-varying orientations.

  abstract     = {The last few decades have witnessed much development in filtering of systems with Gaussian noises and arbitrary unknown inputs. Nonetheless, there are still some important design questions that warrant thorough discussions. Especially, the existing literature has shown that for unbiased and minimum variance estimation of the state and the unknown input, the initial guess of the state has to be unbiased. This clearly raises the question of whether and under what conditions one can design an unbiased and minimum variance filter, without making such a stringent assumption. The above-mentioned question will be investigated systematically in this paper, i.e., design of the filter is sought to be independent of a priori information about the initial conditions. In particular, for both cases with and without direct feedthrough, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for unbiased and minimum variance estimation of the state/unknown input, independently of a priori initial conditions, respectively. When the former conditions do not hold, we carry out a thorough analysis of all possible scenarios. For each scenario, we present detailed discussions regarding whether and what can be achieved in terms of unbiased estimation, independently of a priori initial conditions. Extensions to the case with time-delays, conceptually like Kalman smoothing where future measurements are allowed in estimation, will also be presented, amongst others.},

  abstract     = {Port-Hamiltonian system theory is a well-known framework for the control of complex physical systems. The majority of port-Hamiltonian control design methods base on an explicit input-state-output port-Hamiltonian model for the system under consideration. However in the literature, little effort has been made towards a systematic, automatable derivation of such explicit models. In this paper, we present a constructive, formally rigorous method for an explicit port-Hamiltonian formulation of multi-bond graphs. Two conditions, one necessary and one sufficient, for the existence of an explicit port-Hamiltonian formulation of a multi-bond graph are given. We summarise our approach in an algorithm for the automated generation of an explicit port-Hamiltonian model from a given multi-bond graph. An academic example illustrates the results of this paper.},

  abstract     = {Unlike most control systems, kinematic uncertainty is present in robot control systems in addition to dynamic uncertainty. The use of different types of external sensors in various configurations also results in different sensory transformation or Jacobian matrices and thus leads to different kinematic models. Currently, there is no systematic theoretical framework in developing data-driven neural network (NN) learning and control methods for task-space tracking control of robots with unknown kinematics and dynamics. The existing NN controllers are limited to either dynamic control or kinematic control without considering the interaction between the inner control loop and the outer control loop. In this paper, a NN based data driven offline learning algorithm and an online learning controller are proposed, which are combined in a complementary way. The proposed task-space control algorithms can be implemented on robotic systems with closed control architecture by considering the interaction with the inner control loop. Theoretical analyses are presented to show the stability of the systems and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed learning algorithms.},

The new approach is inspired by the delay-partitioning method, the timer-dependent Lyapunov functional method, and the looped-functional method. In the delay-partitioning framework, a new type of timer-dependent Lyapunov functional is constructed, which depends on the partition on impulse intervals and also on impulse dynamics. Different from the previous discontinuous Lyapunov functionals, the introduced Lyapunov functional is continuous along the trajectories of the considered impulsive delay system. Consequently, two different problems of exponential stability and hybrid L 2 × l 2 -gain performance are tackled by using the same class of Lyapunov functionals. It is shown that the positive definiteness of this Lyapunov functional inside impulse intervals is not necessary for proving exponential stability. By use of new integral inequalities based techniques, delay-dependent criteria for exponential stability and finite hybrid L 2 × l 2 -gain are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the new approach.},

A practical measurement error model is considered in which only the upper bounds of the measurement errors are known by the sensors a priori . The coverage cost function is defined as the largest arrival time from the mobile sensor network to any point on the circle. Two cases of coverage control with and without order preservation of the sensors respectively, are considered. For each case, the upper bounds on the measurement errors are employed to design an estimation algorithm for each sensor to estimate the difference between neighboring sensors’ positions. Then, distributed coverage control laws are developed for the mobile sensors by using the estimated difference. Under the proposed control laws, the sensor network is driven to a neighborhood of the optimal configuration minimizing the cost function and the effect of the measurement errors on the coverage performance is reduced or even eliminated.},

The FDI attacks with complete stealthiness can completely remove its influences on monitored residuals, which have better stealthy performance against residual-based detectors than existing FDI attacks. Based on self-generated FDI attacks that are independent of real-time data of CPSs, we propose the necessary and sufficient condition of attack parameters such that FDI attacks can achieve complete stealthiness. Furthermore, we introduce the energy stealthiness of FDI attacks, which is a special case of complete stealthiness and makes the accumulated attack energy on residuals is bounded. Then, the existence and design conditions of FDI attacks with energy stealthiness are given. Finally, the superiority of the FDI attacks with complete stealthiness is demonstrated by the IEEE 6 bus power system.},

Furthermore, boundary states are assumed to be the only measurements available for feedback. The problem is initially cast into a familiar LTI form describing dynamics at the bottom boundary. This uncertain linear system is characterized by an unknown parameter, delayed input, and an unknown harmonic disturbance. From there, we parametrize the disturbance and use backstepping design, via transport PDEs, to construct an adaptive boundary controller. Stability analysis is given for the closed loop system and the convergence of the error state is proven. The paper concludes with a numerical example illustrating the performance of the derived controller.},

The opinions of the individuals lie between 0 and 1. It is shown that for strongly connected networks, the equilibria with all elements equal identically to the extreme value 0 or 1 is locally exponentially stable, while the equilibrium with all elements equal to the neutral consensus value of 1 2 is unstable. Regions of attraction for the extreme consensus equilibria are given. For the equilibrium consisting of both extreme values 0 and 1, which corresponds to opinion polarization according to the model, it is shown that the equilibrium is unstable for all strongly connected networks if individuals all have weak bias, becomes locally exponentially stable for complete and two-island networks if individuals all have strong bias, and its stability heavily depends on the network topology when individuals have intermediate bias. Analysis on star graphs and simulations show that additional equilibria may exist where individuals form clusters.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of distributed weighted least-squares (WLS) estimation for an interconnected linear measurement network with additive noise. Two types of measurements are considered: self measurements for individual nodes, and edge measurements for the connecting nodes. Each node in the network carries out distributed estimation by using its own measurement and information transmitted from its neighbours. We study two distributed estimation algorithms: a recently proposed distributed WLS algorithm and the so-called Gaussian Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. We first establish the equivalence of the two algorithms. We then prove a key result which shows that the information matrix is always generalized diagonally dominant, under some very mild condition. Using these two results and some known convergence properties of the Gaussian BP algorithm, we show that the aforementioned distributed WLS algorithm computes the exact WLS solution asymptotically. A bound on its convergence rate is also presented.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the issues of stability analysis and stabilizing controller design for two classes of discrete-time non-homogeneous semi-Markov jump linear systems (S-MJLSs). The first class is concerned with the sojourn-time probability mass functions that are independent of jump instants, while the other considers the existence of probability mass functions of sojourn time depending on jump instants. New techniques are developed respectively for both classes of systems by transforming their corresponding time-varying semi-Markov kernels into more tractable forms. Based on the stochastic stability allowing for bounded sojourn time, the derived stability and stabilization criteria containing the probability distribution information of random sojourn time can be numerically tested. In order to reduce the possible conservatism of the obtained results, a novel class of polytopic quadratic Lyapunov function is constructed, which depends on both the current mode and the elapsed time in the current mode. Finally, the proposed control strategies are applied to an illustrative application of automotive electronic throttle valve to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results. The results also reveal the significance of considering the inhomogeneity of S-MJLSs and the importance of our constructed Lyapunov function.},

We consider two different cases: (Case 1) the drift and diffusion terms of the forward part are independent of the backward part (not fully-coupled FBSDE) and the running cost does not include the backward part; (Case 2) the fully-coupled FBSDE with terminal and initial costs. In both cases, the risk-sensitive objective functional is considered, the corresponding control domain is not necessarily convex, and the diffusion term of the forward part depends on control and state variables. In both cases, by using the nonlinear transformations of the equivalent risk-neutral problems, we obtain two (different) risk-sensitive maximum principles, which are characterized in terms of the variational inequalities. We show that the risk-sensitive maximum principle of (Case 1) consists of the two-coupled adjoint equations with an additional scalar adjoint equation, which are backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The risk-sensitive maximum principle of (Case 2) consists of the two-coupled adjoint equations, which are coupled FBSDEs, with an additional scalar adjoint equation and optimality conditions. In both cases, the additional scalar adjoint equations are BSDEs, which are induced due to the nonlinear transformations of the adjoint processes in the equivalent risk-neutral problems. Through the application of results, we consider the linear–quadratic risk-sensitive optimal control problem for the linear FBSDE, and by using the risk-sensitive maximum principle of (Case 1), we characterize an explicit optimal solution.},

Then, the highly nonlinear mathematical model of oxygen mask is analyzed. Next, an ESO is applied to deal with highly nonlinear problems caused by disturbances and uncertainties. Based on the back-stepping SMC technique, the corresponding controller is designed to control the throttle valve. Further, the stability of ESO and SMC are analyzed and proven theoretically. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated by extensive comparative simulations.

According to the offset-free formulation, the system’s state is augmented with disturbances and transformed into a new coordinate framework. Based on the new variables, the proposed controller integrates a moving horizon estimator to determine a solution of the nominal system surrounded by a set of potential states compatible with past input and output measurements. The worst cost within a single homothetic tube around the nominal solution is chosen as the economic objective function which is minimized to provide a tightened upper bound for the accumulated real cost within the prediction horizon window. Thanks to the combined use of the nominal system and homothetic tube, the designed optimization problem is recursively feasible and less conservative economic performance bounds are achieved. The proposed controller is demonstrated on a two-tanks system.},

While this has allowed the construction of advanced open-loop circuitry based on cascaded DNA strand displacement (DSD) reactions, little progress has so far been made in developing the requisite theoretical machinery to inform the systematic design of feedback controllers in this context. Here, we develop a number of foundational theoretical results on the equilibria, stability, and dynamics of nucleic acid controllers. In particular, we show that the implementation of feedback controllers using DSD reactions introduces additional nonlinear dynamics, even in the case of purely linear designs, e.g. PI controllers. By decomposing the effects of these non-observable nonlinear dynamics, we show that, in general, the stability of the linear system design does not necessarily imply the stability of the underlying chemical reaction network, which can be lost under experimental variability when feedback interconnections are introduced. We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, and present an example to illustrate when the linear design does not capture the instability of the full nonlinear system implemented as a DSD reaction network, and we further confirm these results using Visual DSD, a bespoke software tool for simulating nucleic acid-based circuits. Our analysis highlights the many interesting and unique characteristics of this important new class of feedback control systems.},

In this work, we present a robust adaptive control solution free from “feasibility conditions” and capable of accommodating much more general dynamic constraints. In our design, instead of employing the commonly used piecewise Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF), we build a unified barrier function upon the constrained states, with which we convert the original constrained nonlinear system into an equivalent “non-constrained” one. Then by stabilizing the “unconstrained” system, the asymmetric state constraints imposed dynamically are handled gracefully. By blending a new coordinate transformation into the backstepping design, we develop a control strategy completely obviating the “feasibility conditions” for the system. It is worth noting that the requirement on the constraints to be obeyed herein is much less restrictive as compared to those imposed in most existing methods, rendering the resultant control less demanding in design and more user-friendly in implementation. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation verify the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we propose a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) for stochastic parametric models. TAGs can be used to generate models in an EA framework while imposing desirable structural constraints and incorporating prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a TAG that can systematically generate models ranging from FIRs to polynomial NARMAX models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TAGs can be easily extended to more general model classes, such as the non-linear Box–Jenkins model class, enabling the realization of flexible and automatic model structure and complexity selection via EA.},

An adaptive observer-based fault estimation (FE) scheme is used to estimate the fault. The nonlinearity causes the control input (the measurable controller output, which is injected into the FE scheme) to differ from the actuator output (which enters the plant); this mismatch (together with the disturbances) causes interactions between the FE and FTC schemes, violating the separation principle and hence they cannot be designed separately. We introduce a method that integrates both FE and FTC schemes, and design them simultaneously (thus overcoming the violation of the separation principle), guaranteeing bounded stability. To obtain the sufficient conditions for stability and minimum L 2 -gain performance for disturbance rejection, we use the Sector Condition (SC) and successfully re-casted the design as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) which can be performed in a single step and yield tractable solutions. Through a numerical example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the potential of utilizing used electric vehicle (EV) batteries as the battery energy storage system (BESS) in EV charging stations, we study the joint scheduling of BESS operation and deferrable EV charging load (with the same deadline) in the presence of random renewable generation, EV arrivals, and electricity prices. We formulate the cost-minimizing scheduling problem faced by an EV charging station operator as a dynamic program. When the number of EVs is large, the formulated dynamic program cannot be exactly solved by brute-force methods due to the curse of dimensionality. We characterize a complete, optimal priority rule on energy allocation among EVs. For an important special case with full charging/discharging efficiency and all EVs available for charging at the initial period, we propose a new methodological approach to establish full characterizations of an optimal scheduling policy that enable the development of scalable computational approaches. The proposed approach achieves close-to-optimal performance in numerical experiments with real-world electricity pricing and solar generation data.},

More precisely, by selecting the sliding surface that is sufficiently faster than the sensor dynamics, it is possible to maintain unaffected the time-scale separation between sensors and plant. A modified singular perturbation technique is used to show some semi-global practical asymptotic stability of the closed loop system. By incorporating the knowledge of sensors into the SMC design and by tuning the parameters of the proposed integral SMC appropriately, the main result shows that the closed loop system can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin (the ultimate bound) from some given domain of attraction. Both the ultimate bound and the domain of the attraction are dependent of the time-scale parameter that is related to the sensor dynamics.

Unfortunately, the communication on a wireless medium is sensitive to noise in the transmission band, which is characterized by the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Wi-Fi allows to switch among different bit-rates in real-time thus permitting to trade-off lower loss probabilities for larger latency or vice-versa to achieve better closed-loop performance. To exploit this feature, under a constant SNR scenario, we propose a cross-layer approach where the bit-rate is optimally selected based on a control performance metric (i.e. minimum LQG cost) and a model-based controller is used to compensate for the packet losses. Under time-varying SNR, we additionally propose a (sub-optimal) on-line rate adaptation strategy and we guarantee the closed-loop stability under some mild conditions. Numerical comparisons with emulation-based approaches using TrueTime, a realistic Matlab-based Wi-Fi simulator, are included to show the benefits of the adaptive approach under time-varying SNR scenarios.},

  abstract     = {We consider a scenario in which a DoS attacker with the limited power resource and the purpose of degrading the system performance, jams a wireless network through which the packet from a sensor is sent to a remote estimator. To degrade the estimation quality most effectively with a given energy budget, the attacker aims to solve the problem of how much power to obstruct the channel each time, which is the recently proposed optimal attack energy management problem. The existing works are built on an ideal network model in which the packet dropout never occurs when the attack is absent. To encompass wireless transmission losses, we introduce the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio-based network. First we focus on the case when the attacker employs the constant power level. To maximize the expected terminal estimation error at the remote estimator, we provide some more relaxed sufficient conditions compared with the existing work for the existence of an explicit solution to the optimal static attack energy management problem and the solution is constructed. For the other important index of system performance, the average expected estimation error, the associated sufficient conditions are also derived based on a different analysis approach with the existing work. And a feasible method is presented for both indexes to seek the optimal constant attack power level when the system fails to meet the proposed sufficient conditions. Then when the real-time ACK information can be acquired, a Markov decision process (MDP) based algorithm is designed to solve the optimal dynamic attack energy management problem. We further study the optimal tradeoff between attack energy and system degradation. Specifically, by moving the energy constraint into the objective function to maximize the system index and minimize the energy consumption simultaneously, the other MDP based algorithm is proposed to find the optimal dynamic attack power policy which is further shown to have a monotone structure. The theoretical results are illustrated by simulations.},

  abstract     = {This work is concerned with the boundary observer-based control for a category of cascade systems with stochastic jumps. The cascade system consists of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) entering the hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) through the boundary. A continuous-time, discrete-state homogeneous Markov process models the jumping parameters of the system, and its right continuous trajectory candidate values are taken from a finite set. A boundary observer is designed, which relies only on limited quantity of sensors at the boundary of the PDEs. Based on the Lyapunov functional approach, the observer-error system is firstly proved to be exponentially mean square stable. Then, the controller is presented by utilizing the estimated states of the ODEs as feedback variables. The evolution profiles of the PDEs in the closed-loop are proved to be exponentially mean square stable at the desired steady-state. The existence conditions of the boundary observer and the stability conditions of the PDEs in the closed-loop form are presented via a set of compact space-varying linear matrix inequalities (SVLMIs). The SVLMIs are then approximated by a finite number of LMIs, which guarantee the SVLMIs, and the computational cost is reduced greatly. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are applied to a traffic flow control system, which confirms that the proposed estimation and control methods are effective.},

Connectivity maintenance and collision avoidance among neighboring agents are also handled by the appropriate design of certain performance bounds that constrain the inter-agent distance errors. As an extension to the proposed scheme, distance-based formation centroid maneuvering is also studied for disturbance-free agents, in which the formation centroid tracks a desired time-varying velocity. The proposed control laws are decentralized, in the sense that each agent employs local relative information regarding its neighbors to calculate its control signal. Therefore, the control scheme is implementable on the agents’ local coordinate frames. Using rigid graph theory, input-to-state stability, and Lyapunov based analysis, the results are established for minimally and infinitesimally rigid formations in 2-D or 3-D space. Furthermore, it is argued that the proposed approach increases formation robustness against shape distortions and can prevent formation convergence to incorrect shapes under the effect of external disturbances, which is likely to happen in conventional distance-based formation control methods. Finally, extensive simulation studies clarify and verify the proposed approach.},

As an example application of this derived property, we investigate the stabilization of continuous-time linear systems with an unknown time-varying delay, by proposing a switched low gain feedback control technique that utilizes the derived property. Existing literature on stabilization of continuous time delay systems all require some knowledge, such as an upper bound, of the delay. In this work, by proposing a switched low gain feedback control law utilizing the derived property, we are able to achieve asymptotic stabilization of the system without any knowledge of the delay. Furthermore, the proposed switched low gain feedback law also significantly improves the closed-loop system performance in terms of overshoot and convergence speed, in comparison with the traditional fixed gain low gain feedback design.

Two cases are considered, distinguished by whether down-hole pressure measurements are available or not. The main contribution of the paper is a theoretical result on adaptive stabilization and set-point regulation by boundary control for a general 2 × 2 linear hyperbolic system in the case of measurements taken at both boundaries, with stability proven in the L 2 -sense. The design is applied to the drilling system and shown to solve the kick and loss problem with sensing at both boundaries. An earlier result on adaptive set-point regulation for 2 × 2 hyperbolic systems is also applied to the drilling system and shown to solve a kick and loss problem with sensing restricted to the actuated boundary only. The two designs are compared in a simulation of a loss incident, showing a significant reduction in convergence time and total accumulated loss for the design with sensing allowed at both boundaries.},

  abstract     = {Event-triggered tracking control for a class of nonlinear systems with disturbances is investigated in this paper. Compared to existing related results, the nonlinearities only need to satisfy a generalized Lipschitz condition, and the time-varying external disturbances are allowed to be unmatched. By using finite-time disturbance observers, the finite-time estimation of the steady states is achieved to reduce the complexity of tracking control design. The event-triggered controller is designed by a new feedback domination approach, which can dynamically compensate for both errors caused by disturbances and the sampled-data implementation of the controller. A new Lyapunov stability analysis is given to show that all the signals of the closed-loop system are globally bounded and the tracking error is ensured to converge to a set, which can be made as small as desired by adjusting control parameters. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed scheme.},

The case when the steady-state plant responses correspond to equilibrium solutions received a lot of attention. However, in many industrial applications plant performance is characterized by time-varying steady-state behavior. In those cases, no static parameter-to-steady-state performance map can be defined. In this work, we propose an ESC method that employs a so-called dynamic cost function to cope with time-varying steady-state responses of general nonlinear systems. We prove semi-global practical asymptotic stability of the closed-loop ESC scheme in the presence of bounded and time-varying external disturbances. Moreover, the working principle is illustrated by means of the real-time performance optimal tuning of a nonlinear control strategy for a motion control application.},

The structure-preserving Cayley–Tustin transformation is utilized to approximate the continuous-time system by a discrete-time model representation without using any spatial discretization or model reduction. The discrete-time model is utilized in the design of model predictive controller accounting for optimality, stabilization, and input and output/state constraints in an explicit way. The proposed model predictive controller is dual-mode in the sense that predictive controller steers the state to a set where exponentially stabilizing unconstrained feedback can be utilized without violating the constraints. The construction of the model predictive controller leads to a finite-dimensional constrained quadratic optimization problem easily solvable by standard numerical methods.

Since these conditions are not always satisfiable, we relax the restrictions on the choice of abstractions, instead opting to select ones which nearly satisfy such conditions via optimization-based approaches. To quantify the resulting effect on the error between the abstraction and concrete control system, we introduce the notions of practical simulation functions and practical storage functions. We show that our approach facilitates the procedure of aggregation, where one creates an abstraction by partitioning agents into aggregate areas.

  abstract     = {Linear threshold models have been studied extensively in structured populations; however, less attention is paid to perception differences among the individuals of the population. To focus on this effect, we exclude structure and consider a well-mixed population of heterogeneous agents, each associated with a threshold in the form of a fixed ratio within zero and one that can be unique to this agent. The agents are initialized with a choice of strategy A or B , and at each time step, one agent becomes active to update; if the ratio of agents playing A is higher (resp. lower) than her threshold, she updates to A (resp. B ). We show that for any given initial condition, after a finite number of time steps, the population reaches an equilibrium where no agent’s threshold is violated; however, the equilibrium is not necessarily uniquely determined by the initial condition but depends on the agents’ activation sequence. We find all those possible equilibria that the dynamics may reach from a given initial condition and show that, in contrast to the case of homogeneous populations, heterogeneity in the agents’ thresholds gives rise to several equilibria where both A -playing and B -playing agents coexist. Perception heterogeneity can, hence, preserve decision diversity, even in the absence of population structure. We also investigate the asymptotic stability of the equilibria and show how to calculate the contagion probability for a population with two thresholds.},

The dynamics of each agent in this network is governed by a marginally unstable single-input single-output linear system and each agent can access the relative output of its neighboring agents. Recognizing, possibly for the first time, the similarities between the feedback structures appearing in a well-known low-gain controller design approach for solving the consensus problem and the low-gain approach to the output regulation of stable linear plants, we propose a novel controller design technique for solving the consensus problem. Our technique is frequency-domain based, unlike most of the techniques in the literature which are state–space based. Combining our technique with a recent result on the existence of stable p th -order transfer functions with a desired phase at p given frequencies, we design controllers whose order is significantly lower than the order of the controllers proposed in the consensus literature. The techniques developed in this work can be applied equally to design reduced-order controllers for solving the aforementioned consensus problem in the presence of known, uniform and arbitrarily large communication and input delays in the network.},

In particular, by introducing a novel auxiliary system with adaptive gains, the proposed optimization algorithm is privacy-preserving such that no actual state of any agent is necessary for other agents. Moreover, the proposed optimization algorithm is fully distributed in the sense that the optimization objective is achieved without knowledge of global graph information, explicit global cost function as well as strongly convex and Lipschitz constants associated with all local cost functions.

We investigate under which conditions the two definitions are equivalent.

  abstract     = {We introduce in the paper a novel observability problem for a large population (in the limit, a continuum ensemble) of nonholonomic control systems with unknown population density. We address the problem by focussing on a prototype, namely, the ensemble of Bloch equations which is known for its use of describing the evolution of the bulk magnetization of a collective of non-interacting nuclear spins in a static field modulated by a radio frequency ( rf ) field. The dynamics of the equations are structurally identical, but show variations in Larmor dispersion and rf inhomogeneity. We assume that the initial state of any individual system (i.e., individual Bloch equation) is unknown and, moreover, the population density of these individual systems is also unknown. Furthermore, we assume that at any time, there is only one scalar measurement output at our disposal. The measurement output integrates a certain observation function, common to all individual systems, over the continuum ensemble. The observability problem we pose in the paper is thus the following: Whether one is able to use the common control input (i.e., the rf field) and the single measurement output to estimate both the initial states of the individual systems and the population density? Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition for the ensemble system to be observable: We show that if the common observation function is any harmonic homogeneous polynomial of positive degree, then the ensemble system is observable. The proof of the result utilizes tools from representation theory of Lie algebras. Although the results established in the paper are for the specific ensemble of Bloch equations, the approach developed along the analysis can be generalized to investigate observability of other ensemble systems with single, integrated measurement outputs.},

Therefore, it is not obvious in general which linear prediction error method should be preferred. In the second part, the estimating functions approach is introduced and used to construct estimators that are asymptotically optimal with respect to a specific class of estimators. These estimators rely on partial probabilistic parametric models, and therefore neither require the computations of the likelihood function nor any marginalization integrals.

We further prove a separation principle, showing that the problem can be decomposed into finding sensor and actuator schedules separately. However, it is shown that this problem cannot be efficiently solved or approximated in polynomial, or even quasi-polynomial time for time-invariant sensor/actuator schedules; instead, we develop deterministic polynomial-time algorithms for a time-varying sensor/actuator schedule with guaranteed approximation bounds. Our main result is to provide a polynomial-time joint actuator and sensor schedule that on average selects only a constant number of sensors and actuators at each time step, irrespective of the dimension of the system. The key idea is to sparsify the controllability and observability Gramians while providing approximation guarantees for Hankel singular values. This idea is inspired by recent results in theoretical computer science literature on sparsification.},

The scale-free nonlinear dynamic protocol is developed via scheduling (adaptive) design for linear agents. Meanwhile, the scale-free linear observer-based protocol design is proposed for a model consisting of a mix of double-integrator, single-integrator and neutrally stable dynamics. Our protocols do not need any knowledge about the directed network topology or the spectrum of the associated Laplacian matrix. Besides, the proposed protocol is scalable and designed based on only knowledge of agent models and achieves synchronization for any communication graph with an arbitrary number of agents.},

However, most existing nonlinear robust control approaches just consider the affine nonlinear nominal model and thereby ignore available information about existing non-affine nonlinearities. When the general nonlinear nominal model is considered, the robust domain of attraction (RDOA) of closed-loops requires extensive investigation because it is hard to achieve the global stabilization. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear robust control method based on Lyapunov function to stabilize a discrete-time uncertain system and to estimate the RDOA of closed-loops. First, a sufficient condition for robust stabilization of all plants in a plant set and estimation of the RDOA of all closed-loops is proposed. Then, to tackle the non-affine nonlinearities, a data-driven method of estimating the robust negative-definite domains (RNDD) is presented, and based on it the estimation of the RDOA of closed-loops and the resulting controller design are also given.},

To learn and select the right users, we formulate the DR problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with a reliability objective. We propose a learning algorithm: CUCB-Avg (Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound-Average), which utilizes both upper confidence bounds and sample averages to balance the tradeoff between exploration (learning) and exploitation (selecting). We consider both a fixed time-invariant target and time-varying targets, and show that CUCB-Avg achieves O ( log T ) and O ( T log ( T ) ) regrets respectively. Finally, we numerically test our algorithms using synthetic and real data, and demonstrate that our CUCB-Avg performs significantly better than the classic CUCB and also better than Thompson Sampling.},

Utilizing the mean-field type stochastic minimum principle, the necessary conditions are put forward. Under certain convex assumptions, it is shown that the necessary conditions are also sufficient ones. Next, the indefinite linear quadratic (LQ) case is studied. It is pointed out that the solvability of two related generalized differential Riccati equations (GDREs) provides a sufficient condition under which Pareto efficient strategies are equivalent to weighted sum optimal controls.

An important feature of the proposed scheme is its versatility in being applicable to systems with or without constraints and with moving or stationary paths, without changing the control structure. It is demonstrated that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded under the proposed method while the prescribed bounds on the tracking errors will never be violated.

  abstract     = {Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) are key spaces for machine learning that are becoming popular also for linear system identification. In particular, the so-called stable RKHSs can be used to model absolutely summable impulse responses. In combination e.g. with regularized least squares they can then be used to reconstruct dynamic systems from input–output data. In this paper we provide new structural properties of stable RKHSs. The relation between stable kernels and other fundamental classes, like those containing absolutely summable or finite-trace kernels, is elucidated. These insights are then brought into the feature space context. First, it is proved that any stable kernel admits feature maps induced by a basis of orthogonal eigenvectors in ℓ 2 . The exact connection with classical system identification approaches that exploit such kind of functions to model impulse responses is also provided. Then, the necessary and sufficient stability condition for RKHSs designed by formulating kernel eigenvectors and eigenvalues is obtained. Overall, our new results provide novel mathematical foundations of stable RKHSs with impact on stability tests, impulse responses modeling and computational efficiency of regularized schemes for linear system identification.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a new, two-stage approach to identification of linear time-varying stochastic systems, based on the concepts of preestimation and postfiltering. The proposed preestimated parameter trajectories are unbiased but have large variability. Hence, to obtain reliable estimates of system parameters, the preestimated trajectories must be further filtered (postfiltered). It is shown how one can design and optimize such postfilters using the basis function framework. The proposed solution to adaptive tuning of postfilter settings is based on parallel estimation and cross-validatory analysis. When compared with the classical solutions to the problem of parameter tracking, the new approach offers, without compromising good tracking performance, significant computational savings, higher numerical robustness and greater flexibility.},

  abstract     = {We study the non-parametric reconstruction of spatio-temporal dynamical processes via Gaussian Processes (GPs) regression from sparse and noisy data. GPs have been mainly applied to spatial regression where they represent one of the most powerful estimation approaches also thanks to their universal representing properties. Their extension to dynamical processes has been instead elusive so far since classical implementations lead to unscalable algorithms or require some sort of approximation. We propose a novel procedure to address this problem by coupling GPs regression and Kalman filtering. In particular, assuming space/time separability of the covariance (kernel) of the process and rational time spectrum, we build a finite-dimensional discrete-time state-space process representation amenable to Kalman filtering. With sampling over a finite set of fixed spatial locations, our major finding is that the current Kalman filter state represents a sufficient statistic to compute the minimum variance estimate of the process at any future time over the entire spatial domain. In machine learning, a representer theorem states that an important class of infinite-dimensional variational problems admits a computable and finite-dimensional exact solution. In view of this, our result can be interpreted as a novel Dynamic Representer Theorem for GPs. We then extend the study to situations where the spatial input locations set varies over time. The proposed algorithms are tested on both synthetic and real field data, providing comparisons with standard GP and truncated GP regression techniques.},

For periodic target signals we ensure exponential stability of the optimal reachable periodic trajectory using suitable terminal ingredients and a convexity condition for the underlying periodic optimal control problem. Furthermore, we introduce an online optimization of the terminal set size to automate the trade-off between fast convergence and operation close to the constraints. In addition, we show how stabilization and dynamic trajectory planning can be formulated as partially decoupled optimization problems, which reduces the computational demand while ensuring recursive feasibility and convergence. The main tool to enable the proposed design is a novel reference generic offline computation that provides suitable terminal ingredients for tracking of dynamic reference trajectories. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated on benchmark examples, which demonstrates superior performance compared to state of the art approaches.},

To be specific, in the first part of this paper, the K -gap and L 2 -gap metrics are introduced, which measure the distance between two kernel subspaces and serve as an efficient tool to deal with fault detection and isolation issues. Based on it, the K -gap and L 2 -gap aided analysis of residual dynamics with respect to model uncertainties is presented for the open-loop and feedback control systems, respectively. Furthermore, they are applied to deal with the performance analysis of fault detection systems. For this purpose, the concepts of fault detectability indicators and fault-to-uncertainty ratio are introduced. The second part of this paper is dedicated to the isolation of multiplicative faults. To this end, the definition for fault isolability is studied first with the aid of K -gap metric. The further efforts are devoted to the application of K -gap metric to two online fault isolation algorithms. The first one is an observer-based scheme, which adopts a bank of residual generators and an observer-based decision unit. The second scheme is based on the data-driven identification of the kernel representation of the faulty plant and the data-driven computation of the K -gap metric. Case and example studies are finally given to illustrate the proposed approaches.},

In order to overcome the difficulties in analyzing the stability of the sliding mode dynamics and the reachability of the specified sliding surface, a novel matrix decoupling technique and a novel semi-Markovian Lyapunov function method are introduced. Besides, genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve two meaningful optimization problems arising from designing a desired asynchronous SMC scheme.

A distributed control law is then designed for the agents to travel along a common circle of the prescribed radius centered at the target and simultaneously achieve any desired spacing pattern along the circle. For a moving target with a bounded and unknown velocity, networked mobile agents globally converge to a neighborhood of the desired circular formation around the target by the proposed control law. Under the further assumption that one of the agents has access to the velocity information of the target, the localization algorithm and control law are modified by utilizing the estimate of the target’s velocity for each agent.

Such a technique enables us to solve the leader–follower consensus and leaderless consensus problems in a unified framework. And it further allows us to treat the leaderless consensus as a special case of the leader–follower consensus. For leader–follower consensus, the assumption that the leader trajectory is linearly parameterized with some known functions as required in most recent relevant literatures is successfully relaxed.

  abstract     = {Sparse networks can be found in a wide range of applications, such as biological and communication networks. Inference of such networks from data has been receiving considerable attention lately, mainly driven by the need to understand and control internal working mechanisms. However, while most available methods have been successful at predicting many correct links, they also tend to infer many incorrect links. Precision is the ratio between the number of correctly inferred links and all inferred links, and should ideally be close to 100\%. For example, 50\% precision means that half of inferred links are incorrect, and there is only a 50\% chance of picking a correct one. In contrast, this paper infers links of discrete-time linear networks with very high precision, based on variational Bayesian inference and Gaussian processes. Our method can handle limited datasets, does not require full-state measurements and effectively promotes both system stability and network sparsity. On several of examples, Monte Carlo simulations illustrate that our method consistently has 100\% or nearly 100\% precision, even in the presence of noise and hidden nodes, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. The method should be applicable to a wide range of network inference contexts, including biological networks and power systems.},

  abstract     = {Consider a set of jobs with independent random service times to be scheduled on a single machine. The jobs can be surgeries in an operating room, patients’ appointments in outpatient clinics, etc. The challenge is to determine the optimal sequence and appointment times of jobs to minimize some function of the server idle time and service start-time delay. We introduce a generalized objective function of delay and idle time, and consider l 1 -type and l 2 -type cost functions as special cases of interest. Determining an index-based policy for the optimal sequence in which to schedule jobs has been an open problem for many years. For example, it was conjectured that ‘least variance first’ (LVF) policy is optimal for the l 1 -type objective. This is known to be true for the case of two jobs with specific distributions. A key result in this paper is that the optimal sequencing problem is non-indexable, i.e., neither the variance, nor any other such index can be used to determine the optimal sequence in which to schedule jobs for l 1 and l 2 -type objectives. We then show that given a sequence in which to schedule the jobs, sample average approximation yields a solution which is statistically consistent.},

In this paper, we consider the scenario in which a linear, time-invariant feedback law has been designed to control vibrations in a linear, time-invariant vibratory system, without accounting for the actuation stroke limits. In this scenario, the saturation of the actuator stroke may be viewed as introducing unmodeled dynamics into the closed-loop system response, which can be undesirable for a few reasons. Most importantly, it may destabilize the closed-loop system. Additionally, it introduces impulsive disturbances into the response, and may result in hardware damage. We illustrate a technique whereby the linear feedback law, designed a priori , may be augmented with a nonlinear feedback loop which protects against stroke saturation while simultaneously maintaining closed-loop stability. The nonlinear feedback law is developed around the concept of output-strict passivity, and exploits the known output-strict passivity of the vibratory system. Importantly, the nonlinear feedback law leaves the performance of the linear feedback law unaffected for small-signal responses.},

Unlike the conventional methods where the target formation is time invariant, we propose an affine formation method based on the properties of affine transformation, in which the target formation can be time-varying and affinely transformed from the given nominal formation. This paper provides and proves a sufficient and necessary condition of achieving the directed graphical affine localizability, and it only needs that the leaders have a generic configuration and the followers are accessible to the subset of leaders. To achieve the whole formation maneuvers, assume that the leaders decide the whole formation’s maneuver actions, then the control algorithms of the arbitrary-order integrator followers are proposed to track the time-varying target formation and the global convergence of tracking errors is also proved. Furthermore, this paper studies the practical problems of formation maneuvers when existing non-uniform time delays. Finally, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

A continuous robust adaptive FTCC protocol is designed by using a boundary layer technique to compensate for the time-varying unknown inertias, uncertain coupling dynamics/disturbances, and unpredictable actuation failures simultaneously . By artfully choosing a Lyapunov function and by generalizing an important fractional-order inequality, it is shown that the consensus configuration error converges to an adjustable small residual set in finite time. The proposed robust adaptive FTCC protocol is completely distributed in the sense that there is no need for any global information, and also is less demanding without requiring any detailed dynamic/parameters information or complicated/costly fault detection and diagnosis.

Event-triggered control and estimation achieve some efficiency by replacing continuous data exchange between agents with intermittent, or event-triggered communication. Typically, model-based predictions are used at times of no data transmission, and updates are sent only when the prediction error grows too large. The effectiveness in reducing communication thus strongly depends on the quality of the prediction model. In this article, we propose event-triggered learning as a novel concept to reduce communication even further and to also adapt to changing dynamics. By monitoring the actual communication rate and comparing it to the one that is induced by the model, we detect a mismatch between model and reality and trigger model learning when needed. Specifically, for linear Gaussian dynamics, we derive different classes of learning triggers solely based on a statistical analysis of inter-communication times and formally prove their effectiveness with the aid of concentration inequalities.},

Moreover, a novel information fusion strategy is developed to guarantee the estimation performance, based on the collective observability of the sensor network, which greatly relaxes the technical assumption of the proposed estimator. Theoretically, it can be ensured that if the observed system is time-varying, the gains of the estimator will be bounded. Furthermore, if the system is time-invariant, these gains will be convergent. Subsequently, the estimation error covariance will be ultimately bounded if the observed system is quadratically bounded. In the end, the superiority of the proposed robust distributed state estimation algorithm is illustrated by several numerical simulation examples.},

Essentially different from the related literature, the systems under investigation allow large uncertainties (whose size is unknown) coupling to unmeasurable states, which requires to integrate a comprehensive output-feedback compensation mechanism into the event-triggered philosophy and would bring substantial challenges to the event-triggered control. To solve the problem, a novel scheme of adaptive event-triggered output-feedback control is established for the systems. Specifically, an adaptive dynamic gain is introduced not only to counteract the large uncertainties but also to cope with the execution/sampling error. Then, an adaptive event-triggered output-feedback controller based on dynamic-gain observer is constructed to guarantee global convergence for the resulting closed-loop system while reducing execution/sampling. Particularly, the event-triggering mechanism involved is delicately designed by fully exploiting the dynamic gain, to enable the negative influence of the gain through the execution error to be counteracted (no matter how large the gain becomes) while precluding infinitely fast execution which violates the implementation of event-triggered controller in practice. Correspondingly, a distinctive analysis pattern is implemented for the closed-loop performance, due to the coupling of the dynamic-gain compensation mechanism and the event-triggering mechanism. Moreover, for more efficient resource saving, we further show the feasibility of adaptive dynamic event-triggering mechanism for the desired stabilization.},

  abstract     = {Control design for linear systems typically involves pole placement and computing Lyapunov functions. While these tools are useful for ensuring stability, they are not always helpful in ensuring safety. Control designers can employ model checking as a tool for checking safety. We believe that supplementing the model checker to provide various types of counterexamples for the safety specification would help the control designer in the control development process. In this paper, we describe a technique for obtaining the variety of counterexamples for a safety violation in linear hybrid systems. More specifically, we develop algorithms to extract the longest counterexample — the execution that stays in the unsafe set for the longest contiguous time, deepest counterexample — the execution that ventures the most into the unsafe set in a user specified direction, and the robust counterexample — the unsafe execution from which some bounded perturbation yields a new counterexample. These measures for classifying counterexamples can further assist in quantifying controllers’ performance.},

Only the marginal posterior of the parameters used to describe the regressor-space partition is approximated, either in a batch mode using a Metropolis–Hastings Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, or sequentially using particle filters , while the conditional distribution of the other model parameters is computed analytically. Probability distributions for the predicted outputs given new test inputs are derived and modifications of the proposed approaches to address maximum-a-posteriori estimate are discussed. The performance of the proposed algorithms is shown via a numerical example and through a benchmark case study on data-driven modelling of the electronic component placement process in a pick-and-place machine.},

  abstract     = {Feedback control for averaged infinite horizon problems is a challenging task because the optimal way to operate such systems often exhibits a time-varying behavior, i.e. it cannot be represented as a steady state. We present a controller that is based on the excellent approximation properties of periodic solutions to such systems. The controller is capable of autonomously adapting both the optimal periodic trajectory as well as the optimal period itself in case the system parameters change. The amount of necessary a priori information for the controller setup is reduced compared to other Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) schemes and the resulting economic performance of the closed-loop is superior to schemes that use a fixed period. Complementary to the standard stability-theory for EMPC, our approach does not require dissipativity conditions and is based solely on assumptions on controllability of the dynamical system, existence of optimal periodic trajectories with descent directions for suboptimal periodic orbits and regularity of the EMPC subproblems. Based on these assumptions we show that the resulting closed-loop economically performs equally well as the optimal periodic trajectory. We illustrate the results with a numerical simulation of a highly nonlinear, unstable air-borne powerkite under varying wind conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers fully distributed adaptive protocol design for cooperative tracking problem based only on pure relative output information. To tackle leader’s trajectory in the presence of unknown control input, most of the existing observer-based protocols are designed based on absolute output information as well as the relative observer information among neighboring agents, which would suffer from potential network attack. To conquer such limitation, the definition of attack-free protocol is proposed, where no communication information exchange is allowed among neighboring agents, but only relative output measurement can be available. In this setting, the protocol is born to be free from network attack. By taking leader’s control input as external disturbance for each agent, some new kinds of full-order and reduced-order disturbance separation observers are introduced to achieve observation of consensus error. Based on such observer design methods, fully distributed adaptive protocols are successfully proposed to realize distributed tracking without using any absolute output information nor the spectrum information of the graph. Another favorable property of the protocols lies in the communication burden reduction, since to obtain the attack-free feature, each agent does not communicate its designed observer with its neighbors. The effectiveness of the proposed protocols are verified by numerical simulations on a group of transport aircrafts with short-period dynamics.},

By introducing the upper bound of sojourn time for each system mode, numerically testable stabilization criteria are established for discrete-time linear SMJSs via a novel form of Lyapunov function. The adopted Lyapunov matrix depends on the modes and their elapsed time simultaneously. Based on above-mentioned Lyapunov function combined with Projection Lemma, a desired mode-dependent stabilizing controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is mean-square stable.

Such a shortest path is of significant importance as it is usually required in real-world scenarios, such as taking a snapshot of a forbidden region or loitering above a ground sensor to collect data by a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle in a minimum time. By applying Pontryagin’s maximum principle, some geometric properties for the shortest path are established without considering any assumption on the relationship between the minimum turning radius and radius of the target circle, showing that the shortest path must lie in a sufficient family of 12 types. By employing those geometric properties, the analytical solution to each type is devised so that the length of each type can be computed in a constant time. In addition, some properties depending on problem parameters are found so that the shortest path can be computed without checking all the 12 types. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented, illustrating and validating the developments of the paper.},

Subsequently, the well-posedness of the closed-loop delayed PDE system is analyzed using the operator semigroup theory. Then, by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional candidate, a delay-dependent control-plus-guidance design is developed in the form of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs), such that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially convergent and the mobile actuator/sensor guidance can improve the transient response of closed-loop state. Moreover, an iterative algorithm based on linear matrix inequalities is provided to solve the BMIs.

Then, we propose a control strategy based on the identification of a zero-moment direction for the exerted force and a dynamic state feedback linearization based on this preferential direction, which locally asymptotically stabilizes the platform to a static hovering condition. Stability properties of the control law are rigorously proved through Lyapunov-based methods and reduction theorems for the stability of nested sets. Asymptotic zeroing of the error dynamics and convergence to the static hovering condition are then confirmed by simulation results on a star-shaped hexarotor model with tilted propellers.},

In the context of broad solutions, the state-feedback controller drives systems with globally Lipschitz nonlinearities from an arbitrary initial condition to the origin in minimum time. Alternatively, it is possible to satisfy a tracking objective at the uncontrolled boundary or, for systems with C 1 -coefficients and initial conditions, to design the control inputs to obtain classical C 1 -solutions that also reach the origin in finite time. Further, we design an observer that estimates the distributed state from boundary measurements only.

The method is based on splitting the Fokker–Planck equation represented by an integro-partial differential equation into the partial differentiation part for continuous diffusion and the integral part for discrete transition, and integrating the solution of each part. The propagated density function is used with a likelihood function in the Bayes’ formula to estimate the hybrid state for given sensor measurements. The unique feature of the proposed technique is that the probability density describing complete stochastic properties of the hybrid state is constructed without relying on the common Gaussian assumption, in contrast to other methods that compute certain expected values such as mean or variance. We apply the proposed method to the estimation of two examples: the bouncing ball model and the Dubins vehicle model. We show that the proposed technique yields propagated densities consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, more accurate estimates over the Gaussian based approach and some computational benefits over a particle filter.},

Is it possible to go beyond the limitations outlined in the very recent paper by Ortega et al. and show that the smooth version of the (maximum-torque-per-ampere) industry standard control scheme for non-salient-pole PMSMs (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors) – even including the outer Proportional-Integral control action on the rotor speed regulation error – guarantees global asymptotic (exponential on compact sets) stabilization of the desired equilibrium? The key technical point relies on the repeated use of the Persistency of Excitation Lemma, whereas a remarkable feature of the proposed analysis is constituted by the direct possibility of recovering, as a special case, the recent passivity-based arguments presented by Ortega et al. for non-salient-pole PMSMs.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a flatness-based approach to the fault diagnosis for a large class of parabolic and biharmonic distributed-parameter systems (DPS). The inputs, outputs and disturbances of the faulty DPS can be defined in-domain or at a boundary. Time-varying additive actuator and sensor faults of polynomial form are considered. In the presence of disturbances with polynomial form, fault identification is achieved in finite-time by evaluating an algebraic expression depending on the known inputs and measurements. This expression results from applying integral transformations to the faulty DPS. It is shown that the corresponding integral kernels follow from the flatness-based realization of a set-point change for a DPS. The solvability of the latter results in fault identifiability conditions. For bounded disturbances of unknown form acting on the DPS, a threshold for secured finite-time fault detection is introduced. The results of the paper are demonstrated for a cantilever beam subject to in-domain actuator and boundary sensor faults. For polynomial type and bounded stochastic disturbances fault detection is verified for the faulty beam in simulations.},

  abstract     = {Performance of adaptive control policies is assessed through the regret with respect to the optimal regulator, which reflects the increase in the operating cost due to uncertainty about the dynamics parameters. However, available results in the literature do not provide a quantitative characterization of the effect of the unknown parameters on the regret. Further, there are problems regarding the efficient implementation of some of the existing adaptive policies. Finally, results regarding the accuracy with which the system’s parameters are identified are scarce and rather incomplete. This study aims to comprehensively address these three issues. First, by introducing a novel decomposition of adaptive policies, we establish a sharp expression for the regret of an arbitrary policy in terms of the deviations from the optimal regulator. Second, we show that adaptive policies based on slight modifications of the Certainty Equivalence scheme are efficient. Specifically, we establish a regret of (nearly) square-root rate for two families of randomized adaptive policies. The presented regret bounds are obtained by using anti-concentration results on the random matrices employed for randomizing the estimates of the unknown parameters. Moreover, we study the minimal additional information on dynamics matrices that using them the regret will become of logarithmic order. Finally, the rates at which the unknown parameters of the system are being identified are presented.},

Different from time-triggered impulsive control in which the triggered time is determined artificially, ETIC is activated only when some well-designed events occur. Moreover, control input is only needed at triggered instants and there is no any control input during two consecutive triggered instants. As an application, the theoretical result is applied to nonlinear delay multi-agent systems. A class of ETIC strategies is designed to achieve consensus of the addressed systems.

This paper presents a general systems theoretic analysis framework for time-distributed optimization. The coupled plant-optimizer system is analyzed using input-to-state stability concepts and sufficient conditions for stability and constraint satisfaction are derived.

Motivated by the fact that accessing all real system modes is difficult in practice, hidden semi-Markov chains that are more general than semi-Markov chains are introduced to determine the mode switching of the studied system with hidden modes. By allowing for the transition probabilities of the associated embedded Markov chains depending on the operation time, the controlled system is an NHS-MJS that generalizes homogeneous hidden semi-Markov jump systems as well. The circumstance of limited knowledge of ST-PDFs is considered, which relaxes the universal assumption in hidden semi-Markov jump systems that all of PDFs must be completely known a priori . By means of a novel Lyapunov function, the conditions on the existence of a desired available-mode and elapsed-time-dependent controller are proposed, ensuring that the closed-loop NHS-MJS is mean-square stable.

  abstract     = {We consider constraint-coupled optimization problems in which agents of a network aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local objective functions subject to individual constraints and a common linear coupling constraint. We propose a novel optimization algorithm that embeds a dynamic average consensus protocol in the parallel Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to design a fully distributed scheme for the considered set-up. The dynamic average mechanism allows agents to track the time-varying coupling constraint violation (at the current solution estimates). The tracked version of the constraint violation is then used to update local dual variables in a consensus-based scheme mimicking a parallel ADMM step. Under convexity, we prove that all limit points of the agents’ primal solution estimates form an optimal solution of the constraint-coupled (primal) problem. The result is proved by means of a Lyapunov-based analysis simultaneously showing consensus of the dual estimates to a dual optimal solution, convergence of the tracking scheme and asymptotic optimality of primal iterates. A numerical study on optimal charging schedule of plug-in electric vehicles corroborates the theoretical results.},

To deal with non-convexity, we initialize the algorithm using a greedy method and exploit the submodularity and curvature properties of the coverage objective function to derive novel tighter performance bound guarantees on the optimization problem solution. Numerical examples are included to validate the effectiveness of this approach in diverse mission space configurations and different heterogeneous multi-agent collections.

Specifically, inter-agent communications over a network are assumed to fail at certain times due to jamming of transmissions by a malicious attacker. A new stochastic communication protocol is proposed to achieve finite-time practical consensus between agents. In this protocol, communication attempt times of agents are randomized and unknown by the attacker until after the agents make their communication attempts. Through a probabilistic analysis, we show that the proposed communication protocol, when combined with a stochastic ternary control law, allows agents to achieve consensus regardless of the frequency of attacks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our results by considering two different strategies of the jamming attacker: a deterministic attack strategy and a more malicious communication-aware attack strategy.},

As a first contribution, we propose a class of distributed algorithms that can be used to steer the strategies of the rational agents to a Nash equilibrium configuration, with guaranteed convergence under different sufficient conditions depending on the cost functions and on the network. A distinctive feature of the proposed class of algorithms is that agents use optimal responses instead of gradient type of strategy updates. As a second contribution, we show that the algorithm suggested for network aggregative games can also be used to recover a Nash equilibrium of average aggregative games (i.e., games where each agent is affected by the average of the strategies of the whole population) in a distributed fashion, that is, without requiring a central coordinator. We apply our theoretical results to multi-dimensional, convex-constrained opinion dynamics and to demand-response schemes for energy management.},

Several approaches have been proposed in the literature that allow CAVs to coordinate in situations where there is a potential conflict, for example, in signalized intersections, merging at roadways and roundabouts, to reduce energy consumption and optimize traffic flow. In this paper, we consider the problem of coordinating CAVs in a corridor consisting of multiple traffic scenarios. We formulate a two-level optimization problem in which we maximize traffic throughput in the upper-level problem, and derive a closed-form analytical solution that yields the optimal control input for each CAV, in terms of fuel consumption, in the low-level problem. We validate the effectiveness of the solution through simulation under 100\% CAV penetration rate. Fuel consumption and travel time for the vehicles are significantly reduced compared to a baseline scenario consisting of human-driven vehicles.},

In this paper, we study the properties of a general 3D vector field for robotic path following. We stipulate and investigate assumptions that turn out to be crucial for this method, although they are rarely explicitly stated in the existing related works. We derive conditions under which the local path-following error vanishes exponentially in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the desired path, which is key to show the local input-to-state stability (local ISS) property of the path-following error dynamics. The local ISS property then justifies the control algorithm design for a fixed-wing aircraft model. Our approach is effective for any sufficiently smooth desired path in 3D, bounded or unbounded; the results are particularly relevant since unbounded desired paths have not been sufficiently discussed in the literature. Simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The innovative concept of Electric Aircraft is a challenging topic involving different control objectives. For instance, it becomes possible to reduce the size and the weight of the generator by using the battery as an auxiliary generator in some operation phases. However, control strategies with different objectives can be conflicting and they can produce undesirable effects, even instability. For this reason an integrated control design approach is needed, such that stability can be guaranteed in any configuration. In other words, the design of the supervisory controller must be interlaced with that of low-level controllers. Moreover, uncertainties and noisy signals require robust control techniques and the use of adaptiveness in the control algorithm. In this paper, the use of a new adaptive sliding manifold design is proposed for increase robustness against uncertainties and noisy signals, together with a new supervisor exploiting the estimate of the region of attraction of the control laws. A bidirectional voltage converter aiming at recharging batteries and to use the battery to withstand generator overloads is addressed. Detailed and rigorous stability proofs are given for any control configuration, including the switching phases among different control objectives. Effectiveness of the proposed strategies is shown by using a detailed simulator including switching electronic components.},

  abstract     = {The behavior of heterogeneous multi-agent systems is studied when the coupling matrices are possibly all different and/or singular, that is, its rank is less than the system dimension. Rank-deficient coupling allows exchange of limited state information, which is suitable for the study of multi-agent systems under output coupling. We present a coordinate change that transforms the heterogeneous multi-agent system into a singularly perturbed form. The slow dynamics is still a reduced-order multi-agent system consisting of a weighted average of the vector fields of all agents, and some sub-dynamics of agents. The weighted average is an emergent dynamics, which we call a blended dynamics. By analyzing or synthesizing the blended dynamics, one can predict or design the behavior of a heterogeneous multi-agent system when the coupling gain is sufficiently large. For this result, stability of the blended dynamics is required. Since stability of the individual agent is not asked, the stability of the blended dynamics is the outcome of trading off the stability among the agents. It can be seen that, under the stability of the blended dynamics, the initial conditions of the individual agents are forgotten as time goes on, and thus, the behavior of the synthesized multi-agent system is initialization-free and is suitable for plug-and-play operation. As a showcase, we apply the proposed tool to four application problems; distributed state estimation for linear systems, practical synchronization of heterogeneous van der Pol oscillators, estimation of the number of nodes in a network, and a problem of distributed optimization.},

It is first proved that in infinite dimensional systems, the compact set Lipschitz condition is equivalent to the local Lipschitz condition. Then by providing a counterexample which is locally Lipschitz but is not bounded set Lipschitz, it is shown that the local Lipschitz condition is strictly weaker than the bounded set Lipschitz condition. In addition, the right hand side Lipschitz condition, which is frequently used in the study of time delay systems, is considered. It is shown that the right hand side Lipschitz condition and the local Lipschitz condition cannot imply each other.

In particular, we consider the emerging application of metamaterials, which are engineered structures supporting unconventional wave propagation phenomena. We design two kinds of absorbers. The first absorber achieves a complete elimination of wave reflections from the metamaterial boundaries independently of the working frequency regime. The associated controller is implemented in a feedback loop and is given in general terms of the metamaterial effective constitutive parameters. The second absorber blocks wave propagation beyond a prescribed location at the metamaterial interior with minimized back-scattering, thus generating a sink without any physical boundary present. It is implemented in a feed-forward loop via a unique near unidirectional control wave method, using two concentrated actuators. Both the interior and boundary absorbers are based on an exact fractional order transfer function model that we derive for the metamaterial. The model explicitly exhibits essential wave characteristics, including delays, dispersion, impedance, boundary reflections etc. The resulting controllers are of fractional order as well and are realized via a dedicated approximation technique. We verify the results by numerical simulations of a representative mechanical metamaterial.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, according to the properties of the given matrix of the continuous algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), a new positive semi-definite matrix is constructed. And then basing on some significant properties of the matrix eigenvalue and eigenvalue inequality, using inequality techniques and formula transformation and the new positive semi-definite matrix, a class of new upper bounds of the CARE is obtained. Consequently, in redundant control inputs system, by the derived bounds, inequality techniques, and the important property of the matrix eigenvalue and singular value, we present some new sufficient conditions to guarantee the decrease of controller gain when increasing the control input, which are more adaptable than previous results. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the results by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In unconstrained maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimation, the inverse of minus the merit-function Hessian matrix is an approximation of the estimate covariance matrix. In the Bayesian context of MAP estimation, it is the covariance of a normal approximation of the posterior around the mode; while in maximum likelihood estimation, it is an approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, to which the covariance of efficient estimators converges. These measures are routinely used in system identification to evaluate the estimate uncertainties and diagnose problems such as overparameterization, improper excitation and unidentifiability. A wide variety of estimation problems in systems and control, however, can be formulated as equality-constrained optimizations with additional decision variables to exploit parallelism in computer hardware, simplify implementation and increase the convergence basin and efficiency of the nonlinear program solver. The introduction of the extra variables, however, dissociates the inverse Hessian from the covariance matrix. Instead, submatrices of the inverse Hessian of the constrained-problem’s Lagrangian must be used. In this paper, we derive these relationships, showing how the estimates’ covariance can be estimated directly from the augmented problem. Application examples are shown in system identification with the output-error method and joint state-path and parameter estimation.},

By making use of the algebraic state-space approach to SBCNs, necessary and sufficient conditions for the stabilization at a given equilibrium point are presented. A new algorithm is proposed to determine all possible complete families of controllable sets for SBCNs, thereby all possible switching signal-dependent state feedback and output feedback controllers are obtained. Furthermore, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the output regulation problem, and we show that, upon satisfying such conditions, also this problem can be solved by means of switching signal-dependent state feedback and output feedback controllers.

We have proposed Multiple-Arrival Multiple-Deadline (MAMD) differentiated energy services for the flexible loads which require constant power for specified durations. Such loads are indifferent to the actual power delivery time as long as the duration requirements are satisfied between the specified arrival times and deadlines. The focus of this paper is the market implementation of such services. In a forward market, we establish the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium to verify the economic feasibility, which implies that selfish market participants can attain the maximum social welfare in a distributed manner. We also show the strengths of the MAMD services by simulation.},

  abstract     = {This paper treats the control design of a state-dependent switching function for discrete-time switched affine systems, assuring global asymptotic stability of a limit cycle. This limit cycle is determined according to criteria of interest related to the steady-state behaviour of the system trajectories, as for instance, its mean value, oscillation amplitude and frequency. More specifically, based on a time-varying convex Lyapunov function, a min-type switching rule is determined in order to orchestrate the state trajectories, evolving from any initial condition, towards the desired limit cycle. Most of the available methodologies are able to guide the state trajectories to a set of attraction containing the equilibrium point, assuring its practical stability. However, although important, the behaviour of the trajectories inside this set is not considered. Differently, the proposed technique assures an appropriate steady-state behaviour by adequately designing the limit cycle. Moreover, the proposed conditions take into account H 2 and H ∞ guaranteed costs, assuring also a suitable transient response. All the conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities being simple to solve by readily available tools. Illustrative examples, one of them concerning the voltage regulation of a DC–DC multicellular converter, are used for validation and comparison.},

It is shown that the reachable set of the system under this assumption is an evolving ellipsoid with a matrix being a solution to the linear matrix differential or difference equation. This result is used to synthesize optimal observers and estimators providing the minimal ellipsoidal sets as the estimates of the system state and unknown parameters, respectively, as well as optimal controllers steering the system state into a final target ellipsoidal set or keeping the entire system trajectory in a prescribed ellipsoidal tube under all admissible initial states and disturbances. The relationships between the optimal ellipsoidal observer and the Kalman filter as well as between the optimal ellipsoidal estimator and the recursive least weighted squares algorithm are established.

The weight of a directed edge indicates the decay or growth rate of the Lyapunov functions. It is proved that an SLS is switching stabilizable if and only if there exists a GCLF. The main benefits of GCLFs are reduced computational cost and conservatism for stabilizability tests. Besides, we show that the proposed GCLF framework unifies several control Lyapunov functions and the related stabilization theorems. Moreover, we propose a distributed algorithm to evaluate the stabilizability with reduced computational costs by taking benefits of the graph structure of GCLFs.

  abstract     = {A matrix A is called totally positive (TP) if all its minors are positive, and totally nonnegative (TN) if all its minors are nonnegative. A square matrix A is called oscillatory if it is TN and some power of A is TP. A linear time-varying system is called an oscillatory discrete-time system (ODTS) if the matrix defining its evolution at each time k is oscillatory. We analyze the properties of n -dimensional time-varying nonlinear discrete-time systems whose variational system is an ODTS, and show that they have a well-ordered behavior. More precisely, if the nonlinear system is time-varying and T -periodic then any trajectory either leaves any compact set or converges to an ( ( n − 1 ) T ) -periodic trajectory, that is, a subharmonic trajectory. These results hold for any dimension n . The analysis of such systems requires establishing that a line integral of the Jacobian of the nonlinear system is an oscillatory matrix. This is non-trivial, as the sum of two oscillatory matrices is not necessarily oscillatory, and this carries over to integrals. We derive several new sufficient conditions guaranteeing that the line integral of a matrix is oscillatory, and demonstrate how this yields interesting classes of discrete-time nonlinear systems that admit a well-ordered behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new discrete-time filter proportional–integral–derivative (FPID) controller framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The discrete-time FPID controller plays an important role in both determining the dynamic response of the system and further improving the performance of the controller in itself. However, the introduction of the filter parameter brings more challenge for the design of discrete-time FPID controllers than that of discrete-time PID controllers. A novel result on the co-design of such a controller via dominant eigenvalue assignment is first provided, which enables us to tune the controller directly in accordance with the desired system performance indexes. Then, a further result on the discrete-time FPID controller design to improve the dynamic response of the closed-loop system is derived by placing the non-dominant eigenvalues in some assigned region. Compared with the discrete-time PID controller, on the one hand, the discrete-time FPID controller plays a significant role in improving the output of the controller in addition to guaranteeing the desired dynamic performance of the closed-loop system. On the other hand, a discrete-time FPID controller makes it possible to expand the effective parameter region and give a set of parameters which makes the controller achieve the objective of dominant eigenvalue assignment for the closed-loop system when a traditional discrete-time PID controller cannot do. Numerical examples have illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {The asynchronously switched multi-agent systems comprising switched agents of different dynamics and switching signals are considered under arbitrarily switching communication topologies. The practical output synchronization problem is studied for such a kind of systems due to the heterogeneity brought by both the dynamics and the switchings of agents. A switching-dependent controller with an embedded virtual reference system is proposed for each agent. The original problem is then converted into tracking problems between each agent and its reference system. The analysis of resultant tracking error systems involves the analysis of switched systems with bounded but non-attenuating state impulses. By satisfying sufficient conditions featuring the average dwell time (ADT) and the newly proposed piecewise ADT, the practical output synchronization can be achieved and the ultimate bound of the output errors can also be obtained for the considered systems. Furthermore, a realistic case where the agent switching signals undergo adverse fast-switching perturbations is studied. The perturbations may potentially invalidate the “slow-switching” based method. A regulation strategy is thus developed for each agent to render it adaption to such adversity. A payload transport task is taken as the practical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the adaption strategy.},

Every admissible value in these regions moves the poles of the closed-loop system towards the left of the complex plane such that stability improvement is achieved. The concept of potent asymptotic stability is first introduced, referring to the property that all the poles of the closed-loop system are stable and lie on the left of open-loop system poles in the complex plane. Analytical characterizations on parameter pairs of time delay and controller gain that result in potent asymptotic stability are established. All the poles and corresponding root locus with respect to gain are examined. Numerical examples and simulations are given to illustrate the usefulness and merits of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {System opacity is a widely studied security notion, implying that a secret behaviour of a given system cannot be seen or assessed by an external observer based on the system evolution. This work deals with the problem of current-state opacity formulation and verification in the context of discrete event systems modelled with partially observed Petri nets (POPNs) (i.e., Petri nets containing place sensors that measure the number of tokens in observable places and event sensors that indicate the firing of observable transitions). A Petri net system is recognized as current-state opaque if the current-state estimate is never entirely contained in the set of secret states. In this regard, we introduce the notion of discernible markings to design a reduced state estimator called a discernible reachability graph, and then come up with formal modelling of current-state opacity in POPN systems. The main idea of the proposed approach consists in proving that if a system is current-state opaque, its current-state estimate, possibly established by an intruder, contains at least one non-secret state. We exploit the mathematical feasibility to formulate this concept by defining and solving an integer linear programming problem with respect to a given secret and an observation sequence collected from sensors. In the light of the proposed modelling, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for opacity verification, and examples are given to expose the results.},

Different from the dominant single hidden layer neural networks, the hidden layer in the EHH neural network can be seen as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and all the nodes in the DAG contribute to the output. It is proved that for every EHH neural network, there is an equivalent adaptive hinging hyperplanes (AHH) tree, the model of which was proposed based on the hinging hyperplanes (HH) model and finds good applications in system identification. Analog to the proof for the AHH model, the universal approximation ability of the EHH neural network is provided. Different from other neural networks, the EHH neural network has interpretability, which can be easily obtained through its ANOVA decomposition (or interaction matrix). The interpretability can then be used as an indication for the importance of the input variables. The construction of the EHH neural network includes initial network generation and parameter optimization (including the structure and weights parameter optimization). A descent algorithm for searching the locally optimal EHH neural network is proposed and the worst-case complexity of the algorithm is also provided. The EHH neural network is applied in nonlinear system identification, the simulation results show that satisfactory accuracy can be achieved with relatively low computational cost, and at the same time, some insights into the importance of the regressors and the interactions among the regressors can be revealed.},

The local controller operates independently. Given any large delays, the predictor which exponentially stabilizes each uncoupled system, will stabilize the coupled one provided that the coupling is not solid. We propose two methods for the delay compensation: the backstepping-based partial differential equation (PDE) approach and the reduction-based ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach. We present decentralized Lyapunov-based analysis under the two predictor methods. It appears that the first predictor method leads to simpler conditions and manages with larger delays, whereas the second is easily applied to decentralized asynchronous sampled-data implementation, both under continuous and under discrete-time measurements. Through a benchmark example of two coupled cart–pendulum systems, the proposed methods are demonstrated to be effective when the input delays are too large for the system to be stabilized without a predictor.},

To resolve the coexistent uncertainties in delay and input vector, a reduction-based change of variable and a backstepping–forwarding transformation of the finite-dimensional plant state and the infinite-dimensional actuator state are introduced. Making use of these conversions, the certainty-equivalence-based control law and the Lyapunov-based update law are developed for adaptive stabilization.},

  abstract     = {Function estimation using the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework is a powerful tool for identification of a general class of nonlinear dynamical systems without requiring much a priori information on model orders and nonlinearities involved. However, the high degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of RKHS estimators has its price, as in case of large scale function estimation problems, they often require a serious amount of data samples to explore the search space adequately for providing high-performance model estimates. In cases where nonlinear dynamic relations can be expressed as a sum of functions, the literature proposes solutions to this issue by enforcing sparsity for adequate restriction of the DOFs of the estimator, resulting in parsimonious model estimates. Unfortunately, all existing solutions are based on greedy approaches, leading to optimization schemes which cannot guarantee convergence to the global optimum. In this paper, we propose an ℓ 1 -regularized non-parametric RKHS estimator which is the solution of a quadratic optimization problem. Effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated on the non-parametric identification problem of LPV-IO models where the method solves simultaneously (i) the model order selection problem (in terms of number of input–output lags and input delay in the model structure) and (ii) determining the unknown functional dependency of the model coefficients on the scheduling variable directly from data. The paper also provides an extensive simulation study to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

The objective of the addressed variance-constrained estimation problem is to construct a recursive state estimator such that, in the simultaneous presence of event-based transmission strategy, randomly switching topologies as well as multiple missing measurements, a locally optimal upper bound is guaranteed on the estimation error covariance by properly determining the estimator gain, where the desired estimator gain matrix is formulated via the solutions to certain recursive matrix equations. Besides, theoretical analysis is conducted on the monotonicity regarding the missing probabilities of degraded measurements and the obtained upper bound matrix. Finally, some simulations with comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of proposed event-triggered state estimation method.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the state estimation problem for dynamic systems subject to uncertain constraints, i.e., all possible constraints are described by a finite set, and only one constraint is satisfied at each moment. For this typical hybrid system estimation problem with coupled discrete constraint modes and continuous states, we design a mode separability-based state estimation (MSSE) framework. Based on the measurement model over a window, the hypothesis testing is performed to detect whether the mode changes firstly. Then the maximum-likelihood criterion is used to estimate the mode change sequence once detecting the change. Next, to consider the possible impact of the decided modes on the state estimation, a metric of mode separability is proposed to evaluate the separability of the recognized modes, and two different state estimation methods are introduced. Specifically, if the recognized modes are separable from the others, the state estimates are obtained by a recursive mode-based constraint Kalman filter (MCKF) which is proved that the estimation error is bounded in mean square. Otherwise, the estimation results output the fused state estimates (FSE) of the inseparable modes. Finally, simulation results of road-constrained vehicle tracking are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

This paper characterizes the controllable subspace and herdability of signed weighted networks. Specifically, a dynamic signed leader–follower network is considered, in which a small subset of the network nodes (i.e., the leaders) is endowed with exogenous control input and the remaining nodes are influenced by the leaders via the underlying network connectivity. The considered network permits positive and negative edges to capture cooperative and competitive interactions, resulting in a signed graph. Motivated by practical application, the system states are required to be driven by the leaders to be element-wise above a positive threshold, i.e., a specific subset rather than the entire state space as in classical controllability. Graph partitions are exploited to characterize the controllable subspace of the system, from which sufficient conditions are derived to render the system herdable. It is revealed that the quotient graph can be used to infer the herdability of the original graph, wherein criteria of the herdability of quotient graphs are developed based on positive systems. Examples are provided to illustrate the developed topological characterizations.},

Flatness-based motion planning and feedforward control are combined with a backstepping-based boundary controller to stabilize the distributed parameter system of the tracking error. The tracking controller utilizes the required state information from a Luenberger-type state observer. By means of an exogenous system the relocation of formation profiles is achieved. The transfer of the control strategy to a finite-dimensional discrete multi-agent system is obtained by a suitable finite difference discretization of the continuum model, which in addition imposes a leader–follower communication topology. The results are evaluated both in simulation studies and in experiments for a swarm of mobile robots realizing the transition between different stable and unstable formation profiles.},

Importantly, the robustness of the controller is considered with respect to delays in the actuation and in the measurements but also with respect to uncertainties on parameters, most importantly transport velocities. The proposed control law introduces three degrees of freedom (by means of tuning parameters) on which we give general conditions to guarantee the existence of robustness margins. We show that to tune these degrees of freedom and allow potential robustness trade-offs, it is necessary to consider all the different types of uncertainties simultaneously as it is the only way to ensure the existence of non-zero robustness margins. Provided that these conditions are satisfied, these tuning parameters enable a trade-off between performance and robustness, between disturbance rejection and sensitivity to noise. The existence of robustness margins and the Input To State Stability of the system are proved combining backstepping transformations and classical complex analysis techniques.},

(2016), we study two continuous-time opinion dynamics models (Model 1 and Model 2) where the individuals discuss opinions on multiple logically interdependent topics. The logical interdependence between the different topics is captured by a “logic” matrix, which is distinct from the Laplacian matrix capturing interactions between individuals. For each of Model 1 and Model 2, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the network to reach to a consensus on each separate topic. The condition on Model 1 involves a combination of the eigenvalues of the logic matrix and Laplacian matrix, whereas the condition on Model 2 requires only separate conditions on the logic matrix and Laplacian matrix. Further investigation of Model 1 yields two sufficient conditions for consensus, and allows us to conclude that one way to guarantee a consensus is to reduce the rate of interaction between individuals exchanging opinions. By placing further restrictions on the logic matrix, we also establish a set of Laplacian matrices which guarantee consensus for Model 1. The two models are also expanded to include stubborn individuals, who remain attached to their initial opinions. Sufficient conditions are obtained for guaranteeing convergence of the opinion dynamics system, with the final opinions generally being at a persistent disagreement. Simulations are provided to illustrate the results.},

In contrast, the Stackelberg equilibria are always fully revealing. In the multi-stage signaling game where the transmission of a Gauss–Markov source over a memoryless Gaussian channel is considered, affine policies constitute an invariant subspace under best response maps for Nash equilibria; whereas the Stackelberg equilibria always admit linear policies for scalar sources but such policies may be non-linear for multi-dimensional sources.

A two-stage particle filtering (PF) algorithm is proposed to achieve simultaneous measurement recovery and state estimation. In our scheme, the second-stage resampling procedure can be implemented concurrently, resulting in a significant reduction of execution time. Two examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

In doing the saturation reduction analysis, an intractable problem is how to estimate the states of the oscillator. Fully using the property of saturation functions as well as the technique of Lyapunov inequalities, we can first estimate the states of the oscillator and then achieve the time-derivative bounds that some saturated terms possess in a finite time. This has helped to carry out the saturation reduction analysis.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the synchronization problem for networks over finite fields is investigated, which is a generalization of consensus and provides a new perspective for networks of agents with limited capacities of memory and communication. It is assumed that the states and communication weights can only attain values from a finite alphabet equipped with a prime number of integers, termed finite fields, and operations are processed relying on modular arithmetic. For this synchronization problem, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived based on the transition graph of the studied network. The large number of nodes in the transition graph, dependent on the numbers of integers in finite fields and the agents, may lead to high computational cost and difficulties in verifying synchronization. To avoid this, an equivalent condition for synchronization of networks is provided by the characteristic polynomial of the studied network matrix. Furthermore, in a synchronized network over finite fields, the periodic behavior can be determined by the network matrix and the initial state.},

  abstract     = {The paper presents a novel strategy to control the instantaneous rotational velocity of a planar slider subject to a soft contact with friction and to external loads, including gravity. The approach is based on a novel model that combines the LuGre dynamic friction model with the limit surface concept for two main reasons. First, the limit surface allows considering both translational and rotational sliding motions. Secondly, the actual friction provided at the contact by the LuGre dynamic model exhibits dependence on the rate of variation of the external loads and, thus, it is worthwhile in dynamic conditions. Slipping control is realized by acting on the friction forces through the normal load so as to stably regulate the velocity of the slider to zero. The control law exploits a nonlinear observer, based on the proposed model, to estimate the instantaneous rotational velocity of the slider, which is used to compute the normal load necessary to ensure a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of the slider. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in an application of robotic manipulation using an industrial gripper sensorized with force/tactile sensors.},

  abstract     = {Optimal control is a prominent approach in robotics and movement neuroscience, among other fields of science. Methods for deriving optimal choices of action have been classically devised either in deterministic or stochastic settings. Here, we consider a setting in-between that retains the stochastic aspect of the controlled system but assumes deterministic open-loop control actions. The rationale stems from observations about the neural control of movement which highlighted that relatively stable behaviors can be achieved without feedback circuitry, via open-loop motor commands adequately tuning the mechanical impedance of the neuromusculoskeletal system. Yet, effective methods for deriving optimal open-loop controls for stochastic systems are lacking overall. This work presents a continuous-time approach based on statistical linearization techniques for the efficient computation of optimal open-loop controls for a broad class of stochastic optimal control problems. We first show that non-trivial departure from the optimal solutions of classical deterministic and stochastic approaches may arise for simple synthetic examples, thereby stressing the originality of the framework. We then exemplify its potential relevance to the planning of biological movement by showing that a well-known phenomenon in motor control, referred to as muscle co-contraction, occurs naturally. More generally, this stochastic optimal control framework may be suited to other fields where the design of optimal open-loop actions is relevant.},

By taking advantage of the triangular structure, we develop a semiglobal backstepping approach for the construction of a set of parameterized Lyapunov functions, associated sublevel sets and nested high-gain linear state feedback laws, step-by-step. To prevent the shrinking of domains of attraction and overcome the complexity of the semiglobal design based on the rational Lyapunov functions (Teel and Praly, 1995), we introduce the notion of sublevel set and a set of parameterized Lyapunov functions that are well-defined in the entire space, and show how they can be constructed recursively, which are instrumental in solving the SGAS problem by partial linear state feedback.},

Based on this analysis, we propose a Kullback–Libeler divergence based criterion in view of which each agent detects its neighbors’ misbehavior and, consequently, forms a self-belief about the trustworthiness of the information it receives. Agents continuously update their self-beliefs and communicate them with their neighbors to inform them of the significance of their outgoing information. Moreover, if the self-belief of an agent is low, it forms trust on its neighbors. Agents incorporate their neighbors’ self-beliefs and their own trust values on their control protocols to slow down and mitigate attacks. We show that using the proposed resilient approach, an agent discards the information it receives from a neighbor only if its neighbor is compromised, and not solely based on the discrepancy among neighbors’ information, which might be caused by legitimate changes, and not attacks. The proposed approach is guaranteed to work under mild connectivity assumptions.},

To avoid data collisions, the SCP is applied to determine the transmission order of the signals/packets for each sensor. The considered scheduling behavior is characterized by mutually uncorrelated random variables with known probability distributions. Recursive distributed filters are proposed to estimate the system state through available information from both individual and neighboring nodes in the sensor network according to a given topology. Attention is focused on the design of distributed filters in order to ensure the locally minimal upper bound on the error variance of the state estimation. Sufficient conditions are first established, via intensive stochastic analysis and mathematical induction, on the existence of an upper bound of the estimation error variance. Then, by means of a matrix simplification technique, the desired filter gains are designed to optimize the obtained upper bound at each shift step.

By appropriately decomposing the original optimization problems into smaller size subproblems and then solving them in a distributed manner, the expected floating point operations (flops) can be reduced dramatically. We show that the convergence of the AUV trajectory can be guaranteed by the proposed contraction constraints in the decomposed subproblems. Recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are proved.

  abstract     = {Difference equations, such as a Ricker map, for an increased value of the parameter, experience instability of the positive equilibrium and transition to deterministic chaos. To achieve stabilization, various methods can be applied. Proportional Feedback control suggests a proportional reduction of the state variable at every k th step. First, if k ≠ 1 , a cycle is stabilized rather than an equilibrium. Second, the equation can incorporate an additive noise term, describing the variability of the environment, as well as multiplicative noise corresponding to possible deviations in the control intensity. The present paper deals with both issues, it justifies a possibility of getting a stable blurred k -cycle. Presented examples include the Ricker model, as well as equations with unbounded f , such as the bobwhite quail population models. Though the theoretical results justify stabilization for either multiplicative or additive noise only, numerical simulations illustrate that a blurred cycle can be stabilized when both multiplicative and additive noises are involved.},

  abstract     = {Binary sensors compress the measurement information into two possible values as output and have found applications in many fields such as medical monitoring, environment monitoring and localization. This paper is concerned with the fusion estimation problem for a class of binary sensor systems with bounded noises, where the monitored physical process is described by time-varying state-space models. Since binary sensors only provide the valid information at the switching instant, a novel uncertain measurement model is proposed to characterize this feature. Then, by constructing an upper bound of fusion/estimation error at each time, convex optimization problems are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities to design stable centralized and distributed fusion estimators. An illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Such effects are encountered by human evacuation of indoor environments with carbon monoxide as the hazardous field. The accumulated amount of carbon monoxide inhaled during the flight to escape plays a detrimental role in the ability of an evacuee to escape; if this accumulated amount inhaled exceeds a threshold value the evacuee is incapacitated. Using the accumulated amount, represented by the line integral of the spatial field along the chosen escape trajectory, as an augmented state, the navigation problem is cast as an optimal control problem. The solution to the 3D navigation over hazardous fields, which is applicable to both human evacuees in indoor environments and mobile robots traversing over hazardous environments, is presented and a related problem of minimizing the accumulated amount is also formulated and solved. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the proposed results.},

Each agent has sequentially arriving samples of its belief in an online manner. The neighbor relationships among the n agents are described by a graph which is possibly time-varying, whose vertices correspond to agents and whose edges depict neighbor relationships. Two distributed online algorithms are introduced for undirected and directed graphs, which are both shown to converge to the average belief almost surely. Moreover, the sequences generated by both algorithms are shown to reach consensus with an O ( 1 ∕ t ) rate with high probability, where t is the number of iterations For undirected graphs, the corresponding algorithm is modified for the case with quantized communication and limited precision of the division operation. It is shown that the modified algorithm causes all n agents to either reach a quantized consensus or enter a small neighborhood around the average of their beliefs.

After proving the solution equivalence between the deterministic scenario and the stochastic one in the sense of optimal state and fault estimation, a unified solution, based on a Riccati-like equation recursion, can be established by weighting parameterization for two-dimensional systems in deterministic and stochastic cases. The unified solution also works as the optimal state observer and generalized Kalman filter for two-dimensional singular systems. Generalization discussions concerning different system descriptions with respect to fault as well as the implementations of the proposed estimator are also presented.

  abstract     = {We consider a linear system affected by an additive stochastic disturbance and address the design of a finite horizon control policy that is optimal according to some cost criterion and accounts also for probabilistic constraints on both the input and state variables. The resulting policy can be implemented over a receding horizon according to the model predictive control strategy. Such a possibility, however, is hampered by the fact that a feasibility issue may arise when recomputing the policy. Infeasibility indeed can occur if the disturbance has unbounded support and the state is required to remain in a bounded set. In this paper, we propose a solution to this issue that is based on the introduction of a constraint relaxation that becomes effective only when the original problem turns out to be unfeasible. This is obtained via a cascade of two probabilistically-constrained optimization problems where, in the first one, performance is neglected and the policy is designed to fully recover feasibility or – if this is not possible – to determine the minimum level of relaxation which is needed to recover feasibility; in the second step, such a minimum relaxation level is imposed while optimally (re-)tuning the control policy parameters. Both problems are solved through a computationally tractable scenario-based scheme using a finite number of disturbance realizations and providing an approximate solution that satisfies with high confidence the original probabilistic constraints of the cascade.},

Thus, a single vehicle is unable to localize the source and has to cooperate with its neighboring vehicles. By jointly exploiting the ideas of the consensus algorithm and the stochastic extremum seeking (ES), this paper proposes novel distributed stochastic ES controllers, which are gradient-free and do not need any absolute information, such that the multi-vehicle system simultaneously approaches the source position. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is proved for quadratic scalar fields. Finally, illustrative examples are included to validate the theoretical results.},

Motorized functional electrical stimulation induced cycling is a rehabilitation treatment where multiple lower-limb muscle groups are activated jointly with an electric motor to achieve cycling objectives such as speed (cadence) and torque tracking. This paper examines torque tracking accomplished by the stimulation of six lower-limb muscles via a novel spatial repetitive learning control and cadence regulation by an electric motor using a sliding-mode controller. A desired torque trajectory is constructed based on the rider’s kinematic efficiency, which is a function of the crank position. The learning controller takes advantage of the periodicity of the desired torque trajectory to provide a feedforward input to the stimulated muscles. A passivity-based analysis is developed to ensure stability of the torque and cadence closed-loop error systems. The muscle learning and electric motor controllers were implemented in real-time during cycling experiments on five able-bodied individuals and three participants with movement disorders. The combined average cadence tracking error was 0 . 01 ± 1 . 20 RPM for a 50 RPM trajectory and the combined average power tracking error was 1 . 78 ± 1 . 25 W for a peak power of 10 W.},

We analyze the computational complexity of the formulated optimization problem. To minimize the ℓ 0 and ℓ 2 norms of the added perturbations, we derive their convex relaxations which can be efficiently solved.

Performing a suitable change of coordinates, the latter result can be used to design a controller that is able to track reference trajectories that are solutions of the unperturbed fractional-order system. To overcome the challenges associated with the generation of such solutions, we address the practical case where the references to be tracked are generated as a solution of a specific finite-dimensional approximation of the original fractional-order system. In this case, the tracking error trajectory is driven to an asymptotic bound that is increasing with the magnitude of the disturbances and decreases with the increment in the accuracy of the approximation. The proposed controllers are finite-dimensional, in the sense that the computation of the control input only requires a finite number of previous state and input vectors of the system.

To alleviate the effect of observation biases, an event-triggered update based DKF is presented with a tighter mean square error (MSE) bound than that of the time-driven one by designing a proper threshold. Both the two DKFs are shown to provide the upper bounds of MSE online for each sensor. Under mild conditions on systems and networks, the MSE boundedness and asymptotic unbiasedness for the proposed two DKFs are proved. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed filters.},

  abstract     = {We establish stability results for PD tracking control laws in bipedal walking robots. Stability of PD control laws for continuous robotic systems is an established result, and we extend this for hybrid robotic systems, an alternating sequence of continuous and discrete events. Bipedal robots have the leg-swing as the continuous event, and the foot-strike as the discrete event. In addition, bipeds largely have underactuations due to the interactions between feet and ground. For each continuous event, we establish that the convergence rate of the tracking error can be regulated via appropriate tuning of the PD gains; and for each discrete event, we establish that this convergence rate sufficiently overcomes the nonlinear impacts by assumptions on the hybrid zero dynamics. The main contributions are (1) Extension of the stability results of PD control laws for underactuated robotic systems, and (2) Exponential ultimate boundedness of hybrid periodic orbits under the assumption of exponential stability of their projections to the hybrid zero dynamics. Towards the end, we will validate these results in a 2-link bipedal walker in simulation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problems with possibly non-convex cost subject to constraints on states and inputs. For these problems, we present a computational approach for the verification of strict dissipativity properties, which have recently been employed to study optimal system operation, turnpike phenomena, and closed-loop properties of economic model predictive control schemes. Based on a non-strict dissipation inequality, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for strict dissipativity by explicitly computing the set w.r.t. which the system is strictly dissipative as well as the corresponding storage function. We focus on strict dissipativity w.r.t. periodic orbits and steady-states, being the most relevant cases of strict dissipativity, although our approach can be directly extended to strict dissipativity w.r.t. more general sets. For polynomial optimal control problems, the presented approach leads to a polynomial optimization problem, which is solved via sum-of-squares programming. The optimal periodic orbit can then be constructed, without a priori knowledge of its period length, as the set of points for which a suitable non-strict dissipation inequality holds with equality. In addition, we consider the important special case of indefinite linear quadratic optimal control problems subject to quadratic constraints, for which an optimal periodic orbit resulting from our construction is always located on the boundary of the constraint set.},

For unknown quantum states represented by density matrices, performing measurements under certain basis yields random outcomes, from which a classical linear regression model can be established. First of all, for complete or over-complete measurement bases, we show that the empirical data can be utilized for the construction of a weighted least squares estimate (LSE) for quantum tomography. Taking into consideration the trace-one condition, a constrained weighted LSE can be explicitly computed, being the optimal unbiased estimation among all linear estimators. Next, for general measurement bases, we show that ℓ 2 -regularization with proper regularization gain provides even a lower mean-square error under a cost in bias. The optimal regularization parameter is defined in terms of a risk characterization for any finite sample size and a resulting implementable estimator is proposed. Finally, a concise and unified formula is established for the regularization parameter with complete measurement basis under an equivalent regression model, which proves that the proposed implementable tuning estimator is asymptotically optimal as the number of copies grows to infinity. Additionally, several numerical examples are provided to validate the established results.},

  abstract     = {Distributed optimization techniques offer high quality solutions to various engineering problems, such as resource allocation and distributed estimation and control. In this work, we first consider distributed convex constrained optimization problems where the objective function is encoded by multiple local and possibly nonsmooth objectives privately held by a group of agents, and propose a distributed subgradient method with double averaging (abbreviated as DSA 2 ) that only requires peer-to-peer communication and local computation to solve the global problem. The algorithmic framework builds on dual methods and dynamic average consensus; the sequence of test points is formed by iteratively minimizing a local dual model of the overall objective where the coefficients, i.e., approximated subgradients of the objective, are supplied by the dynamic average consensus scheme. We theoretically show that DSA 2 enjoys non-ergodic convergence properties, i.e., the local minimizing sequence itself is convergent, a distinct feature that cannot be found in existing results. Specifically, we establish a convergence rate of O ( 1 t ) in terms of objective function error. Then, extensions are made to tackle distributed optimization problems with coupled functional constraints by combining DSA 2 and dual decomposition. This is made possible by Lagrangian relaxation that transforms the coupling in constraints of the primal problem into that in cost functions of the dual, thus allowing us to solve the dual problem via DSA 2 . Both the dual objective error and the quadratic penalty for the coupled constraint are proved to converge at a rate of O ( 1 t ) , and the primal objective error asymptotically vanishes. Numerical experiments and comparisons are conducted to illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithms and validate our theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we provide a compositional approach for constructing finite abstractions (a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)) of interconnected discrete-time stochastic switched systems. The proposed framework is based on a notion of stochastic simulation functions , using which one can employ an abstract system as a substitution of the original one in the controller design process with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. To this end, we first provide probabilistic closeness guarantees between the interconnection of stochastic switched subsystems and that of their finite abstractions via stochastic simulation functions. We then leverage sufficient small-gain type conditions to show compositionality results of this work. Afterwards, we show that under standard assumptions ensuring incremental input-to-state stability of switched systems (i.e., existence of common incremental Lyapunov functions, or multiple incremental Lyapunov functions with dwell-time ), one can construct finite MDPs for the general setting of nonlinear stochastic switched systems. We also propose an approach to construct finite MDPs together with their corresponding stochastic simulation functions for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic switched systems. We show that for this class of systems, the aforementioned incremental stability property can be readily checked by matrix inequalities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed results, we first apply our approaches to a road traffic network in a circular cascade ring composed of 200 cells, and construct compositionally a finite MDP of the network. We employ the constructed finite abstractions as substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies keeping the density of the traffic lower than 20 vehicles per cell. We then apply our proposed techniques to a fully interconnected network of 500 nonlinear subsystems (totally 1000 dimensions), and construct their finite MDPs with guaranteed error bounds. We compare our proposed results with those available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In dynamic DNA nanotechnology, the DNA strand displacement technique provides the cornerstone for the bottom-up design of a man-made DNA molecular system. Practically, a feedback controller for regulating the concentration of a target DNA strand to the desired level is indispensable for mediating the kinetic momentum of a molecular actuator. However, such a regulator system operates by consuming fuel strands and requires sufficient supplies of these consumables for its normal execution, indicating that, in practice, optimal controller design requires the period of time during which the regulator proceeds with normal operation to be as long as possible. The fact that the system is naturally high dimensional and nonlinear complicates the analysis of properties emerging during a finite-time period in terms of their theoretical aspects. In this paper, we first define the new concept of a “finite-time regulation property” of DNA systems in the regulation problem. Then, to theoretically analyze this regulation property, we present two-time-scale modeling based on the difference in the initial distribution of the abundance of DNA strands. Focusing on the fast mode as a subsystem with a positive quadratic structure, we propose a new method for analyzing the regulation property observed in a finite period of time.},

Despite its simplicity and appeal, the DW model has proved technically hard to analyze and its most basic convergence properties, easy to observe numerically, are only conjectures. This paper solves the convergence problem for the heterogeneous DW model with the weighting factor not less than 1 ∕ 2 . We establish that, for any positive confidence bounds and initial values, the opinion of each agent will converge to a limit value almost surely, and the convergence rate is exponential in mean square. Moreover, we show that the limiting opinions of any two agents either are the same or have a distance larger than the confidence bounds of the two agents. Finally, we provide some sufficient conditions for the heterogeneous DW model to reach consensus.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we consider the estimation of temperature along the pipes of concentric heat exchanger tubes in which CO 2 is the working fluid. The transport phenomenon is modeled using (2x2) linear hyperbolic partial differential equations, with one rightward equation for the hot flow and one leftward equation for the cold flow. Both flows exchange energy through the wall interface, which physically induces a coupling between the two dynamics. Our objective is to estimate the temperature distribution along the flows from measurements at the tubes boundaries only. In this framework, we propose an adaptive boundary observer that can estimate not only the full state of the system, but also unknown in-domain parameters. The design is based on transforming the error system via a finite-dimensional backstepping-like transformation into a desired filter-based system, for which standard backstepping observer techniques and adaptation laws can be used. The theoretical results are evaluated against the temperature measurements taken from a CO 2 refrigeration apparatus built at CERN, Switzerland.},

The objective is twofold: to look at how the internal model principle works for the output tracking of PDEs; and to see how to design a robust tracking error feedback control for PDEs. To this purpose, we first select a frozen case with specially selected frozen coefficients of the disturbances. For this frozen system, we design a feedforward control by solving simply regulator equation and an infinite-dimensional extended state observer in terms of tracking error only which gives an estimation of both states of the frozen plant and exosystem. An observer-based tracking error feedback control is then designed for the frozen system, which is shown to be in line with the internal model principle. As a result, the system is shown to be robust to system uncertainty and disturbances in all channels. The numerical simulations validate the results.},

A network of qubits forms a composite quantum system whose state undergoes unitary evolution in between periodic measurements, leading to hybrid quantum dynamics with random jumps at discrete time instances along a continuous orbit. The measurements either act on the entire network of qubits, or only a subset of qubits. First of all, we reveal that this type of hybrid quantum dynamics induces probabilistic Boolean recursions representing the measurement outcomes. With global measurements, it is shown that such resulting Boolean recursions define Markov chains whose state-transitions are fully determined by the network Hamiltonian and the measurement observables. Particularly, we establish an explicit and algebraic representation of the underlying recursive random mapping driving such induced Markov chains. Next, with local measurements, the resulting probabilistic Boolean dynamics is shown to be no longer Markovian. The state transition probability at any given time becomes dependent on the entire history of the sample path, for which we establish a recursive way of computing such non-Markovian probability transitions. Finally, we adopt the classical bilinear control model for the continuous Schrödinger evolution, and show how the measurements affect the controllability of the quantum networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers Nash equilibrium seeking for N -cluster noncooperative games in which the explicit expressions of the agents’ local objective functions are not available to the agents. As an alternative, the output values of the agents’ local objective functions are supposed to be measurable. An extremum seeker is designed to achieve the Nash equilibrium seeking for the N -cluster noncooperative games. The design of the extremum seeker is based on a dynamic average consensus protocol and the modulation of the sinusoidal dither signals. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the convergence results are analytically studied. Local and nonlocal convergence results are derived under local and global characterizations of the Nash equilibrium for the N -cluster noncooperative games, respectively. Compared with our previous works on Nash equilibrium seeking for the N -cluster noncooperative games, the main advantages and characteristics of the proposed method are threefold. Firstly, the proposed method broadens the applicability of the existing Nash equilibrium seeking strategies to circumstances in which the agents cannot access the explicit expressions of their local objective functions. Moreover, the proposed seeking strategy performs as a unified strategy that solves the noncooperative games and the social cost minimization problems without utilizing explicit model information. Secondly, the proposed seeking strategy requires each agent to update fewer auxiliary variables compared with the existing methods and hence reduces the communication and computation costs. Thirdly, different from most of the existing works that adopt singular perturbation to analyze the stability of extremum seekers, this paper establishes the convergence results via Lyapunov stability analysis, which is novel and provides some new insights on the analysis of extremum seekers. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the challenges in observer design for nonlinear systems which are non-monotonic. A class of nonlinear systems is considered in which the process dynamics and output equations are both composed of nonlinear vector functions of scalar combinations of the states. The nonlinear functions are assumed to be differentiable with bounded derivatives. An observer design algorithm that requires solving just a single linear matrix inequality for exponentially convergent state estimation is developed. The developed algorithm works effectively when the involved nonlinear functions are monotonic. However, it fails when all or even some of the system functions are non-monotonic. Both numerical computation and analytical results show that the observer design LMI has no feasible solutions when either all output functions or all process dynamics functions are non-monotonic. Further, other constant gain LMI-based observer design methods from literature also fail when the involved nonlinear functions are all non-monotonic, no matter how small the Lipschitz constant or the Jacobian bounds of the nonlinearities. This limitation has not previously been recognized in observer design literature. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid observer that switches between multiple constant observer gains is developed that can provide global asymptotic stability for systems with non-monotonic nonlinear functions. Hybrid observers with switched gains enable existing observer design methods to be utilized for non-monotonic nonlinear functions with finite local extrema. The application of the developed hybrid observer to two motion estimation applications, one a vehicle position tracking problem on roads and another a piston position estimation problem for an industrial actuator, are demonstrated.},

Next, sufficient conditions for the existence of the developed sliding surface functions are established. Then the event-triggered sliding mode control laws are designed by two different approaches: the Lyapunov function technique and the reaching law approach, such that the state trajectories of the resultant closed-loop 2-D system are driven into a bounded region and maintained there all time. Finally, the simulation results are given to show the design method and performance of the 2-D system under the proposed event-triggered SMC strategy. The main advantage is that the event-triggering based SMC strategy for 2-D systems is first proposed by taking the particular 2-D system property into account and this contributes to the event-triggered control (ETC) and SMC research for a general 2-D system.},

The proposed IEKF differs from existing techniques in literature on the account that it is derived using minimal tools from differential geometry that simplifies its representation and derivation to a large extent. The filter error dynamics is defined on the Lie algebra directly instead of identifying the Lie algebra with an Euclidean space or defining the error dynamics in local coordinates using exponential map, and the associated differential Riccati equations are described on the corresponding space of linear operators using tensor algebra. The proposed filter is implemented for the attitude dynamics of the rigid body, which is a benchmark problem in control, and its performance is compared against a conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF). Numerical experiments support that the IEKF is computationally less intensive and gives better performance than the EKF.},

  abstract     = {Set point transition of nonlinear plants plays an important role in many applications where dynamic process management has to be considered. This transition should be rapid – as operation in the new set point increases the economical benefit – but in compliance with all safety regulations. We present a feedforward approach for a time-minimal set point transition of single-input, single-output nonlinear plants with respect to input, state and output constraints. The conceptual idea is based on the design of an optimization problem utilizing a coordinate change of the plant and a special setup function for the output trajectory. This allows the simultaneous planning of the trajectory and determination of the corresponding control signal. The formulation of the set point transition as an optimization problem provides a flexible design with respect to the integration of inequality constraints. Additional flexibility is provided by the type of setup functions, which permit any adjustment of the output trajectory between the set points. In contrast to other works, we focus on the stationarity of the system output, which allows a faster transition compared to the requirement to reach a steady state of all states. Finally, we present an example from the field of process systems engineering to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology.},

The multi-objective optimisation problem for each platform is converted to a single optimisation using the Pareto parameter to weigh the relative importance of the two information measures. The relationship between the two Pareto parameters, and different initial track initialisations is investigated.

For a matrix pair ( A , B ) , it was recently shown that if its corresponding time-delay system is internally positive, meaning that A is Metzler and B is nonnegative, then the pair ( A , B ) is diagonally Riccati stable if and only if A + B is Hurwitz. We extend this to the case when the pair ( A , B ) corresponds to a time-delay system with a more general cone-preserving property. We show that if the time-delay system relating to the pair ( A , B ) is invariant on a symmetric cone, the corresponding algebraic Riccati inequality admits positive definite solutions, which can be constructed via the scaling transformation on the Euclidean Jordan algebra associated with the symmetric cone. For the special case when the symmetric cone is the positive semi-definite cone, an application to a class of stochastic systems is discussed.},

A vertical hierarchical controller, with one controller per level, reduces the computational burden associated with the solution of centralized MPC having long prediction horizons and short time steps. To guarantee satisfaction of state and input constraints in the presence of both known and unknown disturbances, a robust MPC formulation is used at each level while waysets are used as a novel coordination mechanism between controllers at different levels. These waysets are implemented as terminal state constraints on lower-level controllers and are computed on-line based on the optimal state trajectory of upper-level controllers. To achieve the computational efficiency necessary for on-line calculation, waysets are represented as constrained zonotopes. State and input constraint satisfaction is proven for a hierarchical controller with an arbitrary number of levels and two numerical examples demonstrate the key features, performance, and scalability of the approach.},

We aim to regulate the rate of change of the opposite boundary, relative to the actuator, around a given constant reference. Towards that aim, we reformulate the opposite boundary equation as a linear system with known parameters, the sinusoidal disturbances and simultaneous input/output delays. In this way, the control input and sensor become collocated with the disturbance. Then, we parametrize the disturbance and represent the delays as a transport PDE. We develop an observer-based adaptive boundary controller for the ODE–PDE cascade system. We prove that all signals are bounded and the rate of change of the opposite boundary tracks a given constant reference. The performance of the controller is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {To address the universal single-rod electrohydraulic system (EHS), a block-strict-feedback model is constructed for the position control loop design. Different from the previous strict-feedback controllers used in EHS, the proposed controller avoids the model order-reduction problem and relaxes the strict-feedback model assumption for the single-rod EHS encountered by the existing results. Hence, all the dynamic physical states of single-rod EHS are directly used in control design. Since the hydraulic parametric uncertainties and the external load would degrade the output tracking performance of EHS, an adaptive control is proposed to guarantee all system states globally and uniformly bounded with parameter adaptation. The constraint holding technique called prescribed performance constraint (PPC) is adopted to improve the output response and to achieve a desirable performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by a comparison with the strict-feedback controller via both simulation and experiments.},

Existing works need to either estimate the position of the target with the robot position a priori, or finally maintain an exact circular motion around the target. In this paper, we propose an estimator–controller framework for the robot, where the estimator is designed to estimate the relative position with bearing measurements by exploiting the orthogonality property, based on which the controller is proposed to achieve the desired relative position. Within this framework, the robot can entrap the target without any prior position information in an arbitrarily shaped orbit. We characterize sufficient conditions on the desired orbiting shapes which can support the robot for successful localization and entrapment simultaneously. It is proved that the estimation and tracking errors both converge to zero as time goes to infinity. Extensions to a moving target and multiple robots are also discussed and analyzed respectively. Simulations testify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By partitioning recourse decisions into state and control decisions, the proposed algorithm applies affine control policy only to state decisions and allows control decisions to be fully adaptive, thus transforming the original problem into an equivalent two-stage Adaptive Robust Optimization (ARO) problem. Importantly, this multi-to-two transformation is general enough to be employed with any two-stage ARO solution algorithms, thus opening a new avenue for a variety of multistage ARO algorithms. The proximal bundle method is developed for the resulting two-stage problem along with convergence analysis. In an inventory control application, the affine disturbance-feedback control policy suffers from a severe suboptimality with an average gap of 34.88\%, while the proposed algorithm generates an average gap of merely 1.68\%.},

The switching sequence is properly reordered to provide an appropriate way to describe different switching behaviors. In addition, multiple composite Lyapunov functions(MCLFs) are employed to derive some stability criteria for the nonlinear SPSSs. Furthermore, by using switching-time-dependent MCLFs and dwell time method, some computable stability condition is given for the linear case. The obtained results show the relationship between the ratio of the stabilizing switching behavior and the singular perturbation parameter.

The principal aim of this paper is to extend and overcome limitations in previous studies which had required restrictive assumptions to be imposed and thereby derive necessary and sufficient conditions for robust output consensus of networked NI systems when such assumptions do not hold. In doing so, the recently published robust NI stability results are utilised. An advantage of the derived conditions is that they depend on the dc and infinite frequency gains of the systems as well as the network graph but not on the precise dynamics of the systems. Furthermore, it is shown that the derived conditions specialise to the earlier results in literature either by imposing the same assumptions or by imposing different ones which had not been known previously. It is also shown that the derived conditions simplify in the single-input single-output case and an intuition about these results is provided. Finally, examples are given which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results over earlier results when earlier assumptions are not met.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider boundary state feedback stabilization of a one-dimensional wave equation with in-domain feedback/recirculation of an intermediate point velocity. We firstly construct an auxiliary control system which has a nonlocal term of the displacement at the same intermediate point. Then by choosing a well-known exponentially stable wave equation as its target system, we find one backstepping transformation from which a state feedback law for this auxiliary system is proposed. Finally, taking the resulting closed-loop of the auxiliary system as a new target system, we obtain another backstepping transformation from which a boundary state feedback controller for the original system is designed. By the equivalence of three systems, the closed-loop of original system is proved to be well-posed and exponentially stable. Some numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers static corrective control of asynchronous sequential machines (ASMs). While static corrective controllers are more efficient than dynamics ones as their implementation needs no memory elements, they have restrictive existence conditions in association with transient states. To alleviate this drawback, we propose a framework of coordinated static control for ASMs. A number of single static controllers are designed to achieve local objectives and the coordinator selects the active controller among them based on the external input and state feedback so that the overall behavior of the closed-loop system matches that of a reference model. Compared with previous static controllers, the existence condition is much improved with mild degradation of design complexity.},

The objective is to make structural changes in the controller so that a lower bound of the delay margin is improved without affecting the steady-state error.

By making use of the salient cascade properties of pure-feedback systems as well as a novel scaling function, we convert the constrained system into a normal form without constraints. Then by using only one single neural network (NN) unit for nonlinear approximation and one high-gain observer for transformed state estimation, an adaptive NN output feedback control scheme is constructed. Different from existing results in the literature, our method exhibits the following features: (1) achieving semi-global stable control with only output feedback without imposing any additional restrictive condition; (2) avoiding the recursive design procedures required by some typical approaches such as backstepping; and (3) recovering the steady-state tracking performance under the state feedback. Besides, all the signals in the closed-loop are bounded and the output constraints are never violated. The effectiveness and flexibility of the developed method is demonstrated through control design and simulation on the non-trivial aircraft short-period dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic control has been used for decades for spacecraft detumbling, i.e. , to bring a spacecraft to a final condition with a sufficiently small angular momentum after separation from the launcher. This task is typically achieved by controllers based on the so-called b-dot principle, which stands out thanks to its simplicity, reliability and ease of on-board implementation. In this paper, we first review existing control methods and study their convergence properties with tools borrowed from general averaging theory, which allows addressing in an accurate manner the time-varying nature of magnetic actuation. Then, some effort is devoted to showing the performance limitations of existing controllers for which increasing the gain too much deteriorates the convergence rate. To overcome this issue, a novel projection-based control law with a state-dependent time-varying gain is presented. By means of Lyapunov arguments for non-autonomous systems, we prove that the proposed controller guarantees that the spacecraft angular momentum converges exponentially fast to zero for all initial conditions, robustly with respect to sufficiently small uncertainties in the inertia matrix, and that the closed-loop solutions are globally uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of exogenous bounded disturbances. Several numerical simulations have been carried out by referring to realistic detumbling scenarios to show the performance improvement with respect to existing controllers.},

  abstract     = {Zero dynamics attacks can be lethal to cyber–physical systems because they can be harmful to physical plants and impossible to detect. Fortunately, if the given continuous-time physical system is minimum phase, the attack is not so effective even if it cannot be detected. However, the situation can become unfavorable if one uses digital control by sampling the sensor measurement and using a zero-order hold for actuation because of the ‘sampling zeros.’ When the continuous-time system has a relative degree greater than two and the sampling period is small, the sampled-data system must have unstable zeros (even if the continuous-time system is minimum phase), so that the cyber–physical system becomes vulnerable to ‘sampling zero dynamics attack.’ In this paper, we present an idea to neutralize the zero dynamics attack for single-input and single-output sampled-data systems by shifting the unstable discrete-time zeros into stable ones. This idea is realized by employing the so-called ‘generalized hold’ which replaces a standard zero-order hold. It is shown that, under mild assumptions, a generalized hold exists which places the discrete-time zeros at desired positions. Furthermore, we formulate the design problem as an optimization problem whose performance index is related to the inter-sample behavior of the physical plant, and propose an optimal gain which alleviates the performance degradation caused by generalized hold as much as possible.},

  abstract     = {Guidepath-based transport systems is a pertinent abstraction for the traffic that is generated in many contemporary applications, ranging from industrial material handling and robotics, to computer game animations and the qubit transport systems employed in quantum computing. A particular problem that must be effectively addressed for the systematic operation of these systems, is the preservation of their “liveness”, i.e., the preservation of the ability of the system agents to complete their current assignments and engage successfully in similar assignments in the future operation of the system. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive characterization of the notion of “liveness” for the entire spectrum of the aforementioned transport systems, and it further investigates the implications of this characterization for the deployment of maximally permissive liveness-enforcing supervision for the underlying traffic. It is shown that the computational complexity of the sought supervisors is contingent upon certain structural and operational attributes of the considered transport systems, that define, thus, a useful taxonomy for these environments. The paper proposes effective and efficient liveness-enforcing supervisors for each member of this taxonomy. Furthermore, the concluding part of the paper indicates how the obtained results can be integrated in a broader control framework for the considered transport systems that will also address time-related performance considerations for these environments, like the maximization of their throughput.},

This paper introduces an adaptive-robust control framework for a quite general class of uncertain underactuated EL systems. Compared to existing literature, the important attributes of the proposed solution are: (i) avoiding structure-specific restrictions, namely, symmetry condition property of the mass matrix, and a priori bounds on non-actuated states or state derivatives; (ii) considering Coriolis, centripetal, friction and gravity terms to be unknown, while only requiring the knowledge of maximum perturbation around a nominal value of the mass matrix; (iii) handling state-dependent uncertainties irrespective of their linear or nonlinear in parameters structure. These features significantly widen the range of underactuated EL systems the proposed solution can handle in comparison to the available methods. Stability is studied analytically and the performance is verified in simulation using offshore boom crane dynamics.},

The optimal solution to the hybrid LQR problem is determined both in the case of finite-horizon and infinite-horizon optimal control problems by introducing a hybrid (periodic) extension of the classic Differential and Difference Riccati Equations, thus leading to the notion of Monodromy Riccati Equation. Interestingly, due to the periodic nature of the discrete-time events, the computation of the optimal feedback hinges upon the solution of a differential, rather than algebraic, Riccati equation also in the infinite-horizon case, hence yielding a time-varying, periodic control law. Necessary and sufficient conditions that ensure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system are provided and discussed in detail in the case of infinite-horizon optimal control problems.},

We show that under these conditions and without any assumptions on the predictability of the environment, the predictive update strictly improves on the performance of the standard update. We give two types of predictive update for various family of loss functions. We provide a regret bound for each of our predictive online convex optimization algorithms.

To this aim, we leverage results on the compositional certification of stability for networks of locally passive systems. More specifically, we consider the decentralized multivariable PI controllers proposed in Tucci et al. (2018), and show that they passivate the generation units and the associated loads under certain conditions. To prove voltage stability in the closed-loop microgrid, we exploit properties of interconnection, passivity of individual components, and the LaSalle’s invariance theorem. Moreover, we provide explicit inequalities on control gains to design local controllers. Control synthesis requires only the knowledge of local parameters of the generation units and is always feasible, allowing removal and addition of DGUs in a plug-n-play fashion. Theoretical results are backed up by simulations in PSCAD.},

  abstract     = {The present paper proposes a novel broadcast control (BC) law for multi-agent coordination. A BC framework has been developed to achieve global coordination tasks with low communication volume. The BC law uses broadcast communication, which transmits an identical signal to all agents indiscriminately without any agent-to-agent communication. Unfortunately, all of the agents are required to take numerous random actions because the BC law is based on stochastic optimization. Such random actions degrade the control performance for coordination tasks and may invoke dangerous situations. In order to overcome these drawbacks, the present paper proposes the pseudo-perturbation-based broadcast control (PBC) law, which introduces multiple virtual random actions instead of the single physical action of the BC law. The following advantages of the PBC law are theoretically proven. The PBC law achieves coordination tasks asymptotically with probability 1. Compared with the BC law, unavailing actions are reduced and agents’ states converge twice as fast. Increasing the number of multiple actions further improves the control performance because averaging multiple actions reduces unavailing randomness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the PBC improves the control performance as compared with the BC law.},

We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for this property to hold. Once the condition is satisfied, one can apply a feedback control that keeps the average fixed during a given time period.

This problem appears in the computation of the H 2 norm of a stable system described by a class of linear time-invariant delay differential equations (DDAEs) with multiple delays. The H 2 norm of a DDAE may not be finite even if there are seemingly no direct feedthrough terms. We show that necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite H 2 norm consist of an infinite number of linear equations to be satisfied, inducing the algebraic decision problem, and that using the generalized Cayley–Hamilton theorem checking these conditions can be turned into a check of a finite number of equations. We conclude with some comments on the computation of the H 2 norm whenever it is finite and by stating an open problem.},

This paper establishes methods to design bounded linear time-varying (LTV) controllers such that the control performance of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system can be improved, that is, the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system can be obtained. Specifically, for an LTI control system, by using the solution to a parametric Lyapunov equation (PLE), a bounded LTV controller containing a suitable time-varying parameter is designed. By fully exploiting properties of the solution to the PLE, it is shown that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. Both state feedback and observer based output feedback, in which both the observer gain and the state feedback gain are time-varying, are considered. As a consequence, the finite-time semi-global stabilization and the fixed-time (prescribed finite-time) stabilization problems for linear systems by bounded controls are solved. The established method is utilized to the design of the spacecraft rendezvous control system and its effectiveness is verified by simulations.},

Information from the different sensors has to be transmitted to a central gateway over a wireless network for monitoring purposes, where typically fewer wireless channels are available than there are processes to be monitored. For effective estimation at the gateway, the sensors need to be scheduled appropriately, i.e., at each time instant one needs to decide which sensors have network access and which ones do not. To address this scheduling problem, we formulate an associated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP is then solved using a Deep Q-Network, a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm that is at once scalable and model-free. We compare our scheduling algorithm to popular scheduling algorithms such as round-robin and reduced-waiting-time, among others. Our algorithm is shown to significantly outperform these algorithms for many example scenarios.},

Our proposed strategy seeks to opportunistically minimize the number of control updates while guaranteeing stabilization and builds on predictor feedback to compensate for arbitrarily large known time-varying delays. We establish, using a Lyapunov approach, the global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system as long as the open-loop system is globally input-to-state stabilizable in the absence of time delays and sampling. We further prove that the proposed event-triggered law has inter-event times that are uniformly lower bounded and hence does not exhibit Zeno behavior. For the particular case of a stabilizable linear system, we show global exponential stability of the closed-loop system and analyze the trade-off between the rate of exponential convergence and a bound on the sampling frequency. We illustrate these results in simulation and also examine the properties of the proposed event-triggered strategy beyond the class of systems for which stabilization can be guaranteed.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a global regulation controller with a time-varying gain is constructed for a class of feedforward nonlinear time-delay systems, and the time-varying function with the logarithmic form is for the first time proposed to copy with the unknown parameter. The uncertain nonlinearities are assumed to be bounded by unknown constants multiplied by states, and both discrete delays and distributed delays are allowed in both states and input of the involved systems. Based on the state transformation method and Lyapunov–Razumikhin theorem, a global regulation controller with the simple form is elaborately constructed for the given systems. Contrary to most existing control designs for feedforward nonlinear systems, the celebrated forwarding design and saturation design are not used here. Via two examples, we demonstrate that a class of the nonlinear time-delay systems which cannot be dealt by the existing methods are successfully regulated by our state feedback controllers.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a novel estimation and control strategy to balance a formation of discrete-time oscillators on a circle. We consider the case in which each oscillator only gathers noisy proximity measurements, whose range is lower than the desired spacing along the circle, implying that a balanced formation would be completely disconnected. These restrictions pose relevant challenges that are overcome through the symbiotic combination of an estimator that borrows tools from interval analysis and a three-level bang–bang controller. We prove that the formation can be balanced, with an accuracy that can be regulated by tuning a controller parameter. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is also numerically demonstrated.},

By means of the notions of controllability and observability, coordinate transformations, which are rotation matrices, can be constructed explicitly that transform an input–output model to a new one. The new input–output model enables us to investigate many interesting properties of the two-level quantum system, such as steady-state solutions to the Lindblad master equation, quantum decoherence-free (DF) subspaces, quantum non-demolition (QND) variables, and the realization of quantum back-action evading (BAE) measurements.

Some applications, e.g. , quantum synchronization and rigid-body attitude synchronization, involve high-dimensional Kuramoto models where each oscillator lives on the n -sphere or SO ( n ) . These manifolds are special cases of the compact, real Stiefel manifold St ( p , n ) . Using tools from optimization and control theory, we prove that the generalized Kuramoto model on St ( p , n ) converges to a synchronized state for any connected graph and from almost all initial conditions provided ( p , n ) satisfies p ≤ 2 3 n − 1 and all oscillator frequencies are equal. This result could not have been predicted based on knowledge of the Kuramoto model in complex networks over the circle. In that case, almost global synchronization is graph dependent; it applies if the network is acyclic or sufficiently dense. This paper hence identifies a property that distinguishes many high-dimensional generalizations of the Kuramoto models from the original model.},

Perhaps the most used parameterized dynamic (aka self-exciting i.e. history dependent) model is the (linear) Hawkes model. But the Hawkes model assumes the infinite past is available and has to be truncated for empirical use. Here we develop, for the first time, the system theory for the truncated Hawkes process. This includes: necessary and sufficient conditions for stability; a Wold decomposition; and an asymptotic spectrum. We then discuss various parameterizations (Exponential, Laguerre, Binomial-autoregression) and their properties. Using the Laguerre parameterization, we next develop a new continuous time multiplicative EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation and develop some of its properties. It turns out that the multiplicative EM algorithm does not guarantee stability and so we develop a modified multiplicative EM that does. We also derive, for the first time for self-exciting processes, the Cramer–Rao bound as well as a BIC model selection criterion. We illustrate with simulations, comparing the Laguerre approach to the popular binomial-autoregression and then with an application to neural data recorded from a cat’s brain under visual stimuli.},

Necessary conditions for the feasibility of the LMIs are presented. Finally, a simulation example is shown to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

However, the convergence of such AGD algorithms is largely unknown in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is the analytical characterization of the convergence regions of AGD under RC via robust control tools. Since such optimization problems arise frequently in many applications such as phase retrieval, training of neural networks and matrix sensing, our result shows promise of robust control theory in these areas.},

Due to bandwidth constraints in digital communication networks, the measured outputs are quantized before transmission by a probabilistic uniform quantizer. Our attention is focused on the design of a recursive quadratic estimator that exploits the quadratic functions of the measurements. By introducing a proper augmented system which aggregates the original state vector and its second-order Kronecker power, we are able to transfer the quadratic estimation problem into a corresponding linear estimation problem of the augmented state vector. An upper bound is first established for the covariance of the estimation error that is expressed in terms of the solutions to certain matrix difference equations, and such an upper bound is then minimized by designing the filter parameters in an iterative manner. Subsequently, we discuss the monotonicity of the optimized upper bound with respect to the quantization accuracy. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed filtering algorithm.},

A piecewise constant adaptive law updates the adaptive parameters which represent the uncertainty estimates by solving the error dynamics between the state predictor and the real system with the neglection of unknowns. A filtering control law is designed to compensate the nonlinear uncertainties and deliver a good tracking performance with guaranteed robustness. In the control scheme, the nonlinear uncertainty compensation component is always active whereas the tracking component is subject to a switching logic. The controller will remain in the tracking mode as long as there exists feasible solution, otherwise this component will be replaced by a new part updated periodically by numerically solving a constrained optimization problem online. The uniform performance bounds are derived for the system states and control inputs as compared to the corresponding signals of a bounded closed-loop reference system, which assumes partial cancellation of uncertainties within the bandwidth of the control signal. Compared to the model predictive control (MPC) method and unconstrained controller, the proposed approach is capable of solving the tracking control problems of multivariable nonlinear systems subject to both constraints and uncertainties.},

Consequently, transmissibility identification does not capture the poles of the system.

  abstract     = {The Covariance Based Realization Algorithm (CoBRA), one branch of subspace methods, enables the estimation of multivariable models using a large number of data points due to the use of finite size covariance matrices. In addition, the covariance pre-processing allows CoBRA to ignore any (high-order) noise dynamics and focus on the estimation of the low-order deterministic model. However, subspace methods and CoBRA in particular are not maximum-likelihood methods. In this paper, an in-depth study on the statistical behavior of the noise effects is conducted. An approach is provided to reduce the variance of an estimate obtained by CoBRA via the choice of optimal row and column weighting matrices. For closed-loop implementation of CoBRA, a two stage procedure is proposed with the estimate on an intermediate instrument. At the first stage, a least-length perturbation of a scalar accuracy function is used to obtain an analytic solution for the optimal weighting matrices. The resulting instruments produced by the first stage are used for the identification at the second stage to extract the plant model. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed two stage CoBRA method on the basis of closed-loop data and compared with other subspace methods.},

  abstract     = {The problem of observer-based boundary control of the sine–Gordon model energy is first posed. A Luenberger-type observer for the sine–Gordon equation is analysed, and explicit bounds on the system parameters ensuring the exponential decay of the estimation error are obtained. With the use of this observer a speed-gradient output feedback for sine–Gordon model energy control is proposed. The achievement of the control goal is established under the assumption that system’s energy does not vanish in finite time. It is shown that the transient time in energy is close that the transient time in observation error, i.e. the closed-loop system has a reasonable performance. It is also shown that the conditions on the observer gain sufficient for the state estimation error convergence are “almost” necessary in the sense that violation of these conditions makes the state estimation error transients too long.},

The system outputs are collected through a sensor network subject to a time-varying topology that is connected via Gilbert–Elliott channels and governed by a set of Markov chains. In order to save communication cost, a dynamic event-triggered strategy is utilized to decide when a particular sensor node should broadcast the corresponding measurement output to its neighbors. For the addressed time-varying systems, our aim is to design a distributed filter for each sensor node such that an upper bound on the filtering error variance is guaranteed and subsequently minimized at each iteration under the dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol. The parameters of the desired filter are obtained recursively by following a certain set of recursions. Finally, an illustrative example is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic event-triggered distributed filtering algorithm.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a synthetic counter-measure, combining transmission scheduling and defensive deception, to defend against jamming attacks in remote state estimation. In the setup studied, an attacker sabotages packet transmissions from a sensor to a remote estimator by congesting the communication channel between them. In order to efficiently degrade the estimation accuracy, the intelligent attacker tailors its jamming strategy by reacting to the real-time information it collects. In response to the jamming attacks, the sensor with a long-term goal will select the transmission power level at each stage. In addition, by modifying the real-time information intentionally, the sensor creates asymmetric uncertainty to mislead the attacker and thus mitigate attacks. Considering the dynamic nature of the process, we model the strategic interaction between the sensor and the attacker by a general stochastic game with asymmetric information structure. To obtain stationary optimal strategies for each player, we convert this game into a belief-based dynamic game and analyze the existence of its optimal solution. For a tractable implementation, we present an algorithm that finds equilibrium strategies based on multi-agent reinforcement learning for symmetric-information stochastic games. Numerical examples illustrate properties of the proposed algorithm.},

The maximum hands-off control is the L 0 -optimal (or sparsest) control among all feasible controls that are bounded by a specified value and transfer the state from a given initial state to the origin within a fixed time duration. The proposed control is obtained via minimization of the CLOT (Combined L -One and Two) norm of the control input along with the constraints on the state variable. The constraints on the state variable ensures that the states are not blown up while achieving the optimal control. By using the non-smooth maximum principle, we prove that the CLOT-norm optimal control is unique, and it is continuous in the time variable. We show by numerical simulations that the CLOT control is continuous unlike L 0 -optimal control (or maximum hands-off control) and much sparser (i.e. has longer time duration on which the control equals 0) than the conventional EN (elastic net) control, which is a convex combination of L 1 and squared L 2 norms.},

The investor optimally liquidates his portfolio to maximize his expected revenue netting his cumulative inventory cost over a finite time. Such a problem is first reformulated as an optimal stochastic control problem for a Markov jump linear system. Then, we derive the value function and the optimal feedback execution strategy in terms of the solutions to coupled differential Riccati equations. Under some mild conditions, we prove that the coupled system is well-posed, and establish a verification theorem. Financially, our closed-form solution shows that the investor optimally liquidates his portfolio towards a dynamic benchmark.

When the probability density function of measurement noise is unknown-but-bounded, multiple-source localization is a difficult problem since not only the acoustic energy measurements are complicated nonlinear functions of multiple sources, but also the multiple sources bring about a high-dimensional state estimation problem. First, when the energy parameter and the position of the source are bounded in an interval and a ball respectively, the nonlinear remainder bound of the Taylor series expansion is obtained analytically on-line. Next, based on the separability of the nonlinear measurement function, an efficient estimation procedure is developed. It solves the multiple-source localization problem by using an alternating optimization iterative algorithm, in which the remainder bound needs to be known on-line. For this reason, we first derive the remainder bound analytically. When the energy decay factor is unknown but bounded, an efficient estimation procedure is developed based on interval mathematics. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the ellipsoidal localization algorithms for multiple-source localization. In particular, our results show that when the noise is non-Gaussian, the set-membership localization algorithm performs better than the EM localization algorithm.},

Positive dynamical systems are particularly well suited to describe biological systems where the states are always positive. We prove two main theorems that utilize the determinant of the system’s Jacobian to find algebraic conditions on the parameters determining whether the number of equilibrium points is guaranteed either to change or to remain the same when a nominal system is compared to its perturbed counterpart. We demonstrate the application of the theoretical results to genetic networks where state-dependent perturbations arise due to disturbances in cellular resources. These disturbances constitute a major problem for predicting the behavior of genetic networks. Our results determine whether such perturbations change a genetic network’s number of steady states.

In open-loop, the system converges to a random eigenstate of the measurement operator. The role of the feedback is to prepare a prescribed eigenstate with unit probability. To achieve this we introduce the use of Brownian motion to drive the unitary control actions; the feedback loop just adapts the amplitude of this Brownian noise input as a function of the system state. Essentially, it “shakes” the system away from undesired eigenstates by applying strong noise there, while relying on the open-loop dynamics to progressively reach the target. We prove exponential convergence towards the target eigenstate using standard stochastic Lyapunov methods. The feedback scheme and its stability analysis suggest the use of an approximate filter which only tracks the populations of the eigenstates of the measurement operator.

  abstract     = {Recent rapid loss of the Arctic sea ice motivates the study of the Arctic sea ice thickness. Global climate model that describes the ice thickness evolution requires an accurate spatial temperature profile of the Arctic sea ice. However, measuring the complete temperature profile is not feasible within and throughout the Arctic icecap. Instead, measuring the ice thickness is doable with the acquisition of data from submarine and satellite devices. In this paper, we develop a backstepping observer algorithm to estimate the temperature profile for the Arctic sea ice model via available measurements of sea ice thickness and sea ice surface temperature. The observer is designed in a rigorous manner to drive the temperature profile estimation error to zero, for a salinity-free sea ice model. Moreover, the proposed observer is used to estimate the temperature profile of the original sea ice model with salinity via numerical simulation. The simulation results illustrate that our observer design achieves a successful estimation of the sea ice temperature profile in three days, which is ten times faster than the straightforward open-loop algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Of collective behaviors in networks of coupled systems, synchronization is of central importance and an extensively studied area. This is due to the fact that it is essential for the proper functioning of a wide variety of natural and engineered systems. Traditionally, uniform coupling strength has been the default choice and the synchronizability measure has been employed for analysis and enhancement of synchronizability. The main drawback of optimizing the synchronizability measure is that it can reach the Pareto frontier but not necessarily a unique point on the Pareto frontier. Additionally, the shortcoming of uniform coupling strength is that it can reach Pareto frontier in specific topologies including edge-transitive graphs. To achieve a unique optimal answer on the Pareto frontier, this paper takes a different approach and addresses the synchronizability in networks of coupled dynamical systems with nonuniform coupling strength and optimizing the synchronizability via maximizing the minimum distance between the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian and the acceptable boundaries for the stability of the system. Furthermore, two solution methods, namely the concave–convex fractional programming and the Semidefinite Programming (SDP) formulations of the problem have been provided. The proposed solution methods have been compared over different topologies and branches of an arbitrary network, where the SDP based approach has shown to be less restricted and more suitable for a wider range of topologies.},

In this setting, standard methods for numerical solution quickly become intractable as n increases. To resolve this we propose a numerical scheme where delay states are discretized with a different step size than that of the time line. We first show that the value function converges to the optimum as the step size goes to zero. We then show, by a counter-example, that the corresponding control does not necessarily converge to an optimal control for the original problem and propose a perturbation that resolves this issue.},

However, deadlocks sometimes are difficult to predict in advance because of the existence of higher-order deadlocks, from which a system can lead to a deadlock inevitably. In this paper, we investigate the properties of higher-order deadlocks and propose a distributed approach to their avoidance in multi-robot systems where each robot has a predetermined and closed path to execute persistent motion. After modeling the motion of robots by labeled transition systems (LTSs), we first conclude that there exist at most the ( N ŌłÆ 3 ) -th order deadlocks with N robots. This means that deadlocks, if any, will occur unavoidably within N ŌłÆ 3 steps of corresponding transitions. A distributed algorithm is then proposed to avoid deadlocks in such systems. In the algorithm, each robot only needs to look ahead at most N ŌłÆ 1 states, i.e., N ŌłÆ 3 intermediate states and two endpoint states, to decide whether its move can cause higher-order deadlocks. To execute the algorithm, each robot needs to communicate with its neighbors. The theoretical analysis and experimental study show that the proposed algorithm is practically operative.},

While prior methods focus on rapidly getting to a new consensus value, maintaining cohesion, during the transition between consensus values or during tracking, remains challenging and has not been addressed. The main contributions of this work are to address the problem of maintaining cohesion by: (i) proposing a new delayed self-reinforcement (DSR) approach; (ii) extending it for use with agents that have higher-order, heterogeneous dynamics, and (iii) developing stability conditions for the DSR-based method. With DSR, each agent uses current and past information from neighbors to infer the overall goal, and modifies the update law to improve cohesion. The advantages of the proposed DSR approach are that it only requires already-available information from a given network to improve the cohesion, and does not require network-connectivity modifications (which might not be always feasible) nor increases in the system’s overall response speed (which can require larger input). Moreover, illustrative simulation examples are used to comparatively evaluate the performance with and without DSR. The simulation results show substantial improvement in cohesion with DSR.},

In this paper, we firstly formulate a one-time attack duration model for such discontinuous replay attacks. Then, by exploiting the attack model, we propose a periodic watermarking strategy which aims to reduce the control cost. Furthermore, we obtain an optimal periodic watermarking strategy for the approximate detection performance. Extensive simulations over a quadruple water tank system are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Since the dynamics is influenced by the switching sequence and the time delay, most existing gradient-based methods and relaxation techniques cannot be applied. In order to find the optimal solution, we first formulate the switched time-delay system into an equivalent switched system to separate the cross term of coefficient matrices. Based on the positive semi-definiteness of the system, we derive a series of lower bounds of the cost functional. By comparing them with the current optimal value, a depth-first branch and bound technique is proposed and the global optimal solution can be exactly obtained.

We derive the equations of motion of the system, we close the loop by equipping each UAV with a PID control law, and finally we linearize the closed-loop vector field around some equilibrium points of interest. When requiring the bar to stay on the horizontal plane and under no normal stress, we verify that the bar’s motion is decomposable into three decoupled motions, namely a longitudinal, a lateral and a vertical: for a symmetric system, each of those motions is further decomposed into two decoupled sub-motions, one linear and one angular; for an asymmetric system, we provide relations on the UAVs’ gains that compensate for the system asymmetries and which decouple the linear sub-motions from the angular sub-motions. From this analysis, we provide conditions, based on the system’s physical parameters, that describe good and bad types of asymmetries. Finally, when requiring the bar to pitch or to be under normal stress, we verify that there is a coupling between the longitudinal and the vertical motions, and that a positive normal stress (tension) has a positive effect on the stability, while a negative normal stress (compression) has a negative effect on the stability.},

The system performance is presented by tracking error entropy as the system is nonlinear and subjected to non-Gaussian noises. The well-known kernel density estimation (KDE) technique is employed to estimate the entropy because the precise statistical property of noises is not available for many industrial processes. Since in many industrial cases gains of PI controllers are fixed, a compensative controller is designed without changing the existing closed loop PI controller. Moreover, the compensative signal is formed using the estimated states from the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a nonlinear compensation realized by the radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The weights of RBF are trained to minimize the entropy of the closed loop tracking error. The convergence of RBF network is discussed and the stability of the resulting closed-loop control system is analysed in mean square sense. Finally, two numerical examples and a practical system simulation are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

Moreover, the hybrid transfer function resulting from series interconnection of two plants is derived and exploited to introduce and discuss, in the single-input single-output case, the concepts of zero and pole of the hybrid transfer function.

This paper proposes a SMDOB-based tracking control strategy for Euler–Lagrange systems with modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. The SMDOB is designed by the construction of an extended state observer embedded by an improved super-twisting algorithm. Compared with existing SMDOB-based controllers, the significant advantage of the proposed controller lies in semiglobal exponential stability guarantee for the combined observer–controller system without the assumption that the time derivatives of modeling uncertainties are bounded by constants. The chattering caused by switching signals is alleviated by passing the switching signals through a low-pass filter in the SMDOB and is compressed by the frequency bandwidths of both the SMDOB and the control system. The effectiveness of the designed SMDOB-based controller is illustrated by simulations on a two-link robot manipulator.},

A set of initial states is said to be admissible if all state trajectories starting within this set respect safety-critical constraints for all future time instances. For many classes of systems, the Maximal Admissible Set (MAS) equals the Maximal Robust Positive Invariant (MRPI) set. Therefore, much of the literature focus on algorithms that produce (approximations of) the MRPI set. However, for slowly-varying systems it turns out that the MAS can be larger than the MRPI set. A property referred to as the M -proximal contraction property is defined for such systems to state sufficient conditions for sets to be admissible. It is then shown that Algorithm 2 produces an admissible set that is a superset of the MRPI set.},

Especially, an adaptive pinning protocol is designed for ICCVNs with heterogeneous coupling weights and the synchronization is ensured by piecewise adjusting the complex-valued weights of edges within a spanning tree. For ICCVNs with homogeneous coupling weights, based on a connected dominating set, an intermittently adaptive algorithm is developed which just depends on the information of the dominating set with their neighbors.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates an event-triggered formation tracking problem of nonholonomic mobile robots in a leader’s coordinate frame. The proposed control protocol can be implemented in directed sensor networks based on only relative information detected by onboard sensors of mobile robots. A novel observer is proposed, and by virtue of it, neither velocity measurements nor communication among robots is required. Furthermore, by introducing a super-twisting sliding mode differentiator, the convergence of estimation errors is no longer dependent on the convergence of system states, which makes it possible to adopt an event-triggered mechanism, by which the continuous update of control command is avoided and Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our control protocol.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a distributed coordination assignment problem of multi-agent systems via state measurements over local indexes. In this problem, no assignment of reference states is predetermined, but arbitrary assignments are allowed to agents. Due to this flexibility, assignment can be determined in a distributed way over local indexes, made by each agent under its own rule. First, we design a distributed controller using only state measurements over local indexes for the coordination assignment with the best performance. For this purpose, a new distributed decision-making method for assignment, called clique-based distributed assignment , is developed, which divides the assignment problem of all agents into small-size problems in terms of cliques (i.e. complete subgraphs). Next, we investigate the local/global achievement of the coordination assignment over a δ -proximity graph, where agents within distance of δ are connected. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples.},

While the prior work considers only those kinds of faults that comply with fundamental mode operations, the constraint is relaxed in this study. Hence the transient faults may occur not only in fundamental mode, or when the machine stays at a stable state, but also in non-fundamental mode, or when the machine passes through transient states. The condition for overcoming transient faults occurring in non-fundamental mode turns out to be stricter than the case of fundamental mode. A novel scheme of corrective control is presented to make the closed-loop system immune against any fault occurrence in non-fundamental mode. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the synthesis procedure of the proposed corrective controller.},

Two different, though related, ways how this procedure can be applied are proposed. First, the assignment of an energy function that has a minimum in a closed curve, i.e. , with the shape of a Mexican sombrero. Second, the use of a damping matrix that changes “sign” according to the position of the state trajectory relative to the desired orbit, that is, pumping or dissipating energy. The proposed methodologies are illustrated with the example of the induction motor and prove that it yields the industry standard field oriented control.},

Specifically, an overlapping cell-like sampling for the attitude configuration space S O ( 3 ) is built and further reformulated to a graph model. Based on this abstraction, a complete graph search algorithm is utilized to generate a feasible path in the graph model. Both sufficient and necessary conditions on finding a feasible path are presented. Furthermore, to facilitate the control design, the point-to-point path is transformed into a smooth reference trajectory along the geodesics.

The stochasticity with the underlying system comes from three sources, namely, random parameter perturbations, dynamical biases and additive white noises. The measurement output is subject to the uniform quantization as a result of communication constraints on the sensors. The purpose of the addressed problem is to recursively estimate the system states with prescribed estimation performance in spite of the stochastic disturbances and the uniform quantizations. An augmented model is first constructed to combine the information about the state and the bias, and the dynamical evolution is subsequently discussed. Furthermore, through stochastic analysis and mathematical induction, the estimator design algorithm is developed to acquire certain upper bound on the estimation error variance and such an upper bound is then minimized in the matrix-trace sense. Moreover, the boundedness issue of the estimation errors is investigated via matrix inversion lemma and inductive analysis technique. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation algorithm is validated on a typical 2-D system modeled by the well-known Darboux equation with extensive application potentials in industrial processes.},

Here, two stubborn agents hold two competing opinions which never change. They propagate their opinions by selecting some non-stubborn agents (who can change their opinions) to connect to. The payoff of each stubborn agent is denoted by the expected number of non-stubborn agents adopting its opinion. We model the competitive problem as a zero-sum game, where players are the two stubborn agents. Firstly, several properties of this game are presented. Secondly, the signed network with structurally balanced property is investigated, and we find that the number of non-stubborn agents in a subgroup can equal the payoff of one stubborn agent. Moreover, for the signed cycle graph, a necessary and sufficient condition is given to determine whether a strategy profile is Nash equilibrium.

In particular, we consider a robot moving in a two-dimensional space and equipped with two sensors, namely, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor and a Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) sensor. The attacker can arbitrarily spoof the readings of the GNSS sensor and the robot control input so as to maximally deviate its trajectory from the nominal precomputed path. We derive explicit and constructive conditions for the existence of undetectable attacks, through which the attacker deviates the robot trajectory in a stealthy way. Conversely, we characterize the existence of secure trajectories, which guarantee that the robot either moves along the nominal trajectory or that attacks remain detectable. We show that secure trajectories can only exist between a subset of states, and provide a numerical technique to compute them. We illustrate our findings through several numerical studies, and show that our methods are applicable to different models of robot dynamics, including unicycles. More generally, our results show how control design affects security in systems with nonlinear dynamics.},

With the coupling constraints for the safe distance headway among neighboring trains, an optimal control problem is formulated to improve speed and distance tracking accuracy for each train and reduce energy consumption. Based on the dual decomposition technique, each train is regarded as a subsystem equipped with a local controller while a centralized entity manages the subsystem via the prices associated with the coupling constraints. Within the framework of an alternating direction method of multipliers and a model predictive control method, a novel distributed optimal control algorithm based on a distributed message passing mechanism is designed. The algorithm divides the original complex optimal control problem into many smaller optimal control problems that can be computed in parallel and satisfies the real-time control requirement.

  abstract     = {In the context of gene regulatory networks, a negative feedback loop is modeled by N -coupled ordinary differential equations. The resulting system is highly non-linear due to the use of smooth Hill functions. This classical dynamical system properly captures the two main biological behaviors arising from this type of recurrent network motif: homeostasis under global stability of the unique fixed point, and biochemical oscillations otherwise. When homeostatic conditions are disrupted, undesired sustained oscillations can appear. In this context, a biologically relevant control strategy is designed in order to suppress these undesirable oscillations. As biological measurement techniques do not provide a quantitative knowledge of the system, the control law is chosen piecewise constant and dependent on specific regions of the state space. Moreover, due to biological devices inaccuracies, the measurements are considered uncertain leading to regions in which the control law is undefined. Under appropriate conditions on the control inputs, successive repelling regions of the state space are determined in order to prove the global convergence of the system towards an adjustable zone around the fixed point. These results are illustrated with the well-known p53-Mdm2 genetic feedback loop.},

  abstract     = {A nonlinear model predictive control approach is studied, for problems where a fixed terminal instant and corresponding terminal set to be reached are imposed. The new technique features a shrinking horizon, rather than the most common receding one, and an input parametrization strategy to reduce computational burden. The property of transferability of the parametrization strategy is introduced. Under this property, theoretical convergence guarantees in nominal conditions are obtained by construction. Two relaxed techniques are then proposed to retain recursive feasibility in presence of bounded additive input disturbance. A bound on the constraint violation achieved by these relaxed techniques as a function of the uncertainty bound is derived, too. The developed strategy is applied to the problem of energy-efficient operation of trains, in either a fully autonomous mode (with continuous input values) or a driver assistance mode (with discrete input values, resulting in a nonlinear integer program if no parametrization is used). Realistic simulation results in this context illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a method based on semidefinite programming for estimating moments of stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs). The class of SHSs considered herein consists of a finite number of discrete states and a continuous state whose dynamics as well as the reset maps and transition intensities are polynomial in the continuous state. For these SHSs, the dynamics of moments evolve according to a system of linear ordinary differential equations. However, it is generally not possible to exactly solve the system since time evolution of a specific moment may depend upon moments of order higher than it. Our methodology recasts an SHS with multiple discrete modes to a single-mode SHS with algebraic constraints. We then find lower and upper bounds on a moment of interest via a semidefinite program that includes linear constraints obtained from moment dynamics and those arising from the recasting process, along with semidefinite constraints coming from the non-negativity of moment matrices. We illustrate the methodology via an example of SHS.},

We search the tree of possible mode sequences with an algorithm called optimistic minimax search with dwell time (OMSd), showing that it obtains a solution close to the minimax-optimal one, and we characterize the rate at which the suboptimality goes to zero. The analysis is driven by a novel measure of problem complexity, and it is first given in the general dwell-time case, after which it is specialized to the unconstrained case. We exemplify the framework for networked control systems where the minimizer signal is a discrete time delay on the control channel, and we provide extensive simulations and a real-time experiment for nonlinear systems of this type.},

The new introduced analysis tools are motivated for addressing the input–output/state properties of linear time-varying interconnected systems. It is shown that the consensus errors between the systems converge to zero so long as the union of the graphs in each of an infinite sequence of time intervals contains a directed spanning tree. It is also shown that the proposed approach enjoys the robustness with respect to unknown time-varying communication delays.},

A novel dynamic compensator is constructed for each follower by only using the follower output and the relative output information of its neighbor agents. The distributed controller is designed for each follower based on the compensator, which is independent of time delays in the agent state. It is proved strictly that each state variable of followers can asymptotically track that of the leader based on the constructed controller. The conditions imposed on nonlinear terms are relaxed and the proposed algorithm has a simple design procedure. Moreover, the proposed control design method is applied to the consensus problem of chemical reactor systems.

Implicit numerical scheme is usually applied to the discretization of the continuous HJB so as to find its numerical solution, since it is generally difficult to obtain its analytic viscosity solution. This type of discretization results in a nonlinear discrete HJB equation. We propose a power penalty method to approximate this discrete equation by a nonlinear algebraic equation containing a power penalty term. Under some mild conditions, we give the unique solvability of the penalized equation and show its convergence to the original discrete HJB equation. Moreover, we establish a sharp convergence rate of the power penalty method, which is of an exponential order with respect to the power of the penalty term. We further develop a damped Newton algorithm to iteratively solve the lower order penalized equation. Finally, we present a numerical experiment solving an incomplete market optimal investment problem to demonstrate the rates of convergence and effectiveness of the new method. We also numerically verify the efficiency of the power penalty method by comparing it with the widely used policy iteration method.},

( i i ) The derivative of desired trajectory function is allowed unknown by all subsystems and directed communication condition is considered.

Using the proposed result, one can refine the control policy synthesized using finite abstractions to the original systems while providing guarantee on the probability of satisfaction of high-level requirements.

The algorithm is based on a solution of a sequence of approximated dynamic optimization problems following the strategy of Fu et al. (Automatica, 2015). For the approximation, the path constraint is imposed only on a set of discrete points and is thus relaxed. At the same time, it is restricted by an adaptive back-off and by the error bound of the PDE solution. The approximation is iteratively improved: at iterations without violation, the restriction is reduced; at iterations with violation, the point of maximal violation is added to the discrete set. Under mild assumptions, we prove finite termination of the algorithm. We test the algorithm on an optimal grade change of a tubular reactor.},

Unfortunately, the offline computation required to generate the approximate solution can be very high using many existing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new procedure to generate the approximate solution based on barycentric interpolation whilst retaining a (less conservative) certification of the controller. This novel certification procedure requires solving a number of small-scale multiparametric linear programs together with convex optimization problems. During the online implementation of the approximate MPC, only a small linear program has to be solved to evaluate the control law. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through both simulation and also in application to a canonical cart–pole stabilization problem.},

  abstract     = {We address the problem of multi-agent partition-based convex optimization which arises, for example, in robot localization problems and in regional state estimation in smart grids. More specifically, the global cost function is the sum of locally coupled cost functions that depend only on each agent variables and their neighbors’ variables. Inspired by a generalized gradient descent strategy, namely the Block Jacobi iteration, we propose an algorithm amenable to a scalable distributed implementation, i.e., each agent eventually computes only the optimal values for its own variables via local communication with its neighbors. In particular, we provide sufficient conditions for global and semi-global exponential stability for the proposed algorithms even in the presence of lossy communications and asynchronous updates. The theoretical analysis relies on novel tools on Lyapunov theory based on separation of time scales and averaging theory for discrete-time systems. Finally, the proposed algorithm is numerically tested on the IEEE 123 nodes distribution feeder in the context of multi-area robust state estimation of smart grids in the presence of measurement outliers.},

The control input anti-collocated with this boundary subject to uncertainty, is designed by using the adaptive control method and infinite-dimensional backstepping technique. The asymptotic convergence to zero of the uncontrolled boundary states, i.e., the oscillations of the angular displacement and velocity at the bit, and the boundedness of all states in the closed-loop system, are proved via Lyapunov analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive controller is verified via numerical simulation. The results also can be applied to other applications, such as vibration control of cable elevators with uncertain cage-guide friction and cage disturbances.},

The result is an analysis of a qualitative notion of stability known as sign-stability. Although the notions of sign-stability of PMJLSs are natural extensions of standard stochastic stability concepts such as exponential almost sure, mean and mean-square stability, the sign-stability notions are proven equivalent, which is not the case for their corresponding standard concepts.

In a heterogeneous tube, the parameterizations of the tube cross sections and the associated control laws are allowed to vary along the prediction horizon. Two extreme cases that can be described in this framework are scenario MPC (high complexity, larger domain of attraction) and homothetic tube MPC with a simple time-invariant control parameterization (low complexity, smaller domain of attraction). In the proposed framework, these extreme parameterizations, as well as other parameterizations of intermediate complexity, can be combined within a single tube. By allowing for more flexibility in the parameterization design, one can influence the trade-off between computational cost and the size of the domain of attraction. Sufficient conditions on the parameterization structure are developed under which recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are guaranteed. A specific parameterization that combines the principles of scenario and homothetic tube MPC is proposed and it is shown to satisfy the required conditions. The properties of the approach, including its capability of achieving improved complexity/performance trade-offs, are demonstrated using two numerical examples.},

A key feature of the control proposed is that it is intrinsic in the sense that it does not need to incorporate any information of the desired formation. Instead, the achieved formation pattern is totally attributed to the geometric properties of the space and the designed inter-agent connection topology. Using a novel coordinates transformation, asymptotic stability of the desired formations is proven by studying stability of a constrained nonlinear system.

Our scheme only requires the leading principal minors of the HFGM to be nonzero and allows their signs to be unknown, which significantly relaxes the assumptions on the HFGM in conventional multivariable adaptive control schemes. To cope with the unknown signs, we propose novel Nussbaum functions with some nice properties and construct periodical intervals in which the effects of the multiple Nussbaum functions reinforce rather than counteract each other. With these efforts, global stability of the closed-loop system and asymptotical convergence to zero of the tracking error are successfully achieved. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

When these enclosures are represented by simple sets such as intervals, ellipsoids, parallelotopes, and zonotopes, certain set operations can be very conservative. Yet, using general convex polytopes is much more computationally demanding. To address this, we present in this paper two new methods, a mean value extension and a first-order Taylor extension, for efficiently propagating constrained zonotopes through nonlinear mappings. These extend existing methods for zonotopes in a consistent way. Examples show that these extensions yield tighter prediction enclosures than zonotopic estimation methods, while largely retaining the computational benefits of zonotopes. Moreover, they enable tighter update enclosures because constrained zonotopes can represent intersections much more accurately than zonotopes.},

  abstract     = {Most current studies of adaptive robot control concentrate on parameter convergence in the steady state, while parameter convergence rates are rarely investigated. This paper proposes a least-squares modulated composite learning robot control based on Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse to improve the performance of parameter convergence. In the composite learning, a prediction error is constructed based on online historical data and regressor extension, and both the prediction and tracking errors are applied to update parameter estimates such that accurate and smooth parameter estimation is obtained under a weak excitation condition termed interval excitation (IE). The distinctive features of the proposed method include: (1) Asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is proven without the IE condition; (2) exponential stability is proven and balanced and easily tunable rates of parameter convergence are achieved under the IE condition, where the rates are independent of unpredictable excitation levels in different regressor channels. These two features are generally not achievable with the existing adaptive robot control methods. Experimental results on an industrial manipulator have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

In addition, as a bi-product of the analysis, a partition of the input space by its fibres of a smooth map over points in the workspace is given that separates regions of singular from nonsingular points.

The model consists of a hidden Boolean state process, observed through an arbitrary noisy mapping to a measurement space. The optimal minimum mean-square error (MMSE) POBDS state estimators are the Boolean Kalman Filter and Smoother. However, in many practical problems, the system parameters are not fully known and must be estimated. In this paper, for POBDS under model uncertainty, we derive an optimal Bayesian estimator for state and parameter estimation. The exact algorithms are derived for the case of discrete and finite parameter space, and for general parameter spaces, an approximate Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) implementation is introduced. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology by means of numerical experiments with POBDS models of gene regulatory networks observed through noisy measurements.},

The existence of attacks may influence the behavior of an algorithm that solves the optimization problem. In this case, an interesting question is under what conditions the optimal solution can be found. To explore this problem, we first use differential inclusions to model attack modes and then use an average dwell-time automaton and time-ratio monitor to constrain attacks. Then based on these constraints, an inequality condition is given to ensure exponential stability of the optimal solution. Finally, a switched algorithm is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system and a Lyapunov function is constructed to show the optimal solution can be achieved exponentially under persistent attacks.},

The presence of actuator faults may lead to the loss of strong controllability of the system assumed in the existing literature on robust control of multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems. The lack of a priori knowledge on the reference trajectory renders the current constraint-handling techniques to achieve prescribed tracking accuracy infeasible. To conquer the above obstacles, a novel fault compensation scheme is designed in this paper, and a new-type error boundary is introduced to the control design. It is proved that the proposed approach guarantees output tracking with prescribed accuracy and constraint satisfactions simultaneously, even if actuator faults occur. A comparative simulation on a robot manipulator is conducted to further illustrate the established theoretical findings.},

Here, each of the players has to satisfy their respective state and control constraints or loses the game. The main contribution is a backward-forward reachable set splitting scheme, which can be used to derive numerically tractable conservative approximations of such two player games. In detail, we introduce a novel class of differential inequalities that can be used to find convex outer approximations of these backward and forward reachable sets. This approach is worked out in detail for ellipsoidal set parameterizations. Our numerical examples illustrate not only the effectiveness of the approach, but also the subtle differences between standard robust optimal control problems and more general constrained two-player zero-sum Stackelberg differential games.},

In this study, we relax the conservativeness induced by the additional constraints by replacing it with other constraints with free variables. As a result, the feasible set obtained by the proposed condition encompasses that of the previously published one. A convex optimization problem is provided for the co-design of the output feedback law and event-triggering condition to reduce the number of transmissions.

The approach only requires knowledge of the graph Laplacian matrix, and can be formulated with binary integer variables. Mixed integer programming algorithms such as branch-and-bound are used to iteratively tighten the lower and upper bounds on r and s .

  abstract     = {We study discrete-time discounted constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) with Borel state and action spaces. These CMDPs satisfy either weak (W) continuity conditions, that is, the transition probability is weakly continuous and the reward function is upper semicontinuous in state–action pairs, or setwise (S) continuity conditions, that is, the transition probability is setwise continuous and the reward function is upper semicontinuous in actions. Our main goal is to study models with unbounded reward functions, which are often encountered in applications, e.g., in consumption/investment problems. We provide some general assumptions under which the optimization problems in CMDPs are solvable in the class of randomized stationary policies and in the class of chattering policies introduced in this paper. If the initial distribution and transition probabilities are atomless, then using a general “purification result” of Feinberg and Piunovskiy we show the existence of a deterministic (stationary) optimal policy. Our main results are illustrated by examples.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finite-time stabilization for a class of high-order nonlinear systems (also known as p -normal form systems) with an asymmetric output constraint is investigated in this paper. A novel design approach is proposed by delicately revamping the technique of adding a power integrator with the introduction of a distinctive asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function and performing a skillful manipulation of sign functions. By using the present method, a continuous state feedback finite-time stabilizer can be recursively constructed while achieving the requirement of the asymmetric output constraint. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it is a unified manner that enables us to simultaneously tackle the problem of finite-time stabilization for high-order nonlinear systems with and without asymmetric output constraints, without changing the controller structure.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel scheme based on strongly continuous semigroup is proposed to find a pointwise optimal control function in a biological tissue. Here, mathematical model for hyperthermia therapy involves solution to the thermal wave equation as state while the control is given by the pointwise time dependent heat source. The target is the temperature at a given point within the tumor. Pointwise optimal control problem on and inside a tissue is solved subject to thermal wave model with Dirichlet and Rubin boundary conditions. The pointwise heating source induced by heating probe inserted at the tumor site as control at specific depth inside the biological body. Solutions for both thermal wave problem and its associated adjoint problem are proposed. Approximate controllability of the thermal wave problem is derived with the help of strongly continuous semigroups theory. We prove that the system is pseudo-port Hamiltonian. Pointwise time dependent optimal control problem is solved by using time discretization, conjugate gradient technique and strongly continuous semigroups theory. A set of numerical experiments concerning the design of optimal heating power strategy in cancer treatment by hyperthermia are presented.},

  abstract     = {We propose a decentralized control synthesis procedure for stabilizing voltage and frequency in AC Islanded microGrids (ImGs) composed of Distributed Generation Units (DGUs) and loads interconnected through power lines. The presented approach enables Plug-and-Play (PnP) operations, meaning that DGUs can be added or removed without compromising the overall ImG stability. The main feature of our design algorithm is that it does not depend on line parameters. This implies that (i) the synthesis of each local controller requires only the model of the corresponding DGU, and (ii) whenever a new DGU is plugged in, neighboring DGUs do not have to retune their regulators because of the new power line connected to them. Moreover, we formally prove that stabilizing local controllers can be always computed, independently of the electrical parameters. Theoretical results are validated by simulating in PSCAD the behavior of a 10-DGUs ImG.},

The network defender needs to secure the nodes with limited protective budget and increase the difficulties for launching attacks, while the attacker needs to decide the target nodes to attack. A resource allocation model for the defender and the malicious attacker is developed. A leader–follower Stackelberg game framework is proposed to study the behavior of both sides and the equilibrium of this security game is investigated.

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on a networked state estimation problem for a spatially large linear system with a distributed array of sensors, each of which offers partial state measurements, and the transmission is lossy. We propose a measurement coding scheme with two goals. Firstly, it permits adjusting the communication requirements by controlling the dimension of the vector transmitted by each sensor to the central estimator. Secondly, for a given communication requirement, the scheme is optimal, within the family of linear causal coders, in the sense that the weakest channel condition is required to guarantee the stability of the estimator. For this coding scheme, we derive the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) state estimator, and state a necessary and sufficient condition with a trivial gap, for its stability. We also derive a sufficient but easily verifiable stability condition, and quantify the advantage offered by the proposed coding scheme. Finally, simulations results are presented to confirm our claims.},

Integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) are employed to assess the robustness of MPC under uncertainty. We efficiently create a model pool, by performing linearization on selected transient points. All the possible uncertainties and nonlinearities (including the controller) can be introduced in the framework, assuming that they admit the appropriate IQCs, whilst the dissipation inequality can provide sufficient conditions for stability through the incorporation of IQCs. We demonstrate the existence of static multipliers, which can reduce the conservatism of the stability analysis significantly. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through two illustrative case studies.},
