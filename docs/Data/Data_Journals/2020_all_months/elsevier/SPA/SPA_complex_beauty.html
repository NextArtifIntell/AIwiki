The definition is based on a system of stochastic partial differential equations which generalize the classical state-space representation of CARMA processes. The resulting CARMA model differs fundamentally from the CARMA random field of Brockwell and Matsuda. We show existence of the model under mild assumptions and examine some of its features including the second-order structure and path properties. In particular, we investigate the sampling behavior and formulate conditions for the causal CARMA random field to be an ARMA random field when sampled on an equidistant lattice .},

It is shown that the mean random dynamical system generated by the solution operators has a unique tempered weak pullback random attractor in a Bochner space. The existence of invariant measures for the stochastic equations in the space of square summable sequences is also established.

  abstract     = {Microbial dormancy is an evolutionary trait that has emerged independently at various positions across the tree of life. It describes the ability of a microorganism to switch to a metabolically inactive state that can withstand unfavourable conditions. However, maintaining such a trait requires additional resources that could otherwise be used to increase e.g. reproductive rates. In this paper, we aim for gaining a basic understanding under which conditions maintaining a seed bank of dormant individuals provides a “fitness advantage” when facing resource limitations and competition for resources among individuals (in an otherwise stable environment). In particular, we wish to understand when an individual with a “dormancy trait” can invade a resident population lacking this trait despite having a lower reproduction rate than the residents. To this end, we follow a stochastic individual-based approach employing birth-and-death processes, where dormancy is triggered by competitive pressure for resources. In the large-population limit, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition under which a complete invasion of mutants has a positive probability. Further, we explicitly determine the limiting probability of invasion and the asymptotic time to fixation of mutants in the case of a successful invasion. In the proofs, we observe the three classical phases of invasion dynamics in the guise of Coron et al. (2017, 2019).},

  abstract     = {Reaction networks are mainly used to model the time-evolution of molecules of interacting chemical species . Stochastic models are typically used when the counts of the molecules are low, whereas deterministic models are often used when the counts are in high abundance. The mathematical study of reaction networks has increased dramatically over the last two decades as these models are now routinely used to investigate cellular behavior. In 2011, the notion of “tiers” was introduced to study the long time behavior of deterministically modeled reaction networks that are weakly reversible and have a single linkage class. This “tier” based argument was analytical in nature. Later, in 2014, the notion of a strongly endotactic network was introduced in order to generalize the previous results from weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class to this wider family of networks. The point of view of this later work was more geometric and algebraic in nature. The notion of strongly endotactic networks was later used in 2018 to prove a large deviation principle for a class of stochastically modeled reaction networks. In the current paper we provide an analytical characterization of strongly endotactic networks in terms of tier structures. By doing so, we not only shed light on the connection between the two points of view, but also make available a new proof technique for the study of strongly endotactic networks. We show the power of this new technique in two distinct ways. First, we demonstrate how the main previous results related to strongly endotactic networks, both for the deterministic and stochastic modeling choices, can be quickly obtained from our characterization. Second, we demonstrate how new results can be obtained by proving that a sub-class of strongly endotactic networks, when modeled stochastically, is positive recurrent . Finally, and similarly to recent independent work by Agazzi and Mattingly, we provide an example which closes a conjecture in the negative by showing that stochastically modeled strongly endotactic networks can be transient (and even explosive).},

The jump component is driven by a Poisson process with a time-dependent intensity function . All coefficients, i.e. drift, volatility and jump size, are controlled. Under fairly general conditions, we establish existence of a solution in a relaxed version of the mean field game and give conditions under which the optimal strategies are in fact Markovian, hence extending to a jump–diffusion setting previous results established in Lacker (2015). The proofs rely upon the notions of relaxed controls and martingale problems. Finally, to complement the abstract existence results, we study a simple illiquid inter-bank market model, where the banks can change their reserves only at the jump times of some exogenous Poisson processes with a common constant intensity, and provide some numerical results.},

We obtain general limit results for the evolution of the allele frequency distribution for rapidly fluctuating environments.

This is the natural continuation of a previous work, where the homogeneous Erdős–Rényi case was considered. The class of graphs we consider includes disordered W W -random graphs, with possibly unbounded graphons. The main result concerns a quenched convergence (that is true for almost every realization of the random graph) of the empirical measure of the system towards the solution of a nonlinear Fokker–Planck PDE with spatial extension, also appearing in different contexts, especially in neuroscience. The convergence of the spatial profile associated to the diffusions is also considered, and one proves that the limit is described in terms of a nonlinear integro-differential equation which matches the neural field equation in certain particular cases.},

The model describes the spread of an infectious disease on the lattice Z d Zd . The configuration at each site x ∈ Z d x∈Zd takes value in [ 0 , ∞ ) [0,∞) . Site x x is recovered at rate 1, and is infected by its neighbor x ± e i x±ei at rate λ ∓ λ 1 ∕ N λ∓λ1∕N , where { e i } 1 ≤ i ≤ d {ei}1≤i≤d is the canonical basis of the d d -dimensional lattice , λ , λ 1 λ,λ1 are non-negative constants and N N is the scaling parameter. When the infection occurs, the seriousness of the disease at site x x is added with that of y y . When there is neither recovery nor infection occurring during some time interval , the value at site x x evolves according to some ODE . We prove that for d ≥ 3 d≥3 and large value λ λ , the empirical measure of the process, under diffusive scaling, converges in probability to a deterministic measure whose density is the unique weak solution to a linear parabolic equation , while for small λ λ and in all dimensions, the limit is zero. We also conjecture that the fluctuations field in the former case is driven by a generalized Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, while a rigorous proof is absent. The main difficulty in proving the hydrodynamics is to prove the absolute continuity of the limiting path, where the theory of linear systems introduced in Liggett (1985) is utilized.},

In the Brownian case, we give a representation of the limiting process in terms of an explicit SDE and compare it to the SDE fulfilled by the Brownian meander.},

  abstract     = {We study a simple model of DNA evolution in a growing population of cells. Each cell contains a nucleotide sequence which randomly mutates at cell division. Cells divide according to a branching process. Following typical parameter values in bacteria and cancer cell populations, we take the mutation rate to zero and the final number of cells to infinity. We prove that almost every site (entry of the nucleotide sequence) is mutated in only a finite number of cells, and these numbers are independent across sites. However independence breaks down for the rare sites which are mutated in a positive fraction of the population. The model is free from the popular but disputed infinite sites assumption. Violations of the infinite sites assumption are widespread while their impact on mutation frequencies is negligible at the scale of population fractions. Some results are generalised to allow for cell death, selection, and site-specific mutation rates. For illustration we estimate mutation rates in a lung adenocarcinoma.},

The present work aims to propose a different explicit full-discrete scheme to numerically solve the stochastic Allen–Cahn equation with cubic nonlinearity, perturbed by additive space–time white noise. The approximation is easily implementable, performing the spatial discretization by a spectral Galerkin method and the temporal discretization by a kind of nonlinearity-tamed accelerated exponential integrator scheme. Error bounds in a strong sense are analyzed for both the spatial semi-discretization and the spatio-temporal full discretization, with convergence rates in both space and time explicitly identified. It turns out that the obtained convergence rate of the new scheme is, in the temporal direction, twice as high as existing ones in the literature. Numerical results are finally reported to confirm the previous theoretical findings.},

Essentially, we relax the criterion of the Peskun type covariance ordering by considering two different invariant probabilities , and obtain, in place of a strict ordering of asymptotic variances , a bound of the asymptotic variance of IS by that of the direct MCMC. Simple examples show that IS can have arbitrarily better or worse asymptotic variance than Metropolis–Hastings and delayed-acceptance (DA) MCMC. Our ordering implies that IS is guaranteed to be competitive up to a factor depending on the supremum of the (marginal) IS weight. We elaborate upon the criterion in case of unbiased estimators as part of an auxiliary variable framework. We show how the criterion implies asymptotic variance guarantees for IS in terms of pseudo-marginal (PM) and DA corrections, essentially if the ratio of exact and approximate likelihoods is bounded. We also show that convergence of the IS chain can be less affected by unbounded high-variance unbiased estimators than PM and DA chains.},

The set-up is well-suited to model, for example, real options in the context of investors who do not want to publicly reveal their interest in a certain business opportunity. We show that if the underlying process is a R d Rd -valued, continuous, strong Markov process , and the stopping payoff is a continuous function (with mild integrability properties) there exists a Nash equilibrium in randomised stopping times for the game. Moreover, the equilibrium strategies and the expected payoffs of the two players are computed explicitly in terms of the corresponding one-player game. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper to address this version of Dynkin games.},

  abstract     = {One main limitation of the existing optimal scaling results for Metropolis–Hastings algorithms is that the assumptions on the target distribution are unrealistic. In this paper, we consider optimal scaling of random-walk Metropolis algorithms on general target distributions in high dimensions arising from practical MCMC models from Bayesian statistics . For optimal scaling by maximizing expected squared jumping distance (ESJD), we show the asymptotically optimal acceptance rate 0.234 can be obtained under general realistic sufficient conditions on the target distribution . The new sufficient conditions are easy to be verified and may hold for some general classes of MCMC models arising from Bayesian statistics applications, which substantially generalize the product i.i.d. condition required in most existing literature of optimal scaling. Furthermore, we show one-dimensional diffusion limits can be obtained under slightly stronger conditions, which still allow dependent coordinates of the target distribution. We also connect the new diffusion limit results to complexity bounds of Metropolis algorithms in high dimensions .},

This paper focuses on how to operate on effective intervals to obtain regular Dirichlet subspaces. The first result is a complete characterization for a Dirichlet form to be a regular subspace of such a Dirichlet form in terms of effective intervals. Then we give an explicit road map how to obtain all regular Dirichlet subspaces from a local and regular Dirichlet form on an interval, by a series of intuitive operations on the effective intervals in the representation above. Finally applying previous results, we shall prove that every regular and local Dirichlet form has a special standard core generated by a continuous and strictly increasing function.},

Starting from a simple observation of generalized inverse Gaussian distributions with particular sets of parameters, we show, with the help of a result by Matsumoto and Yor (2000), that, for every x ∈ R x∈R and for every positive and finite stopping time τ τ of the process { e − B t A t } t ≥ 0 {e−BtAt}t≥0 , the following identity in law holds: e B τ sinh x + β ( A τ ) , C e B τ cosh x + β ̂ ( A τ ) , e − B τ A τ = ( d ) sinh ( x + B τ ) , C cosh ( x + B τ ) , e − B τ A τ , eBτsinhx+β(Aτ),CeBτcoshx+β̂(Aτ),e−BτAτ=(d)sinh(x+Bτ),Ccosh(x+Bτ),e−BτAτ, which extends an identity due to Bougerol (1983) in several aspects. Here β = { β ( t ) } t ≥ 0 β={β(t)}t≥0 and β ̂ = { β ̂ ( t ) } t ≥ 0 β̂={β̂(t)}t≥0 are one-dimensional standard Brownian motions, C C is a standard Cauchy random variable, and B B , β β , β ̂ β̂ and C C are independent. The derivation of the above identity provides another proof of Bougerol’s identity in law; moreover, a similar reasoning also enables us to obtain another extension for the three-dimensional random variable e B τ sinh x + β ( A τ ) , e B τ , A τ eBτsinhx+β(Aτ),eBτ,Aτ . By using an argument relevant to the derivation of those results, some invariance formulae for the Cauchy random variable C C involving an independent Rademacher random variable, are presented as well.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the central limit theorem for additive functionals of stationary Markov chains with general state space by using a new idea involving conditioning with respect to both the past and future of the chain. Practically, we show that any additive functionals of a stationary and totally ergodic Markov chain with var ( S n ) ∕ n var(Sn)∕n uniformly bounded, satisfies a n − n− central limit theorem with a random centering. We do not assume that the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic. However, the random centering is not needed if the Markov chain satisfies stronger forms of ergodicity . In absence of ergodicity the convergence in distribution still holds, but the limiting distribution might not be normal.},

The first part of the manuscript deals with the investigation of the conditions which guarantee the occurrence of noise-induced blow-up. In the second part we first prove the C 1 C1 -spatial regularity of the solution. Then, based on this regularity result, and using a strong positivity result we derive, for first in the literature of SPDEs, a Hopf’s type boundary value point lemma. The preceding results together with Kaplan’s eigenfunction method are then employed to provide a (non-local) drift term induced blow-up result. In the last part of the paper, we present a method which provides an upper bound of the probability of (non-local) drift term induced blow-up.},

Instead, the information, which evolves and accumulates over time and which is mathematically encoded by filtrations, has to be accounted for as well. The nested distance , also known as bicausal Wasserstein distance , recognizes this component and involves the filtration properly. This distance is of emerging importance due to its applications in stochastic analysis, stochastic programming, mathematical economics and other disciplines. This paper investigates the basic metric and topological properties of the nested distance on the space of discrete-time processes. In particular we prove that the nested distance generates a Polish topology, although the genuine space is not complete. Moreover we identify its completion to be the space of nested distributions , a space of generalized stochastic processes.},

These formulas lead to Monte Carlo simulation methods which can be easily parallelized. The second order method proposed here requires further regularity of coefficients in comparison with the first order method but achieves finite moments even when Poisson sampling is used for the partitions, in contrast to Andersson and Kohatsu-Higa (2017). Moreover, using an exponential scaling technique one achieves an unbiased simulation method which resembles a space importance sampling technique which significantly improves the efficiency of the proposed method.

The value u ( t , x ) u(t,x) represents the membrane potential at time t t of a typical neuron located in position x x , embedded in an infinite network of neurons. In the present paper, we complement this result by studying the fluctuations of such a stochastic system around its mean field limit u ( t , x ) u(t,x) . Our first main result is a central limit theorem stating that the spatial distribution associated to these fluctuations converges to the unique solution of some stochastic differential equation driven by a Gaussian noise. In our second main result we show that the solutions of this stochastic differential equation can be well approximated by a stochastic version of the neural field equation satisfied by u ( t , x ) u(t,x) . To the best of our knowledge, this result appears to be new in the literature.},

The goal of this paper is to establish precise asymptotics for large deviation probabilities P ( log | G n x | ⩾ n ( q + l ) ) P(log|Gnx|⩾n(q+l)) , where q &gt; λ q&amp;gt;λ is fixed and l l is vanishing as n → ∞ n→∞ . We study both invertible matrices and positive matrices and give analogous results for the couple ( X n x , log | G n x | ) (Xnx,log|Gnx|) with target functions, where X n x = G n x ∕ | G n x | Xnx=Gnx∕|Gnx| . As applications we improve previous results on the large deviation principle for the matrix norm ‖ G n ‖ ‖Gn‖ and obtain a precise local limit theorem with large deviations.},

The methods follow the strategy used for sublinear variance proofs on the lattice , using the Falik–Samorodnitsky inequality and a Bernoulli encoding, but with substantial technical difficulties. To deal with the different setup of the Euclidean model, we represent the passage time as a function of Bernoulli sequences and uniform sequences, and develop several “greedy lattice animal” arguments.},

Our main interest is on such SPDEs where the nonlinear part is stronger than the linear part, usually called stochastic dominated transport equations. Most standard numerical schemes lose their good stability properties on such equations, including the current linear implicit Euler method . We discretize the SPDE in space by the finite element method and propose a novel scheme called stochastic Rosenbrock-type scheme for temporal discretization . Our scheme is based on the local linearization of the semi-discrete problem obtained after space discretization and is more appropriate for such equations. We provide a strong convergence of the new fully discrete scheme toward the exact solution for multiplicative and additive noise and obtain optimal rates of convergence. Numerical experiments to sustain our theoretical results are provided.},

The proposed models include not only classical Brownian motion driven dynamics but also volatility processes that are driven by long-memory fractional Brownian motions or other Gaussian processes . We characterize the leading order terms of the mean squared error, which in turn enables us to determine an explicit formula for the leading term of the optimal bandwidth. Central limit theorems for the estimation error are also obtained. A feasible plug-in type bandwidth selection procedure is then proposed, for which, as a sub-problem, a new estimator of the volatility of volatility is developed. The optimal selection of the kernel function is also investigated. For Brownian Motion type volatilities, the optimal kernel turns out to be an exponential function, while, for fractional Brownian motion type volatilities, easily implementable numerical results to compute the optimal kernels are devised. Simulation studies further confirm the good performance of the proposed methods.},

Our aim is to set statistical tests to decide whether an observed field of this kind is heterogeneous or not. The statistical methodology relies upon a field analysis by quadratic variations , which are averages of square field increments. Specific to our approach, these variations are computed locally in several directions. We establish an asymptotic result showing a linear Gaussian relationship between these variations and parameters related to regularity and directional properties of the model. Using this result, we then design a test procedure based on Fisher statistics of linear Gaussian models. Eventually we evaluate this procedure on simulated data.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on a general class of systems of nonlinear stochastic differential equations , inspired by stochastic chemostat models. In the first part, the system is formulated as a hybrid switching diffusion. A complete characterization of the asymptotic behavior of the system under consideration is provided. It is shown that the long-term properties of the system can be classified by using a real-valued parameter λ λ . If λ ≤ 0 λ≤0 , the bacteria will die out, which means that the process does not operate. If λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 , the system has an invariant probability measure and the transition probability of the solution process converges to that of the invariant measure . The rate of convergence is also obtained. One of the distinct features of this paper is that the critical case λ = 0 λ=0 is also considered. Moreover, numerical examples are given to illustrate our results. In the second part of the paper, controlled diffusions with a long-run average objective function are treated. The associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is derived and the existence of an optimal Markov control is established. The techniques and methods of analysis in this paper can be applied to many other stochastic Kolmogorov systems.},

They generalize fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and Rosenblatt process in a natural way. They were introduced several decades ago. Yet, in contrast with fBm and many other Gaussian and stable stochastic processes and fields related to it, few results on path behavior of Hermite processes are available in the literature. For instance the natural issue of whether or not their paths are nowhere differentiable functions has not yet been solved even in the most simple case of the Rosenblatt process. The goal of our article is to derive a quasi-optimal lower bound for the asymptotic behavior of local oscillations of paths of Hermite processes of any rank N N , which, among other things, shows that these paths are nowhere differentiable functions .},

The Laplace principle for the strong solution of the stochastic system is established in a suitable Polish space using a weak convergence approach. The Wentzell–Freidlin large deviation principle is proved using the well known results of Varadhan and Bryc. The large deviations for shot time are also considered.

  abstract     = {The quantile admission process with veto power is a stochastic process suggested by Alon, Feldman, Mansour, Oren and Tennenholtz as a model for the evolution of an exclusive social club. Each member is represented by a real number (his opinion). On every round two new candidates, holding i.i.d. μ μ -distributed opinions, apply for admission. The one whose opinion is minimal is then admitted if the percentage of current members closer in their opinion to his is at least r r ; otherwise, neither is admitted. We show that for any μ μ and r r , the empirical distribution of opinions in the club converges a.s. to a limit distribution. We further analyse this limit, show that it may be non-deterministic and provide conditions under which it is deterministic. The results rely on a coupling of the evolution of the empirical r r -quantile of the club with a random walk in a changing environment.},

A version of this process starts whenever an infection occurs, and the contamination rate of the newly infected individual is a function of its state. When his process is absorbed, the individual becomes a removed case. We use a martingale approach to derive the distribution of the final epidemic size and severity for this class of models. Next, we examine some special cases. In particular, we focus on situations where the infection processes are Brownian motions and where they are Markov-modulated fluid flows. In the latter case, we use matrix-analytic methods to provide more explicit results. We conclude with some numerical illustrations.},

The control system is governed by a stochastic evolution equation, in which both drift and diffusion terms may contain the control variable and the set of controls is allowed to be nonconvex. Only one adjoint equation is introduced to derive the first order necessary optimality condition either by means of the classical variational analysis approach or, under an additional assumption, by using differential calculus of set-valued maps. More importantly, in order to avoid the essential difficulty with the well-posedness of higher order adjoint equations, using again the classical variational analysis approach, only the first and the second order adjoint equations are needed to formulate the second order necessary optimality condition , in which the solutions to the second order adjoint equation are understood in the sense of the relaxed transposition .},

Focussing on the case of strong sparsity and assuming additionally that the distribution tail of the jumps is regularly varying at infinity we consider a nearest neighbor random walk on the set of integers having jumps ± 1 ±1 with probability 1 ∕ 2 1∕2 at every nonmarked site, whereas a random drift is imposed at every marked site.

We are interested in finding the diffusion associated to the uniform peacock , i.e., the peacock with uniform law at all times on a time-varying support [ a ( t ) , b ( t ) ] . Following an idea from Dupire (1994), Madan and Yor (2002) propose a construction to find a diffusion martingale associated to a Peacock, under the assumption of existence of a solution to a particular stochastic differential equation (SDE). In this paper we study the SDE associated to the uniform Peacock and give sufficient conditions on the (conic) boundary to have a unique strong or weak solution and analyze the local time at the boundary. Eventually, we focus on the constant support case. Given that the only uniform martingale with time-independent support seems to be a constant, we consider more general (mean-reverting) diffusions. We prove existence of a solution to the related SDE and derive the moments of transition densities. Limit-laws and ergodic results show that the transition law tends to a uniform distribution.},

  abstract     = {In this work, it is proved that the set of boundedly-compact pointed metric spaces, equipped with the Gromov–Hausdorff topology, is a Polish space. The same is done for the Gromov–Hausdorff–Prokhorov topology. This extends previous works which consider only length spaces or discrete metric spaces. This is a measure theoretic requirement to study random boundedly-compact pointed (measured) metric spaces, which is the main motivation of this work. In particular, this provides a unified framework for studying random graphs, random discrete spaces and random length spaces. The proofs use a generalization of the classical theorem of Strassen, presented here, which is of independent interest. This generalization provides an equivalent formulation of the Prokhorov distance of two finite measures, having possibly different total masses, in terms of approximate couplings. A Strassen-type result is also provided for the Gromov–Hausdorff–Prokhorov metric for compact spaces.},

Herglotz’s theorem for functional time series allows to generalize existing results that are central to frequency domain analysis on the function space. In particular, we use this result to prove the existence of a functional Cramér representation of a large class of processes, including those with jumps in the spectral distribution and long-memory processes. We furthermore obtain an optimal finite dimensional reduction of the time series under weaker assumptions than available in the literature. The results of this paper therefore enable Fourier analysis for processes of which the spectral density operator does not necessarily exist.},

We introduce a topology on the set of (equivalence classes of) m2m spaces induced by certain test functions (i. e. the initial topology with respect to these test functions) and show that this topology is Polish by providing a complete metric. The framework introduced in this article is motivated by possible applications in biology. It is well suited for modeling the random evolution of the genealogy of a population in a hierarchical system with two levels, for example, host–parasite systems or populations which are divided into colonies. As an example we apply our theory to construct a random m2m space modeling the genealogy of a nested Kingman coalescent.},

You then search in continuous time, observing box J t at time t , and receiving a signal as you observe: if the box you are observing does not contain the object, your signal is a Brownian motion, but if it does contain the object your signal is a Brownian motion with positive drift μ . It is straightforward to derive the evolution of the posterior distribution π ( t ) for the location of the object. If T denotes the first time that one of the π j ( t ) reaches a desired threshold 1 − ε , then the goal is to find a search policy ( J t ) t ≥ 0 which minimizes the mean of T . This problem was studied by Posner and Rumsey (1966) and by Zigangirov (1966), who derive an expression for the mean time of a conjectured optimal policy, which we call follow the leader (FTL); at all times, observe the box with the highest posterior probability. Posner and Rumsey assert without proof that this is optimal, and Zigangirov offers a proof that if the prior distribution is uniform then FTL is optimal. In this paper, we show that if the prior is not uniform, then FTL is not always optimal; for uniform prior, the question remains open.},

We study v n vn at the location of the k k th largest potential, x k , 2 n xk,2n . Our main result is that, for a certain class of potential distributions, the solution exhibits a phase transition: for short time scales v n ( t n , x k , 2 n ) vn(tn,xk,2n) behaves like a system without diffusion and grows as exp { ( ξ n ( x k , 2 n ) − κ ) t n } exp{(ξn(xk,2n)−κ)tn} , whereas, for long time scales the growth is dictated by the principal eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction of the operator κ Δ n + ξ n κΔn+ξn , for which we give precise asymptotics. Moreover, the transition time depends only on the difference ξ n ( x 1 , 2 n ) − ξ n ( x k , 2 n ) ξn(x1,2n)−ξn(xk,2n) . One of our main motivations is to investigate the mutation–selection model of population genetics on a random fitness landscape, which is given by the ratio of v n vn to its total mass, with ξ n ξn corresponding to the fitness landscape. We show that the above mentioned phase transition translates to the mutation–selection model as follows: a population initially concentrated at x k , 2 n xk,2n moves completely to x 1 , 2 n x1,2n on time scales where the transition of growth rates occurs. The class of potentials we consider includes the Random Energy Model (REM) which is studied in the statistical physics literature as one of the main examples of a random fitness landscape.},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to the analysis of semilinear , parabolic, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations , with slow and fast time scales. Asymptotically, an averaging principle holds: the slow component converges to the solution of another semilinear , parabolic, SPDE, where the nonlinearity is averaged with respect to the invariant distribution of the fast process. We exhibit orders of convergence, in both strong and weak senses, in two relevant situations, depending on the spatial regularity of the fast process and on the covariance of the Wiener noise in the slow equation. In a very regular case, strong and weak orders are equal to 1 2 12 and 1. In a less regular case, the weak order is also twice the strong order. This study extends previous results concerning weak rates of convergence, where either no stochastic forcing term was included in the slow equation, or the covariance of the noise was extremely regular. An efficient numerical scheme, based on Heterogeneous Multiscale Methods, is briefly discussed.},

We show that their state space is always a union of open orthants with 0 as the only absorbing state and that there is no finite entrance law at 0 for these processes. We give conditions for these processes to satisfy the Feller property. Then we show that a Lamperti-type representation is also valid for R d Rd -valued multi-self-similar Markov processes. In particular, we obtain a one-to-one relationship between this set of processes and the set of Markov additive processes with values in { − 1 , 1 } d × R d {−1,1}d×Rd .

The main novelty is the fact that we allow for infinitely many modes (or regimes, i.e. the possible values of the piecewise-constant control process). We allow all the given coefficients in the model to be path-dependent, that is, their value at any time depends on the past trajectory of the controlled system. The main aim is to introduce a suitable (scalar) backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), with a constraint on the martingale part, that allows to give a probabilistic representation of the value function of the given problem. This is achieved by randomization of control, i.e. by introducing an auxiliary optimization problem which has the same value as the starting optimal switching problem and for which the desired BSDE representation is obtained. In comparison with the existing literature we do not rely on a system of reflected BSDE nor can we use the associated Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation in our non-Markovian framework.},

An important feature of those systems is that the elliptic part of the parabolic operators may be realized as an unbounded Schrödinger operator with compact resolvent in standard L 2 L2 -space. The Bernstein processes we are interested in are in general non-Markovian, may be stationary or non-stationary and are generated by weighted averages of measures naturally associated with the pure point spectrum of the operator. We also introduce time-dependent trace-class operators which possess several attributes of density operators in Quantum Statistical Mechanics , and prove that the statistical averages of certain bounded self-adjoint observables usually evaluated by means of such operators coincide with the expectation values of suitable functions of the underlying processes. In the particular case where the given parabolic equations involve the Hamiltonian of an isotropic system of quantum harmonic oscillators , we show that one of the associated processes is identical in law with the periodic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process.},

  abstract     = {We consider a stochastic search model with resetting for an unknown stationary target a ∈ R a∈R with known distribution μ μ . The searcher begins at the origin and performs Brownian motion with diffusion constant D D . The searcher is also armed with an exponential clock with spatially dependent rate r = r ( ⋅ ) r=r(⋅) , so that if it has failed to locate the target by the time the clock rings, then its position is reset to the origin and it continues its search anew from there. Denote the position of the searcher at time t t by X ( t ) X(t) . Let E 0 ( r ) E0(r) denote expectations for the process X ( ⋅ ) X(⋅) . The search ends at time T a = inf { t ≥ 0 : X ( t ) = a } Ta=inf{t≥0:X(t)=a} . The expected time of the search is then ∫ R ( E 0 ( r ) T a ) μ ( d a ) ∫R(E0(r)Ta)μ(da) . Ideally, one would like to minimize this over all resetting rates r r . We obtain quantitative growth rates for E 0 ( r ) T a E0(r)Ta as a function of a a in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the rate function r r , and also a rather precise dichotomy on the asymptotic behavior of the resetting function r r to determine whether E 0 ( r ) T a E0(r)Ta is finite or infinite. We show generically that if r ( x ) r(x) is of the order | x | 2 l |x|2l , with l &gt; − 1 l&amp;gt;−1 , then log E 0 ( r ) T a logE0(r)Ta is of the order | a | l + 1 |a|l+1 ; in particular, the smaller the asymptotic size of r r , the smaller the asymptotic growth rate of E 0 ( r ) T a E0(r)Ta . The asymptotic growth rate of E 0 ( r ) T a E0(r)Ta continues to decrease when r ( x ) ∼ D λ x 2 r(x)∼Dλx2 with λ &gt; 1 λ&amp;gt;1 ; now the growth rate of E 0 ( r ) T a E0(r)Ta is more or less of the order | a | 1 + 1 + 8 λ 2 |a|1+1+8λ2 . Note that this exponent increases to ∞ ∞ when λ λ increases to ∞ ∞ and decreases to 2 when λ λ decreases to 1. However, if λ = 1 λ=1 , then E 0 ( r ) T a = ∞ E0(r)Ta=∞ , for a ≠ 0 a≠0 . Our results suggest that for many distributions μ μ supported on all of R R , a near optimal (or optimal) choice of resetting function r r in order to minimize ∫ R d ( E 0 ( r ) T a ) μ ( d a ) ∫Rd(E0(r)Ta)μ(da) will be one which decays quadratically as D λ x 2 Dλx2 for some λ &gt; 1 λ&amp;gt;1 . We also give explicit, albeit rather complicated, variational formulas for inf r ≩ 0 ∫ R d ( E 0 ( r ) T a ) μ ( d a ) infr≩0∫Rd(E0(r)Ta)μ(da) . For distributions μ μ with compact support, one should set r = ∞ r=∞ off of the support. We also discuss this case.},

  abstract     = {The martingale part in the semimartingale decomposition of a Brownian motion with respect to an enlargement of its filtration, is an anticipative mapping of the given Brownian motion. In analogy to optimal transport theory, we define causal transport plans in the context of enlargement of filtrations, as the Kantorovich counterparts of the aforementioned non-adapted mappings. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a Brownian motion to remain a semimartingale in an enlarged filtration, in terms of certain minimization problems over sets of causal transport plans. The latter are also used in order to give robust transport-based estimates for the value of having additional information, as well as model sensitivity with respect to the reference measure, for the classical stochastic optimization problems of utility maximization and optimal stopping.},

We prove that for a small enough interaction parameter, any solution converges to the unique (in this case) invariant probability measure . To this aim, we first obtain global bounds on the jump rate and derive a Volterra type integral equation satisfied by this rate. We then replace temporary the interaction part of the equation by a deterministic external quantity (we call it the external current). For constant current, we obtain the convergence to the invariant probability measure. Using a perturbation method , we extend this result to more general external currents.

Via duality with respect to probability generating functions , we deduce limiting results for the survival probabilities of time-homogeneous branching processes with arbitrary offspring distributions, underlying binomial disasters. Extending this method, we obtain corresponding results for time-inhomogeneous birth–death processes underlying time-dependent binomial disasters and continuous state branching processes with p p -jumps.},

  abstract     = {In traditional works on numerical schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs), the globally Lipschitz assumption is often assumed to ensure different types of convergence. In practice, this is often too strong a condition. Brownian motion driven SDEs used in applications sometimes have coefficients which are only Lipschitz on compact sets, but the paths of the SDE solutions can be arbitrarily large. In this paper, we prove convergence in probability and a weak convergence result under a less restrictive assumption, that is, locally Lipschitz and with no finite time explosion. We prove if a numerical scheme converges in probability uniformly on any compact time set (UCP) with a certain rate under a global Lipschitz condition , then the UCP with the same rate holds when a globally Lipschitz condition is replaced with a locally Lipschitz plus no finite explosion condition. For the Euler scheme , weak convergence of the error process is also established. The main contribution of this paper is the proof of n n weak convergence of the normalized error process and the limit process is also provided. We further study the boundedness of the second moments of the weak limit process and its running supremum under both global Lipschitz and locally Lipschitz conditions.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce and investigate two novel classes of loop measures, space–time Markovian loop measures and Bosonic loop measures , respectively. We consider loop soups with intensity μ ≤ 0 μ≤0 (chemical potential in physics terms), and secondly, we study Markovian loop measures on graphs with an additional “time” dimension leading to so-called space–time random walks and their loop measures and Poisson point loop processes. Interesting phenomena appear when the additional coordinate of the space–time process is on a discrete torus with non-symmetric jump rates. The projection of these space–time random walk loop measures onto the space dimensions is loop measures on the spatial graph, and in the scaling limit of the discrete torus, these loop measures converge to the so-called Bosonic loop measures . This provides a natural probabilistic definition of Bosonic loop measures . These novel loop measures have similarities with the standard Markovian loop measures only that they give weights to loops of certain lengths, namely any length which is multiple of a given length β &gt; 0 β&amp;gt;0 which serves as an additional parameter. We complement our study with generalised versions of Dynkin’s isomorphism theorem (including a version for the whole complex field) as well as Symanzik’s moment formulae for complex Gaussian measures . Due to the lacking symmetry of our space–time random walks, the distributions of the occupation time fields are given in terms of complex Gaussian measures over complex-valued random fields [8] , [10] . Our space–time setting allows obtaining quantum correlation functions as torus limits of space–time correlation functions.},

We first derive the Feynman–Kac formula by reformulating the original model into an auxiliary Caputo-type evolution equation with a specific forcing term subject to certain smoothness and compatibility conditions. After that, we confirm that the stochastic formula also provides the solution in the weak sense even though the problem data is nonsmooth. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and the application of the stochastic formula.},

This model is consistent with stylized facts of high frequency data such as the discrete nature of tick data and the clustering in the order flow. We include both temporary and permanent effects into our analysis. We use stochastic filtering to reduce the optimal liquidation problem to an equivalent optimization problem under complete information. This leads to a stochastic control problem for piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). We carry out a detailed mathematical analysis of this problem. In particular, we derive the optimality equation for the value function, we characterize the value function as continuous viscosity solution of the associated dynamic programming equation, and we prove a novel comparison result. The paper concludes with numerical results illustrating the impact of partial information and price impact on the value function and on the optimal liquidation rate.},

In a series of previous papers (i) the transform of r ( ⋅ ) r(⋅) has been derived for the case that the driving process is spectrally-positive ( sp ) or spectrally-negative ( sn ) Lévy, (ii) it has been shown that for sp -Lévy and sn -Lévy input r ( ⋅ ) r(⋅) is positive, decreasing, and convex, (iii) in case the driving Lévy process is light-tailed (a condition that is automatically fulfilled in the sn case), the decay of the decay rate agrees with that of the tail of the busy period distribution. In the present paper we first prove the conjecture that property (ii) carries over to spectrally two-sided Lévy processes; we do so for the case the Lévy process is reflected at 0, and the case it is reflected at 0, and K &gt; 0 K&amp;gt;0 . Then we focus on queues fed by Markov additive processes ( map s). We start by the establishing the counterpart of (i) for sp - and sn - map s. Then we refute property (ii) for map s: we construct examples in which the correlation coefficient can be (locally) negative, decreasing, and concave. Finally, in relation to (iii), we point out how to identify the decay rate of r ( ⋅ ) r(⋅) in the light-tailed map case, thus showing that the tail behavior of r ( ⋅ ) r(⋅) does not necessarily match that of the busy-period tail; singularities related to the transition rate matrix of the background Markov chain turn out to play a crucial role here.},

We introduce particular couplings called left-monotone transports; they are characterized equivalently by a no-crossing property of their support, as simultaneous optimizers for a class of bivariate transport cost functions with a Spence–Mirrlees property, and by an order-theoretic minimality property. Left-monotone transports are unique if μ 0 μ0 is atomless, but not in general. In the one-period case n = 1 n=1 , these transports reduce to the Left-Curtain coupling of Beiglböck and Juillet. In the multiperiod case, the bivariate marginals for dates ( 0 , t ) (0,t) are of Left-Curtain type, if and only if μ 0 , … , μ n μ0,…,μn have a specific order property. The general analysis of the transport problem also gives rise to a strong duality result and a description of its polar sets. Finally, we study a variant where the intermediate marginals μ 1 , … , μ n − 1 μ1,…,μn−1 are not prescribed.},

Moreover, in recent years, by modifying the Wasserstein distance appropriately, this technique has been transferred to further evolution equations and systems; see e.g. Maas (2011), Fathi and Simon (2016), Erbar (2016). In this paper we establish such a gradient flow representation for evolution equations that depend on a non-evolving parameter. These equations are connected to a local mean-field interacting spin system. We then use this gradient flow representation to prove a large deviation principle for the empirical process associated to this system. This is done by using the criterion established in Fathi (2016). Finally, the corresponding hydrodynamic limit is shown by using the approach initiated in Sandier and Serfaty (2004) and Serfaty (2011).},

Both servers employ the first-in-first-out policy. The reuse of service times creates strong dependence at the second queue, making its workload difficult to analyze. To investigate the evolution of workload in the second queue, we introduce and study a process M M , called the plateau process, which encodes most of the information in the workload process. We focus on the case of infinite-variance service times and show that under appropriate scaling, workload in the first queue converges, and although the workload in the second queue does not converge, the plateau process does converge to a limit M ∗ M∗ that is a certain function of two independent Lévy processes . Using excursion theory, we derive some useful properties of M ∗ M∗ and compare a time changed version of it to a limit process derived in previous work.},

We consider a more general setting, called the pairwise Markov model, where the joint process consisting of finite-state hidden regime and observation process is assumed to be a Markov chain . We prove that under some conditions it is possible to extend the Viterbi path to infinity for almost every observation sequence which in turn enables to define an infinite Viterbi decoding of the observation process, called the Viterbi process. This is done by constructing a block of observations, called a barrier, which ensures that the Viterbi path goes through a given state whenever this block occurs in the observation sequence.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study weighted distances in scale-free spatial network models: hyperbolic random graphs, geometric inhomogeneous random graphs and scale-free percolation. In hyperbolic random graphs, n = Θ ( e R ∕ 2 ) vertices are sampled independently from the hyperbolic disk with radius R and two vertices are connected either when they are within hyperbolic distance R , or independently with a probability depending on the hyperbolic distance. In geometric inhomogeneous random graphs, and in scale-free percolation, each vertex is given an independent weight and location from an underlying measured metric space and Z d , respectively, and two vertices are connected independently with a probability that is a function of their distance and their weights. We assign independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) weights to the edges of the obtained random graphs, and investigate the weighted distance (the length of the shortest weighted path) between two uniformly chosen vertices, called typical weighted distance. In scale-free percolation, we study the weighted distance from the origin of vertex-sequences with norm tending to infinity. In particular, we study the case when the parameters are so that the degree distribution in the graph follows a power law with exponent τ ∈ ( 2 , 3 ) (infinite variance), and the edge-weight distribution is such that it produces an explosive age-dependent branching process with power-law offspring distribution, that is, the branching process produces infinitely many individuals in finite time. We show that in all three models, typical distances within the giant/infinite component converge in distribution , that is, no re-scaling is necessary. This solves an open question in Hofstad and Komjáthy (2017). The main tools of our proof are to develop elaborate couplings of the models to infinite versions, to follow the shortest paths to infinity and then to connect these paths by using weight-dependent percolation on the graphs, that is, we delete edges attached to vertices with higher weight with higher probability. We realise the percolation using the edge-weights: only very short edges connected to high weight vertices are allowed to stay, hence establishing arbitrarily short upper bounds for connections.},

The parasite is capable to persist in its host till the host dies, and to reinfect other hosts. To maintain type diversity within a host, balancing selection is assumed. For a suitable parameter regime we show that in the limit of large host and parasite populations the host state frequencies follow a dynamical system with a globally stable equilibrium , guaranteeing that both types are maintained in the parasite population for a long time on the host time scale.},

We investigate the spectral relationship between P P and the two MH kernels. Along the way, we state a version of Weyl’s inequality for the spectral gap of P P (and hence its additive reversiblization), as well as an expansion of P P . Both results are expressed in terms of the spectrum of the two MH kernels. In the spirit of Fill (1991) and Paulin (2015), we define a new pseudo-spectral gap based on the two MH kernels, and show that the total variation distance from stationarity can be bounded by this gap. We give variance bounds of the Markov chain in terms of the proposed gap, and offer spectral bounds in metastability and Cheeger’s inequality in terms of the two MH kernels by comparison of Dirichlet form and Peskun ordering.},

Another one is to select equilibria that are included in the support of the zero noise limit of the mean-field game with common noise. A last one is to select equilibria supported by the limit of the mean-field component of the corresponding N N -player game as the number of players goes to infinity.

Here we study the heavy range: the number of edges frequently visited by the walk. The asymptotic behavior of this process when the number of visits is a power of the number of steps of the walk is given for all recurrent cases.

In a directed preferential attachment model, despite the well-known marginal power-law degree distributions, not much investigation has been done on the joint behavior of the in- and out-degree growth. Also, statistical estimates of the marginal tail exponent of the power-law degree distribution often use the Hill estimator as one of the key summary statistics, even though no theoretical justification has been given. This paper focuses on the convergence of the joint empirical measure for in- and out-degrees and proves the consistency of the Hill estimator. To do this, we first derive the asymptotic behavior of the joint degree sequences by embedding the in- and out-degrees of a fixed node into a pair of switched birth processes with immigration and then establish the convergence of the joint tail empirical measure. From these steps, the consistency of the Hill estimators is obtained.},

We take the spectral approach by assuming that one path of the first N N Fourier modes of the solution is continuously observed over a finite time interval . First, we show that the model is regular and fits into classical local asymptotic normality framework, and thus the MLE and the Bayesian estimators are weakly consistent, asymptotically normal, efficient, and asymptotically equivalent in the class of loss functions with polynomial growth. Secondly, and mainly, we prove a Bernstein–Von Mises type result, that strengthens the existing results in the literature, and that also allows to investigate the Bayesian type estimators with respect to a larger class of priors and loss functions than that covered by classical asymptotic theory . In particular, we prove strong consistency and asymptotic normality of Bayesian estimators in the class of loss functions of at most exponential growth .

  abstract     = {We consider a continuous-time random walk which is defined as an interpolation of a random walk on a point process on the real line. The distances between neighboring points of the point process are i.i.d. random variables in the normal domain of attraction of an α α -stable distribution with 0 0&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;1 . This is therefore an example of a random walk in a Lévy random medium . Specifically, it is a generalization of a process known in the physical literature as Lévy–Lorentz gas . We prove that the annealed version of the process is superdiffusive with scaling exponent 1 ∕ ( α + 1 ) 1∕(α+1) and identify the limiting process, which is not càdlàg. The proofs are based on the technique of Kesten and Spitzer for random walks in random scenery.},

In this paper, we study the existence, construction of Root’s solutions to SEP, in the absence of this convex ordering condition. We replace the uniform integrability condition by the minimality condition (Monroe, 1972), as the criterion of “good” solutions. A sufficient and necessary condition (in terms of local time) for minimality is given. We also discuss the optimality of such minimal solutions. These results extend the generality of the results given by Cox and Wang (2013) and Gassiat et al. (2015).

Ingredients for standard arguments involve the leading order tail asymptotics of the distribution of the first hitting time of the domain of interest and its relation to an underlying harmonic function . In the present article we condition stable processes to avoid intervals. The required tail asymptotics in the stable setting for α ≥ 1 α≥1 go back to classical work of Blumenthal et al. and Port from the 1960s. For α α&amp;lt;1 , we appeal to recent results centered around the so-called deep factorisation of the stable process to compute hitting probabilities and, moreover, to identify the associated harmonic functions for all α ∈ ( 0 , 2 ) α∈(0,2) . With these in hand, we thus prove that conditioning to avoid an interval is possible in the classical sense and that the resulting process is a Doob h h -transform of the stable process killed on entering the aforesaid interval. Appealing to the representation of the conditioned process as a Doob h h -transform, we verify that the conditioned process is transient.},

This is a general, possibly high dimensional filtering problem which is not even locally approximately Gaussian, whence essentially only particle filtering methods remain as solution techniques. In this work we present an efficient numerical solution by introducing an approximate filter for which conditional characteristic functions can be calculated by solving a system of generalized Riccati differential equations depending on the observation and the process characteristics of X X . The quality of the approximation can be controlled by easily observable quantities in terms of a macro location of the signal in state space. Asymptotic techniques as well as maximization techniques can be directly applied to the solutions of the Riccati equations leading to novel very tractable filtering formulas. The efficiency of the method is illustrated with numerical experiments for Cox–Ingersoll–Ross and Wishart processes, for which Gaussian approximations usually fail.},

More precisely, we show that the recursive algorithm presented in Lamberton and Pagès (2002) and based on simulation algorithms of stochastic schemes with decreasing steps can be used to build invariant measures for general Feller processes. We also propose various applications: Approximation of Markov Brownian diffusion stationary regimes with a Milstein or an Euler scheme and approximation of a Markov switching Brownian diffusion stationary regimes using an Euler scheme .},

  abstract     = {Focusing on stochastic systems arising in mean-field models, the systems under consideration belong to the class of switching diffusions, in which continuous dynamics and discrete events coexist and interact. The discrete events are modeled by a continuous-time Markov chain. Different from the usual switching diffusions, the systems include mean-field interactions. Our effort is devoted to obtaining laws of large numbers for the underlying systems. One of the distinct features of the paper is the limit of the empirical measures is not deterministic but a random measure depending on the history of the Markovian switching process. A main difficulty is that the standard martingale approach cannot be used to characterize the limit because of the coupling due to the random switching process. In this paper, in contrast to the classical approach, the limit is characterized as the conditional distribution (given the history of the switching process) of the solution to a stochastic McKean–Vlasov differential equation with Markovian switching.},

The resulting equation has solutions absolutely continuous with respect to time. We then propose a convergent θ θ -linear scheme for the numerical solution of the reformulated equation.

Indeed, we study large deviations for the case where the signal-to-noise ratio is small by considering weak convergence arguments. To that end, we first prove the uniqueness of the solution of the controlled Zakai and Kushner–Stratonovich equations. For this, we employ a method which transforms the associated equations into SDEs in an appropriate Hilbert space . Next, taking into account the controlled analogue of Zakai and Kushner–Stratonovich equations, respectively, the large deviation principle follows by employing the existence, uniqueness and tightness of the solutions.},

Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of the conjugate observables and clarify the precise mathematical conditions and ranges of applicability for the two types of FDTs.
