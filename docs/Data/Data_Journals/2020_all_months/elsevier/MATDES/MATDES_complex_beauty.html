  abstract     = {This study documents the effects of the twist channel angular pressing (TCAP) on the structure and selected properties of Al/Cu clad composites. Processing of the designed clad composite via single, as well as double pass TCAP was performed experimentally, and simulated via the finite element method. The deformation behaviour predicted via the simulation was verified experimentally by 3D Micro-CT scanning, and by structure analyses. The results revealed that the single pass introduced significant deformation strengthening of the Al/Cu composite components, and after the second pass, the effective imposed strain in the Al sheath approached the value of 5. The composite sheath also exhibited more or less homogeneous distribution of residual stress of the lowest observed absolute values, and the smallest observed average grain size - slightly above 1.5 μm. The Cu grains in the structures of the wires within the extruded composites also refined significantly, especially after the second pass, to almost 3 μm. However, the analysed parameters exhibited slight variations across the cross-sections of the composite billets. This can be attributed to phenomena related to the (differences in the) plastic flow. The intensive imposed shear strain also imparted increase in microhardness and changes in thermal conductivity.},

The core of new material prediction is to find the relationship between material structure and properties. In this research, machine learning will have important advantages and play an important role for materials data. In this paper,we put forward a framework combining feature engineering and linear regression to find the correlation between structure and properties from materials data. High temperature superconductor and double perovskites for solar cells were employed to test the feasibility of the method. In the former, we successfully rebuilt a descriptor ( ℓζ ) −1 from data mining which is consistent with the theoretical formula. In the latter, as an exploration, we obtain a new descriptor χ b 2 rs x 2 e rs x − 1 χb2rsx2ersx−1 from data mining which expresses the heat of formation ( ΔH F ) in the double perovskite. By our experiment, the method can obtain related expressions of structure-property relationship for material.The results show that the method is a simple yet efficient paradigm to construct the structure-property relationship and provides valuable hints to accelerate the process of materials design.},

However, for some light-weight and high-strength materials, such as 7xxx series aluminum alloy , their room-temperature plasticity is poor, which limits the production of complex structural components of these materials. In this study, the microstructure evolution of annealed 7075 aluminum alloy and its influence on room-temperature plasticity were investigated. Firstly, the annealing experiments with different annealing temperature and soaking time were conducted, and the annealed microstructure evolution was analyzed. Secondly, the room-temperature tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the room-temperature plasticity. The relationship between annealed microstructure and plastic deformation behavior was studied. The new effect mechanisms of annealed microstructure on room-temperature plasticity was found. The results indicated that the annealed grains with high Schmid factor (˃0.4) adjacent to coarse granular-shaped secondary particles exhibited easy multiple slip system activation and smoothly transformed strain through the slip bands, which promoted the grain fragmentation. Concurrently, the secondary particles underwent rupture and separation. Owing to the low strain localization and multiple slip systems of the grain fragments, they can coordinately deform around the prior particle-matrix interfaces or between the separate particle pieces, which led to good room-temperature plasticity.},

The specimens are first machined from the surface (t1), subsurface (t2) and center (t3) layers along the thickness direction of the 7050 Al alloy plate. Then in the rolling plane of each layer, the specimens are taken along the angles of 0° (L0), 45° (L45) and 90° (L90) to the rolling direction. After CA, the creep strain shows the trends of t1 &gt; t2 &gt; t3 along the thickness direction and L45 &gt; L90 &gt; L0 for in-plane directions, while the yield strength (YS) shows t1 &gt; t3 &gt; t2 and L90 &gt; L0 &gt; L45, respectively. Before CA, the low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) increase along the thickness direction, leading to a reduced creep strain. After CA, through-thickness heterogeneous LAGBs contributes to the above trend of YS. After L45 and L90 loading, S, Brass and Copper textures are obviously weaker than that under L0 loading, and show the largest equivalent Schmid factor (ESF) for L45 loading, and that for L0 and L90 conditions are approaching; while the equivalent slip system number (ESSN) shows L90 &gt; L0 &gt; L45.

  abstract     = {The prediction of thermal stress and distortion is a prerequisite for high-quality additive manufacturing (AM). The widely applied thermo-mechanical model using the finite element method (FEM) leaves much to be improved due to their oversimplifications on material deposition, molten pool flow, etc. In this study, a high-fidelity modelling approach by linking the thermal-fluid (computational fluid dynamics, CFD) and mechanical models (named as CFD-FEM model) is developed to predict the thermal stress for AM taking into account the influences of thermal-fluid flow. Profiting from the precise temperature profiles and melt track geometry extracted from the thermal-fluid model as well as the remarkable flexibility of the quiet element method of FEM, this work aims at simulating the thermal stress distribution by involving physical changes in the AM process , e.g., melting and solidification of powder particles, molten pool evolution and inter-track inter-layer re-melting. Unlike the conventional thermo-mechanical analysis, in this approach, thermal stress calculation is purely based on a mechanical model where the thermal loads are applied by using a linear interpolation function to spatially and temporally map the temperature values from the thermal-fluid model&#39;s cell centres into the FEM element nodes. With the proposed approach, the thermal stress evolution in the AM process of single track, multiple tracks and multiple layers are simulated, where the rough surfaces and internal voids can be well incorporated. Moreover, a conventional thermo-mechanical simulation of two tracks with predefined track geometry is conducted for cross comparison. Finally, the simulated thermal stress distribution can rationally explain the crack distribution observed in the experiments.},

With increasing compressive strength, concrete becomes even more brittle, hence requiring appropriate reinforcement to enhance its ductility. This paper presents a new method for increasing the ductility of ultra-high-performance concrete by reinforcing it with 3D printed polymeric lattices made of either polylactic acid (PLA) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). These lattice-reinforced concrete specimens were then tested in compression and four-point bending. The effect of polymeric reinforcement ratios on mechanical properties was investigated by testing two lattice configurations. The lattices were very successful in transforming the brittle ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) into a ductile material with strain hardening behavior; all flexural specimens revealed multiple cracking and strain hardening behavior up to peak load. Increasing the ABS reinforcing ratio from 19.2\% to 33.7\% resulted in a 22\% reduction in average compressive strength. However, in flexure, increasing the PLA reinforcing ratio from 19.2\% to 33.7\% resulted in a 38\% increase in average peak load. The compression results of all specimens independent of their reinforcement ratio revealed smooth softening behavior in compression.},

Considerable efforts have been made to develop an efficient surface coating that can provide higher Mg stent corrosion resistance , sustained drug-delivery capability, and vascular compatibility. Herein, we introduce poly(ether imide) (PEI) and poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) (PLGA) as surface coating polymers for WE43 Mg-alloy stent. Using a sequential spray-coating method, we developed a novel asymmetric stent coating comprising an inner surface coated with a PEI single layer and outer/side surfaces coated with sirolimus-loaded PLGA/PEI double layers. PEI coating layer has excellent adhesiveness to WE43 surface and considerably improves WE43 corrosion resistance and in vitro endothelial cell compatibility. PLGA/PEI double coating layer ensures a low release rate of sirolimus and stable surface morphology during drug-release process. Only vascular smooth muscle cells are directly affected by sirolimus owing to the asymmetric geometry of PLGA/PEI double coating, which has a satisfactory anti-proliferation effect. These results indicate that the developed asymmetrically PEI- and PLGA/PEI-coated WE43 stents have significant potential for achieving enhanced re-endothelialization and suppressed in-stent restenosis in vascular stent applications.},

Four subsequent thermal cycles in each layer induce various microstructural transitions for each individual grain. The high cooling rate solidification in the first two thermal cycles leads to the formation of a highly deformed cellular microstructure. Discontinuous and continuous dynamic recrystallization are activated in the third thermal cycle to induce grain refinement. The fourth thermal cycle undergoes dynamic recovery and grain growth. The as-built alloys exhibit an excellent combination of high yield and ultimate tensile strength . The high strength is attributed to the activation of the various dynamic recrystallization mechanisms, as well as to the development of the cellular structures resulting from a high cooling rate upon solidification.

  abstract     = {Wearable electronics demonstrate great potential for a wide range of applications, including electronic skin, implantable bio-medical devices, and health monitoring sensors. Such applications require highly stretchable and durable electrodes for adequate reliability and superior performance. Although extensive works on intrinsically stretchable electrodes have been reported, obtaining both mechanical integrity and electrical conductivity remains challenging owing to a trade-off effect. In addition, the lack of mechanical resilience to external stimulation of the stretchable electrodes has limited practical commercialization in numerous industrial fields. Here, intrinsically stretchable gold nanosheet (AuNS) electrodes with enhanced mechanical durability due to optimized hot-pressing fabrication conditions is studied. The AuNS stretchable electrodes exhibited lifetimes 8 times longer against repetitive sliding cycles under 88 kPa contact pressure compared to other hot-pressing conditions. Furthermore, the AuNS stretchable electrodes maintained a 5 Ω/sq. sheet resistance under 50\% mechanical strain and 1000 stretch-release cycles. Application of hot-pressing to the AuNSs facilitated a firm contact between the AuNSs and hence they remained intact when stretched. Also, it is successfully demonstrated that AuNS stretchable electrodes can form a conformal contact with human skin and capture dynamic human bio-signals, exhibiting excellent performance compared to existing commercial wearable devices.},

The microstructural evolution and variant selection across builds in response to different printing strategies processed by electron beam powder bed fusion has been previously clarified. However, a detailed knowledge of the grain boundary plane characteristics of the α-α intervariant interfaces is still missing. The aim of this study was to reveal the full ‘five-parameter’ crystallographic characteristics of the intervariant boundaries. The most common α-α intervariant for colony and basketweave microstructures was 60°/[1 1 2 ¯ 2¯ 0], while in the acicular microstructure, the maximum was at 63.26°/[ 10 ¯ 10¯ 5 5 3 ¯ 3¯ ]. This is discussed in terms of self-accommodation during the β to α phase transformation, and the degree of coherence of the α laths in the as-deposited condition and during further growth. The grain boundary plane distributions reveal a high tendency for intervariant boundaries to terminate on prismatic and pyramidal planes rather than on low-energy basal planes . This suggests that, during additive manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V and irrespective of the α morphology, the crystallographic constraints imposed by the Burgers orientation relationship determine the boundary plane distribution characteristics.},

The model couples the self-accelerating exothermic free-radical bulk polymerization of MMA (gel effect) with the heat transfer within the preform and to the environment. The predicted temperature profiles are in excellent agreement with experimental data measured during a series of in-situ polymerization tests with different heating conditions and preform thicknesses.

In this work, multi-scale interfaces were implemented into a hierarchical TiN/SiO x microstructure to mimic stepwise crack growth behaviour of the hard and damage resistant bivalve mollusc Saxidomus purpuratus shell. In situ micromechanical testing in scanning and transmission electron microscopes revealed multi-scale crack deflection events at grain boundaries of individual alternately-tilted TiN crystallites , at kinks of their repeatedly tilted columnar grains as well as crack interaction with perpendicular interfaces of elastic amorphous SiO x layers. These events induced an increase in the crack surface area, reduction of the crack driving force and dissipation of local stress and energy at the crack tip with subsequent crack slow-down or arrest, resulting in fracture toughness exceeding by ~200\% the toughness of monolithic TiN nanoceramics. By this perspective biomimetic microstructural design, catastrophic failure of brittle ceramics may be turned into a predictable and controllable process increasing reliability of strong materials in various challenging safety-critical engineering applications . It also shows potential paths for the development of strong and simultaneously tough materials with high mechanical and thermal stability.},

In this study, three different EBM beam scan strategies, i.e. the standard raster scan, ordered spot scan, and random spot scan patterns, were used to fabricate three identical Ti-6Al-4V blocks. Using scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, variations in microstructure and crystallographic texture, such as α lath thickness, prior beta β grain size and orientation, α/α lath boundary (LB) distributions, are investigated with respect to the applied scan strategy. Both spot scan strategies result in coarser α laths and smaller prior β grains with width and height &lt; 1/3 of the value of the typical large columnar grains, observed in raster scan samples. The combined fraction of type 2 and type 4 α/α LBs measured in the three samples was found to be between 0.50 and 0.85, which is greater than the expected combined fraction of ~0.36 for a random distribution of α variants. This suggests the presence of a mild to weak variant selection in EBM Ti64.},

In present study, a zero Poisson&#39;s ratio metamaterial with intelligent switching mechanical properties and vibration isolation effect is proposed. Based on a 4D printing method of shape memory polymer, this metamaterial is created that can sense temperature changes and switch mechanical properties. The macroscopic deformation and the morphology change of the metamaterial during compression tests are analyzed using experimental and finite element methods. The irregular buckling distortion of the metamaterial is eliminated by cylindrical design, and controllable and adjustable local deformation and stress-strain curve are achieved based on microstructure gradient design. Subsequently, this work focused on the vibration isolation performance of metamaterials, and found fascinating shock absorption performance. Compared with traditional linear spring, this metamaterial spring can effectively reduce the vibration amplitude of certain frequency bands before reaching the resonance peak, which provides a new realization method for low-frequency vibration isolation design.},

The modified samples presented greatly enhanced elongation at break and impact response, simultaneously preserved their tensile strength and high thermal conductivity. The reactive compatibilization between PBT and Al 2 O 3 spheres was confirmed by SEM, FTIR, and rheology characterizations. Three rheology criteria plots demonstrated that the filler percolating network and apparent yield behavior occurred in the ternary PBT/Al 2 O 3 /E-MA-GMA composites melt. It is believed that enhanced particle-matrix interfacial interaction and stress transfer caused by E-MA-GMA endowed this highly filled composite improved toughness.

The XRD analysis indicated that LCB modification favored the generation of the γ-form, and the γ-form content of LCB-PA6 increased with increasing degree of LCB, which could provide a reasonable explanation for the high Izod impact strength of ultra-high LCB-PA6. Another reason for the great enhancement of impact toughness was the strong interfacial interaction between LCB molecules and virgin PA6 matrix.

With the increase of pulse frequency, the grain size increases, the reduction of cross section decreases firstly and then increases. The increase of temperature due to applying of electropulse is considered as the main reason for the retardation of mechanical property and the change of fracture mode. Copper sulfide is found on the fracture surface , which may be the root cause for the electricity-induced embrittlement . Recrystallization induced by the presence of electricity inhibits the embrittlement and improves the plasticity of material.

Because regression methods that construct a single model for each Y variable cannot consider the relationships between the Y variables, the search for candidates for materials that satisfy all of the target Y values cannot be efficiently performed. Furthermore, pseudo-inverse analysis of models, where promising candidates are selected based on the Y values predicted by substituting a large number of candidates for explanatory variables X, such as experimental conditions and molecular descriptors, into models, cannot search for candidates with desired Y values from X candidates. Therefore, in this study, we focused on Gaussian mixture regression (GMR), which can simultaneously handle multiple Y variables. GMR can simultaneously predict multiple Y variables while considering the relationships between the Y variables, and it can also directly predict X variables by substituting the values of multiple Y variables. We used numerical simulation data in which the Y variables were nonlinearly correlated and nonlinear relationships existed between X and Y, and verified the predictive ability of the GMR model and the advantages of direct inverse analysis of the GMR model. In addition, we analyzed a dataset of thermoelectric conversion materials and searched for new high-performance thermoelectric conversion materials.},

  abstract     = {To improve the protective performance of structures in terms of explosive shock waves and fragment penetration, a foamed aluminum/UHMWPE fiber sandwich composite structure was designed. A “explosion+fragmentation” penetration experiment was used to study the failure mode of the structure and the failure mechanisms of materials, the effects of the core material combination and explosion distance were discussed, meanwhile, numerical simulation using LS-DYNA was adopted to simulate the timing and distribution law of the shock wave and fragments. The results show that the explosion distance is the main influencing factor for the timing, and the experimental and numerical results have a good consistency. When the structure was perforated completely by fragments, the front aluminum plate was damaged mainly by shear plugging, and the rear aluminum plate was broken largely by cracking and tearing. When the fragments arrived prior to the shock wave, the tearing damage to the rear aluminum plate was more obvious. The foamed aluminum absorbed the explosive energy through its own crushing deformation, and the fiber layer absorbed the kinetic energy of the fragments through its own tensile failure. Of the composite structures prepared herein, the composite structure consisting of foamed aluminum/foamed aluminum/UHMWPE fiber had the best protection performance.},

The current work investigated the microstructure evolution in the austenite zone in a low density steel Fe-10Mn-5.5Al-0.25C at the heat treatment temperature range of 850 °C–1000 °C. The microstructure features have been characterized by SEM, TEM. The results indicate that the soaking temperature has great influence on the room-temperature mechanical properties, even promotes austenite-to-martensite transformation at 1000 °C heat treatment. The increased temperature and austenite zone fraction degrade the stability of austenite, whilst the small B2 phase shows no detrimental effect on mechanical properties. The product of tensile strength and elongation increases from 28 to 50 GPa\% is due to multiple deformation mechanisms with austenite zone fraction increased. And the transformed martensite at 1000 °C significantly decreases the mechanical properties. So, the improved mechanical properties maybe attributed to the coordination function of dislocations pile-up and cut through the B2 phase, and strengthened TWIP effect as heat treatment temperature below 1000 °C.},

  abstract     = {Angiogenesis and osteogenesis have been considered as inseparable and critical processes for bone formation and fracture healing. One promising strategy to improve the capability of angiogenesis and osteogenesis on a titanium (Ti) surface involves the fabrication of stable multifunctional release interfaces. This study developed a combined sequential bio-interfacial release system with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) using a polydopamine (PDA) coating on the Ti surface to enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Their surfaces were characterized and their biological properties were evaluated to provide sufficient supporting evidence for successfully fabricating the combined release system. The novel bio-interface demonstrated a significant improvement in surface hydrophilicity; highly effective growth factor adsorption; and moderate, sustained release on the surface of modified Ti substrates. Furthermore, this system surpassingly promoted the initial proliferation, migration and late angiogenic and osteogenic differentiation of HUVECs and MC3T3-E1 in vitro while also augmenting the osseointegration between the implant surface and the surrounding host tissues in vivo . All these results suggest that the fabrication of this novel bio-interface is a practical modification strategy for Ti implants to stimulate angiogenesis and osteogenesis and further optimize its clinical performance.},

In the semi-solid state, metallic materials may show rheological features comparable to those of polymers. Thus, they can be processed accordingly. The use of biodegradable Mg-based materials is an interesting approach to avoid removal surgeries and release of toxic corrosion products and wear debris. Therefore, in this study, the FFF technique was applied using a biodegradable Mg-Zn alloy in the semi-solid state. Some preliminary compositions were investigated through thermodynamic simulations to verify their compatibility with the process. Among them, Mg-38Zn was selected to be experimentally evaluated. Metallic filaments were produced via hot extrusion , which also aided in obtaining a globular microstructure in the semi-solid state. FFF was performed at 420 °C without any obstruction at the nozzle channel, which allowed the production of sound parts with acceptable welding between the deposited layers. This indicated that this technique (termed as “3D thixo-printing”) provides a promising additive manufacturing route to produce biodegradable Mg-based implants .},

In situ and real time microscopy is used to understand the discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental macroscopic properties of materials via the microscopic mechanisms. The feasibility of this method on the inorganic lithium salts is demonstrated despite their air/moisture-sensitivity and the common belief pretending that LiOH cannot be used for the synthesis of new materials inside the microscope chamber due to its decomposition in dry environment or under vacuum. The deviation source of ~30\% from the theoretical energy density of 434 kWh/m 3 has been investigated through the case study of Li 4 Br(OH) 3, an uncommon promising phase change material . The hydration/dehydration of the starting materials appears as one of the main parameters, with applied temperature protocols, eliciting the deviation towards different materials from the targeted one of interest, in terms of morphology and properties. This criterion, if not taken into account, could be disastrous for the storage capacity of a unit during its use. This study highlights solutions to avoid these deficiencies.

  abstract     = {Narrow gap multi-layer hybrid welding technology is an efficient way to join thick plates of metal or alloys. However, the coarse microstructure and solute segregation were caused by rapid cooling. In this paper, a magnetic field was utilized to achieve better microstructural control during welding. Using analytical electron microscopy combining with EDS and EBSD, microstructure evolution including grain growth and solute segregation during electromagnetic stirring (EMS) was systematically studied. EMS promoted the refinement and suppressed the overgrowth of austenite (γ) grains. Besides, γ exhibited equiaxed grains as seen from both grain size and texture evolution. For ferrite (δ) dendrites, EMS promoted the morphological transition from the coarse and long vermicular morphology to the fine lathy forms. EMS also induced deviation and discontinuity in δ dendrite growth. From chemical compositions point-of-view, a homogeneous distribution was obtained at both macro- and micro-scales by EMS. These results were attributed to δ “dendrite fragmentation” behavior brought by electromagnetic force at solid/liquid interface. Such δ fragments grew and acted as a substrate for epitaxial γ grains nucleation, with specific γ/δ orientation relationships, suppressing continuous epitaxial growth of γ grains via increased nucleation. Moreover, δ fragments result in reduced fraction of δ phase and dispersed distribution.},

Based on the kinetic equations determined, the distribution of the γ phase fraction in a multi-pass weld of lean DSS was calculated by applying the incremental method combined with a heat conduction analysis of the welding process . The γ phase fraction was reduced in the higher temperature HAZ; however, that in the reheated HAZ was increased and recovered to the base metal level. Microstructural analysis revealed that the calculated results of the γ phase fraction in the multi-pass weld were consistent with experimental ones.

Results showed that nude mice treated with the HA-NB/DDM hydrogel loaded with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) accelerated wound healing compared with those treated with the hydrogel or ASCs alone and untreated control animals. Neo-epidermal formation and angiogenesis was better in wounds treated with ASC-loaded hydrogels. Further, epidermal–dermal junctions with healthy epidermal protrusions and dermal projections were observed in wounds treated with the ASC-loaded HA-NB/DDM hydrogels. Collagen deposits resembling the natural collagen structure and arrangement were observed in wounds treated with the ASC-loaded HA-NB/DDM hydrogel. Further, ASC-loaded HA-NB/DDM hydrogels can achieve satisfactory therapeutic effects in wounds with irregular defects.

Then, an approach to characterization the location and size of the corrosion cracks is proposed. Finally, the boundary of the corrosion cracks is imaged by an improved canny algorithm.

The elastic modulus obtained with a monotonic tensile procedure is compared to values obtained from multiple loading–unloading cycles in the elastic regime . The latter were found to lead to more reproducible and reasonable values with significantly smaller standard deviations. To enable interpretation of the modulus values electron backscatter diffraction and X-ray diffraction were used to emphasize the effects of texture and microstructure.

  abstract     = {Hybrid nanocomposites of bacterial cellulose (BC) and magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) are of interest due to their potential for novel applications. Magnetic NPs are typically synthesized by co-precipitation since it is facile, enabling control of their size and distribution. This work investigates the effect of using different starting reactants (Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts) in the fabrication and control of the properties of BC/iron oxide nanocomposites. It was found that the choices of starting reactants are not important for synthesizing NPs outside of the BC networks. However, the starting reactants do affect the formation of NPs when they are synthesized in the BC network. Significant differences in the morphologies, sizes, crystal structures, and magnetic phases of NPs occurs when in this environment. The nanopores of BC networks in some instances force the aggregation of the NPs, either within the pores, or on the surfaces of the fibrils. Nanocomposites synthesized from Fe(II) sulfate and Fe(III) chloride were found to exhibit the highest magnetization. These nanocomposites have potential for flexible sensors, actuators, or electromagnetic shielding. Nanocomposites from Fe(II) acetate and Fe(III) chloride, though exhibiting lower magnetization, preserve a porous structure . Thus, they have potential as adsorbents or for wound healing applications.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) offers high-freedom in the design and processing of components with complex internal structures. In this work, a new injection mold with the self-supporting large cooling channel and tailored porous structures was designed to improve cooling efficiency and save AM build costs. The optimized internal supports suppressed the collapse and warpage of large channels, which improves the manufacturability and breaks the geometric constraints of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The formable diameter of self-supporting channels is significantly increased (≥20 mm). In comparison to the 8 mm normal-sized channel, the self-supporting 13 mm channel reduces the cooling time of more than 20\%. Additionally, the porous diamond structure was designated in the assembly part of the mold to save the materials and build time. To tune the strength , a core-shell composite structure with solid shell surrounding inner porous structures is designed. The influence of the wall thickness on the mechanical property of the composite structure was explored, which guides the specific mold design . Finally, a mold with the above-mentioned novel design was successfully processed by LPBF, which substantiates the manufacturability of innovative design. This work also inspires other industrial applications of AM-processed components with improved performance and functionality.},

  abstract     = {Significant grain refinement of AZ91 alloys was achieved by ceramic nanoparticle(NP)-induced growth control. Advanced characterization techniques including 3D tomography and in-situ observation were carried out to examine the microstructure evolution . The results show that the NPs are distributed in matrix in three ways, i.e. along the grain boundaries, inside the α-Mg grains and within the interior of β phases . The intergranular NPs that are distributed along the grain boundaries can form a multilayer of NPs covering the surface of α-Mg, greatly restricting the grain growth. A numerical model is proposed to predict the grain size, in which the solute concentration gradient at dendrite tip and the impingement of grains are recognized as two pivotal factors in modelling. It is demonstrated from the model prediction that a reduced growing rate of α-Mg can be obtained upon NP addition due to the lowered solute concentration gradient at dendrite tip, which could increase the nucleation events, accelerate the grain impingement and thus induce significant grain refinement. Given the chemically and thermally stability of ceramic NPs, which can avoid the intrinsic drawbacks of conventional inoculation, e.g. element poisoning, NP-induced growth control (NIGC) may provide a new avenue for grain refinement in magnesium alloys .},

Due to the novelty of ribbed memory-steel reinforcement bars, limited research has been performed on their application in structural engineering, however. In this study, the bond behaviour of memory-steel bars in a near-surface-mounted configuration designed for prestressed strengthening of concrete structures was investigated. Memory-steel bars were installed on concrete blocks and activated by resistive heating before being subjected to pull-out load. The effects of heating and hence prestressing, bar ductility, bond length and rigidity of the fixation were studied based on obtained prestress , crack development, slip and bar strain. During activation of the bars, a longitudinal splitting crack with insignificant crack width occured. Two failure modes were observed during subsequent external loading, including tensile rupture of the bar when less ductile material was used, or bond failure when material with higher ductility was under investigation. Initial prestressing did not result in a reduced bond capacity. Based on the differential equation of bond behaviour, an analytical calculation procedure was developed that enables prediction of bond shear stress, slip, bar strain, pull-out load, as well as the use of a non-linear material behaviour .},

In this paper, the nano-graphite flakes were adhered to the melamine sponge by polydimethylsiloxane , and then the sponge was silanized with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane to prepare a superhydrophobic conductive sponge. The prepared sponge has excellent adsorption capacity for oil and organic solvent . It can not only absorb 24–40 g of organic solvent per gram of sponge, but also absorb oil in the oil-in-water emulsion. After the emulsion separation, the COD value of the emulsion can be reduced to 260 mg/L. Even after hundreds of adsorption-extrusion cycles, it can still maintain more than 92\% of the adsorption capacity for organic solvents. In addition, its electrical conductivity makes it having potential application for pressure sensors . After adsorbing different organic solvents, the composite exhibits particular current changes and can be used as a sensor for organic solvents to detect the presence of different types of organic solvents.},

While metamaterials are typically assembled from carefully designed mesoscale units, the intended bulk-scale functionality can be obscured by unintended emergent effects driven by non-additive unit-unit interactions. These interactions are often sensitive to the number of units and their overall arrangement, making them extrinsic to the unit-scale design. As such, the emergence of extrinsic effects adds a significant hurdle for the development of general-purpose metamaterial technologies. Here, we reconceptualize bulk-scale extrinsic properties as a design opportunity and develop an approach that repurposes them in a new class of exponentially reconfigurable origami-inspired mechanical metamaterials. We illustrate the use of extrinsic properties to design a single general-purpose structure that can be transformed into a variety of passive mechanical devices including a waveguide , a wave lens, and a wave cloak. Bench-top experiments validate the core concepts of our approach and show how unintentional extrinsic effects become useful for applications of reconfigurable metamaterials.},

  abstract     = {Although numerous reports have elucidated the neurotoxic impacts of Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) due to the presence of vanadium, it is the most widely used biomedical Ti material. This is because it exhibits significantly better mechanical performance characteristics than those of pure Ti. In addition to the possibility of facilitating the production of customized medicines, selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing (AM) can enable pure Ti to match the properties of Ti64 by utilizing several mechanisms such as grain refinement and solid solution strengthening. These results can be obtained due to the high cooling rate of the AM process and via a possible modification in the alloy chemistry of Ti. Herein, we report a novel approach that endows the pure Ti prepared via AM with excellent mechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, and microhardness of 1057.05 MPa, 784.59 MPa, 24.09\%, and 307 Hv, respectively), corrosion resistance , and biocompatibility, while significantly reducing the cost of the powder.

In this study, the mechanism of the β to α transformation in MnTe films capped with a tungsten layer during isothermal annealing at 500 °C was investigated. X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the out-of-plane c-axis orientation was maintained during the polymorphic transformation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that the β-phase transformed to the α-phase via a β′-phase which has a wurtzite-type structure as the β-phase but with a slight difference in the coordinates of the Te atoms. The β → β′ transformation was induced by the puckering process during which Mn- and Te-atomic planes shift in opposite directions along the c-axis, whereas the β′ → α transformation was induced by a buckling process during which pairs of Mn- and Te-atomic planes alternately move to the opposite directions along the 210 210 direction. Meanwhile, in the MnTe film without the tungsten capping layer, the out-of-plane c-axis orientation was not retained during the polymorphic transformation. These results imply that the sequential two-stage polymorphic transformation maintaining the out-of-plane c-axis orientation is caused by the constraint on the MnTe film induced by the tungsten capping layer.},

The optimal material selection to meet given practical engineering demands usually requires that a compromise is struck between conflicting criteria. This paper studies the mechanical properties of a polyamide-based composite combined with short and continuous carbon fibers and establishes a systematic hierarchical structure of multiple criteria for materials selection with the consideration of environmental, economic, social and physical impacts. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach that contained the fuzzy best-worst method and fuzzy G-VIKOR method is presented to solve the composite materials selection problem . A front-end thin-walled underframe structure of high-speed train, as an empirical application, is adopted to verify the application of this solution methodology and 6 L-2 is selected as the optimal alternative under this engineering background.

In this study, the formation of sliver defects was investigated with respect to the defect morphological features, the microstructure of defect initiation points, and the solidification conditions. Experiment results showed that sliver defects were originated from fragmentation of dendrite trunks and could developed to various morphologies. The misorientation range of sliver grains was between 3.2° to 12°. Microstructural analysis results indicated that the dendrites fragmented abruptly without significant plastic deformation . And the dendrite fragmentation could be facilitated by oxide inclusions and solidification pores. It was also found that the sliver defects were prone to occur at the interface where primary dendrite converge to the mold inner wall. Based on the low misorientation level of sliver grains in the experimental observation, the critical solid volume fraction range for fragmentation was suggested to be 0.6–0.8. The dendrite fragmentation was attributed to the non-uniform stress distribution in dendrite during solidification. In addition, the effect of airfoil geometry of a typical blade casting and defect prevention methodology were discussed.},

The pvT model is based on the data measured under standard conditions and might not reflect the specific volume at process level. In order to know the exact variation of the specific volume, a pvT testing device was used to simulate the injection molding process. Four parameters (starting temperature, holding pressure, holding-end temperature and cooling rate) corresponding to injection temperature, holding pressure, holding time and cooling time were considered. The semi-crystalline polypropylene (PP) and the amorphous acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) were employed. The design of experiments (DoE) method was applied to analyze the influences of these parameters on the changes of the specific volume during the simulated injection molding cycles. The results demonstrated that the specific volume especially at the phase transition and shrinkage stages is significantly influenced by the complicated injection molding process. The starting temperature has a great effect on the specific volume but has little effect on the shrinkage. The specific volume decreases non-linearly with decreasing cooling rate during the shrinkage stage.},

  abstract     = {Synthesis of graphene at high temperature offers an alternative route for large-scale production on a short time scale. Through the solid-state exothermic reaction of the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-Al energetic material, single and few-layer graphene having a lateral size in tens of nanometers are produced with an ultralow power consumption due to the self-sustained characteristics of the reaction. The graphene can directly disperse in ethanol to form stable dispersion and by evaluating in half-cell configuration, the graphene exhibits a stable cycling performance over 1000 cycles. The positive correlation between the dimension of the PTFE precursor and graphene demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing powdered graphene in a controllable manner.},

Addition of modified NRs as the compatibilizers evidently enhanced the mechanical properties of the resulting TPNR. The highest mechanical and thermal properties as well as the homogeneous dispersion of the TPNR can be achieved on using ENR as a compatibilizer. The overall migration limit (OML) of TPNR samples in aqueous food simulants was lower than the upper limit (10 mg/dm 2 ) according to EU regulation No.10/2011. The developed TPNR exhibited better performance compared with the general-purpose polymers in terms of flexibility, recyclability , food contact ability, oil resistance and biodegradability.},

A similar gradient distribution of grain sizes is obtained through both simulation and experimental results, which validates the predictive model and presents an in-depth understanding of microstructure evolution process during surface formation, and it shows the primary factors influencing the grain size distribution in sub-surface are cDRX-induced grain refinement and dDRX-induced grain growth. Moreover, the gradient distribution of microstructures in refined sub-surfaces could be used to explain mechanisms of sub-surface damage in the future.},

However, their fabrication is limited to conventional manufacturing techniques. In this work, a MoSiBTiC multiphase alloy, mainly consisting of Mo solid solution (Mo ss ), Mo 5 SiB 2 (T 2 ), and TiC phases, was fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) using ball-milled alloy powders; subsequently, the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on its microstructure and fracture toughness was investigated. Due to the non-equilibrium metallurgical characteristics of L-PBF, the as-built alloy included uniform and fine-grained structures, as well as internal microcracks . The length of microcracks was effectively reduced with the assistance of the TiC bridging effect during HIP. As revealed by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, the TiC was uniformly dispersed and was in close contact with the Mo ss or T 2 phase. Consequently, the MoSiBTiC multiphase alloy exhibited a high fracture toughness of 9.0 MPa(m) 1/2 after HIP at 1973 K. This work could be an important step towards the fabrication of high-performance refractory components with advanced properties in ultrahigh–temperature use.},

Photoluminescent liquid-core polymer optical fibers (LiCo-POFs), produced by a co-extrusion of a low refractive index semi-crystalline fluoropolymer sheath with a glycerol core, are presented. Substituting a POF&#39;s solid polymer core with a transparent liquid yields luminescent waveguides with extra mechanical flexibility, enabling unique applications like strain sensing. Light conversion and guidance in LiCo-POFs were both achieved simultaneously by doping of the glycerol core with a fluorescent dye. X-ray analysis showed a strong impact of drawing on fiber sheath morphology, and in consequence on both mechanical and optical properties: as the molecular orientation of the sheath increases, tensile strength improves and light attenuation decreases. Excessive drawing leads to micro-voids in the sheath material, causing light scattering, which negatively affects both attenuation and light-conversion. It has been found that both the sheath structure and the sheath and core cross-sectional areas are important design parameters regarding the mechanical and optical performance of LiCo-POFs. A novel principle of an optical strain sensor based on self-absorption peak-shifts is demonstrated; it allows detection of sub-millimeter displacements, both in a reversible elastic as well as in an irreversible inelastic sensor range.},

A winding path on the cylindrical and ellipsoidal (dome) part of a pressure vessel is considered with varying tooling curvature. First, the process model output is verified with the literature data based on the laser intensity distribution. Then, the transient laser irradiation and temperature distributions on the tape and substrate are described comprehensively. It is shown that the maximum laser intensity increases approximately by 80\% and the process (bonding) temperature changes by 80 °C at the intersection of the cylindrical and dome section of the pressure vessel. In order to keep the transient process temperature constant , a robust optimization scheme is utilized by means of a genetic algorithm . The design variable is determined as the total laser power and temperature constraints are defined. The proposed optimization methodology regulates the temperature within 1.5 °C variation with respect to the desired value. In order to compensate the transient local curvature effects on the process temperature, the total laser power varies approximately between 30\% and 175\% of the reference (non-optimized) case.},

In this study, we classify different groups of lattices based on their topology and propose a strategy to enhance their energy absorption-to-weight ratio under compression. We particularly elucidate the effect of variation of relative density across the lattice structures 3D printed by stereolithography . The experimental compression test results and numerical data obtained by finite element analysis show that a uniform desi g n with even distribution of relative density yields the highest initial stiffness among all 3D printed architected lattices. However, the graded design with a rational variation of relative density can significantly enhance the stiffness and energy absorption capability of lattices experiencing high compressive strains . Specific gradients, where the relative density varies normal to the direction of external compressive force , can increase the stiffness and the energy absorption capabilities of cellular solids up to 60 and 110\%, respectively. These results promise the possibility of designing single-phase lattice architectures that can combine lightweighting and energy absorption properties by a rational variation of porosity within the cellular architecture.},

The calculated damage index showed good correlation with the microcracks&#39; total area and indicated that RH equal or lower than 55\% could cause relatively high cracking risk.

Furthermore, the developed UHPC/CNT composites subjected to compressive or flexural stress showed significant crack sensing capability due to the obtained low electrical resistivity. A dramatic fractional change in the resistivity (FCR) of the UHPC/CNT composites can represent the failure under compression or first cracking under flexure .

  abstract     = {Resonating piezoelectric devices, such as aluminum nitride (AlN) piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs), display superior performance to previous generations of resonating microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). However, the quality of the piezoelectric thin film can greatly impact operating characteristics, such as the resonant frequency. Several AlN PMUT devices fabricated on the same silicon wafer exhibited a range of resonance frequencies (400-600 kHz), indicating that there is nonuniformity across the processed wafer. AlN film nonuniformity is likely introduced during the reactive sputtering process. Two key parameters identified as influencing the resonance frequency include: (i) the membrane diameter and (ii) residual stress. This work focuses on the residual stress, and uses X-ray diffraction technique (XRD) to determine the in-plane biaxial residual stress values, as a function of die position on the wafer. Results show that there is a compressive stress gradient along the wafer, ranging from -357 MPa to -56 MPa. A plot of in-plane biaxial residual stress as a function of resonance frequency shows a relation between the measured stress and frequency. As resonating piezoelectric devices require well defined operating frequencies and bandwidths, this work demonstrates the importance of studying not only global stresses, but also local residual stresses.},

Plate formability was described using the Lankford parameter and evaluated based on the crystallographic texture . It was concluded that the mean anisotropy was almost identical to that of the initial material, but planar anisotropy was reduced almost to 0.

Next to experiments, a new kinetic model is reported which combines both athermal and isothermal transformation mechanisms to cope with the diversity in conditions in a unified framework. The experimental results show that reverse transformation can proceed extremely fast, yet saturates at intermediate temperatures. Additionally, it is shown that there is good agreement between experiment and model and it is essential to embed both the athermal and isothermal transformation mechanism in the model for achieving this performance.

Here, we conduct a systematic structural analysis of the nanoscale secondary phase particles, including W phase, a small amount of I phase and a handful of Mg 3 Gd phase, in hot deformed dilute alloying Mg-Zn-Gd alloy by combining atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy with first-principles calculations. The investigation of atomic structure of nanoscale W phase reveals that the stoichiometric composition of W phase is determined by the quantity of Mg atoms which are replaced by Zn at certain positions. Furthermore, nanoscale W phase, I phase and Mg 3 Gd phase particles could exhibit certain orientation relationships and coherent or semi-coherent interface with Mg matrix, which contributes to atomic bonding at their interfaces. We also identify a phase transition from Mg 3 Gd phase to W phase, which is further supported by first-principles calculations showing that Mg 3 Zn 3 Gd 2 phase is energetically more favorable than Mg 3 Gd phase. The phase transition between W phase and I phase could also take place during hot deformation and is reversible by absorbing or releasing Zn atoms at the interfacial region .},

  abstract     = {Material Extrusion (ME), which is a type of Additive Manufacturing (AM), has become widely popular in the manufacturing world. However, the evolution of a material&#39;s temperature in this relatively new manufacturing method, which plays an important role in the polymer crystallinity , is not yet well researched. Next to voids, interlayer adhesion and surface roughness , the degree of crystallinity strongly determines the quality of printed products. Hence, a thorough and deep understanding of crystallinity in ME is essential for the improvement of the parts printed. In this paper, a primary generic model is proposed to predict the temperature evolution and crystal growth of printed polymer materials. The temperature evolution was developed based on the two-dimensional domain discretisation method and the crystal growth was simulated via the Hoffman-Lauritzen theory. In the simulation, key parameters have been taken into consideration, such as the printing speed, thermal convection coefficient , thermal contact conductance with the platform, nozzle diameter and latent heat in crystallisation. Then, a single-line printing scenario was tested to verify the accuracy of the model. A comparison of the model predictions with the experimental results showed only of up to 3.8 °C deviations which is a 2\% of maximum percentage mismatch from the full scale reading.},

According to the Federal Railroad Administration the axle and bearing failure costs around 89 million dollars and causes 46 derailments in the US per year (2005–2010). In this study, the authors have suggested a novel protective mechanism (Metallic Foam Shell – MFS) by using a lightweight sandwich panel. At the first step, a preliminary study is conducted, followed up by the numerical simulations to determine the applicable materials. At the next step, experimental tests were performed to assess the efficiency of the suggested device against flying ballast impacts. An extended non-destructive (NDT) evaluation has been performed in order to find the most suitable technique for damage detection of the proposed device when on-service. The studied cases were GFRP and Aluminium sandwich panels, having an aluminium foam core with different densities and thicknesses. The results showed that the MFS can absorb up to 90\% of the initial impact energy and significantly decrease the chance of rebounding impact to the other components. Moreover, the results were also analysed in order to propose the most reliable NDT method for this specific application.},

The interface microstructure, mechanical properties and strengthening mechanisms were systematically studied with various MLG contents. Experimental results exhibited that MLG can be relative uniformly dispersed onto the surface of TC4 powders by the 3D dynamic mixing method, SPS parameter of 700 °C-500 MPa caused weak interface bonding between MLG and Ti matrix, and 900 °C-250 MPa was determined as the optimal sintering condition . Appropriate ratio of in-situ generated TiC phase with approximately 30 vol\% retained MLG at the interface was beneficial to the interface bonding. The compressive strength of the composites was remarkably enhanced with excellent compressive ductility. Superior mechanical properties with the highest strengthening efficiency (65.5\%) and tensile strength , acceptable tensile ductility (9.0\%) and higher Vickers microhardness were achieved in the 0.15 wt\% MLG composites due to its better interface microstructure. The network interface strengthening mechanism by the TiC phase and residue MLG is proposed to be the dominant mechanism with a few contributions from C solid solution and fine-grain strengthening.},

  abstract     = {Ferromagnetic shape-memory CoNiGa alloys have attracted much scientific interest due to their potential alternative use as high-temperature shape-memory alloys, bearing a high prospect for actuation and damping applications at elevated temperatures. Yet, polycrystalline CoNiGa, due to strong orientation dependence of transformation strains, suffers from intergranular fracture . Here, two multi-grain CoNiGa samples were prepared by a novel hot extrusion process that can promote favourable grain-boundary orientation distribution and improve the material&#39;s mechanical behaviour . The samples were investigated by multiple methods and their microstructural, magnetic, and mechanical properties are reported. It is found that a post-extrusion solutionising heat treatment leads to the formation of a two-phase oligocrystalline homogeneous microstructure consisting of an austenitic parent B2 phase and γ -CoNiGa precipitates. Reconstruction of the full 3D grain morphology revealed large, nearly spherical grains with no low-angle grain boundaries throughout the entire sample volume. The presence of γ precipitation affects the transformation behaviour of the samples, by lowering the martensitic transformation temperature, while, in conjunction with the oligocrystalline microstructure, it improves the ductility. Controlling the composition of the B2 matrix, as well as the phase fraction of the γ phase, is thus crucial for the optimal behaviour of the alloys.},

A finite volume based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model coupled with solidification physics has been developed to predict melting, flow, solidification, and resulting microstructural characteristics during such processes. The variation of texture, grain size and columnar/equiaxed morphology of the grains with laser power and speed has been verified against experiments. The difference in cooling curves and evolution of temperature gradients and cooling rates during solidification leading to a difference in each microstructural variant has been identified. Lower laser power and higher scan rates lead to “unconstrained” solidification with small variation of solidification times across the melt pool depth leading to finer grain structure with lower grain boundary (GB) misorientations. On the other hand, higher power and lower scan rates lead to “constrained” solidification, with huge variations in solidification times, coarser grains and highly misoriented grain boundaries. The desirable microstructure has been found to be predominantly fine grained based on mechanical strength measured using nanoindentation tests . Hunt&#39;s criterion-based processing maps for understanding the morphological variants has been prepared for systematic design of microstructure during the process.},

The effect of PU coating&#39;s age on the development of strong interfacial interactions and hence the level of adhesion achieved between the photopolymer and the topcoat was explored. With aging, the PU coatings were shown to increase in cross-link density which resulted in reduced levels of adhesion with the photopolymer observed. This was reflected in changes in surface energy hence surface chemistry via XPS analysis. Changes in the interfacial interactions were qualitatively examined through SEM analysis of the photopolymer – PU coating interface which showed localized debonding (de-wetting) of the photopolymer when printing was performed on aged PU topcoats.},

A strategy that the heat source is allowed adaptively following the free surface of a molten pool along with power leakage-free is developed for the moving laser. The fundamental characteristics of the molten pool and solidified tracks are found and analyzed. The remolten region between two neighboring tracks in the horizontal and vertical directions is predicted, and the effects of the scanning spacing and laser power on the width and depth of the remolten region are investigated. The results indicate that both the dimensions of the molten pool and remolten region depend on the process parameters anisotropically, varying the laser energy input could change the dynamic regime of a molten pool, and the pore defect can appear between adjacent tracks when using a large scanning spacing.},

Aluminium alloys were the base material. The main intention of the article is to present the results confirming the possibility of using aluminium-based foams in the liquefied natural gas tanks. For this reason, the main goal of the research was to evaluate the energy absorption and structural stability at sub-zero as well as extremely high temperatures. The low temperature of liquefied methane (−163 °C) was particularly important because low temperatures can reduce the strength of aluminium foams, which decreases their durability and influence the overall structural safety. The combustibility of aluminium foams and composite foams was also tested. The composite foam named 445, manufactured by the authors, underwent a combustibility test and retained its original dimensions, while other foams were partially melted. The advantageous durability at extremely low (−175 °C) and high (750 °C) temperatures suggest that such materials can significantly increase the safety and durability of liquefied natural gas tanks against fire, quasi-static and impact loading .},

The process dependence of pvT behavior of polymers was discussed in theory, and the influences of starting temperature and cooling/heating rates were considered in the modeling. The pvT behavior of a semi-crystalline polymer, polypropylene (PP), was measured. Mathematical model parameters were determined through the fitting of the experimental pvT data. The fitted results were in good agreement with the experimental data, which showed that the proposed model is accurate and effective. The R 2 value of 99.82\% and the average absolute percent deviation of 0.21\% were obtained.

Herein we presents an electrochemical approach for creating a large-area honeycomb-like porous structure in Zr-based metallic glasses .

Differential scanning calorimetry and the compression cycle were utilized to determine the phase transformation temperature and shape memory effect of the alloy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to investigate the microstructure and clarify the corresponding deformation mechanism . We found that the Zr 50 Cu 25 Ni 7.5 Co 17.5 alloy exhibited excellent thermal stability and achieved the best maximum recovery strain of 6.87\% (8\% pre-strain) observed to date, making it a promising high temperature shape memory alloy. The TEM results indicated that, during the primary stage of the compression cycle, a small number of the (001) compound twins were de-twinning and numerous contraction twins formed. As the stress increased, increasing numbers of nanoscale (021) and (111) type-I deformation twins formed, and the shift displacement of the type-B planar defect expanded from 3d ~ (001) to 8d ~ (001). Furthermore, the newly found (111) type-I deformation twin and the extension of the type-B planar defect that contributes to the large recovery strain in the Zr 50 Cu 25 Ni 7.5 Co 17.5 alloy were observed.},

  abstract     = {Micro-forming is one of the major micro-manufacturing methods with promising application potentials, in which the damage response and fracture behavior need to be insightfully addressed. Among all the damage criteria to predict fracture, GTN model is a widely-used one and able to predict void-dominated fracture in micro-scale deformation. However, it is not very applicable under low stress triaxiality and shear-dominated condition. An in-depth understanding of shear damage and its potential size effect are crucial to explore the micro-scaled damage and fracture mechanisms . This research characterizes the size effect on flow stress via employing a combined constitutive model, and an approach for applying a phenomenological shear damage evolution law to the GTN-Thomason model via considering the size effect is developed. The prediction of micro-scaled fracture in a wide stress triaxiality range is thus enabled. Through simulation and experiment, the proposed model is validated and verified. In addition, stress state parameters including stress triaxiality, Lode parameter, and weight function, are also discussed, and the two damage parameters are analyzed quantificationally to reveal different fracture mechanisms occurring in different stress states and grain sizes. The research thus facilitates the physical insight and in-depth understanding of the size effect on damage evolution and fracture formation in micro-scaled plastic deformation of materials.},

The flexible aerobeads (diameter of 2–3 mm) with hierarchical porous structure demonstrated an outstanding adsorption capacity toward both diclofenac (121.20 mg/g) and methyl orange (49.21 mg/g).

In this study, carbon nanocages (CNCs) were firstly considered as a synergistic factor for BMP2. CNC could improve the osteogenesis of BMP2 (0.8 μg/mL) at a concentration of 20–80 μg/mL in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, a composite hierarchical porous scaffold composed of silk fibroin (SF) and CNC (SF/CNC) was developed for the controlled delivery of BMP2, which provided delivery of BMP2 with an initial burst release of 23.9\% and a gradual release over the subsequent 6 days to about 47.7\%. According to the ALP staining and quantification, CNC and SF/CNC scaffold (without BMP2) were evidenced to promote osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) dose-dependently. After loading BMP2, BMP2/SF/CNC scaffold could significantly increase the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in vitro and promote new bone formation in vivo. BMP2/SF/CNC scaffold developed in this study could efficiently prolong the local retention of BMP2 and its synergic interaction duration with CNC, which provides a new strategy for bone tissue engineering .},

The feasibility of the FE-based simulations is confirmed through experimental indentation for various steels. Parametric studies of the FE simulation are performed to generate an ANN training database. An encoding for feature extraction and a hyperparameter optimization is implemented to design the ANN with high predictive performance. The indentation load–depth curves are converted into hardening parameters through the trained ANN. The predictive performance of the FE–ANN model using real-life indentation data is investigated in-depth with thorough error evaluation, and verified by uniaxial tensile tests . The emphasis is made that the mean absolute percentage error between the experimental and simulated indentation data is required to be meticulously controlled below 1\% to accurately predict the tensile properties . The validations demonstrate that the applied FE–ANN modeling approach is very robust and captures the tensile properties well. Furthermore, the Taguchi orthogonal array (OA) method that can achieve high efficiency and fidelity with less training data is discussed. The FE–ANN model is concisely designed using the Taguchi OA method and can predict elasticity as well as plasticity.},

Rather than using a fiber element , the new model enables a full-field failure simulation due to its finite number of elements. Based on the micromechanical difference equation, we validated the effectiveness of the model and identified the damage evolution pattern by applying it to a basic model of 6 mm FRP tendon. Then, the effect of varied constituent properties, hybrid fibers and initial defects were investigated using the Monte Carlo (MC) method. Several interesting results were found and compared with the findings of earlier studies. For instance, it was found that a more stable IFB strength and higher matrix shear strength reduced variations in composite strength. A moderate hybrid ratio and careful packing of high- and low-elongation fibers helped to achieve optimum composite properties. In the thin-ply composite, transverse initial defects were more detrimental to composite strength than longitudinal defects. These findings prove the value of the bundle-based model, which can be used in future studies as an effective tool for evaluating the strength of various composites.},

However, the small layer thickness presents a great challenge for a systematic and consistent characterisation of the spread powder layer. In this study, a novel digital-based characterisation approach is proposed based on space discretization , with an emphasis on the characteristics that is important to powder-bed-based additive manufacturing. With the developed approach, the spread powder layer can be qualitatively illustrated by contour maps and quantified by statistics of packing density, surface profile and pore characteristics. For the first time, two types of pores are proposed for the spread powder layer. The density pore can identify those less populated areas while the chamber pore is able to quantify the size of empty patches observed in the spread powder bed. Applicability of this approach is demonstrated via both simulation-generated and experimentally spread powder layers. Sensitivity tests on the sampling parameters are conducted. This digital-based characterisation method is general and can be applied to both polydisperse and non-spherical particle systems, not only enriching detailed structural analysis of the spread powder layer but also allowing us to quantitatively evaluate powder spreadability in additive manufacturing.},

Compared with conventional support membrane, TENMs possessed high surface porosity, low tortuosity, high-proportioned interconnect pore, and minimum average pore size below 200 nm. Therefore, it has great potential in the preparation of high-performance TFC nanofiltration( NF )membrane.

Results indicated that adding 0.025 mol TBAC in the spinning solution would facilitate the formation of tree-like structure with the smallest pore size of 130–140 nm and narrowest pore diameter distribution, as well as the densely packed branching nanofibers . Furthermore, the effect of TENMs structure and surface morphology on the formation of polyamide film were also studied. It was found that the ultrafine branches embedded into polyamide matrix formed “directed water channels”, which increased water molecules transporting speed. Rejection test revealed that a rejection rate above 97\% against MgSO 4 solution and 76\% against NaCl solution could be achieved, indicating the potential in the application of water purification.},

Samples are fabricated using the laser powder bed fusion technique, selective laser sintering , and characterized using micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A finite-deformation hyperelastic-viscoplastic-damage constitutive model is calibrated and employed to capture the full compressive behavior of lattices. The computational results are compared to and validated against corresponding experimental results. Results show that sheet-based polymeric TPMS lattices exhibit a stretching-dominated mode of deformation and prove to have superior stiffness and strength as compared to TPMS ligament-based lattices. The numerical simulations are in good agreement with experimental results for ligament-based lattices while significant deviation from experimental results is observed for the sheet-based lattices which is attributed to uncertainty in measuring the actual relative density and relatively higher manufacturing defects.},

In this paper, we develop a deep learning (DL) model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts optimal metamaterial designs. The developed DL model non-iteratively optimizes metamaterials for either maximizing the bulk modulus , maximizing the shear modulus, or minimizing the Poisson&#39;s ratio (including negative values).

  abstract     = {It is known that Ni-based superalloys experience microstructural rafting during high temperature straining. This paper presents a comparative study of the different rafting models by means of finite element modeling and experimentation investigation. It was found that uniaxial elastic loading does not alter the misfit or misfit isotropy of the structure, but causes repartitioning of the misfit into elastic strains in the γ and γ&#39; phases. This causes an elastic strain energy anisotropy and hydrostatic stress anisotropy among the vertical and horizontal γ phase channels. Both anisotropies predict a raft structure that is contrary to the experimental observation. Through a carefully designed pre-treatment at 750 °C and under a uniaxial stress of 750 MPa, an anisotropic dislocation structure was created on the {001} γ&#39;/γ interfaces without altering the cuboidal morphology of the γ&#39; phase. This allows the evaluation of the influence of dislocations on the rafting behavior of the alloy. It was found that rafting occurred in the pre-treated samples containing anisotropic dislocation structures during thermal exposure without applied stress, instead of isotropic corsening, and that the raft structures conform to the expectations base don the anistropic dislocation strucutres. This demonstrates that an anisotropic dislocation structure on the {001} γ&#39;/γ interfaces is a direct cause of rafting. This is attributted to the fact that dislocations on γ&#39;/γ interfaces help to relax the local misfit strains, causing some to expand at the expense of others. At the same time, the formation of the anisotropic dislocation structure is a direct result of the anisotropy of elastic strains induced by the applied bia stess in during the pre-treatment. These explain the complex interplay of the elastic and plastic models reported the literature.},

Particularly, a novel method for fatigue life distribution assessment of notched specimens was proposed based on Weibull model and critical distance theory. Experimental data of Al 2024-T351 smooth plate specimens and center hole plate (CHP) specimens with four different notch radii were utilized for model validation and comparison. Results show that all predicted lives of Al 2024-T351 CHP specimens are within the ±2 life scatter bands of experimental ones.},

Results demonstrated that bacterial cellulose addition affected the characteristic properties of the blends. Morphological studies revealed the homogenous dispersion of the bacterial cellulose within the 12 wt\%PVA/0.25 wt\%hBN matrix. Tensile strength of the scaffolds was decreased with the incorporation of BC and 12 wt\%PVA/0.25 wt\%hBN/0.5 wt\%BC had the highest elongation at break value (93\%). A significant increase in human osteoblast cell viability on 3D scaffolds was observed for 12 wt\%PVA/0.25 wt\%hBN/0.5 wt\%BC. Cell morphology on composite scaffolds showed that bacterial cellulose doped scaffolds appeared to adhere to the cells.

  abstract     = {Fretting fatigue can significantly reduce the life of components, leading to unexpected in-service failures. This phenomenon has been studied for over a century, with significant progress being made during the past decade. There are various methods that have been used to study fretting fatigue cracks in order to gain a greater understanding of the effects of fretting fatigue. Destructive methods are traditionally used to observe fretting fatigue cracks. Although useful in determining crack location, crack length, crack propagation modes, crack path and shape, it is not efficient or reliable for time based measurements. Non-destructive testing has developed in recent years and now in-situ monitoring can be used during testing in order to increase the understanding of fretting fatigue. This paper presents a review of non-destructive testing techniques used in-situ during fretting fatigue testing, which are compared in order to conclude the suitability of each technique. Recent developments in non-destructive techniques that could be also applied for fretting fatigue tests are also discussed, as well as recommendations for future research made.},

Here, we report a supramolecular hydrogel made of graphene oxide and diacerein-terminated four-armed polyethylene glycol for SCI repair. The hydrogel is mechanically compliant and injectable, thus can be delivered to the SCI lesions in a minimally invasive way. As diacerein is an anti-inflammatory drug, the hydrogel loaded with free diacerein can minimize the inflammatory response and prevent the formation of inhibitory microenvironment . Moreover, the suitable conductivity of the hydrogel promotes the growth of neuron and the remyelination of axons. We validate the outstanding mechanical, biochemical and electric properties of the designed hydrogel in vitro and also demonstrate their successful applications in SCI repair in vivo using the rat model. We anticipate that with the advances of our understanding of the biology of SCI lesions and of the axonal growth mechanism, more sophisticated SCI repair hydrogels can be designed to fully achieve functional recovery of SCI.},

Their surface characteristics can be tailored for specific applications, including energy storage, sensors, and water filtration, by adjusting synthetic parameters. Furthermore, MXene possesses excellent biocompatibility and can be designed for anticancer, antibacterial, and immunomodulatory properties. However, a major limitation facing systemic delivery of nanoparticles is ensuring successful uptake from the bloodstream into the desired site of action. An important consideration is the vascular endothelial cell (EC), which serves as the barrier between blood and organs. Therefore, cellular uptake of engineered nanoparticles by EC is important to advance their use in nanomedicine . In this study, smart zero-dimensional biocompatible titanium carbide (Ti 3 C 2 T x ) MXene quantum dots (MQD) were synthesized with specific surface modifications for subcellular nanomedicine applications. MQD were shown to be spontaneously uptaken into human ECs within 24 h of cell culture. MQD localization was observed to be highly stable during this with no significant changes seen in cell morphology . Furthermore, uptaken MQD maintained their strong autofluorescence properties at different excitation-emission wavelengths to enable post-delivery monitoring and tracking. This novel finding represents promising progress in the application of MQD for nanomedicine.},

The compressive behavior and energy absorption of the fabricated foams were also evaluated and compared with samples prepared by powder metallurgy method (PM). The results showed that processing parameters such as the holding time, foaming temperature and their mutual interaction during the second foaming could affect the final cellular structure features, such as porosity content, average diameter, pore distribution uniformity and sphericity .

A design optimization method of heterogeneous conformal lattice structure coupling constraints and anisotropy of AM based on principal stress lines (PSL) is proposed. (1) The PSL is calculated based on finite element analysis to visualize the path of load transfer. (2) The load-adapted lattice structure is generated guided by the PSL. (3) In order to further optimize lattice structure, the lattice structure optimization model is established by coupling anisotropy and constraints of AM based on the fused deposition modeling (FDM) experiment. Taking a cantilever beam as a case, the maximum force-to-weight ratio and the stiffness-to-weight ratio of the optimized heterogeneous conformal lattice structure are increased by 11.8\% and 41.8\% respectively compared with homogeneous conformal lattice structure, which verified the feasibility of the proposed method.},

With this approach, the textile is presented as a continuous material using mutually constrained shell and membrane elements, this allows for both the high tensile stiffness and low out-of-plane bending stiffness to be present within the model. To include the through-thickness behaviour of the material, a compliant penalty contact is introduced which is able to capture the mechanical response of the material under compaction. By simulating the interaction between individual plies , the model is able to predict compaction induced wrinkle formation. The approach is used here to analyse the deformation behaviour of stacked layers compacted on to a male box tool to produce a C-section bracket. The model is validated against experimental results and used to assess the influence of key design and manufacturing parameters on defect formation.},

The TiO 2 nanotubes had excellent hydrophilicity and Sr incorporation can further enhance the hydrophilicity; however, the AgNPs loading could slightly increase water contact angle.

Experimental, simulation and theoretical investigation were carried out to demonstrate the design method and NHE deformation effects of the metamaterial. It was shown that the effective NHE coefficient depends on the length of the driving layer and the straight bar connecting the lattice microstructures. In addition, a non-monotonic relationship was found between the bandings angle θ 2 and the length ratio ( s / a ) due to the constraint effect on both ends of the composite beam. Through the parameter design of the lattice microstructure, the NHE coefficient of can be adjusted within the range of 0–22.4\%. For the 3D sample, the value of the NHE coefficient is among the largest achieved in experiments to date.

Composition, structure and electric and magnetic behavior have been analyzed by different techniques including EDX , XRR , XRD , SQUID magnetometry, electrical resistivity and XANES and XMCD spectroscopies. Despite the difficulty in growing CrO 2 by physical deposition techniques, an Ir 1–x Cr x O 2 solid solution phase could be achieved for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8, where the oxidation state of Cr is found to remain as 4+. Both the electrical and the magnetic behavior are shown to starkly depart from those of the parent IrO 2 (paramagnetic metal) and CrO 2 (half–metal ferromagnet) compounds. In particular, they show a semiconducting behavior, dρ/dT &lt; 0 and giant magnetic coercivity at low temperatures. XMCD reveals a significant contribution of Ir to the magnetic response of the Ir 1–x Cr x O 2 films. In addition, the nature of the magnetic moment of the Ir 4+ ion (〈 m l 〉 / 〈 m s 〉 = 0.09) is completely different from the large orbital moment that is a hallmark of insulating Ir 4+ oxides. This suggests a Cr–induced magnetic moment, which is a remarkably surprising result for an oxide.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the development, calibration and finite element implementation of a novel set of phenomenological equations describing the effect of temperature and moisture on the stiffness, strength and toughness properties of fibre-reinforced plastics. An extension of the classical Zhurkov&#39;s kinetic approach is proposed to describe the effect of temperature and moisture on the ply-level matrix-dominated strength properties. The phenomenological equations are implemented into a finite-element simulation framework, consisting of a smeared crack approach for modelling intralaminar and translaminar failure, coupled with a bi-linear cohesive zone approach to describe delamination onset and progressive growth. The modelling approach is calibrated by means of experimental data in the open literature for the carbon-epoxy material IM7/8552. Validation case studies for the simulation strategy include quasi-isotropic short beam shear coupons and open-hole specimens subject to tension. It is demonstrated that the proposed simulation framework provides a comprehensive quantitative description of the role played by environmental effects in terms of development and interaction of intralaminar, interlaminar and translaminar damage processes.},

The pulsed laser technique is utilized as the manufacturing method for both the fabrication and the introduction of desired pre-stresses, simultaneously. Based on this concept, a novel bistable structure consisted of one pre-compressed main beam, and a pair of supporting beams is designed and fabricated. The deformation difference between the main beam and the supporting beams induced by laser heating residual stress make the main beam to buckle under the constraints of two supporting beams and possess a bistable feature. The bistable structures can be implemented into other devices in the form of cantilevers thanks to the internal integration of the buckled beam and the boundary conditions. The characteristics of this new bistable structure, including its stable shape and snap-through response, are investigated both experimentally and numerically. During the snap forth and back process with the snapping load of 19 mN and the required energy of 77 mN·mm, an impressive energy dissipation with a loss factor value of 0.3 exists. Finally, a parametric study was carried out to find the critical performance parameters.},

But these coatings can cause iatrogenic complications when particles become lose and float freely in the blood stream. Here we present an ultra-thin coating based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA). The mussel-inspired biopolymer hyaluronic acid was first conjugated to dopamine (DN) to get HADN and then poly (ethylene glycol) bis (3-amino-propyl) terminated (PBA) was used to functionalize the HADN with PEG. The reciprocating sliding ball-on-flat ex vivo model based on PU ball and porcine aorta was used to evaluate the lubrication performance and the results suggest coating of HADN with best lubrication enhancement. After 40 min friction test, the surface of aorta remained intact for HADN-PBA coated PU as compared to HADN coating and positive control (sliding against bare PU). The amount of glycocalyx, number of endothelial nuclei and intima surface of aorta for coated PU were similar to negative control (without rubbing). Besides lubrication, the high biocompatibility suggests the coating of HADN-PBA is safe and lubrication benefits to the cardiovascular catheter.},

A set of dispersion parameters, including area A , distance l , angle α , and aspect ratio δ , are firstly proposed for quantitatively characterizing the voids dispersion features of the SDVMs. Then on the basis of the characterization results, a reconstruction approach is developed based on the random medium theory and similarity comparison algorithm. The applicability and validity of the proposed voids dispersion characterization and SDVM reconstruction methods are verified through numerical and experimental case studies, respectively. And effects on the dispersion features of the SDVMs by such as autocorrelation function parameters and the sintering pressure are also investigated via the comparative discussions on the cumulative distribution function (cdf) curves of all dispersion parameters.},

Low-velocity impact tests were conducted on eight GFRPs and eight GFRP-STF composite specimens . The results show that the STF could improve the maximum resistive force and energy absorption of the GFRP-STF composite for both penetration and non-penetration samples. The effectiveness of the STF in improving the impact behavior of the composite were differed significantly owing to various physical parameters such as the number of layers, constraint type, and laying angle. The maximum resistive force and energy dissipation of the four-layered GFRP-STF, considering the interaction of two-way fibers, increased by 105\% and 113\%, respectively. However, GFRP-STF composites under the “+” and “O” constraint types could only improve either the maximum resistive force or the energy dissipation. Under a laying angle of 45°, the energy dissipation of GFRP-STF was also improved by 58.5\% of the increase in maximum resistive force. It can be inferred from the impact tests conducted on all the GFRP-STF specimens that the specimens fail because of filament fracture or tearing in the zonal fracture, which is different from the results obtained for the GFRP specimens.},

Directional coarsening of γ&#39; precipitates under external stress forms the rafting morphology, which plays a crucial role in the creep property. The microelastic theory, coupled with the crystal plasticity model, is utilized to study the rafting behavior during the early stage of creep in Co-Al-W superalloys. High W content and large eigenstrain can produce a lower creep strain of early stage, for the subdued plastic deformation in the γ matrix. Driving forces of element redistribution during rafting are compared among the chemical, interfacial and elastic contribution, in which the elastic contribution is dominant in rafting. With the change in creep stress from 197 MPa to 297 MPa, the element redistribution is strengthened, and the rafting is accelerated in Co-10 Al-9 W (at.\%) alloy. Elements redistribution in the rafting process widens the γ/γ&#39; interface. In contrast, the width of γ/γ&#39; interface along the rafting direction begins to decrease when the coalescence of γ&#39; precipitates happens. The straight-forward insight on the element diffusion during rafting and the related creep properties guides the composition design and rafting behavior prediction of this novel Co-Al-W superalloy.},

Specifically, the anisotropic sliding wear behavior of as-built, AM-ed 316L SS is compared against annealed, wire-drawn counterparts. We describe, in-detail, how the sliding wear mechanisms of delamination , abrasion, oxidation , and plastic deformation are attributed to the initial surface microstructure under different loading conditions using a number of techniques. This new understanding sheds light on how different AM-induced microstructures affect wear, thereby allowing for better utilization of this technology to develop components with enhanced wear properties.},

Food ingredients are often exploited to implement some strategies to conceive new drug delivery systems as potential solutions.

Ferulic acid (FA), as a poorly water-soluble model drug, was loaded on both sides of the Janus fibers. The side-by-side electrospinning process was performed for a smooth and robust preparation. SEM and TEM revealed that the resultant Janus fibers had linear morphology without beads-on-a-string phenomena, smooth surface, and obvious side-by-side structure. The FA was present in the fibers in an amorphous state due to its fine compatibility with zein and PVP. In vitro dissolution tests verified that the Janus fibers manipulated the release of FA in a two-stage manner. The controlled release mechanism of the Janus fibers was proposed. On the basis of the application of zein, a process–structure–performance relationship, which should be useful for developing many new functional materials from biological macromolecules, was disclosed.},

In this paper, a new phenomenological model is constructed according to the hysteresis responses of the MR gel. The current is employed as an input variable under different frequencies, i.e., 0.1 Hz, 5 Hz and 15 Hz. The model parameters have been identified using the genetic algorithm and the modeling results are compared with two classical models such as Bouc-Wen model and Dahl model . The root means square error (RMSE) is employed as an evaluation criterion and the results show that the proposed phenomenological model can forecast the hysteresis with high accuracy and especially has the capability to capture the strain softening/stiffening characteristics of the MR gel. Therefore, the constructed model is a great candidate to implement the semi-active control of the MR gel in the practical application with various excitations.},

This was confirmed by diffraction and atom probe tomography (APT) showing that carbon is in the as-deposited (Ta,W):C films homogeneously distributed in the structure without carbide formation or carbon segregation. Annealing at 900 °C for 2 h showed no significant column coarsening but an increased defect density at the column boundaries in the (Ta,W):C films. The films were still supersaturated with respect to carbon but APT showed a partial segregation of carbon presumably to defect-rich column boundaries after annealing. The (Ta,W) films exhibited a hardness of ~12–13 GPa. Alloying with carbon increased the hardness to ~17 GPa. The hardness increased to ~19 GPa for the annealed (Ta,W):C films. This annealing-induced hardness increase was explained by C segregation to the more defect-rich column boundaries, which restricts dislocation movements .

The results suggest that the average friction coefficient decreases with increased hydrostatic pressure. Hydrostatic pressure helps reduce the wear rates of CF/PEEK and 431SS. As the pressure increases, the main wear and friction mechanism of CF/PEEK changes from adhesive wear to fatigue wear, while the main wear mechanism of 431SS is abrasive wear . Compared with the sliding surface after normal pressure experiments, the surface roughness Ra of CF/PEEK will be smaller after high pressure experiments. The crystallinity of CF/PEEK decreases linearly with hydrostatic pressure, indicating a possible decline in mechanical properties .

  abstract     = {An excessive concentration of boron in the 9\% Cr tempered martensitic steels alloyed with nitrogen has a detrimental effect on creep performance, as relatively large boron nitride phases are formed and can act as the preferred sites for cavity nucleation . In the current research, a systematic investigation has been performed documenting details of creep damage in the heat affected zone of a weld joint constructed by using a 9\% Cr Grade 92 steel. A combination of correlative characterisation techniques has been applied to monitor and quantify the evolution of creep damage within the heat affected zone through the entire creep life. The utilisation of cryo-fractography, two-dimensional electron-based microscopic characterisation and three-dimensional tomography based on focused ion beam microscopy have confirmed the close association between creep cavities and boron nitride phases from the initial stage of creep. It is revealed that the thermal transients imposed during welding result in the decohesion at the interface of boron nitrides with the surrounding matrix . This decohesion is a result of significant thermo-mechanical mismatch between boron nitrides and the tempered martensitic matrix. The voids initiated at these locations grow and eventually link-up during creep exposure, leading to cracking and fracture.},

  abstract     = {Conventionally, the shear thickening fluid (STF) is used to improve the ballistic performance of aramid fabric because its shear thickening property increases the friction of inter-yarns. However, intuitively, enhancing the inter-yarn adhesion is an easier method. In this study, the adhesive polyurethane (PU) was utilized. The aramid fabrics impregnated with STF, the composite of STF and PU (STF-PU), and PU were compared in terms of the resistance to single yarn pull-out, the flexibility of fabric and the high-velocity impact test, respectively. Due to the robust adhesion of PU, comparing with STF/aramid fabric, a small amount of PU within STF-PU could strengthen the resistance of inter-yarn relative motion significantly and decrease mass loading intensively. Meantime, the flexibility had a little compromise due to unique heterogeneous structure in striking contrast with PU/aramid whose flexibility was impaired extremely. When it came to the high-velocity impact test, STF-PU/aramid showed outright advantages over STF/aramid and PU/aramid composite. It was also illuminated that excessively strong resistance to the yarn mobility was adverse for the high-velocity impact. Confidently, this work provides a new avenue in the development of flexible armor.},

  abstract     = {Flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is an important manufacturing process whereby nanomaterials are produced through the combustion of atomized fuel containing dissolved precursor elements. While FSP has the potential to enable the scalable production of a wide range of next generation energy materials, it also has a multi-scale, multi-physics character, and a large number of processing variables. Optimizing the process for desirable material outcomes by traditional approaches is challenging. In this work, the processing parameter space is explored via a new and efficient methodology that includes statistical methods such as Latin hypercube design of experiments , machine learning surrogate modeling , and Bayesian optimization. As a result, the FSP process is optimized for enhanced performance. Specifically, in-situ particle size measurements are used to tailor the production of silica nanoparticles for a low spread in particle diameters with respect to the mean particle diameter, resulting in an improvement of 25.5\% over the baseline within 15 experimental trials. In the process, the analysis reveals distinct domains of primary particle and agglomerated particle formation.},

This paper describes the incorporation of graphene platelets (GNP) into polypropylene (PP) to produce PP/GNP SPC. PP/GNP fibers were firstly prepared by melt compounding and spinning, and then PP/GNP SPC were produced by film stacking. The thermal, mechanical, and morphological properties of the produced samples were characterized via DSC , WAXD , tensile test , peeling test, optical microscopy, and SEM. The combination of film stacking technology of SPC and nanotechnology of graphene enhanced the mechanical properties significantly. The tensile strength , tensile modulus , and interfacial strength of PP SPC with only 0.062 wt\% GNP were increased by 117, 116, and 116\%, respectively. The reinforcement is attributed to the high intrinsic mechanical properties of GNP and the self-reinforced mechanism. The spinning promotes the alignment of GNP, and the compaction process induces the in-plane orientation of GNP. In addition, a small number of GNP do not increase the cost significantly.},

Inspired by coral&#39;s high efficiency in preying on tiny plankton in the ocean, we pioneered a simple method for the in situ construction of “nano-tentacles” based on the original porous material skeleton. The introduction of “nano-tentacles” can further redesign and remolding of the existing interconnected pores to increase the specific surface areas and specific chelating sites for target metal ions. Herein, a proof-of-concept design is illustrated by in situ growing (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APS) on the inner wall of the porous structure of chitosan/graphene oxide composite gel (CGG). The resulting material (NT-CGG) has a distribution coefficient ( K d ) of 1.25 × 10 8 mL g −1 , which exhibits ultrahigh affinity for lead ions, and the uptake capacity can reach 470 mg g −1 . More significantly, the NT-CGG can effectively remove lead from 10 ppm to undetectable levels (≤0.02 ppb) with remove efficiency ≥99.9998\% in the breakthrough experiment. The method proposed in this paper may be widely applicable to the redesign and remolding of most existing porous materials.},

  abstract     = {Gaussian laser intensity profiles are standard in laser-based metal additive manufacturing , although recent work in single-layer melt tracks showed that beam shaping could offer a feasible route towards microstructural control. Since thermal cycling and grain orientation templating in multilayer builds can alter microstructures, we compare three-dimensional 316 L stainless steel cubes built using Gaussian and elliptical laser intensity profiles. Microstructural characterization confirms that elliptical beams result in a modified and improved microstructure compared to Gaussian beams . This assessment favoring the elliptical beam is based on: (1) the observed refinement of the columnar and equiaxed grains; (2) more importantly, the volume fraction occupied by equiaxed grains increases dramatically such that the average grain area is reduced by nearly 50\%; (3) reduced texture in cubes built using an elliptical beam. The random orientation of small equiaxed grains in samples built using an elliptical beam also suggests a higher nucleation frequency. High-fidelity finite element simulations that deliver accurate thermal profiles by incorporating laser ray tracing and fluid dynamics were performed. Using a time-dependent solidification map based on local thermal gradients ( G ) and growth rates ( R ), our simulation results confirm the experimentally observed trend that an elliptical beam results in a favorable thermal profile.},

Electron microscope analysis showed that the synthesized particles had well-defined core-shell morphology. Special double/multi-core structure and a reduced thickness of the intermediate shell were found, and the formation mechanisms were also explored in detail. The water contact angle measurement proved that the wettability of PTFE could be greatly enhanced by coating SiO 2 layer. The friction tests were performed to investigate the water lubrication properties of PTFE@SiO 2 additive, the results indicated that the core-shell PTFE@SiO 2 nanoparticles possessed the superior tribological properties, and the maximum friction coefficient and wear volume were respectively decreased by 75\% and 99\% when compared with pure water and water with PTFE/SiO 2 . Based on the analysis of worn surface, it was believed that the existence of core-shell structure and the formation of robust transfer film were the key to its excellent performance, and a possible lubrication mechanism was also proposed.},

The ultimate tensile strength and yield strength increase monotonously with increasing of the solution temperature, while the elongation and reduction of area change conversely. The thickness of the secondary α (α S ) increases significantly from 28.6 nm to 120.1 nm with the aging temperature increasing from 550 °C to 710 °C. The volume fraction and thickness of α S are sensitive to the aging temperature and strongly influence the mechanical properties.

This work investigates the mechanical properties of PrintCast composites and their relation to the volume-fraction of 316 L reinforcement. Uniaxial tension experiments were conducted with A356/316 L PrintCast composites that had either 30 vol\%, 40 vol\% or 50 vol\% 316 L. When 316 L reinforcement increased from 30 vol\% to 40 vol\%, a &gt; 200\% increase in ductility and 400\% increase in absorbed-energy were observed, while a much lower increase was exhibited when reinforcement increased from 40 vol\% to 50 vol\%. The failure of the 30 vol\% sample occurred by localized deformation and a single failure initiation region, in contrast to the 40 vol\% and 50 vol\% samples which failed by delocalized damage in the entire gauge section. To understand this transition phenomena, digital image correlation (DIC) was coupled with finite element (FE) analysis to capture the deformation and failure processes. The results revealed that, for all samples, stress concentrated and failure initiated in a 316 L strut near the lattice nodes, where the strut underwent localized bending-dominated deformation. In the high 316 L volume-fraction composites, the increase in 316 L-strut diameter reduced local bending stress and stabilized the deformation, leading to improved damage tolerance. Based on the presented analysis, local modifications to the PrintCast structure are suggested.},

  abstract     = {Laser keyhole welding of dissimilar metals has broad applications in various industrial fields. However, dissimilar metal mixing in the molten pool often causes the formation of detrimental intermetallic compounds that can undermine the performances of the dissimilar metal joints . In this study, the metal mixing process in laser keyhole welding of dissimilar metals is investigated with a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The parametric experimental study is conducted to reveal the effects of laser power, welding speed, and heat input on the metal mixing in the fusion zone. Ex-situ energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy element mapping is used to characterize the metal mixing status in the fusion zone. To investigate the underlying physics of the welding process , a numerical model is developed to simulate the heat transfer, fluid flow, and metal mixing in the molten pool. It is found that the recoil pressure contributes to an upward flow that pushes copper to migrate from the bottom of the molten pool to the top. Meanwhile, the Marangoni force generates one backward flow and two side vortices that facilitate the metal mixing. An increase of laser power increases both the recoil pressure and the Marangoni stress, which drives more copper to migrate upward and mix with aluminum . An increase of welding speed reduces the molten pool lifetime, which reduces the metal mixing by the fluid flow. The investigation of dissimilar metal redistribution provides insights regarding the formation of intermetallic compounds in the joints, which is valuable for the design and optimization of the welding process in different industries.},

Through a localized treatment, the nanostructuring process can bring bistable properties for localized regions, whose configurations were determined by their shapes and sizes. With coupled deformations among multiple nanostructured regions, the processed shell can hold different stable configurations with localized bistable regions capping toward different sides. The stable configurations are determined by the shapes and sizes of the localized bistable regions and their in-plane distributions. Furthermore, the stable configurations of the multistable shells can be further mechanically modified by plastic bending. To guide the design and investigation of the multistable behavior, finite element analysis and experimental work have been conducted to correlate the stable configurations to design parameters, including shapes and sizes of the localized nanostructuring regions, their pattern distributions, applied mechanical processes as well as boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing processes supplement traditional material processing routes with unique capabilities which can have profound impacts on component production. Physical prototyping is accelerated and the fabrication of complex components, difficult or impossible to produce conventionally, is realized. Metals research is often focused on identifying process windows to avoid defects which thereby yield desirable properties. In electron beam melting fusion processes, however, precise spatial control of the heat source allows for detailed microstructure manipulation. Design is therefore extended to the microstructure scale offering greater overall flexibility towards engineering high performance components. In this work the role of geometry and beam path sequencing in a powder bed electron beam melting process is investigated. It is observed that by carefully engineering the melting sequence the morphology and texture at the mesoscale can be controlled. Solidification in the build direction, which usually prefers [001] directions, is tilted by control of the heat flux vector which yields large columnar crystals with a strong [011] build direction preference. This newly developed conduction control strategy is demonstrated for producing alternating mesoscale structures in bulk samples. Furthermore, a new scanning strategy is demonstrated which may be suitable for promoting a randomized crystallographic texture during the additive manufacturing process.},

The materials were hardened 410, PH13-8Mo and 300M, two stainless steels and one high strength steel respectively. A primary aim was obtaining low machined surface roughness . A surface finish investigation compared tool geometries and tool materials. Multi-response cutting parameter screening was undertaken using a novel trade study and iteration method, where the calculated cut quality was used to identify better feed rates and surface speeds. In addition the sub-surface machined microstructure was examined. Tools with a small nose radius produced the roughest surfaces. A surface roughness below 0.4 μm Ra could be consistently achieved on all three materials using rhombic wiper inserts and a feed rate up to 0.1 mm/rev. PH13-8Mo had the lowest machined surface roughness, as low as 0.11 μm in terms of Ra . In the parameter screening stage a generalised recommendation for good cut quality was a surface speed of at least 120 m/min and a feed rate of 0.088 mm/rev. The microstructure examination showed that for all materials under the conditions tested, there was no evidence of white amorphous layer formation and there was grain deformation for the 410 material only.},

In this study, we combine cheap, easily and commonly available agricultural waste materials, bamboo microfibres , chitosan, and mycelium from Ganoderma l ucidum, to establish a composite mixture that is workable, extrudable and buildable. We study the impact of bamboo fibre size, chitosan concentration, pH and weight ratio of bamboo to chitosan to determine the optimum growth condition for the mycelium as well as high mechanical stiffness. The resulting materials have thus low energy costs, are sustainable and can be shaped easily.

In this work, galvanized Q&amp;P980 steel sheets were welded with LCS sheets. LME cracks were found on both the Q&amp;P980 steel and LCS sides. However, the severity of LME cracking on the Q&amp;P980 side was much higher than that on the LCS side, indicating that Q&amp;P980 steel has a higher LME susceptibility than LCS, which was also proven by a hot tensile test . The higher LME susceptibility of Q&amp;P980 was attributed to its lower reactivity with liquid Zn, higher achievable stress and increased number of LME-susceptible grain boundaries. Micro-analysis revealed that Zn most likely entered the steel matrix via diffusion and not via liquid penetration, and stress-assisted diffusion is the likely mechanism for LME.},

Here, this effect is investigated by applying 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy and XRD technique to track the hydration reaction and identify the hydration products . In the presence of these biopolymers an earlier consumption of clinker phases was observed indicating a shortened induction period. The subsequent formation of hydration products occurs earlier, resulting in the formation of C-A-H phases (CAH 10 and C 2 AH 8 ). No further reaction products like intercalation compounds were detected. An in-depth mechanistic study revealed that alginate does not adsorb on cement, but captures Ca 2+ ions from the pore solution , thus resulting in a positively charged biopolymer chain which then attracts [Al(OH) 4 ] − ions to its surface. Through this binding of calcium and aluminate ions and alignment to the alginate molecule, a precursor for calcium aluminate hydrates is formed which acts as a nucleation seed and triggers continued growth into large C-A-H crystals, similar as in related biotemplating processes which are known for calcite or brushite formation.},

In particular, we introduce “differential EBSD” tomographs to highlight the changes to the microstructure caused by the grinding process, allowing us to detect even subtle differences in lattice orientation and small distances in grain boundary migration. We use our visualization approach to discuss the acting microstructural mechanisms in a load- and time-resolved fashion, spanning a wide range of grinding conditions from mild to severe. In addition to removed matter, we observe lattice rotation originating at the surface and advancing deeper into the work piece with increasing load, grain growth by grain boundary migration, and the transient formation of unstable small new grains.},

A specific mold with a thin cavity was designed to achieve rapid cooling rate during MIM process, and to further accelerate crystallization and refine crystals, which was verified by visualization results, DSC curves, and WAXD patterns. Thus, nanocellular PP foams were prepared, whose high toughness was presented in tensile testing , especially for bimodal cellular foams, more than 327\% higher than that of microcellular foams, and up to 53\% higher than that of solid. It is owing to the introduced matrix craze, shear yielding, and larger plastic zone by nanocells and the transformed crack propagation direction by microcells.

  abstract     = {Fibre reinforced composite laminates are key engineering materials allowing to design lightweight components with high mechanical properties . Yet they are prone to delamination between the reinforcing plies, which in turn limits the damage resistance of many applications. This is especially true for the interfaces between dissimilar reinforcing plies that are often encountered in actual components, e.g. differences in fibre orientation , fibre material or ply architecture, where high interlaminar stresses can occur. Nanofibrous toughening veils are known to increase the damage resistance when inserted between similar reinforcing plies, but it is currently unknown how they perform when delamination occurs at dissimilar interfaces. Here, the nanofibre toughening of frequently encountered dissimilar interfaces such as occurring between multidirectionally stacked unidirectional fibre plies (+45°/−45°), multistructural stackings (unidirectional versus fabrics) and multimaterial configurations (glass fibres versus carbon fibres) are analysed. These interfaces largely exert their influence on the crack path during delamination and thus alter the effectiveness of nanofibre toughening. Poly(ether- block -amide) nanofibres of the biosourced polyamide 11 family result in a large increase in mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness for all the tested dissimilar interfaces. We show that their effectiveness however depends on the underlying delamination mechanics present in different dissimilar interfaces.},

Nitrile Butadiene Rubber / Poly(ε-caprolactone) (NBR/PCL) blend nanofibers, with 20‐40-60\%wt of not crosslinked NBR, were interleaved in epoxy-based CFRPs to evaluate their effect on the final composite performance. CFRPs with rubbery mats show a significant increase of the energy release rate in Mode I, both at initiation and propagation stages (+480\% and +340\%, respectively), thanks to NBR/PCL blend ability to promote high matrix toughening of the fragile epoxy resin. In Mode II a maximum improvement of about 30\% was achieved. The presence of highly damping NBR component widens the composite energy dissipation window below room temperature, enhancing the CFRP damping. Similar results were obtained with two different epoxy resins, and the effect of the layering sequence was also discussed. NBR percentage in nanofibers and nanofibrous mats amount may strongly affect the CFRP maximum operating temperature . Nanofibers can be positioned, during lamination, in the critical regions where interlaminar stresses are mostly concentrated due to geometric discontinuities providing a flexible approach to localized modification of laminates.},

  abstract     = {Alloy 718 is a nickel-based superalloy that is widely used as a structural material for high-temperature applications. One concern that arises when Alloy 718 is manufactured using powder bed fusion (PBF) is that residual stresses appear due to the high thermal gradients . These residual stresses can be detrimental as they can degrade mechanical properties and distort components. In this work, residual stresses in PBF built Alloy 718, using both electron and laser energy sources, were measured by neutron diffraction . The effects of process parameters and thermal post-treatments were studied. The results show that thermal post-treatments effectively reduce the residual stresses present in the material. Moreover, the material built with laser based PBF showed a higher residual stress compared to the material built with electron-beam based PBF. The scanning strategy with the lower amount of residual stresses in case of laser based PBF was the chessboard strategy compared to the bi-directional raster strategy. In addition, the influence of measured and calculated lattice spacing ( d 0 ) on the evaluated residual stresses was investigated.},

  abstract     = {The majority of the previously reported nanocomposites obtainable with higher energy density (&gt;15 J cm −3 ) relies strongly on much higher breakdown strength (&gt;4000 kV cm −1 ). The operation of capacitors in such higher applied electric field brings challenges because of the substantially increased the failure probability. In this study we explored the dispersibility and the orientation of fillers in nanocomposites as they play vital roles in the energy density. Based on the infinite element modulation results, an original design of 1–3 type composite structure was employed in the current study. This design adopts the one-dimensional (110)-oriented monodispersed barium strontium titanate Ba 0.67 Sr 0.33 TiO 3 (BST) nanorod array as fillers embedded in the three-dimensional poly (−vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer matrix . With these originally designed BST/PVDF nanocomposites, we have demonstrated a significant enhancement of energy density at a lower applied electric field. For example, an energy density of 13.10 J cm −3 at electric field of 3400 kV cm −1 can be obtained, an enhancement of 3 times larger than that of bare PVDF. Moreover, the discharge efficiency is maintained at 69\% at 3400 kV cm −1 . The high performance of this originally designed nanacomposite demonstrated its potential application in the next generation energy storage devices.},

The microstructure and wear properties of the thermal sprayed Fe based metallic glass coating layers were investigated. XRD analysis results showed that all the three coating layers had broad halo peaks. Alloying element depletion was observed in the coating layer in the vicinity of the oxides. However, the VPS coating layer showed no depletion area. Wear test results showed that the VPS coating layers had the best wear resistance among all the three coating layers, whereas the plasma material had the poorest wear resistance property. Worn surface and cross-section observation revealed that the plasma material had particle boundary delamination because of its lower bonding force between the particles. Directly below the worn-out surface of the HVOF coating layers, microcracks were generated along the particle boundaries. By contrast, no defects were found at all directly under the worn-out surface of the VPS materials. The wear behavior of Fe based metallic glass coating layers fabricated in diverse thermal spray processes was discussed with respect to the microstructure.},

Here, the creep life and the cracking behavior of Inconel 718 fabricated by selective laser melting were investigated systematically at 650°C and 400 N by means of the small punch creep testing method. The results show that the periodic and spatially heterogeneous microstructures composed of V-shaped grains and columnar grains are produced, and play an important role in the creep performance. Under the same heat-treatment condition, the creep resistance of the specimens loaded along the scanning direction is much higher than that of the ones loaded along the building direction. While under the same loading direction, homogenization/aging-treated specimens have the longest creep life and the solution/aging-treated specimens are of the shortest creep life. The creep cracking mechanism of the alloy associated with the spatially heterogeneous microstructures was elucidated. The theoretical calculation suggests that the higher energy input or the larger overlap ratio of the melting pools may decrease the area fraction of the V-shaped grains to enhance the creep life. The finding provides a potential strategy to design microstructures for the high creep performance of selective laser melting-fabricated Inconel 718.},

Previously, the compatibility of the component with future non-destructive testing (NDT) requirements has not been considered at the design stage. As a result, NDT operators are often challenged to reliably inspect components with complex geometries. In this paper, a framework is proposed for the optimisation of a component&#39;s shape to maximise the sensitivity and coverage of an interrogating ultrasonic wave, thus enhancing the ability to non-destructively image defects . The design of beam cross-sections are optimised using both a low-dimensional parameterisation with a genetic algorithm , and the level set method which enables more degrees of freedom in the component shape parameterisation . Images of flaws computed using the total focusing method show an 8 dB improvement in the signal to noise ratio for the optimised component as well as a five-fold improvement in the estimate of flaw size . These results show that the NDT-optimised design of components can provide significant improvements in flaw imaging. This in turn assists in extending the lifespan of in-service components and indeed their remanufacturability, which is both environmentally and economically advantageous.},

This method utilizes recent developments in welding to achieve better performance and higher process rates. Higher performance requires higher metal deposition rates , which implies higher heat input that negatively affects the manufacturing process . In the present study, a high-performance controlled short-circuiting metal transfer process at a wire feed rate of 12 m/min for WAAM with an Al–Mg–Mn alloying system was developed. The arc current and voltage waveforms were studied by oscillogram processing and then modified to reduce the energy input in comparison with a self-regulated gas metal arc welding process. The newly developed process was implemented to manufacture sample parts at a travel speed of up to 150 cm/min. The modified waveforms in combination with an increased travel speed led to a decrease in heat input, which appeared to be 16\% lower than that of a conventional self-regulated process. Decreased heat input led to an improved geometry preservation stability at high process rates (up to 2.2 kg/h). Study of the mechanical properties showed that the elongation of the tensile samples was up to 41\%. This increase in elongation was explained through macro- and microstructure analysis .},

To verify the enhancement effect of the material, the low velocity impact testing was used to analyze the impact response and damage morphology .

Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method has been successfully applied to solve various material selection problems .

In order to handle the uncertainty and inaccuracy in the criteria information, this paper develops a novel MCDM method based on group generalized Pythagorean fuzzy weighted average (GGPFWA) operator. In the novel method, decision makers are divided into advisers and deciders. The advisers use Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) to represent the criteria information of alternative materials. PFS is a new extension of fuzzy set, which can effectively represent fuzzy and uncertain information. The deciders use group generalized parameters (GGPs) to judge the accuracy of criteria information provided by each adviser. The GGPs are expressed by Pythagorean fuzzy numbers. Then, the criteria information and the GGPs are aggregated by GGPFWA operator, and the aggregate value of each material is obtained. By processing the aggregate value, the ranking of alternative materials is determined and the optimal material is selected. The accuracy and reliability of the novel method are verified by two material selection cases.},

However, further optimizing the design and improving the performance of the void-involved Si/C electrodes still remain challenging. Here, the lithiation kinetics and morphological evolution in lithiated Si@CNT nanohybrids are investigated using large-scale atomistic simulations based on reactive force field (ReaxFF), and the effects of both size of C shell and contact mode between Si and C phase on the lithiation behavior are explored systematically. The simulation results quantitatively reveal that the constraint effect of C shell causes the Li capacity loss, and the barrier function of the void space retards the lithiation rate. Regulating the size of coating layer can mediate the constraint effect and barrier function. Furthermore, regulating the contact mode between Si and C phase to form an eccentric structure can effectively enhance the lithiation capacity (up to 10\%) and lithiation rate at initial stage. Besides, the malleability and deformability of the lithiated a-Li x Si phase are investigated at atomic-level. The findings not only provide theoretical rational for the lithiation mechanism of core-hollow shell nanohybrid, but also open avenues for optimizing the void-containing electrode design for high-performance LIBs.},

A very large entropy change value of 58 J.kg −1 .K −1 corresponding to a magnetic field change of 5 T near room temperature has been obtained for Mn 0.89 Cu 0.11 CoGe exhibiting a maximum effective refrigerant capacity of 258.2 J.kg −1 .

The range of the process conditions, i.e., complete melting, partial melting, and unmelted, was determined based on the observations of the microstructure parallel to the building direction. When the powders were pre-sintered and not melted under specific process conditions with an energy density lower than that required for complete melting, porous microstructures were formed with open pores. In addition, interfacial microstructural studies were conducted to confirm the presence of residual powder, which settled onto the strut, resulting in a higher specific surface area. These indicate that the SLM process can enhance the porosity, even with a specific design of lattice structures, as fluidic materials are expected to flow through the open porous structure.},

This study evaluates the manufacturability, mechanical behaviour , permeability and biocompatibility of gyroid scaffolds. In simulations, mechanical behaviour and permeability exhibited up to 56\% and 73\% accuracy, respectively, compared to the experimental data. The compression and permeability experiments showed that the elastic modulus and the permeability of the scaffolds were both in the range of human bones. The morphological experiment showed that manufacturing accuracy increased with greater designed porosity, while the in vitro experiments revealed that permeability played the main role in cell proliferation . The significance of this work is improving the understanding of the effect of design parameters on the mechanical properties, permeability and cell growth of the scaffolds, which will enable the design of porous bone scaffolds with better bone-repair effects.},

  abstract     = {Based on the mechanism of laser-powder interaction and droplet forming method, a cellular automaton simulation model of laser cladding layer morphology is introduced. In the model, the influences of thermophysical parameters including specific heat and thermal conductivity are taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the relationships involving laser power, scan speed and powder feed rate and the morphology parameters of the cladding layer are established. Subsequently, in order to verify the applicability and accuracy of the simulation of the cladding layer, single-track experiments of Stellite6, Ni60AA and SUS316, materials with different thermophysical properties , were carried out under different process parameters, respectively. Additionally, the stepwise method is applied to multitrack cladding experiments with different overlap to obtain morphological parameters of different tracks. The morphology of the cladding layer calculated by the model is in good agreement with the experimental results. Both of the relative errors of width and height are less than 5\%, and the relative error of the cross-sectional area is less than 9\%, which affirms the possibility of the model to predict the cladding morphology of different materials under different process parameters. This research can optimize process parameters and improve the forming quality of laser cladding .},

  abstract     = {The substitution of Portland cement with microbially based bio-cement for the production of construction materials is an emerging sustainable technology. Bio-cemented building components such as bricks have been fabricated in molds, where bacteria-containing aggregates solidify when treated with a cementation solution. This restricts component size due to the limited fluid penetration depth and narrows options for component customization . The use of additive manufacturing technologies has the potential to overcome those limitations and to expand the range of bio-cement applications. In the present work an automated process for the production of spatial structures has been developed, in which sand and urease active calcium carbonate powder were selectively deposited within a print volume and treated with a cementation solution. This method provided conditions for calcite precipitation in the powder-containing areas, whereas areas of pure sand served as removable support structure allowing improved fluid exchange. The 3D printed structure was geometrically stable and had sharply defined boundaries. Compressive strength tests on cylindrical specimens showed that the used powder-sand mix was suitable for the production of high-strength bio-cemented material. The present work demonstrates an application of bio-cement in an additive manufacturing process, that can potentially be used to produce resource efficient sustainable building components.},

This paper investigates the effects of processing parameters and heat treatments employed on CMT-WAAM of a precipitation hardenable Ni-based alloy – Inconel 718. The process stability was analysed by electrical transients and melt pool imaging, showing an opposite trend to the measured heat inputs. A 1.2 mm diameter wire permitted deposition widths of 5.92–13.15 mm, but widths larger than ~10 mm decreased the arc stability considerably. Laves length and carbide diameter decreased with travel speed, while the as-deposited hardness increased. These observations permitted a linear wall to be fabricated with a minimal heat input per layer of 181–185 J/mm. An increase in the solution treatment temperature from 980 to 1040 °C reduced microsegregation , Laves and δ phase precipitation . Localised regions with high microhardness were found near interlayer regions due to a local dissolution of Nb-rich eutectic phases . Compared to powder-based additive manufacturing, CMT-WAAM IN718 exhibits a larger melt pool size and lower as-deposited hardness, but has been found to show satisfactory ageing response and similar Laves phase area fraction.},

The cyclic stability is vital during long term operation of cooling systems for real commercial applications. The multiple cycling under mechanical loading causes to produce structural and functional fatigue in eCMs. Recently, various feasible strategies, e.g., microalloying, toughening through texture, adjusting the compressive stress mode and grain refinement, etc., have been employed in shape memory alloys (SMAs) to enhance the working stability of eCMs. As structural–/functional fatigue is a crucial challenge for elastocaloric cooling that must be overcome to make the technology commercial, we summarize the state-of-the-art strategies to enhance the cyclic stability in numerous well-studied eCMs. The article elucidates the methodology of these approaches through tailoring the materials or composition, arresting the crack initiation via microstructural modifications and the influence of properties (i.e. ∆T ad ) under the cyclic application of stresses. Finally, the current report provides a summary of directly measured adiabatic temperature change ( ∆T ad ) for various eCE SMAs over multiple cycles.},

To access the feasibility of the orthosis 6 voluntary post-stroke patients were asked to test the functionality with manual function test, daily living functionality tests and Likert scale. Movement analysis was used to evaluate the range of movement in the orthosis. The results showed significantly higher functionality by using the orthosis on manual function test, most of the daily functional tests, also the overall personal impressions accessed by Likert scale were positive.

At RT, with an EPSE content of 8 wt\%, the failure strain and fracture toughness K IC value of epoxy resin was improved by 69.4\% and 10.4\%, respectively. At cryogenic temperature , the tensile strength , failure strain and K IC value of EPSE-epoxy reached a maximum of 207 MPa, 3.13\%, and 2.60 MPa·m 1/2 , respectively. Micro-morphology of the fracture surface indicated that the incorporation of EPSE improved the resistance to crack growth. The flexural strength of CF/EPSE-epoxy laminate at 77 K was 17.2\% higher than that of CF/neat epoxy laminate , which mainly attributed to the flexible Si O Si molecular chains in EPSE reducing the CF/matrix interface thermal stress. The transition of failure mode resulted in the jagged-shape load fluctuations in the load-displacement curves of laminates at 77 K. Thermal cycling affecting the flexural strength of CF/EPSE-epoxy laminate was mainly ascribed to the release of part of thermal residual stress and the formation of interface debonding.},

The theory of “energy flow in stages during explosive welding” was first proposed and energy balances at the start and end welding were obtained in this paper. The temporal and spatial distribution of the relevant parameters was analyzed. The value and proportion of each energy were calculated in sections by numerical simulation. The results showed that the detonation products in double method had higher internal energy and lower kinetic energy. The collision velocity obtained by the two methods was close. The kinetic energy of the flyer plate, plastic deformation energy and jet energy in the double method were about twice those in the parallel method. The experimental results showed that the dimension of the interface waves in two methods was close, but more melted microstructures were observed in the double method, whose compositions were mainly TiFe 2 and TiFe 3 . Double vertical explosive welding improved energy efficiency and saved at least half of the explosives.},

In particular, the accurate deposition of MEW-fibres onto curved surfaces of conductive and non-conductive regenerative biomaterials is studied. This study reveals that clinically relevant materials with low conductivities are compatible with resurfacing with organized MEW fibres. Importantly, accurate patterning on non-flat surfaces was successfully shown, provided that a constant electrical field strength and an electrical force normal to the substrate material is maintained. Furthermore, the application of resurfacing the geometry of the medial human femoral condyle is confirmed by the fabrication of a personalised osteochondral implant . The implant composed of an articular cartilage-resident chondroprogenitor cells (ACPCs)-laden hydrogel reinforced with a well-organized MEW scaffold retained its personalised shape, improved its compressive properties and supported neocartilage formation after 28 days in vitro culture.

In this work, a relationship between the heat input and strengthening and softening mechanisms is proposed for a titanium, nickel and stainless steel alloy (Ti-6Al-4V, IN718 and 316L, respectively). Maximum strength is obtained with increasing heat input in 316L stainless steel; whereas IN718 and Ti-6Al-4V require low heat inputs. The results demonstrate that yield strength can be described in terms of the normalised enthalpy. The variation in the yield strength of LPBFed alloys depends prominently on dislocation multiplication/annihilation at certain processing temperatures and thermal straining, which are alloy dependent; as well as on dislocation strengthening and heat dissipation during cooling, which are process dependent. These dependencies are modelled via well-known metallurgical approaches. The relative contribution of various strengthening mechanisms is revealed. The findings of this work can be used as a metric for the prediction and further improvement of yield strength based on the choice of LPBF process parameters and chemical composition.},

The scratch test results in intergranular grain sliding and the formation of nanoscopic intragranular defects within CrN, while Cr sublayer&#39;s thickness reduction and pile-up formation are accompanied by a bending of columnar crystallites and localized plastic deformation .

  abstract     = {Without sacrificing any solution accuracy, an efficient optimization scheme of determining the orientation relationship only based on the daughter phase (i.e., lath martensite in steels in this paper) was established in this work, which involves two key steps. Firstly, an accurate clustering algorithm was developed to perform a statistic of all variants, which can give the most probable orientation and area fraction for each variant. Different from previous methods, the second step is to perform a newly-established optimization scheme, which is able to take variant fractions into consideration to determine the optimal orientation relationship and orientation of prior austenite simultaneously. In this case, the variant-level calculation, which can save much computational time compared with pixel/domain-level calculation, is beneficial for the efficiency promotion. Through inputting the equally-weighted variants into the optimization scheme, the influence of the random cross-sections on the solutions can be effectively eliminated. Furthermore, in-situ high temperature EBSD examinations were first performed to validate solution accuracy, the corresponding results clearly indicated that the orientation of austenite obtained from this approach exhibited a high accuracy and the error is less than 1°.},

With H 2 O 2 increasing in the medium, the release rate of Van from Van-mPEG-TK-MSNs was significantly up-regulated following gatekeepers&#39; disintegration. When Van-mPEG-TK-MSNs was applied in vivo, the infected site was fully cleared after 14 days and the tissue was free of infection. On the whole, the mentioned results suggested that Van-mPEG-TK-MSNs could act as a potential antimicrobial. This study can broaden MSNs&#39; applications and advance the development of novel antibacterial agents.},

  abstract     = {Based on the engineering of the TiN capping layer, the tailoring of the crystalline phases and the paraelectric(PE)/antiferroelectric(AFE)/ferroelectric(FE) properties of nanoscale ZrO 2 thin films are demonstrated without any post-annealing treatment. The capping by the TiN layer leads to the conversion of ZrO 2 from the PE to the AFE electrical characteristics , while the removal of the TiN capping layer results in the AFE-to-FE phase transformation of ZrO 2 . The nano-beam electron diffraction , high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction characterizations identify the presence of the AFE tetragonal and FE orthorhombic phases in ZrO 2 , and the observations reveal the emergence of the out-of-plane compressive and in-plane tensile strains in the ZrO 2 layers by the TiN capping layer as well. The results demonstrate the significant impact of the TiN capping layer effect on the crystalline phases and dielectric properties of nanoscale thin films at a low temperature, which may play an important role in the FE/AFE applications which need a low thermal budget.},

  abstract     = {At present, Fiber metal laminates (FMLs) are mostly used in the aeronautical field to manufacture large-size components, such as skins of fuselage or wing. However, the utilization of FMLs in microsystems and micro-electro-mechanical systems has not been explored yet. Therefore, miniaturization of conventional FMLs and integration of micro-sheet preparation and complex-shaped components forming are of utmost significance from a practical viewpoint. Herein, an integrated ultrasonic-assisted preparation-forming-curing method is proposed to manufacture ultra-thin micro-Ti/Cf/PPS hybrid laminates (TA1/Carbon fiber/PPS) components in this paper. The influence of ultrasonic vibrations on the performance of as-prepared micro-laminates is systematically studied, including the immersion distribution of PPS resin in Cf layer, interfacial bonding properties of Cf/PPS and Ti/PPS interfaces and micro-deformation mechanism of metallic layer. Furthermore, the hot bulging test is carried out by rapid transfer of the micro-laminates at melting temperature (280 °C) of the resin layer using a micro-arrayed spherical-cap die to assess the formability. A combination of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis, metallographic observations and image precision measurement revealed the unique deformation characteristics and thickness evolution of complex-shaped micro-Ti/Cf/PPS laminates. Overall, a high deformation level is achieved during the bulging process. The current study provides an enhanced understanding of ultrasonic-assisted micro-forming-curing process.},

In the present study, high-throughput synthesis of an Al x (CoCrFeNi) 100- x combinatorial material library covering x = 4.5–40 atomic percent Al is achieved, using magnetron co-sputtering. The effects of Al on the microstructure and corrosion behavior are investigated. With the increased amount of Al, crystal-structures of thin films transform from face-centered cubic (FCC) to body-centered cubic (BCC). Both the FCC and BCC thin films demonstrate a uniform elemental distribution. Corrosion characteristics of combinatorial samples immersed in the 3.5 wt\% (wt\%) NaCl solution are evaluated via electrochemical tests. Complementary X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals the compositional variation of passivated films formed on the sample surface after immersion. The results show that the Al x (CoCrFeNi) 100- x HEA thin films possess outstanding corrosion-resistant properties, but the resistance diminishes with the increasing Al content . The decreased corrosion resistance is revealed to be directly related to the constituents of passivated films.},

  abstract     = {Struts are the main load carrying elements in cyclically loaded open cell metal foams . Little is known about the local fatigue behaviour and the influence of the microstructure on nanoscale deformation mechanisms . Different to the bulk counterpart, the millimetre-sized struts in precision-cast AlSi7Mg0.3 foams contain only 1–2 Al-dendrites, Si-Al-eutectic and intermetallic phases. We applied cyclic nanoindentation to N = 10 5 to assess nanofatigue. The change in minimum depth per cycle and the ratio of minimum to maximum indentation depths versus the number of cycles correspond to cyclic plastic processes. These and the indent and pile-up morphologies were correlated with the microstructure and dislocation formations revealed by phase-contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography and transmission electron microscopy . Our results reveal that Si-particles affect deformation within 5 to 10 μm from the indent, and that they favour the formation of fatigue induced dislocation cells in the affected volume. We believe that this interaction is mediated through residual stresses. Furthermore, local variations in microstructure strongly influence the cyclic deformation behaviour and the indent pile-up size and morphology. Interestingly, the results well coincide with observations during fatigue of the bulk alloy reported in the literature.},

This paper presents a new method for improving the electrical conductivity of fibre-polymer composites by through-thickness weaving of continuous filaments with high electrical conductivity (e.g. copper and other materials). Experimental testing and analytical modelling reveal that orthogonally weaving of conductive z-filaments in the through-thickness direction of carbon-epoxy composite increases the electrical conductivity by creating interconnected pathways for current flow. In particular, it is possible to increase the electrical conductivity by over two to three orders of magnitude by using a very low volume fraction (under 1.3 vol\%) of metal z-filaments with a diameter of 0.51 mm. The improvements to both the in-plane and through-thickness electrical conductivities can be designed by controlling the volume fraction and by the judicious choice of the z-filament material.},

Several DFI methods were combined to assess the microstructure over more than two orders of magnitude in size. Different degrees of porosity and other building features were found depending on the parameters of the selective laser melting additive manufacturing process. A sample built with processing parameters yielding the lowest porosity was deformed which induced a phase transformation of the austenitic phase (fcc) into the martensitic phase (bcc). In the deformed sample an increased dark-field contrast was observed which can only be explained by accounting for the fcc-bcc phase distribution and the magnetic properties of the martensitic phase. We demonstrate that neutron dark-field imaging is well suited to not only detect build flaws like cracks but quantitatively characterize the microstructure in additive manufactured steels.},

The strongest correlations were observed between viscosity at a shear rate of 10 3 s −1 and IP (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.9, p  0.9, p &lt; .01).

One specific application could be the removal of ammonium (NH 4 + ) through exchange with Na + ions. Additive manufacturing (AM) represents an especially interesting option for fabrication, as it allows to tailor the size, distribution, shape, and interconnectivity of pores, and therefore the access to charge-bearing sites. The present study provides a proof of concept for NH 4 + removal from wastewater using porous geopolymer components fabricated via direct ink writing (DIW) AM approach. A metakaolin-based ink was employed for the fabrication of a log-pile structure with 45° rotation between layers, producing continuous yet tortuous macropores which are responsible for the high permeability of the sorbents. The ink consolidates in an amorphous , mesoporous network, with the mesopores acting as preferential sites for ion exchange. The printed sorbents were characterized for their physicochemical and mechanical properties and the NH 4 + removal capacity in continuous-flow column experiments by using a model effluent. The lattices present high permeability and high cation exchange capacity and maintained a high amount of active ions after four cycles, allowing to reuse them multiple times.},

Uncovered stents used for malignant obstructions in the biliary tree, especially in the hilar area, are prone to obstruction by tumor ingrowth. In comparison, full-covered stents may block bile duct branches and are at risk of migration. Moreover, metal stents merely promote biliary drainage and have no antitumor effect. In contrast, a drug-eluting self-expandable metallic stent (DES) may provide continuous tumor control and relief of malignant obstructive jaundice. In this study, a new design of SEMS was created and fabricated as advanced stent applications of material extrusion (ME) 3D printing for palliative treatment of unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction according to various paclitaxel (PTX)/poly ε-caprolactone (PCL) weight ratios. As a result, PTX-containing groups had significant effectiveness for inhibiting biliary tumor growth compared with the control group. The PTX-containing groups showed a controlled drug release profile, and its safety and efficacy were verified through in vivo testing.

  abstract     = {Polymer blending strategy has demonstrated to be efficient in enhancing the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers represented by poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). Special attention is paid to the polymeric reinforcements which are miscible with PVDF. Immiscible polymeric reinforcements for PVDF based blends are rarely reported because of the interfacial compatibility issue. In this work, we aimed to explore the possibility of immiscible component polypropylene (PP) in modulating the capacitive performance of PVDF. A two-step fabrication process and polydopamine compatibilizer were developed to improve the interfacial compatibility between two components. The resultant binary blend demonstrated to perform suppressed dielectric loss, improved polarization level and consequently enhanced capacitive performance. With an optimized addition of 10 wt\% PP, a maximum discharge energy density of 12.1 J/cm 3 and discharge efficiency of 69.3\% can be obtained in blends under 350 MV/m, while those of pure PVDF were 5.7 J/cm 3 and 45.6\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Polylactic acid (PLA) is a promising biodegradable polyester , however, the brittle nature of PLA restricts its applications. In this study, PLA is reinforced by artificially cultured diatom frustules (DFs) to prepare high-performance and biodegradable polymer composites via melt blending . Interpenetrating structure can be observed between DFs and PLA by scanning electron microscope (SEM) due to the porous nature of diatom. Both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis reveal that well-dispersed DFs can act as a nucleating agent to increase the crystallinity of the α-crystal in PLA, but decrease its cold crystallization temperature ( T cc ). Tensile tests show that both strength and ductility of PLA can be enhanced simultaneously by incorporation of a few percent of DFs. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) indicates that DFs can increase the storage modulus and maintain the glass transition temperature of PLA. Our study illustrates the promise of utilizing artificially cultured diatom frustules as biomass-based reinforcing fillers for preparing high-performance fully-biodegraded polymeric materials for green and sustainable applications.},

However, since the thermodynamic instability of nanoscale bubbles causes lower nucleation density and cells rupture, developing a green and cost-effective method for fabricating high porosity NPFs remains a challenge. Hence, we proposed a novel method for fabricating high porosity NPFs based the design of materials system and foaming process, and the NPFs with a porosity of over 70\%, an average cell size of 287 nm, and a nucleation density of over 10 14 /cm 3 were obtained. Firstly, based on the excellent compatibility between poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), homogeneous PMMA/PVDF blends were prepared by melt compounding. Then, the PMMA/(PVDF-microcrystals) system was formed by self-assembly through CO 2 induced crystallization. Thanks to numerous homo-dispersed PVDF crystallites&#39; facilitating heterogeneous nucleation and enhancing polymer strength , high porosity NPFs with tailored cellular structures were fabricated by heating foaming. This method provides a simple, flexible, and environmentally friendly way for the preparation of high porosity NPFs.},

Herein, the shot peening (SP)-induced strengthening of high-speed railway axle EA4T alloy or 25CrMo4 steel subjected to foreign object damage (FOD) and the effect of this strengthening on fatigue strength were elucidated using the electron backscattered diffraction, transmission electron microscopy , X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation techniques. An improved backward statistical inference method was employed to construct probabilistic fatigue S-N curves based on the results of high cycle fatigue test and thus derive reliable endurance limits for unFODed and FODed specimens subjected or not subjected to SP treatment. Eventually, El-Haddad model and the Wöhler curve were combined with the modified Miner damage accumulation theory to develop a three-dimensional Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram in the nominal stress framework. The above diagram was shown to well correlate the fatigue damage accumulation and the critical FOD defect size of externally impacted railway axles with knee-point life and fatigue S-N curve slope.},

However, the cyclic softening factor is independent of the strain amplitudes and temperatures. At room temperature, the steady fatigue behavior until 80\% fatigue life was presented, by contrast, great changes were offered below 80\% fatigue life at 630 °C. this is directly related to the microstructure properties during fatigue tests , where dislocation network, wall, and dynamic recovery were formed, resulting from the dislocation movement , interaction, and annihilation. The density of dislocation and intensity of slip is inversely proportional to the temperature.

Changes in the compression stress, creep elongation, melting temperature, melting enthalpy and the average molecular weight between cross-links of the dewatered samples are much more obvious than that of the pristine ones. The possible mechanism was investigated by computational study with analog molecules. It suggests that the absorbed moisture and its radiolysis species (H·/HO·) would consume part of the macromolecular radicals generated by gamma irradiation, which hinders the crosslinking reactions.

A new analytical model is proposed to calculate the twist angle based on the law of conservation of energy . Meanwhile, a novel alternate spiral tool trajectory is established according to the linear interpolation of the two adjacent contour lines . Based on the case studies including pyramid frustum shape with constant wall angle and truncated cone shape with varying wall angle, SPIF formed parts by using the alternate spiral trajectory are compared with that by traditional unidirectional spiral trajectory, to effectively understand the advantages of the developed tool trajectory strategy.

Moreover, improving its properties experimentally could spend a lot of time.

Thus, a new strategy is needed to predict the properties of the superalloys rapidly and accurately. In this study, an accelerated design strategy is applied to find the Co-base superalloys with good properties. Four important properties, which are the existence of γ&#39; and other phases, the γ&#39; solvus temperature and area fraction are predicted based on machine learning-based models. Samples used in this study are experimental data collected from related references and our previous study. Afterwards, four predicting models are integrated to design the superalloys that meet the designing requirements of four properties simultaneously. Finally, six groups are chosen from 363,000 possible candidates and all of six are experimental validated. New Co-base superalloys with high γ&#39; solvus temperature and high γ&#39; area fraction are designed successfully.

  abstract     = {Owing to the extremely low stiffness of elastomeric materials commonly used as substrates of stretchable devices, fabrication of stretchable devices is usually performed with an elastic film attached to a rigid temporary substrate. The problem is that the stress applied to the elastic film during peeling induces a severely large deformation of the film, resulting in performance degradation of the devices formed thereon. To address this, a water-induced, softly peelable, pressure-sensitive adhesive (wisp-PSA) was developed by synthesizing a new amphiphilic oligomer and mixing it with acryl-based PSA. As amphiphilic oligomers facilitate more water uptake in the adhesive layer , hydrogen bonding between the polymers and water molecules weakens the hydrogen bonding in the polymers and to the substrate, resulting in decrease in adhesion. The initial adhesion strength of the wisp-PSA, which reached about 152 N/m, was dramatically dropped to about 8 N/m after immersing in water. Through the use of wisp-PSA, polyurethane film with Ag nanowires formed thereon could be safely peeled, without damage, from the glass after immersion in warm water. Furthermore, the adhesion strength lowered by the water treatment was almost restored when the water absorbed by the oligomer was dried, revealing that the developed wisp-PSA is reusable.},

In this paper, we proposed a conceptually new idea to address this problem simply by tapering the thickness of the electrode material film. The resulting thickness-gradient electrode exhibits considerable enhancement in the electrochemical performances including capacity, capacity retention, energy density , Coulombic efficiency, and rate capability in comparison to the traditional counterparts with uniform thickness. Such enhancement in the electrochemical performance can be attributed to the lessening of the stress concentration on the interface between the electrode film and the current collector upon the volume change of Si taking place in the lithiation and delithiation process. To make the best use of this strategy, the optimal design of the gradient thickness is proposed based on the theory of stress homogenization , followed by the experimental verification. The results of this paper provide a facile, cost-effective, and scalable way for enhancing the performance of Si-based anodes for LIBs.

The microstructure analyses indicated that minor addition of rare earth element La (500 ppm) not only can achieve the α-Al grain refinement, but also can modify the Al 13 Fe 4 intermetallic phase. The test results of tensile and electrical properties indicated that minor La addition can concurrently enhance the yield strength , ultimate tensile strength , elongation as well as the electrical conductivity of Al-Fe alloys. The improvements of strength, ductility and electrical conductivity are mainly ascribed to the α-Al grain refinement, the modification of Al 13 Fe 4 intermetallic phase and the reduction of the solubility of Fe and Si elements in α-Al, respectively.

  abstract     = {A reflection upon the recent developments of semisolid rheoforming techniques of magnesium (Mg) alloys is vital for successfully shaping the future landscape of lightweight and high-performance metal materials. In our paper, formation mechanisms of non-dendritic structure were firstly reviewed, and slurry preparation methods as well as rheoforming processes of Mg alloys were then summarized. Afterwards, microstructures and mechanical properties of semisolid Mg alloys were elaborated. The various formation mechanisms of non-dendritic structures provide theoretical bases for understanding the microstructure evolution of semisolid metal slurries. Despite the abundant slurry preparation methods to date, inexpensive industrial solutions for producing high-quality Mg alloy slurries are still scarce, which is constituting one of many key challenges in the future. In the case of rheoforming processes, high pressure die casting (HPDC) and squeeze casting are the most promising processes for mass production of semisolid Mg alloys. At present, researches on semisolid Mg alloys are mainly focused on AZ and AM series alloys . To develop high-performance semisolid Mg alloys, the slurry preparation and rheoforming technology of Mg-RE alloys are worthy of further investigation.},

In this study, five sets of experiments with different joining temperatures were designed to figure out the formation mechanisms of defects. The joining temperature (T J ) histories were measured with K-type thermocouple inserted in the lap interface. Macro−/micro-scale defects in TC4/UHMWPE joints were analyzed. Numerical simulation was carried out to study the temperature distribution during joining and gap formation during cooling. Micro−/nano-scale interfacial bonding was characterized using scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Then, the formation mechanisms of defects were better understood. Macro-scale defects were shown as insufficient filling and bubbles. Insufficient filling is linearly related to the T J which can be alleviated by applying higher T J . However, when the T J is &gt;385 °C, large bubbles appear due to excessive and fast thermal degradation of UHMWPE. Meanwhile, micro-scale defect, appearing as continuous gaps caused by the shrinkage of polymer can be avoided by enhancing the micro-scale interfacial bonding.},

The primary cause of this characteristic microstructure is rapid, localized heating and cooling cycles, which result in extreme thermal gradients where material solidification is followed by fast cooling in the solid state. The final microstructure and mechanical performance are also influenced by pore formation caused by melt pool fluid dynamics . Here, we use high speed, in situ X-ray diffraction to probe the kinetics of cooling and solid-solid phase transitions after laser melting in two aerospace titanium alloys : Ti-6Al-4V, an α + β alloy ; and Ti-5Al-5V-5Mo-3Cr, a near-β alloy. We complement these diffraction studies with in situ X-ray imaging to probe melt pool dynamics and pore formation. From these two complementary probes, we quantify pore formation during melting and the subsequent microstructural evolution as the material rapidly cools after solidification. These results are critical for understanding defect formation and residual stress development in different titanium alloys under LPBF conditions and can help inform process models to predict final part performance.},

  abstract     = {Laser spot welding method was employed to fabricate Al Si coated press-hardened steel (PHS) joints in overlapped configuration. Al and Si segregate at the notch root of a laser spot weld of Al Si coated PHS resulting in pre-mature cracking and weakening of the joint strength . The thickness-oriented δ-ferrite strips induced by the Al and Si segregation was mainly responsible for the mechanical deterioration though the dispersive δ-ferrite in the fusion zone also contributes. A supplemental annular stirring with beam oscillation is proposed to break up the segregation. With the annular stirring, the lap-shear peak load and energy absorption increased 57\% and 80\% respectively, which is attributed to the removal of δ-ferrite strips and the reduction in the fraction of dispersive δ-ferrite. Thermo-fluid numerical simulations suggest that the annular stirring promoted the melt flow and extended the duration of the melt pool, which accelerated and prolonged the diffusion of Al and Si atoms into the fusion zone, thus preventing the segregation of Al and Si and formation of δ-ferrite strips. Meanwhile, the prolonged melt flow pulled additional dissolved Al onto the molten pool surface forming the Al oxide film , resulting in further reduction of Al content and fraction of dispersive δ-ferrite.},

To investigate the local growth morphology, phase-field simulations were performed to examine the effect of grain misorientation on the previously built layer with respect to the thermal gradient direction. Furthermore, the solidification of partially melted microstructures observed during the EBSD measurements was simulated under the rapid solidification conditions. The obtained results revealed that the growth morphology of alloy grains during solidification strongly depended on the misorientation angle of the previously built layer measured with respect to the local thermal gradient direction. The simulated microstructures were in good agreement with the experimentally observed alloy morphology, which indicated that the utilized phase-field method could be potentially used in quantitative microstructural modeling.},

If the top layer was a PMMA film, a hard substrate (such as steel) reduced its scratch resistance and puncture occurred after material removal. Compared with a two-layer PMMA/PMMA system (without glue), the critical loads for scratch damage to a PMMA/glue/PMMA system were reduced under linearly increasing normal load scratch tests.

The results show that Chl a molecules assembled in SR nano-ring retain their native structure, and an increase of loading amount (up to ~26 pigment molecules per protein nano-ring) with the equilibrium concentration of Chl a upon dialysis has been observed. It is further seen that the nanoscale organization of Chl a in SR leads to a significant quenching of Chl a fluorescence, especially at high loadings. Moreover, the photostability of Chl a encapsulated in SR is significantly enhanced in comparison with free Chl a , as evidenced by an up to 6-fold increase of its half-life time. Both the interaction of Chl a with SR and the interaction between Chl a molecules contribute to photostability. Finally, it is shown that the Chl a -SR complex has good photoreduction activity as well as photoelectrochemical activity under visible light illumination. The maximum photoelectric conversion efficiency of the Chl a -SR-sensitized solar cells is around 1.09\%. The strategy presented herein is believed to be instrumental in the design of effective photoenergy conversion materials.},

In this study, we fabricated auxetic scaffolds using fish gelatin methacrylamide and evaluated the effects of cyclic tensile stimulation effects on the neural differentiation capabilities of human Schwann cells. The auxetic hydrogels were found to withstand up to 20\% tensile strain without tears, and the hydrogels had lost only about 10\% weight after immersed for 14 days. The tensile forces were able to enhance cell viability and proliferation as compared to a static culture. In addition, the secretion of neural regeneration-related proteins was enhanced in the tensile stimulation group. The cell-laden auxetic scaffold with tensile stimulation caused improvement in the nerve growth factor and TRKA receptor expression. This is the first study to combine tensile stimulation with NGF. The initial results showed the positive potential of such conditions being applied in clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {In multi-pass welding, there is increasing motivation to move towards in-process defect detection to enable real-time repair; thus avoiding deposition of more layers over a defective weld pass. All defect detection techniques require a consistent and repeatable approach to calibration to ensure that measured defect sizing is accurate. Conventional approaches to calibration employ fixed test blocks with known defect sizes , however, this methodology can lead to incorrect sizing when considering complex geometries, materials with challenging microstructure, and the significant thermal gradients present in materials during the inter-pass inspection period. To circumvent these challenges, the authors present a novel approach to calibration and introduce the concept of in-process calibration applied to ultrasonic Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). The new concept is centred around the manufacturing of a second duplication sample, containing intentionally-embedded tungsten inclusions, with identical process parameters as the main sample. Both samples are then inspected using a high-temperature robotic NDT process to allow direct comparative measurements to be established between the real part and the calibration sample. It is demonstrated that in-process weld defect detection using the in-process calibration technique can more reliably identify defects in samples which would otherwise pass the acceptance test using a traditional calibration.},

Specially, the polydopamine as photothermal components, titanium dioxide and perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane as superhydrophobic/superoleophilic source are introduced into the melamine-formaldehyde sponge by deposition method . To be applicable in the marine environments with winds and waves, the bottom side of this sponge subjected to UV irradiation is transferrable from superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity. The Janus sponge can keep the balance of movement and never overturned under the action of wind force, thereby enabling this sponge to absorb consecutively spilled heavy oil from marine system. With one simulated solar irradiation , the top and bottom of Janus sponge are heated to a suitable temperature of 90.7 and 70.2 °C, respectively. Relied on these advantages, the Janus sponge can effectively reduce the viscosity of spilled heavy oil and enhance its fluidity, which allow for quick heavy oil absorption up to nearly 12 times of own weight.

For the best parameter combination, 160 o C for auxiliary heating temperature and 0 degree for raster angle, the warpage was completely suppressed and the tensile strength got 31\% enhancement, ductility got 439\% enhancement compared to the FDM part without auxiliary heating and 0 degree in raster angle. Cyclic fatigue behavior and anisotropy of CF/ABS specimen was also significantly improved by auxiliary heating treatment. The reduced stain caused by the annealing ability of auxiliary heating during the 3D printing, is responsible for this enhancement. Compared with auxiliary heating and post thermal annealing treatment, the tensile property and cyclic fatigue behavior of CF/ABS specimen was equivalent. Notably, auxiliary heating is the “in-situ” annealing during the process of 3D printing, which can break through the existing dimension constraints of post thermal annealing treatment. Therefore, the approach broadens the design for CF/ABS composites through temperature-specific optimization and makes it possible to fabricate huge-size FDM parts.},

  abstract     = {Two-photon lithography (TPL) enables the fabrication of metamaterials exhibiting unprecedented mechanical performance. Such lattice structures consist of micron-scale geometric features and are designed to achieve their envisioned properties through stretching and bending of individual trusses. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive study of the effect of temperature and strain rate on the mechanical properties of micron-sized 3D printed polymers made by TPL using Nanoscribe’s negative tone photoresist IP-Dip. A strong strain rate dependency was identified for the yield strength, which increased fourfold in compression from 68 MPa to 230 MPa as the strain rate was raised from 7e−4 s −1 to 600 s −1 . This trend was also seen in tension. The elastic modulus was found to increase with strain rate in the quasistatic regime but was constant at 3.2 GPa for strain rates of 0.7 s −1 and above. Even slightly elevated temperatures of 80°C led to a significant drop in the yield strength and elastic modulus, though the observed reduction was less severe at higher strain rates. Further, a model based on the strain rate-temperature superposition principle is reported that allows the extrapolation of the mechanical properties even beyond the conditions tested here.},

We show that Re can be replaced by other elements without losing creep strength . To come to this conclusion one has to consider both, alloy composition and microstructure. We analyze the mechanical, microstructural and chemical results (creep rates, γʼ-volume fractions, average γʼ-particle sizes, average γ-channel widths and the chemistry of γ- and γʼ-phases) obtained for ERBO/15 and its two leaner variants (less Mo: ERBO/15-Mo and less W: ERBO/15-W). ERBO/15-Mo and ERBO/15-W show higher creep rates than ERBO/15, because they exhibit lower Mo and W concentrations in the γ-channels. This results in higher diffusion rates, accelerated rafting and faster dislocation climb at γ/γʼ-interfaces.},

Superhydrophobic or superamphiphobic surfaces have been widely fabricated. Less attention has been paid to such modifications on wood and the changes of its hygroscopic or solvoscopic properties. In this work, wood veneers were surface modified by hydrophobized silicone nanofilaments. Results revealed that the surface-modified wood showed a superamphiphobic behavior, i.e. it repelled water, ethylene glycol and hexadecane with contact angles greater than 150° and roll-off angles of less than 10°. Most importantly, a plastron effect was observed when the surface-modified wood was submerged in water, ethylene glycol or hexadecane, which reduced the liquid sorption rate and extent to various degrees. By comparing the measured permeabilities and the estimated diffusive mass flux and supported by Hansen solubility parameters and the degrees of swelling, it is concluded that diffusion is the major cause for the liquid uptake in the surface-modified wood. Moreover, the interaction between the liquid and the modified layer (the solubility of the liquid in the modified layer) also needs to be considered, especially in hexadecane.},

In order to generate the specific structural behavior it is of utmost importance to understand the response of the unit cells when different load conditions are considered. In this article the mechanical response of diamond based cellular structures has been investigated focusing on the impact of geometrical inaccuracy generated by the manufacturing process on the elastic anisotropy of the mentioned unit cell. The μ -CT analysis of the structures shows that the manufacturing deviations occur in certain orientations that depend highly on the building direction and proximity to nodes. The measured imperfection types were implemented in a finite element model in order to predict their single and combined effects in the elastic directional response. The results indicate that the L-PBF process can induce a significant change of elastic anisotropy in the diamond unit cells, including a substantial variation of the optimal orientation for minimal compliance. Methods are presented to calculate this anisotropy such that it can be taken into account when designing and using such lattice structures in real-life applications with multi-axial load conditions.},

DNN-2D is designed to estimate biaxial stress-strain curves from a digital image of {111} pole figure, while DNN-3D estimates the curves from a 3D image of the texture. The two DNNs were trained using synthetic texture datasets and the corresponding biaxial stress-strain curves obtained from crystal plasticity-based numerical biaxial tensile tests . The accuracy of the two trained DNNs was examined by comparing the results from that of the numerical biaxial tensile tests. It was observed that both the DNNs could estimate biaxial stress-strain curves with high accuracy. Though DNN-3D provides with a better estimation than DNN-2D, it displays lower computational efficiency. Thus, the two DNNs and their training procedures offer a new and efficient method to provide virtual data for material modeling.},

Therefore an innovative inductor design , which allows a controlled sample cooling is presented. Supported by dilatometric studies as well as different heat treatment strategies, limitations are identified to gain a profund process understanding. Hereby an accelerated bainite formation after short time austenitization is detected. By using different heat treatment strategies, the fraction of the bainitic phase can be adjusted in the surface of the part made of AISI 4140. The results of this innovative heat treatment method are compared to short time inductive hardening and tempering processes regarding microstructure, hardness and residual stresses.

The model is applied to SLM of a Zr-based BMG and it is shown that the transient effects, accounted for by the model, reduce the nucleation rate by up to 15 orders of magnitude below the steady-state nucleation rate on cooling, resulting in less nuclei during the build process. The capability of the proposed modelling approach is demonstrated by comparing the resulting crystalline volume fraction to experimental findings. The agreement between model predictions and the experimental results clearly suggests that transient nucleation effects must be accounted for when considering the crystallization rate during SLM processing of BMGs.},

Further, implications in employing classical laminate mechanics for characterizing the mechanical behavior of printed parts are discussed in detail. Mechanical testing on printed test coupons revealed that build orientation significantly influenced the final properties, with properties being especially poor in parts built with upright orientation. Further, the overall performance of parts made of composite material is lower than that of polymeric parts . Finally, mechanical performance of 3D printed functional part was assessed to demonstrate the influence of printing strategy on its final material behavior under actual loading scenario.

Fish collagen (FC) is currently considered an alternative scaffold to mammalian collagen (MC) due to its safety, accessibility, lower price, and similar biological properties compared to those of MC. Here, we developed bilayer FC-based composite scaffolds with different components and pore sizes to modulate the differentiation fate of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs): chondroitin sulfate-incorporated FC scaffolds (FC-CS) with small pores (approximately 128 μm) as the top layer and hydroxyapatite-incorporated FC scaffolds (FC-HA) with larger pores (approximately 326 μm) as the bottom layer. Both the FC-CS and FC-HA scaffolds possessed good cytocompatibility, excellent water absorption, suitable biodegradability and high cell seeding efficiency. The in vitro results indicated that FC-CS and FC-HA promote chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of BMSCs, respectively, as validated by gene expression and histological examination. Furthermore, compared to the empty group in a rabbit OCD model, the bilayer scaffold significantly induced simultaneous regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone after 6 and 12 weeks of implantation, which was confirmed by gross, histological, and microcomputed tomography images. Our findings demonstrated that the FC-based bilayer scaffold is a promising scaffold for the repair of OCD.},

  abstract     = {The effects of a bimodal microstructure and porosity on the elastic modulus and yield strength of a Ti-13Ta-12Sn alloy foam was analyzed. In order to obtain a bimodal microstructure, the powder metallurgy approach was used, with the amount of Sn being chosen depending on a thermodynamic analysis, so that there could be a bcc solid solution after the consolidation process . The foams were obtained using an ammonium carbonate space holder (30, 40 and 50 v /v\% porosity). Foams with a bimodal microstructure were synthetized by mixing 50 wt\% of milled powder (at 50 h) + 50 wt\% unmilled powder, while foam without a bimodal microstructure were synthetized using only milled powders. The elastic modulus and compression yield strength were experimentally measured and compared with estimations given by the Gibson-Ashby model and finite element analysis . The foams with a bimodal microstructure have shown a higher compression strength (over 70 MPa more) than the samples without bimodal microstructure, for all of the porosity values. The samples with bimodal microstructures, as well as 30, 40 and 50\% porosity, have an elastic modulus smaller than 30 GPa and a yield strength over 120 MPa, therefore, having a great potential to be explored for biomedical applications .},

  abstract     = {Fracture mechanics and form-structure-function relationships were studied in the hierarchically structured endocarp of the coconut ( Cocos nucifera ). We mechanically tested various endocarp sample types: (1) whole endocarp; (2) arch-shaped samples prepared from the endocarp in either an equatorial or a meridional orientation; (3) small endocarp samples. The last-mentioned were tested either in their naturally grown state or with both surfaces ground coplanarly. Samples were either compression- or impact-loaded in various orientations and/or diverse setup configurations (constrained vs. un-constrained). The results establish (1) that the orientation of the whole endocarp has no significant effect on the fracture force, (2) that the orientation of arch-shaped samples affects fracture behaviour , whereas (3) test velocity does not and (4) that the compressive strength of rectangular samples is highest when applied normal to the endocarp surface. Thus, on a comparatively small scale, the endocarp is a transversely isotropic material , whereas on a larger scale, the ellipsoidal shape of the coconut compensates for weaknesses introduced by the main vascular bundles. Coconut shells are therefore good examples of the way in which potential disadvantages that concern stability and that arise from biological necessities and evolutionary constraints can be counteracted by clever material arrangements and designs.},

  abstract     = {As a kind of green renewable resource from trees, wood has abundant porous structure , which makes it have great potential in the field of energy storage. However, poor conductivity and limited energy storage capacity hinder the application of wood in the field of energy storage. Here, a novel carbonization lignin-free wood (CLFW)@Co-CoS hybrid is designed and fabricated by a combination of vacuum filtration and carbonization. The CLFW@Co-CoS hybrid assembled into wood-based supercapacitor presents a high areal energy density of 610 μWh cm −2 , meanwhile maintaining a high areal power density of 192 mW cm −2 . There are two main reasons for the excellent capacitance characteristics: one thing is that wood has a natural and abundant porous structure, which provides more space and channels for the storage and transport of electrolyte ions . The other thing is that CoS and Co can provide high capacitance, and numerous new pores are created by the interweaving of CoS nanofibers with flower-like structure. Additionally, Co nanoparticles attached to CoS and wood have more active sites, which endows the hybrid with excellent ORR properties. Thus, this bifunctional material with excellent electrochemical performance and outstanding ORR properties has huge potential in the field of energy storage and catalysis.},

Scheelite-structured Li(Gd,Y)F 4 :Yb,Er core UCNPs are synthesized, followed by the formation of a Nd 3+ -doped active shell and inert shell, and the novel Li(Gd,Y)F 4 :Yb,Er/LiYF 4 :Nd,Yb/LiGdF 4 CSS UCNPs are applied to liver cancer cell-targeted upconversion luminescence imaging. X-ray diffraction and electron energy loss spectroscopy confirm that single tetragonal phase scheelite-structured CSS UCNPs are successfully synthesized. Because of the formation of the active shell and inert shell on the core, CSS UCNPs display bright green light under both 800 and 980 nm excitations. In particular, the synthesized CSS UCNPs exhibit a high absolute upconversion quantum yield of 0.15\% under 800 nm excitation. For liver cancer cell targeting, free amine and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-introduced glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) (GA-PEG-NH 2 ) is synthesized, and the GA-PEG-NH 2 is conjugated with the CSS UCNPs, whose surface was modified with poly(acrylic acid sodium salt).

Particularly, a modified kinematic hardening rule considering loading-dependent effect is developed to simulate the stress relaxation behavior during hold periods. Then, creep-fatigue assessment based on interaction diagram is quantitatively determined by the strain energy density exhaustion (SEDE) approach. In order to elucidate damage mechanisms under various loading conditions, the characterization of damage mechanism is observed from the post-test examination. Main-crack-failure modes from fracture appearance observations and cracking modes from longitudinal sections are studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), respectively.

Adaptive sampling methods can effectively reduce the number of samples and enhance the accuracy of the surrogate model. However, from the perspective of optimization, most adaptive sampling methods ignore the inevitable connection between the optimization process and the establishment of a surrogate model. The efficiency and accuracy of existing adaptive sampling methods are poor. In this paper, a novel adaptive sampling method is proposed based on the complex method (CM). In the proposed method, the samples are used not only to establish the surrogate model but also to form complex shapes to guide the optimization search. An iterative process is added to collect new samples to improve the accuracy of the surrogate model. The proposed method is compared with three classic adaptive methods with several benchmark functions. The comparison results indicate that the proposed method can obtain a global optimum with low computational burden and a small sample. Finally, the optimum design of an electric vehicle battery pack is presented to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

Varying the cell size and wall thickness of TPU honeycombs facilitates changes in stiffness magnitude, though affords only modest capacity to alter the shape of the stress-strain curve. 3D printing facilitates advanced design exploration, beyond that of straight walls. Origami fold patterns have demonstrated the ability to influence the buckling behavior of tubular structures. Here we demonstrate the incorporation of origami folds into square honeycombs. The fold parameters facilitate significant tailoring of the stress-strain curve, allowing a range of profiles from quasi-rectangular to quasi-linear to be achieved; such structures can find applications in situation-specific energy absorption scenarios.},

To evaluate the performances of the membrane actuators, we monitored changes in the properties of the MREs in terms of the crosslinking degree in their polymeric matrices . The microstructure, curing behavior, magnetic properties , and mechanical properties of MREs were measured using a scanning electron microscope , vibrating sample magnetometer , rheometer , uniaxial tensile testing system. Deflection of the membrane actuators was measured using a custom-designed deflection system. The saturation magnetization ( M s ) and remanence ( B r ) of MREs decreased as the crosslinking degree of matrices increased. Their elastic moduli ( E ) also decreased as the crosslinking degree increased. Meanwhile, in case of integrated analysis, an anisotropic sample with an initial curing time of five minutes exhibited the largest actual deflection, although the particles were aligned with the magnetic fields after crosslinking of 6.01\% was achieved. By identifying the relationship between the properties of MREs and the crosslinking degree in its polymeric matrix, the MREs used to fabricate membrane actuators can be tailored for specific applications: pumps, valves, microlenses, and cell stimulators .},

In a near-field EMI attenuation measurement by a microstrip line method, composite films with a CNT fraction higher than 2 wt\% showed a high attenuation that exceeded 50 dB at 10 GHz. This high attenuation was due to the enhanced magnetic anisotropy of the oriented CNTs and the encapsulated catalyst-derived cementite nanoparticles . This is the first report of high magnetic anisotropy in an oriented CNT structure for noise attenuation in a transmission line. In a far-field EMI shielding measurement by a coaxial tube method, the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) significantly increased as the number of CNT web layers increased.

Nanoparticles with diameter of about 4.5 nm were specifically deposited at the interface between Cu and Ni laminates by forced agglomeration of magnetron sputtered ions using a Mantis Ltd. Nanogen50 nanoparticle generator and the hardness of these films were measured using the nanoindentation technique. Cu/Ni laminates without W nanoparticles have an average modulus value of approximately 120 ± 3.7 GPa and hardness value of 2.23 ± 0.07 GPa, while the hardness values of the particle-containing films are greater, regardless of particle density. The areas with the lowest particle density at the interfaces (0.9 at.\% W) show the greatest increase in hardness, with an increase of about 1.3 GPa greater than the particle-free sample. However, as the particle density increases, there is a corresponding decrease in hardness. In-situ x-ray diffraction of these films was also conducted to observe the annealing behavior of these films. For all samples, the Cu and Ni layered structure remained intact; however, there is evidence of Ni diffusion along grain boundaries and interaction with the oxygen, likely creating NiO. After annealing, a significant number of the W nanoparticles dissolved into the Ni matrix to create NiW solid-solution. The ability to deposit particles with such precise control has the potential to open up an exciting new field of research.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an analytical investigation based on thermodynamic simulation aimed at achieving a holistic management of the phase assemblages of alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and gaining insights into the designing of precursors. Gibbs free energy minimization method was conducted on AAMs spanning the compositional envelopes at (metastable) thermodynamic equilibrium . The stability regions and quantities of simulated phases were identified in the SiO 2 -CaO-Al 2 O 3 ternary contour diagrams, yielding the overall relationships between the chemical components of precursors, phase assemblages and pH in pore solution . The analytical results are in good agreement with the available experimental observations that the main precipitation regions of C-(N-)A-S-H appear at CaO/SiO 2 = ~1.0 and relatively low Al regions while N-A-S-H phases generally dominate the Ca-deficient regions of the contour diagrams. Strätlingite mainly occurs at intermediate levels of Si, Al and Ca. Katoite and AFm phases form at Al 2 O 3 /CaO = ~3.0 under Si-deficient conditions. The findings also suggest the precipitation regions of a product may span a range of pH of aqueous solution, making it possible to simultaneously control pH and maintain the precipitation amount of the phase. The application of this work in designing precursors can achieve a more precise control of the phase assemblages for AAMs.},

  abstract     = {Development of multicomponent alloys, popularly known as high entropy alloys (HEAs) provides abundant compositional space for designing a variety of HEAs, including equiatomic, dual phase and microstructurally flexible (MF-HEAs). Among them, the design of MF-HEAs further extends the HEA domain in terms of understanding adaptive phase evolution with respect to change in alloy chemistry and processing parameters. This responsive phase evolution enabled near single phase ε (h.c.p., 95\%) or γ (f.c.c., 90\%) dominant microstructures, depending on imposed processing strain, strain rate and temperature for a selected alloy chemistry. The γ-phase dominated HEAs showed slower yet sustained work hardening (WH) rates (~ 2000 MPa) owing to transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect whereas ε-phase dominated microstructure showed exceptionally high and sustained work hardening rates (2300–2700 MPa) due to formation of nano plates or twins in ε-phase upon deformation. Therefore, MF-HEA design leads to exceptional strength–ductility synergy (1100-1250 MPa, 30-43\%) irrespective of the dominance of either γ- or ε-phase in the starting microstructure owing to selective operation of deformation mechanisms in the dominant phase.},

Integration of this device in the LATP process would remove gap and overlap manufacturing defects in variable angle tow (VAT) laminates and complex curvature components. During trials different width tapes were produced using the novel spreading device. Three different width increases were investigated, viz. 15\%, 30\% and 45\%, and were compared with as-received tape. Initial trials indicate that it is possible to achieve a tape width increase of 62\%. Preliminary characterisation tests show that the spreading process does not adversely affect the properties of the tapes. Physical properties including cross-sectional area, fibre volume fraction and void content remain similar to as-received tape. Furthermore, differential scanning calorimetry data show that levels of crystallinity increase due to spreading, improving related mechanical properties .},

Besides being homogeneously dissolved into the HEA matrix, Mn also forms oxide particles with oxygen originating from both powder feedstock and printing atmosphere, resulting in an in-situ alloyed, oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) HEA. The tensile strength of the ODS HEA is significantly improved to a yield strength of 620 MPa and a tensile strength of 730 MPa. The tensile ductility of the ODS HEA is lower than the ones prepared by using fully pre-alloyed powders, but an outstanding compression ductility maintains for the ODS HEA. The deforming behaviour of the alloy has been revealed, and the contribution of Orowan strengthening has been quantified along with other mechanisms.

Besides, X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was employed to identify various phases formed during the LPBF process. The results showed that the horizontally printed Ti-rich samples exhibited higher retained austenite (γ) phase and superior values of hardness and tensile strength , while those ones vertically prepared showed an excellent ductility that could bring benefits in high-cycle fatigue applications.

Fully reversed tension-compression fatigue results on miniaturised vertically built and machined samples indicate that as-built and stress relieved specimens exhibit superior fatigue behaviour compared to fully annealed and hot isostatic pressed ones. Fine sub-grained cellular microstructure in as-built and stress relieved samples resulted in high fatigue performance, which was decreased with microstructure coarsening from the high temperature heat treatments. Secondly, a microstructure-based fatigue crack initiation model is adapted for additively manufactured 316L and verified for different material states. The results show that the analytical model depicts a conservative prediction for crack initiation life when compared with experimental results for full fracture. This validation offers the potential to expand the model for other material and process conditions.},

In this paper, a 2-inch anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template with nano/micro hybrid structure was obtained directly through a simple lithography-free aluminum anodization process for the first time. This new nano/micro hybrid structure combines the advantages of sub-100 nm sub-wavelength structure (SWS) and micrometer scaled surface roughening. Aluminum grains were found to rearrange the distribution of the penetrated surface current during the anodization and eventually induced the micrometer scaled fluctuation underneath. The ultra-thin AAO replication scheme was introduced to fabricate and study the spectrum (300 nm to 800 nm) dependent AR performance of the nano/micro hybrid PDMS structure, which obtained an AR enhancement fraction of more than 42\% higher than that of the nano-patterned one. Thin film and GaN based light-emitting diode (LED, 450 nm) models were built and studied. Compared to the flat LED, the AR enhancement of the nano/micro structured one can reach as high as more than 3 folds. These results suggest the nano/micro hybrid structure could be a good alternative for the applications of surface AR structure.},

For this purpose, a monomer mixture containing a crosslinking agent, a hydrophilic monomer, and a photoinitiator were deposited onto polycarbonate substrates. Upon UV irradiation and controlled drying under a vacuum atmosphere, either one-generation or hierarchical two-generation wrinkles were formed. More interestingly, the wrinkle characteristics depend on the crosslinking agent and monomer concentration in the solution so that larger wrinkles were observed in diluted solutions. Equally, the wrinkle period and amplitude also gradually grow by increasing the number of deposited layers. Atomic force microscopy was carried out to finely characterize the wrinkle dimensions as well as their eventual preferential orientation and distribution. Besides, hydrogel surfaces have been evaluated in terms of cytocompatibility, given their potential interest for biomedical applications .},

However, most antifogging surfaces suffer from poor durability and tend to lose the antifogging property in the short term caused by airborne pollutant adsorption or environment weathering (e.g., UV irradiation). To address this issue, a series of zwitterionic and hydroxylated superhydrophilic coatings were prepared and their long-term antifogging properties under harsh conditions were systematically studied, including in a normal laboratory environment, under accelerated pollution test by exposing surfaces to acetic acid steam, and under UV irradiation. The prepared zwitterionic coatings showed significantly improved durability than the hydroxylated surfaces in all the test conditions, attributed to the chemical inertness and stability of the zwitterionic moieties. By incorporating zwitterionic coating and nanoscale roughness together, the longevity of antifogging surfaces can be further greatly improved, and eyeglasses treated with such nanostructured zwitterionic coating kept decent antifogging property even after storage for up to 210 days. The present nanostructured zwitterionic coatings are promising for real-world antifogging applications that can survive practical environmental fouling and weathering.},

This contribution develops material independent dimensionless allometric scaling laws for both single track and contour exposure to enable process-driven design of lattice structures in laser powder bed fusion.

  abstract     = {The microstructures and the distribution of alloying elements in alloy and intermetallic phases forming in a hyper-duplex stainless steel during aging at temperatures in the range of 750°C–1050°C are characterized by Electron probe micro analysis . Due to long aging times of up to 48 h, close-to-equilibrium configurations are obtained over well recrystallized microstructural regions. This allows for validation of computed equilibrium thermodynamics , including the solvus temperature of the σ-phase. During aging below 1050°C primary ferrite is replaced by a fine-grained aggregate of σ-phase and secondary austenite . The replacement of ferrite occurs by a eutectoidal reaction producing microstructural sub-regions with fine lamellar and coarse blocky morphology. In contrast, aging at 1050°C produced continuous rims of σ-phase surrounding primary austenite. At this temperature, the σ-phase, which is compositionally different from the σ-phase from the eutectoidal reaction, probably formed by the preferred nucleation and growth at austenite-ferrite and ferrite-ferrite boundaries. At the lower aging temperatures, χ-phase is observed as a transient precursor of the σ-phase. Temperature-dependent element enrichments and depletions across primary matrix phases and secondary intermetallic phases and secondary austenite shed light on the degree of equilibration in the different microstructural domains. Finally, nano- and microhardness was determined for different phases.},

  abstract     = {This work compares different measurement and analysis protocols of spherical nanoindentation tests performed at different temperatures on a ferritic/martensitic P91 grade steel, in order to derive meaningful indentation stress−strain curves (ISSC) and estimate material parameters such as indentation modulus, yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate tensile strength . Quasi-static multi-cycle and dynamic continuous stiffness measurement indentation using a spherical indenter with a tip radius of 20 μm has been carried out from room temperature to 600 °C in vacuum in a set-up where thermal drift has been minimised by an active surface referencing system and accurate temperature stabilization in the contact area. The methodology used to determine the contact radius is critical to achieve consistent results. The application of different combinations of definitions of contact radius and indentation-induced strain to nanoindentation data obtained by the quasi-static and dynamic measurements reveals that Tabor&#39;s approach combined with a geometrically determined contact radius best represents the ISSC relationship for the P91 characterized. This method is then extended to predict the high temperature tensile properties of the steel from nanoindentation results.},

  abstract     = {Due to its simplicity and low-cost manufacturing, self-patterning has been considered a promising candidate to replace conventional photolithography . However, most solution-based self-patterning methods require toxic materials, lengthy processes and generate extensive material waste, thus hindering eco-friendly and also economic mass production. Therefore, this work presents an expeditious and eco-friendly solution-free self-patterning method to fabricate patterned indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). This faster and simpler two-step process requires within only 10 min to generate the selective wetting and dewetting regions on the dielectrics via a simultaneous stamping and thermal treatment (SST) and then an ultraviolet ozone exposure. As a result, well-defined IGZO patterns were formed without residues. Extremely suppressed lateral and vertical leakage currents were obtained in self-patterned IGZO TFTs by eliminating leakage paths found in non-patterned devices (appx. 10 −11 A versus 10 −5 A, respectively). Furthermore, the recyclability of the surface energy modification stamp (SEMS) used in the proposed SST process was confirmed, as the IGZO patterns and uniform electrical performances remained clear through nine patterning processes using a single SEMS. Overall, the proposed solution-free self-patterning method will contribute to the realization of next-generation printed electronics by enabling their mass production.},

To solve this problem, Fast light Alloys Stamping Technology (FAST) is proposed in this paper, where fast heating is employed. Effects of heating parameters on the formability and post-form strength were studied by tensile tests . Forming of a wing stiffener was performed to validate this new process. Results show that microstructure of TC4 alloy after fast heating was in nonequilibrium state , which could enhance ductility significantly compared with the equilibrium state. When TC4 alloy was first heated to 950 °C with heating rate of 100 °C/s and then cooled to 700 °C, the elongation at 700 °C was more than 3 times that of a slow heating rate with soaking. Nano-scaled martensite with high dislocation density transformed from β phase was observed under fast heating condition. A complex shaped wing stiffener was successfully formed from TC4 titanium alloy in less than 70 s including heating, transfer and forming, and the post-form strength was almost the same with the initial blank.},

We demonstrate that flat strut connectors offer unprecedented design flexibility for controlling the mechanical performance. By tuning the geometric parameter of flat strut connectors, the stiffness of architected foams can increase about one order of magnitude while the relative density increases only by 5\%. Furthermore, the failure modes can be engineered from a catastrophic one to a progressive one by using weak flat strut connectors.

Initially, homogeneous gelatin solution was initially poured into a tubular mold and underwent a procedure of vacuum freeze-drying to form a three-dimensional porous tubular skeleton. Chitosan was used to loading heparin (Hep) which is a kind of efficient anticoagulant. The Hep-loaded CS composite solution were poured into Gel tubular skeleton, following freeze-drying matched EDC-NHS crosslinking to form Gel@CS-Hep tubular scaffold exhibited a three-dimensional structure and porous morphology. Then, poly(ester-urethane)urea/gelatin (PU75) micro-nano fibers were electrospinning outside the Gel@CS-Hep tube as mechanical reinforcement layer. The Gel@CS-Hep/PU75 tube showed higher hydrophilicity , stable mechanical properties as well as no cytotoxicity on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Importantly, the three-dimensional functional Gel@CS-Hep/PU75 tubular scaffold shows a good rapid endothelialization performance and effective anti-acute coagulation properties. Therefore, the developed Gel@CS-Hep/PU75 tube was proposed to be a potential scaffold for remodeling vascular tissue.},

This study investigates the effect of energy input on porosity and the resulting mechanical properties of polyamide-12 parts. Samples were produced at different lamp speeds, generating varying amount of energy input from a low to a high level. They were then scanned using X-ray Computed Tomography technique, following which they were subject to tensile testing . A strong correlation between energy input, porosity and mechanical properties was found, whereby pore formation was fundamentally caused by insufficient energy input. A greater amount of energy input resulted in a reduced porosity level, which in turn led to improved mechanical properties. The porosity, ultimate tensile strength and elongation achieved were 0.58\%, 42.4 MPa and 10.0\%, respectively, by using the standard parameters. Further increasing the energy input resulted in the lowest porosity of 0.14\% and the highest ultimate tensile strength and elongation of 44.4 MPa and 13.5\%, respectively. Pore morphology, volume, number density and spatial distribution were investigated, which were found to be closely linked with energy input and mechanical properties.},

This research has gained an in-depth understanding of the effects of deformation bands and twin-twin interactions on recrystallization, which will potentially lead to improved manufacturing processes and mechanical properties of magnesium alloys. To study their individual effects, the recrystallization mechanisms of the room-temperature (RT)-rolled and liquid-nitrogen-temperature (LNT)-rolled samples during the annealing process were analysed with the quasi-in-situ electron backscatter diffraction method, respectively. It is found that recrystallization mainly occurred in deformation bands in the RT-rolled sample, which enhanced the initially formed texture, due to oriented and inhomogeneous grain growth. However, it is of great interest to see that the recrystallized sites were mainly located around the (10 1 ¯ 1¯ 2)-(01 1 ¯ 1¯ 2) twin-twin interactions with high kernel average misorientation (KAM) values in the LNT-rolled samples, resulting in rather weaker texture, finer grain size and more homogeneous microstructure, because of the randomized orientations of recrystallized grains and uniform grain growth, while almost no recrystallization was observed around the single tension twin variant.},

However, the characterization and modelling of the stress-strain hysteresis responses of MRG has not been reported in the past, which are fundamental steps towards engineering applications . In this study, the stress-strain hysteresis of polyurethane based MRG sample with 60\% carbonyl iron particle weight fraction was characterized under sinusoidal shear excitations with broad ranges of strain amplitude (5\%–100\%), excitation frequency (0.1 Hz–2 Hz) and magnetic fields (0–0.91 T). Significant stress overshooting phenomenon were observed under the application of low magnetic fields (0.27 T). A structurally-simple and accurate phenomenological model has been established to capture this unique nonlinearity. By validating the experimental results, the proposed model accurately predicts the hysteretic behaviour and the overshoot of the MRG under the excitation scenarios and the magnetic fields considered. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) was implemented to provide the solution to the model generalization. The SVM-assisted model showed good agreement with the experimental data and can benefit the efficiency and viability in developing controllable MRG-based devices and system.},

The molecular weights , thermophysical, dihedral angle of the molecules, fractional free volume, d-spacing, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, and gas separation performance were studied through a combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. These polymers show high molecular weights, with number-average molecular weights (M n ) in the range of 5.0–15.3 × 10 4 , and excellent thermal stability, with weight loss temperatures (T 5\% ) of over 420 °C. The pure-gas (O 2 , N 2 , CO 2 , and CH 4 ) permeation results indicated that the four polymers selectivity of CO 2 /CH 4 over 31 and that 6FDA-F had the highest gas permeability among the four tested gases. Importantly, the dihedral angle from molecular simulation was used to clarify the phenomenon wherein the 6FDA-P gas permeability lower than 6FDA-F. A detailed analysis indicates that -CH 3 increased the gas permeability of the polyimides, while the turnstile-like rotary thermal motion of -OCH 3 formed channel obstacles and improved the gas selectivity. The polymers containing pyridine ring and those containing benzene ring follows different gas separation mechanisms, based on the gas solution-diffusion behaviour.},

In this study, an optimization method for the multi-component epoxy resin system was put forward by using molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning methods. An optimized high- performance epoxy resin system considered Young&#39;s modulus (E), Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS), Elongation (δ), and the glass transition temperature (Tg) together was designed by using the proposed method. The influence of each component proportion on mechanical properties can also be obtained automatically. It was found that 4,4′-Diaminodiphenyl Sulfone (DDS) was a better curing agent to improve Tg, E, and δ, compared with Dicyandiamide (DICY). Tetraglycidyl Diamino Diphenylmethane (TGDDM) could ensure high Tg, E and UTS, but the system still needed some Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA) to improve toughness. The toughening agent Polyether Sulfone (PES) improved the toughness of the epoxy resin system significantly. The presented method could be extended to other resin system composition optimization.},

  abstract     = {The corrosion behavior and discharge performance of a die-cast (DC) Mg-9Al-1Zn (AZ91D) alloy in 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution were investigated by means of immersion and electrochemical measurements in comparison with a hot-rolled (HR) AZ91D. The results indicated that the DC AZ91D had a low corrosion rate (0.10 ± 0.01 mm y −1 ), and superior discharge performance as an anode assembled in Mg-air batteries, especially at low discharge current densities. The anodic efficiency of the DC AZ91D reached 53.47\% and 57.72\% at 1 and 2.5 mA cm −2 , respectively, which were significantly higher than that of many other Mg-based anodes. This efficiency enhancement could mainly be attributed to the uniform microstructure of the DC AZ91D with a continuous β phase network and fine matrix grains, which could produce a more protective corrosion product film. Such a uniform microstructure together with a protective product film can suppress self-corrosion and hinder the detachment of the undermined metallic pieces or the second phase particles from the substrate. Therefore, the DC AZ91D might be developed into an appropriate low cost and highly corrosion-resistant anode with superior discharge performance for Mg-air battery.},

Interestingly, the photocatalytic activity of amorphous Fe 2 TiO 5 /C is distinctly superior to those of its crystalline counterparts without C and P25 (43-fold increase and 12-fold increase, respectively), which is mainly attributed to the incorporation of C (8.17 wt\%) and amorphous Fe 2 TiO 5 with a hollow spherical structure and a high BET surface area of 195.5 m 2 /g.

  abstract     = {Effective thermal management is an important issue to ensure safety and performance of lithium-ion batteries. Fast heat removal is highly desired but has been obstructed by the high thermal resistance across cathode/electrolyte interface. In this study, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are used as the vibrational mediator to tune interfacial thermal conductance between an electrode, lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), and a solid state electrolyte , polyethylene oxide (PEO). Embedded at the LCO/PEO interface, SAMs are specially designed to form hierarchical hydrogen-bond (H-bond) network with PEO. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that all SAM-decorated interfaces show enhanced thermal conductance and dominated by H-bonds types. The incorporation of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) SAM drastically enhances interfacial thermal conductance by approximately 211.69\%, largely due to the formation of a strong H-bond, -COOH···:O, between PAA and PEO. Even with weaker H-bonds such as -OH···:O, it still outperforms the pristine interface as well as interfaces decorated with non-H-bonded SAMs, e.g. PE . Such improvement is attributed to the unique hierarchical H-bond network at the interface, which removes discontinuities in temperature field, straighten SAM chains, make materials strongly adhere, and couple the vibrational modes of materials. The study is expected to guide surface engineering for more effective thermal management in lithium-ion batteries.},

The conventional electrothermal technique is not favorable towards large tuning range because of its reliance on metallic heating elements. The use of metallic heaters could limit the tuning capability due to the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of materials forming the resonator. To solve this drawback, herein, the design, fabrication, and testing of a highly-doped SiC bridge resonator that excludes the use of metallic material as a heating element has been proposed. Instead, free-standing SiC structure functions as the mechanical resonant component as well as the heating element. Through the use of the Joule heating effect , a frequency tuning capability of almost ∆f / f o ≈ 80\% has been demonstrated. The proposed device also exhibited a wide operating frequency range from 72.3 kHz to 14.5 kHz. Our SiC device enables the development of highly sensitive resonant-based sensors, especially in harsh environments.},

The austenite reversion with various charging temperatures was investigated through the thermal simulation experiments. And a two-dimensional representative volume element model was constructed to analyze the crack sensitivity related to microstructures. Compared to cold charging reversion, with the residual austenite in starting microstructure, the kinetics of hot charging reversion is slightly accelerated and the reversion behavior is changed. As the charging temperature increases, the austenite nucleation-growth from pearlite and ferrite grain boundaries are suppressed, while the austenitization through the growth of residual austenite is enhanced. The change of transformation behavior facilitates the formation of ferrite film during reversion through the morphological influence of austenitization modes. With the increasing of charging temperature, the film-like morphology of the evolved ferrite intensifies, especially in the two-phase temperature range. Consequently, the calculated crack sensitivity index rises sharply from 0.0006 to 0.029 when the charging temperature increases from A r 1 to A r 3 temperature, which is agreeable with the statistical production data. Additionally, it was observed that the incomplete γ → α → γ transformation cannot bring an effective austenite grain refining for the present steel.},

We systematically investigated the self-contracting properties to determine the feasibility of the hydrogel to treat wounds and promote wound closure noninvasively. Following elongation, OSGs could be entirely fixed in a temporary shape at 4 °C, and then contracted under infrared irradiation (IR) for shape memory activation near human physiological temperature (38 °C), providing sufficient recovery force (4 kPa) for successful noninvasive wound closure. Additionally, H&amp;E staining revealed that thicker epidermis and dermis layers were achieved upon OSG treatment, confirming that the OSG facilitated tissue reconstruction in an in vivo rabbit model. Moreover, the OSG-treated wounds displayed smoother skin and no visible scarring compared to sutured wounds. Such excellent performance suggests that OSG hydrogel exhibits high potential as an alternative to medical sutures to facilitate noninvasive would closure.},

  abstract     = {The present work provides an analytic solution for the stiffness to crack length relation in microscopic cantilever shaped fracture specimens based on classical beam theory and substitution of the crack by a virtual rotational spring element. The resulting compact relationship allows for accounting of the actual beam geometry and agrees very well with accompanying finite element simulations. Compared with the only other model present in literature the proposed relationship reduces the deviation between model and data to a maximum of 1.6\% from the previous minimum of 15\%. Thus, the novel solution will help to reduce the necessity for individual simulations and aim to increase the comparability of elastic-plastic microcantilever fracture experiments in the future.},

Antimicrobial drug stearyl trimethyl ammoium chloride (STAC) was loaded into the PVA foam for infection control and the CMC surface mesh offers effective hemostatic function. Additionally, the potential of laser photodynamic response of the loaded methylene blue (MB) and its effect in enhancing the wound dressing&#39;s bacterial inhibition has been investigated. The antibacterial drug and laser photodynamic therapy (PDT) were jointly deployed, which demonstrated greater potential in killing both S. aureus and E. coli bacteria strains. In addition, the unique color changing property of MB has enabled real time bacterial infection monitoring of the wound dressing. The multi-layer wound dressing with ideal material combination and unique multifunctionality may be a promising option for wound management in the future healthcare sector.},

An effective online weld-quality inspection technology can promote the industrial application of ultrasonic composite welding. Literature focused on the quality inspection of ultrasonic composite welding is scarce. To address this, the present study proposes an online weld-quality inspection method for ultrasonic composite welding by combining artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with welding process signatures. The failure load in a tensile-shear test and the weld quality level (i.e., under weld, normal weld, and over weld) are predicted simultaneously using artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) models. Eight features consisting of the duration and energy at each welding stage are extracted from the process signatures as independent variables. The results indicate that both the ANN and RF models exhibit high prediction accuracies. The weld quality can be assessed comprehensively and reasonably by considering both the failure load and weld quality level. The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of online weld-quality inspection for ultrasonic composite welding.},

This review paper proposes a critical overview of the current state of 3D printing of natural fibre-reinforced composites or biocomposites for mechanical purposes, as well as an overview of their role in 4D printing for stimuli-responsive applications. The paper is structured as follows: after the first part recalling the specificities of natural fibres and their associated composites, the two main sections are each divided into two parts presenting an analysis of the available data to provide fundamental understandings and a discussion and outlook for the future. Natural discontinuous fibre-reinforced polymers exhibit moderate mechanical properties compared to composites manufactured by conventional processes due to specific factors of the 3D printing process, such as high porosity, low fibre content, and a very low fibre-aspect ratio (L/d). Hygromorph BioComposites (HBC) are categorized into a new class of smart materials that could be used for 4D printing of shape-changing mechanisms. Fibre content, fibre orientation control, and fibre continuity are outlined in relation to known challenges in actuation performance.},

The finite element model is integrated with a rigid-flexible coupled multibody dynamics model which was used to obtain load time histories. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simultaneously attenuating the structural coupled vibration and improving the durability at several structural frequencies. The field structure dynamics stress verification is carried out and vehicle vibration characteristics are obtained under different operated vehicle speed. The measured dynamic stress is found to be in good agreement with the predictions of the mathematical model. Finally, the fatigue life prediction results of the weight-reduced car body structure before and after multidisciplinary optimization are compared and analyzed.

Though some reports have emphasized the importance of time-dependent plastic strain on cold dwell effect in titanium alloys , the mathematical relationship between plastic strain and fatigue life has never been discussed because plastic strain changes continuously no matter in normal cyclic fatigue or dwell fatigue. In this paper, a series of fatigue tests under constant plastic strain is designed to investigate the mathematical relationship between plastic strain and fatigue life in titanium alloys at room temperature in air. Results show that plastic strain has a definitely detrimental effect on fatigue life in titanium alloys. Different from the traditional qualitative mechanisms, one semi-quantitative explanation for cold dwell effect in titanium alloys is proposed by introducing hysteresis energy density .},

Analysis of contour plots provides curves where the mean value of the phases and the bulk value can be read directly. In complex microstructures, this gives access to the predominant mechanical properties facilitating the interpretation of the results. The estimation of the phase fractions by this proposed method is better than the estimation performed with statistical analysis. The estimation of the standard deviation is equivalent to the statistical analysis in most cases; however the difference is large on skewed distributions. The formulation of the objective function for inverse analysis is able to manage large number of indentations, producing elastoplastic parameters with excellent accuracy compared to parameters identified by tensile test .},

Recently, Gd has received much attention as a neutron absorbing material in SNF applications owing to its high neutron absorption capability. Herein, we propose novel Fe Gd alloys as binary alloys and master alloys for potential materials in nuclear applications. Fe Gd alloys with 20, 55 and 80 wt\% Gd were selected based on the Fe Gd phase diagram. All fabricated Fe Gd alloys had higher hardnesses than pure Fe due to the formed Fe Gd phases, and the Fe-rich phase had a higher hardness than the Gd-rich phase. On the other hand, corrosion resistance of the Fe Gd alloys decreased as the Gd content increased. Satisfactory Gd-based intermetallic dispersion and modifying effects were obtained by casting Fe and stainless-steel alloy with Fe 80Gd. The average intermetallic size in the stainless-steel alloy remarkably decreased with a decrease in the average distance between Gd-based intermetallics. Fe Gd alloys possess requisite hardness, thermal conductivity , and corrosion resistance as well as dispersion ability of intermetallics; hence, they show potential as promising candidates for SNF applications.},

Reversible adhesion was achieved by switching magnetic fields. Theories and simulations show that geometric size, magnetic field strength, and content of the filling particles all significantly affect the magnet-induced deformation and the enhanced adhesion.

A cohesive model taking into account the traction-separation constitutive response was employed to capture the delamination behavior between the composite plies . The elastoplastic model was utilized to characterize the sleeve&#39;s deformation behavior . Numerical simulations of different installation modes are performed and compared with experiments. The inserting load, damage modes and damage positions predicted by the proposed model agree well with the experimental results.

Cross-linking dramatically changed the optical properties of SAPs: it triggered new absorption/fluorescence bands in the visible spectral range , which are attributed to charge transfer between peptide chains. Genipin cross-linking, fitted for different classes of SAPs, could be a powerful tool to obtain biomimetic SAP scaffolds with tunable stiffness and thermostability. Lastly, because of the changed absorption/emission properties and relaxation kinetics of cross-linked SAPs, genipin cross-linking may bestow novel optical properties to several well-known lysine-containing SAPs, with intriguing potential for biomedical imaging, photonics and optoelectronics .},

The buckling plateau stress of the two combined honeycombs were almost equal, and approximately 1.5–2 times of their quasi-static values. Besides, a dimensionally consistent empirical formula was proposed to describe the effects of the honeycomb density and strain rate on the plateau stresses. It concluded that the energy absorption capacity was highest in the 90°-layered honeycombs and lowest in the single-layer honeycomb. Finally, the energy absorption mechanisms of the two combined honeycombs were discussed.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing by laser powder bed fusion allows the production of complex parts including lattice structures in popular metal alloys such as Ti6Al4V. Lattice structures are a class of meta-materials which hold many advantages such as the possibility for the production of lightweight parts with tailored mechanical and other properties: these have many potential applications in aerospace and medical fields. The laser powder bed fusion process can result in microporosity inside the produced material, which can affect the mechanical performance of these types of materials. In this work, different typical microporosity distributions are induced in manufactured gyroid lattice structure samples and the mechanical performance is tested by both static compression and compression-compression fatigue. X-ray tomography was used to validate the microporosity distributions and samples were tested in stress-relieved state and hot isostatic pressed state. In particular, it is found that small amounts of keyhole mode microporosity of ~0.2\% make no difference while lack of fusion is critical, especially when this results in inefficient HIP pore closure. The results highlight the effect of microporosity on the mechanical performance of these materials and the results add to the knowledge base and trustworthiness of these materials.},

In this study, we examine nanofibre properties resulting from five different electrospinning methods when using polyurethane or polyvinyl butyral . The five electrospinning methods examined were based on (a) alternating current ( AC electrospinning) and (b) direct current (Rod electrospinning, Nanospider™ technology, Needle electrospinning, Centrifugal electrospinning). The results, based mainly on the evaluation of images from scanning electron and confocal microscopy , showed clear structural differences between the nanomaterials produced by the various methods. The fibres obtained by the AC method were predominantly fine and disordered with high porosity. In the case of DC methods, which are characterized by a significant difference in productivity, the nanofibers of an accurately defined thickness (Nanospider technology) or very oriented nanofibres with considerable surface roughness (centrifugal spinning) could be prepared. By selecting a suitable method, it should be possible to prepare required nanofibre structures (larger/smaller pore size, specific fibre diameters , etc.) for specific biological applications , sensors, filtration, cosmetic products , drug delivery systems etc.},

The hardness reaches to 13.76 GPa, which is the maximum ever reported for CrMnFeCoNi HEA, and the contributions of the NC HEA microstructural characteristics to the ultra-high hardness were revealed.

In this work, we investigate the additive manufacturing of Fe 3Si and Fe 6Si benchtop scale transformer cores. A novel design inspired by a Hilbert curve was developed to exploit the geometric complexity of AM, and cores of each alloy were successfully printed, heat treated, machined, pickled, and assembled. The microstructure and magnetic performance of the cores were characterized and compared to additively manufactured components with simpler square cross-sections as well as to conventionally laminated non-oriented electrical steel sheet. The AM cores showed performance roughly comparable or better than the conventional non-oriented sheet, but higher power losses than Goss oriented steel. The increased Si content of the Fe 6Si alloy resulted in a significant reduction in core losses. The transformer cores had higher losses than the similarly manufactured simple cross-sections, which was attributed to defects in fabrication and assembly that resulted in air gaps between the transformer legs. The performance was also rationalized relative to nanoscale carbide and oxide inclusions .},

Frequently met dendritic ferrite (δ) and newly encountered spherical nanoscale particles trapped in austenite (γ) were only observed in the latter region. Chemically, these particles turned out a SiO 2 phase. From base metal to FZ, δ morphology was altered from originally linear to relatively diversely dendritic. Meantime, γ exhibited a converse manner where previously randomly oriented equiaxed was replaced by coarse, columnar and textured. Accordingly, a comparably high Schmidt factor in γ phase was obtained in FZ. Moreover, δ exhibited a relatively higher stress level than γ which presented a decrease in residual stress with grain coarsening in heat affected zone . In FZ, δ fraction displayed a dramatical increase with special BCC-FCC orientation relations established. Finally, tensile test and fracture appearance implied that FZ was exactly the weakest link of the whole welded joint in spite of a qualified strength achieved. In summary, lack in Σ3, largely increased δ fraction, high Schmidt factor in γ and especially being rich in SiO2 particles collectively led to the micro-void coalescence fracture in FZ.},

Hyaluronic acid-gelatin hydrogel (HG) polymers, β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics were fabricated using freeze-drying methods. The HG/TCP/BCP plug was prepared to be easily applied by pouring the mixture of HG and TCP into the shell-shaped mold, followed by placing the sponge type of BCP in the core portion of the mold compared to HG/TCP and collagen plugs. In vitro studies showed that HG/TCP and HG/TCP/BCP plugs were cytocompatible and could promote osteogenesis by upregulating the expressions of bone-related genes COL1, RUNX2, ALP , and OPN. The rabbit-femur defect model revealed that the implanted HG/TCP/BCP plug, which showed excellent hemostatic property, promote bone regeneration with a high rate of collagen distribution along with ALP and OPN expressions more than could the HG/TCP plug at 3 months after implantation, whereas the collagen plugs just filled with chondrocytes for cartilages formation. The HG/TCP/BCP plug should be considered for potential dental applications for one-step socket preservation.},

To realize bioactivity , Ti Nb alloys with varying Nb contents (0–45 at.\%) were additively manufactured using elemental powder blends. The regulation of the Nb contents could balance the surface constituent ratio of Nb 2 O 5 and TiO 2 , enhancing the formation of the hydroxyl group and surface hydrophilicity . Moreover, the effect mechanism of Nb 2 O 5 on immune modulation and bone regeneration was first put forward. The incorporation of Nb improved the viability of macrophages by inducing a macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2-like state. The variation of morphological and up-regulated expression of anti-inflammatory factors led to a more favorable osteoimmune microenvironment for osteogenesis, promoting the osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro . Considering the surface constituent and in vitro biological performance, 3D-printed Ti 25Nb scaffolds were placed into the femoral condyle of the rabbit. The Micro-CT and histological analysis indicated that Ti 25Nb scaffolds could accelerate bone regeneration and reinforce bone integration as relative to pure Ti. Overall, the Ti 25Nb scaffold exhibited structural bionic ability, surprising immunomodulatory properties, superior bone regeneration and osseointegration capacity, showing exceptional potential in the treatment of bone defects.},

Nature abounds of examples of such architectured materials, for example in the segmented structure of vertebrate spines. In this study we consider segmented beams made of stiff blocks and submitted to a transverse force. We start with simple cubes as a geometrical reference, which we then enrich by using two-dimensional polynomial functions. The flexural response of the beam is simulated using finite element modeling (FE-model) to predict strength, toughness and maximum local stresses . Using this procedure we identified the most efficient interface geometries and interlocking mechanisms within a set of polynomial functions and for a given strength of the individual blocks. To illustrate these results, we fabricated segmented beams of ceramic glass using a laser engraver. Experiments on these architectured glass revealed how enriched blocks turned the catastrophic brittle failure of monolithic glass into graceful progressive deformation. Resulting in a tougher response than the monolithic by 370 times and preserved 40\% of strength of that of the monolithic. ⁎ Corresponding author.},

We introduce a new method of combining a bioinspired, hierarchical architecture with the pre-strain generated by extrusion-based 3D printing to encode multiple permanent shapes in thermoplastic polymer shell structures . At high temperature, these structures are multistable and can snap repeatedly between all encoded permanent shapes without reprogramming. At low temperature, the structures are monostable with increased stiffness; the multistability can be switched on and off via temperature. Characterization studies are performed to determine how to control the level of pre-strain and the deflection behavior of the structure to enable finite element modeling for analysis and design. This pre-straining technique may be thought of as a virtual mold: printed structures are initially flat but have multiple permanent shapes encoded. Taking advantage of the geometric freedom of 3D printing, complex geometries, and pre-strain fields may be used to create highly tailored snapping structures. Thermoplastic filaments with added particles may be used to impart additional multifunctionality to the structures, such as magnetic responsiveness, to enable remote actuation . These switchable multistable structures have potential applications in fields including robotics, aerospace, and smart buildings .},

To realize the in situ measurements, the real-time curvature change of cantilever graphite electrodes in a home-made transparent cell was captured by a CCD camera during cycling. The elastic modulus and stress were derived from the curvature change of cantilever electrodes using a mechanical model, developed in this study. The elastic modulus increases from an initial value of ca. 8.9 GPa to ca. 31.9 GPa when the state of charge (SOC) is 60\% during the second lithiation. The magnitude of the stress increases during lithiation process, and changes from compressive stress to tensile stress in the thickness direction.

  abstract     = {We provide an experimental and theoretical description of the high temperature fracture behaviour of TiN thin films. For this, we employ molecular dynamics and density functional theory, to show that the surface energies drop insignificantly between 0 and 1000 K. We utilise these results to predict a slight decrease of the fracture toughness over the aforementioned temperature range. For the experimental perspective, we use unbalanced DC reactive magnetron sputtering to synthesise a TiN film, on which we perform in situ high temperature microcantilever bending tests. Upon increasing the testing temperature from room temperature to 773 K our results present a slight, irreversible decrease of K IC , once the deposition temperature of the film (~653 K) is exceeded. Based on our theoretical groundwork, as well as complementary data produced by X-ray diffraction, nanoindentation, transmission electron microscopy, and wafer curvature measurements, we identify growth defect recovery as the main reason behind the decrease of K IC . We observe no change in the deformation and/or fracture mechanism of TiN across the experimentally investigated temperature range. Using an analytical model based on continuum mechanics, we estimate the influence of macro residual stresses on the temperature-dependent fracture toughness of TiN attached to a Si (100) wafer.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium is widely regarded as an excellent structural material, primarily because it forms the basis for a range of light-weight high-strength alloys. Recently, high-strain rate deformation of magnesium has received a great deal of attention due to the complicated deformation modes that involve combinations of dislocation slip and deformation twinning. In this study, single crystal magnesium samples were shock-compressed along the c- and a-axis, then released back to ambient conditions. Post-mortem transmission electron microscopy revealed that extension twins developed for both c- and a-axis shock loading . Also, the nanoindentation hardness values for these shocked samples were compared to those for samples compressed under quasi-static conditions; it was found that the hardness decreased with increasing strain rate for both c- and a-axis loading. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of deformation twinning in terms of inertial confinement of sample geometry and different stress relaxation speed between impact and lateral directions . The conversion from work-done to heat was discussed to explain the influence of shock-induced heating on the residual hardness. These results give new insights into the residual mechanical response in shock-compressed materials and may help to develop a more fundamental understanding of shock phenomena in metallic materials.},

In this work, the energy-absorption performance of lattice metamaterials with a heterogeneous spatial layout of different unit cell architectures was studied. Such multi-morphology lattices can harness the distinct mechanical properties of different unit cells while being composed out of a single base material. A rational design approach was developed to explore the design space of these lattices, inspiring a non-intuitive design which was evaluated alongside designs based on mixture rules. Fabrication was carried out using two different base materials: 316L stainless steel and Vero White photopolymer . Results show that multi-morphology lattices can be used to achieve higher specific energy absorption than homogeneous lattice metamaterials. Additionally, it is shown that a rational design approach can inspire multi-morphology lattices which exceed rule-of-mixtures expectations.},

Fire-resistant steel shows a yield strength ratio of more than 2:3 between 600 °C and room temperature and achieves an excellent high-temperature strength. Alloying elements such as Mo and Nb are used to improve the strength at elevated temperatures. In this study, the effects of the addition of Mo and Nb on the fire resistance of steel were carefully investigated using SEM, TEM , in-situ TEM, EPMA , 3D-APT, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, and first principles calculations. The fire resistance in Mo and Nb added steel (Mo + Nb) was shown to be drastically improved compared to plain carbon steel (C Mn). The improvement in the high-temperature strength in Mo + Nb was attributed to the precipitation of fine Nb-rich MX particles and a solid solution of Mo and Nb hindering the dislocation movement , and thereby minimizing the dislocation annihilation at elevated temperature. The solid solution of Mo and Nb lowers the vacancy formation energy and allows a vacancy to form more easily, leading to a large lattice distortion which results in a slower dislocation mobility in Mo + Nb.},

  abstract     = {Due to the flexible structures and vulnerable coordination bonds, hydrolytic stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a critical issue for practical use. Besides the collapse of MOF structures by water intrusion, herein, we found that phase transformation among MOF isomers ( viz. , t -Ln-BTC, m -Ln-BTC, and c -Ln-BTC) can be triggered by water/organic solvent soaking. In isostructural Ln-BTC, different Ln cations (Ce 3+ , Y 3+ , or their combination) affected the hydrolytic robustness of the frameworks by altering the bonding strength of Ln-O. In addition, the Ln-BTC isomers can serve as host materials to immobilize Au Pd alloy nanoparticles for the catalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction in aqueous solution, wherein, the catalytic performance increased in the order of m -Ln-BTC/Au-Pd &lt; c -Ln-BTC/Au-Pd &lt; t -Ln-BTC/Au-Pd. Nevertheless, the poor recyclability of t -Ln-BTC/Au-Pd was caused by the phase transformation of t -Ln-BTC to less porous m -Ln-BTC during the catalytic reaction . Strikingly, the hydrolytic robustness and catalytic recyclability of c -Y-BTC/Au-Pd were even better than the carbon-coating samples using thermal treatment (a routine strategy reported in the literature). Our results have demonstrated that the coordination environments between lanthanide ions and ligands have a significant effect on the structural stability, which can prevent the attack of water molecules and consequently protect the constituent metal-ligand bonds.},

Secondary processing of SLMed components is thus an essential finishing operation to produce functional SLMed parts in precision engineering . This paper investigates the effects of laser scanning strategies (0°, 67.5° and 90° laser scanning schemes) and machining surfaces (top and front surfaces) on the machining performance of SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy in milling, compared with that of annealed ASTM B265 Ti6Al4V alloy. High degree of anisotropy of SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy is reflected in cutting force, surface morphology and surface roughness on different machining surfaces. The machining anisotropy is dominated by the anisotropy of microstructure and mechanical properties of SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy, where the anisotropy weakens following the sequence of 0°, 90° and 67.5° SLMed samples. It is verified that high cutting speed can improve machining anisotropy features of SLMed titanium alloy . The chip shape of SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy is a typical conical spiral chip, and the bending degree and length of chips produced by SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy are larger than those produced by annealed Ti6Al4V alloy.},

Varying one factor at the time for experimenting to obtain insight into tire friction does not necessarily provide a proper judgment. It is needed to take all interactions between the operating factors into account to determine the optimized test conditions to predict tire friction. The research methodology of the Design of Experiments (DoE) is particularly suited for such a system influenced by multi-factors; a technique that constructs a predictive mathematical model to describe the relationship between responses and critical factors. With the aid of DoE, the influence of various operating parameters of the Laboratory Abrasion Tester (LAT100) as a tribometer on tire friction is investigated: load, speed, and slip angle . Two counter-surfaces are employed: a sandpaper- and a corundum-based substrate. A predictive mathematical model is extracted from the DoE and suggests various optimal test conditions to predict the tire friction. It provides new insights into the impact of factor interactions on the coefficient of friction of tire tread compounds. The variation of the coefficient of friction vs speed on the corundum-based substrate is in good agreement with the ABS braking distance data of actual tires on the road.},

We develop an empirical model that captures salient features of the strain hardening behavior. The model emphasizes ease of implementation into computer codes and identifying parameters from macroscopic data over physically motivated parameters; however, parameters fit to the mechanical response of several alloys show a direct correlation between some parameters and stacking fault energy . Finite element simulations of TWIP and TRIP steels under uniaxial tension show the lack of post-necking elongation observed experimentally is directly related to how abruptly the hardening decreases after the linear hardening regime. A scheme is then proposed for computing some hardening parameters directly from composition so that the model is compositionally-sensitive. This method is demonstrated on medium to high Mn steels so that the mechanical behavior can be predicted using the stacking fault energy, which is computed as a function of composition.},

As demonstrated by synchrotron X-ray nano-computed tomography and scanning electron microscope combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the micro-channels on the surface or inside of Fe 78 Si 9 B 13 particles offer a shortcut for fast mass transfer and supply plenty of reactive sites with low density and high energy due to the structural rejuvenation after ultrasonic vibration. It leads to the reduction of the reaction activation energy of degradation under the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and an exceptional decomposition capacity.

Based on an in situ X-ray CT compression test, the 3D segmentation is complemented by a watershed method and a geodesic reconstruction technique to isolate cells and to identify missing walls. An implicit 3D geometry is reconstructed for each cell based on a distance field computation technique. An automated procedure extracts a shell geometry from this implicit 3D geometry, followed by a finite element meshing step. The resulting FE model is solved using ABAQUS/Explicit with an elasto-plastic-damage constitutive model for the cell walls behaviour, and with consideration of contacts between cell walls. A comparison of the simulation results is conducted with experimental force-displacement curves and scanned deformed configurations . The deformation and failure mechanisms under quasi-static compression are investigated numerically and compared with the result of the in-situ experimental measurement. The simulation is shown to predict the yield zones on both the macroscopic and cell levels.

An aqueous dispersion of ITO NPs enabled the suspension of GZO NPs without surfactants . Transmission electron microscopy indicated the formation of high aspect-ratio segments of ITO NPs from the suspension through oriented attachment, that persisted in the deposited and sintered thin films to establish an efficient electrical percolating network within the less conductive GZO NP matrix. Rapid CO 2 -laser sintering under argon gas of approximately 800 nm thick NP films yielded resistivities of 7.34 × 10 −3 Ω·cm and 116 Ω·cm for pure ITO and pure GZO respectively. However, a bi-component film with only 19.6 at.\% indium (relative to zinc) achieved a resistivity of 3.21 × 10 −1 Ω·cm. By changing the ITO content, the near-infrared transmittance could be adjusted between 13\% and 82\% and the optical bandgap energy between 3.93 and 3.33 eV, enabling fine-tuning of the properties. Finally, a fast and material/energy efficient processing route was demonstrated for the fabrication of a GZO-ITO circuit pattern using CO 2 -laser patterning of a mask and CO 2 -laser sintering of the NP films.},

It is pointed out that they can be used to identify the constitutive constants of filled rubber-like materials subjected to arbitrary strain history. The constitutive constants are found by minimising the difference between the predicted and the measured stress response. The stress solutions are based on a finite time increment approach and are derived for uniaxial and equibiaxial tension/compression as well as pure and simple shear. The stress solutions make it possible to apply any hyperelastic material model and user-defined damage parameter. Furthermore, the material model parameters may be determined for each loading mode separately or any combination of the different loading modes. With the purpose of demonstrating the application of the stress solution-based parameter identification method used, as a first step, uniaxial cyclic tension tests had been performed on a carbon black filled EPDM rubber. Then, the calibration process was presented in details, applied at a strain rate of 0.01 1/s and the effectiveness of the proposed and the frequently used inverse parameter identification method was compared. Finally, the stress solution-based parameter identification was performed by considering measurements made at different strain rate simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {While laser-assisted machining can significantly improve the machinability of nickel-based superalloy, the mechanism of surface integrity evolution and its influence on the material functional performance is still not clear. The present study gives a comprehensive investigation on the surface integrity of laser-assisted milling (LAMill) process with an in-depth study of the mechanism of chip formation, microstructural and mechanical alternations, supported by key outcomes from the two constitutive processes, conventional milling (CMill) and single laser scanning (LS). Although the high thermal affected layer in LAMill process has been removed through the cutting chips, a significant bending effect has been found in both the LAMill and LS workpiece. More interestingly, a combined impact of the residual stress from LS and CMill has been found on LAMill workpiece while a lattice evolution has been revealed regarding both the thermal and mechanical influence. Specifically, inadequate fatigue performance on LAMill and LS workpiece has been found due to the high thermal effect in the superficial layer regarding the residual tensile stress distribution and microstructure variation. While LAMill is generally considered as a promising machining method with improved machinability of difficult-to-cut materials, this research shows a poor workpiece functional performance (fatigue) and justifies its application prospect.},

Artificial periosteum with suitable mechanical properties and chemical composition can effectively guide bone tissue regeneration. In this study, a polycaprolactone (PCL)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS)/sodium alginate (SA) micron-fibrous bionic periosteum was prepared. The water-in-oil PCL-CMCS/SA emulsion was prepared by using Span 80 as the emulsifier, and the PCL/CMCS/SA composite micron-fibers were fabricated by emulsion electrospinning. The physicochemical properties of the PCL/CMCS/SA micron-fibers were investigated via SEM, FTIR and tensile test analyses. CCK8 assay, live/dead assay, cell adhesion, and qPCR tests were carried out to evaluate the osteoinductive capacity of the micron-fibers and their biocompatibility to MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. The results showed that CMCS and SA were successfully immobilized in the micron-fibers. The PCL/CMCS/SA micron-fibers showed an average diameter of 2.381 ± 1.068 μm with excellent tensile strength. The PCL/CMCS/SA composite scaffold demonstrated no significant cytotoxicity and could facilitate osteoblast adhesion. In addition, it could upregulate the early expression of osteogenic genes ALP and Runx2. The PCL/CMCS/SA micron-fibers prepared by emulsion electrospinning showed good mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility and osteoinductive capacity to osteoblasts, and could be used as potential transplantable scaffolds for repairing large-segment bone defects.},

A processing window was identified to enable continuous single track deposition with a regular shape. Deposition of thin walls and single tracks were used as a guideline to deposit blocks. Blocks were deposited using L-DED, and the physical, microstructural, and mechanical properties of the samples were investigated. Results demonstrated that the morphology of the thin walls were a better indicator of the morphology of the block samples than single tracks were, and care must be taken when transitioning from depositing single tracks to bulk (thin walls and blocks) samples. Results from mechanical testing show slight inhomogeneity as a function of height within the build for elongation and ultimate tensile strength . Microhardness and yield strength, however, were mostly uniform throughout the build. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that L-DED is suitable for depositing AlSi10Mg and obtaining mechanical properties superior to those achieved through casting.},

A range of print parameters was used for a comprehensive assessment of printability, providing a basis to establish the relationship between process, microstructure, and mechanical properties. The study demonstrates a high relative density of the alloy fabricated with energy density in the range 62.7–109.8 J/mm 3 . It is shown that the scan strategy plays an important role in consolidation. For the same energy density, the rotation of 67° between two consecutive layers tends to yield higher consolidation than other considered strategies. Moreover, the scan strategy is found to be most influential in microstructure development . The scan strategy rotation angle controls the extent to which epitaxial growth can occur, and hence the crystallographic texture and the grain morphology. Amongst four considered strategies, the 0°- and 90°-rotation meander led to the strongest preferred texture while the 67°-rotation resulted in weaker texture. The 67°-rotation strategies led to broadened grains with lower aspect ratios. The understanding of texture and grain size provides explanations to the observed mechanical properties (such as flow stress and plastic anisotropy) of the alloy.},

  abstract     = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has become a predominant process for manufacturing complex metal parts. However, research on controlling the geometric tolerances of the metal AM printed parts and assemblies is scarce. This paper presents a methodology to conduct a geometric tolerance and manufacturing assemblability study of the parts manufactured by metal AM. An assembly benchmark test artifact (ABTA) is designed to include mating features with given assembly conditions based on geometric tolerancing quantifiers. For virtual analysis, prediction phase ABTA samples are generated by using systematic and random field theory deviations. The prediction phase deviations are then calibrated using deviations from a numerical simulation based on thermo-mechanical finite element model of the part. These samples or ‘skin model shapes’ are subjected to geometric tolerance and assemblability study. For experimental validation of the method, geometric tolerance quantification and actual assembly was conducted on laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated parts. The comparative analysis of the experimental and virtual results validates the new methodology and its ability to provide reliable information regarding assemblability, size dimensions and geometric tolerances. The method can be extended to any AM process for performing a virtual tolerance and manufacturing assemblability study.},

  abstract     = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a novel manufacturing method where a component is fabricated by accumulating material layer-by-layer therefore facilitating customized near-net-shape components while maximizing design freedom. A metal AM technology suited for large-scale component fabrication that has been emerging in recent years and is commonly referred to as Wire and Arc AM (WAAM) uses Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) technology to deposit material and large-scale robotic serial manipulator systems (reach &gt;1 m cubed). One of the requirements for applying GMAW welding technology to AM is to identify and optimize deposition parameters in order to achieve a desired deposition quality measured in terms of geometrical, mechanical and metallurgical consistency. In this work, deposition process parameters qualitatively and quantitatively influencing the geometrical, mechanical and metallurgical consistency are identified and statistically validated. A deposition parameter combination is found that optimizes the quality of single-track wall benchmark components made from low-carbon steel. Moreover, correlations are found between accumulated heat during fabrication and the geometrical variations of the benchmark components due to bead slumping. Additionally, correlations between microstructure variations and geometrical variations are found. Finally, based on the presented analyses, in-situ temperature monitoring methods are proposed in order to achieve optimal component quality.},

  abstract     = {Modulated laser power hybrid welding (M-HW) of 4 mm-thick T2 pure copper was conducted to improve the welding stability. It was observed that the sinusoidal modulation of laser power in hybrid welding can reduce the incidence of weld defects such as spatters and pores, and decrease the transverse shrinkage of the weld seam. An observation of the evolution of the molten pool and keyhole using high-speed CCD photography reveals the main reason behind this to be the increase in the instantaneous maximum power because of power modulation, which increases the keyhole depth and frequency of formation of penetrated keyholes. The formation of a penetrated keyhole facilitates the escape of excess energy from the aperture at the bottom of the keyhole, thereby preventing the instability of the bottom of the keyhole caused by over concentration of energy thereat. This reduces the energy transfer within the surroundings of the molten pool, as well as the transverse shrinkage of the weld seam. The effects of the amplitude and the frequency of the sinuous waveforms of laser power on the frequency of formation of penetrated keyholes were analysed.},

Three-dimensional (3D)-printed porous titanium (pTi) alloys have the character of low stiffness, similar to cortical bone, and are seemed as promising materials in orthopedic applications , but limited by the bio-inert of titanium alloy . Thus, improving the bioactivity of the prosthesis and bone regeneration around the implant are crucial for the osseointegration. Herein, we established rabbit model of osteoporosis by bilateral ovariectomy, and the bioactive interface was constructed by coating 3D-printed pTi scaffolds with autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared by traditional and Freeze-Dried methods. The pTi have advantages of ideal pore size, porosity and mechanical properties matching with bone tissue. In vitro , PRP-coated pTi significantly promoted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) attachment, proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation . In vivo studies of the implant coatings were performed using osteoporosis models. The results indicated that this PRP-coated bioactive interface enhanced bone regeneration and osseointegration. Besides, compared with Traditional PRP, the Freeze-Dried PRP-coated pTi exhibited the superiority of promoting cell activity and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, and better bone formation. The novel Freeze-Dried PRP-coated pTi shows potential for the development of artificial prosthesis with bioactive interface for patients with osteoporosis.},

In this study, however, the mechanical and corrosion-induced hydrogen embrittlement (CIHE) properties of medium C-based ultra-strong steel degraded with increasing Ni content. Steel samples with a higher Ni content had a higher fraction of undissolved cementite (Fe 3 C) in the martensite matrix, leading to a smaller prior-γ grain size and lattice parameter , and a lower tensile strength . Even at a higher austenitizing temperature , no significant change in the tensile strength of the sample with a higher Ni content was observed. This was attributed to the additional supply of C atoms into the lattice by the further dissolution of Fe 3 C. The tensile test at a slow strain rate did not reveal a proportional relationship between the Ni content and the CIHE indices, but an inflection point of the Ni quantity in the steel was noted. Based on the results, effective metallurgical strategies with respect to the optimal Ni contents and austenitizing conditions for the steel are proposed.},

Near equiatomic Ti-Ni conventional SMAs, as the most applied SMA system, were considered to possess appreciable shape memory effect and superelasticity only below 373 K, which owes to low martensitic transformation temperatures. Here we utilized the martensite stabilization effect and successfully expanded the viable zone of B19′ (monoclinic) martensite to 616 K in a 35\% cold-rolled Ti-50Ni (CR35) SMA. After a training cycle, it exhibited quasi-linear superelasticity of narrow hysteresis , ~3\% superelastic strain and high strength over 1.2 GPa in a wide temperature range up to 483 K. It is the first exploration of high temperature superelasticity associated with the stabilized martensite. Using transmission electron microscopy and in-situ heating/tensile synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we reveal the origin of martensite stabilization and the underlying mechanisms of unique superelasticity in the CR35. Our work provides an attractively facile approach to realize high temperature superelasticity in Ti-Ni conventional SMAs, as well as in other kinds of SMAs, for precise actuation within an expanded range of working temperature and stress.},

After welding, the AlFeCrCo medium entropy amorphous alloy powders were transformed into a body-centered cubic structure coating having an average thickness of 430 μm. The effect of instantaneous temperature on the formation ability of the coating was analyzed by theoretical calculations and experimental results. Based on the calculations, the instant Joule heating effect was only concentrated in the minute bonding area, and no direct or immediate increase in temperature occurred at the substrate. The experimental results demonstrated that the temperature gradient did not engender an obvious dilution of the matrix. The average microhardness of the coating (870 HV 0.2 ) was approximately 12 times higher than that of the substrate. The wear performance was systematically evaluated in dry and 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution conditions under different normal loads. Compared with the substrate and other high entropy alloy-related systems, the AlFeCrCo medium-entropy alloy coating exhibited good wear resistance. The wear resistance improved when the metal films and corrosive behavior were occurred in corrosive environments , which was anomalous to wear mechanism under dry conditions.},

  abstract     = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a continuously growing additive manufacturing technology that aside from physical prototypes can also deliver functional prototypes and devices for radiofrequency (RF) and microwave applications. The very recent introduction of high-permittivity filaments for FFF has been one of the main facilitators for this major advancement, aiding microwave engineers to realise academics concepts that have thus far been impossible to fabricate and therefore invent new designs. However, the value to the RF community of these devices depends on accurate knowledge and repeatability of the electromagnetic properties of the materials being used which strongly relies on the processing strategy used during printing. This paper investigates the use of a high-permittivity filament and studies the impact of layer height and infill density on the relative permittivity ( ε r ) and loss tangent ( tanδ ). A maximum relative permittivity of ε r = 9.63 ± 0.16 and tanδ = 0.003 ± 0.0003 was achieved with a 200 μm layer thickness and 100\% infill density. Finally, the results of this study are used in designing, simulating, 3D printing and measuring the performance of a novel graded-index dielectric lens operating at 10 GHz.},

In this paper, composite structures with different gradient impedances are proposed. The influence of impedance gradient forms and discrete layering methods on acoustic performance is investigated numerically and experimentally. It is found that the gradient structure with exponential form improves absorbing performance in low frequency best among all these forms studied in terms of absorption coefficient and reflection coefficient. The curvature of the exponential curves shows the greatest effects on the position of the first absorption peak and the corresponding absorption coefficient. Better acoustic properties can be obtained in the case when adopting the equivalent layering method by thickness than that of the method equally layering by impedance. These findings provide useful guidance for application of underwater acoustic impedance gradient medium in engineering, especially for designing customized anechoic coating.},

  abstract     = {An innovative manufacturing method, based on Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Laser Writing (LW) technologies, was developed to integrate electrically conductive tracks within high strength 3D printed parts. Carbon fibers reinforced polyamide composites were processed by FDM according to three different printing architectures by varying the raster angle in the layer sequence. Laser writing was then performed to obtain conductive tracks on the surface of the printed parts. The process-structure-property relationship of components before and after the writing of conductive tracks was investigated. The tensile behaviour and the track resistance of samples were correlated to the direction of filament extrusion within the layers, and consequently to fibers orientation . Tracks showing good aesthetic quality and the lowest electrical resistance were obtained on samples with [±45] architecture. These tracks displayed the lowest electrical resistance ever reached by laser writing on metal-free polymer composites (0.008 kΩ/cm). Samples with [±45] architecture also showed high strength (72.9 MPa) and stiffness (7.7 GPa). The integration of FDM and LW emerges as a new approach to transform the surface of high strength polymer composites parts into a highly valuable system. These multifunctional components can find applications in several industrial fields such as automotive, aeronautics, and appliances.},

These materials usually appear ferroelectricity with the built-in electric field, which can be used to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. However, the toxicity of lead has severely hampered their applications. Hence, it is of utmost significance to explore novel organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials with non-toxicity, ferroelectricity, and narrow bandgap at room temperature to enhance the PCE for broad practical applications. Herein, we reported a lead-free hybrid molecular ferroelectric material , i.e. (C 5 N 2 H 9 ) 3 Bi 2 I 9 , with zero-dimensional perovskite-like structure. (C 5 N 2 H 9 ) 3 Bi 2 I 9 undergoes first-order ferroelectric phase transition with a Curie temperature of 327 K. Moreover, the dielectric constants of (C 5 N 2 H 9 ) 3 Bi 2 I 9 exhibit a step-like anomaly varied between the high-temperature paraelectric phase and the low-temperature ferroelectric phase. Furthermore, (C 5 N 2 H 9 ) 3 Bi 2 I 9 demonstrates a narrow bandgap of 2.1 eV.

New cathodes were used as an alternative to the traditional cathode in the single cell assembly and were tested for power density. Mechanical properties were compared with the current state-of-the-art. The results show that the use of metallic foams for high temperature fuel cell electrodes is beneficial from the technological point of view, especially in larger scale production.

The prepared alginate/chitosan/fucoidan (ACF) sponges display excellent elastic properties, preserving their shape even after bending and compressive strain without failure. The ACF sponge containing 10\% fucoidan (ACF-1) shows better hemostatic and antibacterial performances, and significantly promotes wound closure in a rat full-thickness wounds model compared to the alginate/chitosan group and ACF sponge containing 30\% fucoidan. Furthermore, the ACF-1 sponge greatly facilitates the epithelialization and the formation of collagen in the dermis, promotes the hair follicle regeneration, enhances vascularization by upregulating the protein expression of CD31, and reduces inflammation by downregulating the protein expression of TNF-α.

A UL 94-V0 classification was achieved for epoxy resin containing DA at 2 wt\% of phosphorus loading. However, addition of silica nano particles was necessary to avoid melt dripping. The incorporation of DA and Mel to the epoxy resin promoted a remarkable reduction (48\% to 70\%) in the heat release rate (HRR) values, a significant delay (up to 47\%) in the ignition time in cone calorimetry experiments, and thus an increase (~75\%) in the time to flashover . Evolved gas, thermal and fire analysis was used to propose the combined mode of action of DA, Mel and silica in the fire performance improvement of the epoxy system. Tensile and three-point bending flexural tests showed that the addition of DA increases the rigidity of the resin, resulting in a strong increase in the Young&#39;s modulus (up to 34\%) and in a slight reduction in fracture strength , elongation break and toughness which is typical for non-reactive additives.},

The first stage of preparing highly transparent PMAS is attainable with the rapidly maturing sintering technology. However, the machining technologies aiming to achieve high shape accuracy and surface quality on PMAS are still restricted by its poor machinability and limited endeavours to survey. This paper provides a comprehensive collection of PMAS processing strategies. The state-of-the-art techniques for sintering PMAS are reviewed with a focus on the technical details and intimate relationship with the material properties . The fundamental material properties of PMAS including the crystal structure, mechanical properties and damage mechanisms are systematically discussed. These characteristics inherently govern the material removal mechanisms and the generation of surface damages in the subsequent machining processes. The surveyed fundamental studies signify that the combination of high brittleness , strong anisotropy within each single-crystal grain and polycrystalline structure is the major obstacle in achieving damage-free surface finish. In this regard, further explorations of improving machining performance with advanced machining technologies and enhancing the machinability through optimising sintering strategies are expected in the outlook.},

Mechanical strain is a promising stimulus to tune the surface wettability, however, it is still a great challenge to achieve both wide-range reversible wettability and high sensitivity. In this study, highly ordered and quasi-periodic ridge patterns with cracks at their peaks were tailored based on a film-substrate system by sputter deposition of zinc (Zn) nanofilm on prestretched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The contact angle (CA) on the ridged Zn/PDMS surface is well tunable between 115° and 143° by adjusting the applied strains. It is remarkable that such a structure possesses wide-range CA variation (~28°) under just 28.6\% applied strain, indicating a high responsive sensitivity ( η = 98°). This result is attributed to the cracked ridges with both wide-range aspect ratios from 0.07 to 0.54 and high rate of change (~1.70). Moreover, the responsive reversibility of the ridged Zn/PDMS surface remains up to 1000 cycles and 60 days without special protection. The outstanding performances make the ridged surface could be a promising component for various technological applications, especially in small strain required situations.},

Although the amorphous boron coating makes a significant contribution to the high fracture strength , its mechanical properties have not been studied rigorously due to its thin thickness and strong adhesion to the substrate. Furthermore, the medium-range atomic ordering of CVD amorphous boron has not been clearly understood, and the determination of the closest crystalline structure has been a challenge. In this study, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), nanoindentation , and in-situ micropillar compression were performed to investigate the atomic arrangement and mechanical properties. Electron diffraction and autocorrelation function analysis revealed α-rhombohedral boron ordering as the closest crystalline structure. Micropillar compression displayed near-ideal yield strength (~13 GPa), but nanoindentation a relatively moderate Young&#39;s modulus (~320 GPa), leading to a modulus of resilience (2.64 × 10 8 J/m 3 ) unprecedentedly higher than most advanced engineering materials . Our structural and mechanical data will be discussed in terms of lattice point spacing and the influence of surface defects on fracture strength, respectively.

  abstract     = {Simple geometric distortions applied to the isometric Kelvin cell structures, (the tetrakaidecahedron), are shown to result in equivalent materials with anisotropic Hooke&#39;s tensors. The equivalent material models are estimated using a recently published inversion method where the 21 independent elastic constants of the Hooke&#39;s tensor are identified. In these cell geometries, some of the faces of the Kelvin cell have been twisted and/or tilted. Numerical experiments suggest that the equivalent material models of the distorted cells exhibit variations in compression, shearing, shear-compression and shear-shear coupling moduli, which are shown to be continuous functions of the degree of twist and tilt applied. When twist and tilt are combined, it is demonstrated that full anisotropy in the elastic properties may be generated. A rotational symmetry without symmetry planes, but having either a tetragonal or a monoclinic elastic symmetry is discussed. Four cell geometries, one isometric and three distorted, were manufactured using masked stereolithography 3D printing technology and measured in a laboratory compression set-up. Results from numerical simulations are compared to the experimental in terms of the compressive modulus.},

  abstract     = {A new global kinematic-optical-thermal (KOT) model is proposed to provide a proper understanding and description of the temperature evolution during laser-assisted tape winding and placement (LATW/LATP) on any arbitrary shaped tooling geometry. Triangular facets are utilized in the kinematic model to define a generic tooling together with a user-defined fiber path and time-dependent process settings such as the tape feeding rate. The time-dependent heat flux distribution on the surfaces is calculated by the optical model and subsequently coupled to the thermal model. The numerical implementation of the developed KOT model is first verified for process simulations of the LATP on a flat tooling by comparing the temperature predictions with the available literature data. To validate the KOT model, a total of four pressure vessels are manufactured with in-line temperature measurements. The process temperature predictions are found to agree well with the measured temperature during the helical winding. The influence of the changing tooling curvature and process speed on the process temperature is found to be significant as shown by the experimental and numerical findings.},

A strong 〈100〉 single crystalline-like texture is obtained in the direction of the laser scan and a 〈110〉 texture was observed in the build direction when using a bidirectional scan without rotation. Fiber texture was observed along the tensile direction when the bi-directional laser scanning vectors were rotated by 67° (Rot-scan) for each layer. The study highlights a correlation between laser scanning strategies with resulting textures, microstructure, and mechanical properties in as-printed bulk 316L SS. The hardness, Young&#39;s modulus , and ultimate tensile strength were significantly influenced by the final microstructure , crystallographic texture , and porosity. Furthermore, the applied laser scanning strategies made it possible to tailor crystallographic textures locally within the component.

  abstract     = {Recycling of metal waste for feedstock material in additive manufacturing (AM) is typically carried out through energy extensive melting and solidification processing techniques. However, in austere environments, energy production can be limited and thus melting down scrap into powder through an atomization process is not a viable approach to producing feedstock from reclaimed waste. However, advancements in solid-state material processing has led to a novel additive manufacturing process that uses solid, macroscale structural feed-rods that allow for high deposition rates with wrought-like mechanical properties . This process, additive friction stir deposition (AFS-D), leverages friction between the rotating feed-rod and the substrate (or previous deposition layer) to soften and promote material flow that creates a plasticized and metallurgically bonded material layer. As such, the AFS-D approach is ideally suited to directly process metal waste with minimal material preparation. To illustrate this concept, we demonstrate AM builds with refined microstructure and wrought-like properties made using loose machines chips. The results of this study demonstrate the potential to recycle metal machine chips by feeding them directly into the AFS-D process and produce structurally sound depositions that can be used for Point-of-Need manufacturing within austere environments.},

Capacitance data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to determine the conductivity (n- or p-type), carrier density, and flat band potentials for samples grown on indium tin oxide (ITO) at 25 °C. The Hall mobility (μ H ) of the n- and p-type Cu 2 O was estimated to be ~0.85 cm 2 /V.s and ~ 4.78 cm 2 /V.s respectively for samples grown on quartz substrate at 25 °C. An elevated substrate temperature ~ 200 °C with O 2pp = 2–3 mTorr yielded p-type Cu 2 O films with six orders of magnitude higher resistivities in the range, ρ ~ 9–49 kΩ.cm and mobilities in the range, μ H ~ 13.5–22.2 cm 2 /V.s. UV–Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy showed optical bandgaps of Cu 2 O films in the range of 1.76 to 2.15 eV depending on O 2pp .

Despite the increasing number of studies to understand the relationship between the process parameters and the residual stress, the underlying complex mechanisms are yet to be understood. In this work, a 3D finite element model (FEM) is established to investigate the relationship between the process parameters and the residual stress during SLM. When the process parameters are in different ranges, the residual stress behavior is different. The complex relationship between the residual stress and the process parameters could be the reason for the contradictory parametric effects reported in the literature. The magnitude of the parametric effect on the residual stress is obtained. The influence of the scanning speed is stronger than that of the laser power, which is in turn stronger than that of the hatch spacing. These results can bring insights into the understanding of the residual stress during SLM.},

The stress-life criterion is formulated by dislocation stress field elaborated from anisotropic fracture mechanics , taking in random variables to represent the scatter in grain size and orientation. Parameters include microstructures characterized by microscope, dislocation slip properties evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and information of activated slip system via crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) simulation.

The mass and cut-through tendon distance of the tape suture with unique structure decreased by 36\% and 61\%, respectively, compared to commercial USP No.2 PET suture for tendon repair clinically. The unique structural design also rendered the tape suture architectural stability, a large force of suture pull-out through tendon, good mechanical performance and handling property. Moreover, the cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility of the tape sutures were confirmed as well. A highly attractive combination of properties makes the hollow and porous tape sutures have huge potential for application in tendon repair.

DMECP is an advanced surface finishing method combining the advantages of both mechanical and electrochemical polishing techniques in a more environmentally friendly manner. In this paper, the SLM process-related defects causing poor surface quality are analysed first. The material removal mechanism of DMECP is investigated to continuously remove the oxide layers formed during polishing. Surface morphology and roughness evolution under different polishing conditions are characterised. The top surface roughness can be reduced by over 91\% from 8.72 μm to 0.75 μm compared to side surface by over 93\% from 12.10 to 0.80 μm. The material removal on the top surface is more efficient than that on the side surface under the same polishing condition. The secondary defects formed during polishing can be removed using mechanical polishing mode. The chemical element composition of the polished surface exhibits almost identical content to the initial 316L powders. Compared with the initial dark and rough surfaces, the results validate the capability of DMECP as an effective tool to improve the SLM surface quality and achieve a mirror finish.},

In this study, several types of two-level structures, which consist of the first-order micro geometric features corresponding to the pattern shape and the second-order submicron grooves corresponding to the diffraction grating, are designed to directly induce a variety of iridescent patterns based on their shape regulations. To fabricate these two-level iridescent structures with high accuracy in a single step, vibration-assisted fly cutting (VAFC) is proposed. VAFC involves the low-frequency vibration of the workpiece in the vertical direction during the feed in the horizontal direction and the high-speed rotation of the diamond cutting tool. A 3D theoretical model is established for the numerical simulation of the generating process of the iridescent structures and the regulation of the first-order geometric feature by vibration parameters. As the key parameter to the iridescent color, the spacing of the second-order submicron grooves is flexibly controlled by the feed rate. A VAFC platform is developed to fabricate the two-level structures and an optical detection system is setup to test the surface iridescence. Various vivid colors are regulated by the two-level structures with high saturation and uniformity.},

  abstract     = {Ductile fracture is the most common defect in plastic forming of tailor-welded blank (TWB). Revealing the damage and fracture characteristics of welded joint is very critical for accurately predicting the fracture defect. In this study, the fracture strain and microscopic damage development of a 2219 aluminum alloy welded joint were systemically investigated by in-situ-SEM testing. The interactive effects of microstructure and stress state on void growth and coalescence were quantitatively explored. Further, a micromechanical model based on actual microstructure was established to reveal the underlying mechanisms. The results show that the prominent void growth rates are affected by the particle size, particle volume fraction and grain size, and the effects vary with the stress triaxiality . The growing voids coalesce through one or both of ligament necking and shearing , which compete with each other dependent on the microstructure and stress state, making the variations of critical void spacing ratio. Attributing to these effects, the fracture strains of different microstructures in welded blank under various stress states are different, and the relationship between the fracture strain and microstructure relies on the stress state. These damage and fracture rules are explained by the microscopic heterogeneous deformation characteristics under different microstructures and stress states.},

The nine parameters include formation enthalpies determined by the extended Miedema theory, and mixing entropy. They are highly related to the phase formation, common ML methods cannot distinguish accurately. In this paper, feature selection and feature variable transformation based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) are proposed, the feature variables are optimized, the distinction of phases is carried out by Support vector machine (SVM) model. The results indicate that elastic energy and atom-size difference contribute significantly in the formation of different phases. The accuracy of testing set predicted by SVM based on four feature variables and KPCA (4V-KPCA) is 0.9743. The F1-scores predicted detailedly by SVM based on 4V-KPCA for the considered alloy phases are 0.9787, 0.9463, 0.9863 and 0.8103, corresponding to solid solution, amorphous, the mixture of solid solution and intermetallic, and intermetallic respectively.

  abstract     = {With common manufacturing approaches it is impossible to fabricate complex free-standing 3D carbon electrodes with well-defined geometrical structures. Here, a novel and straightforward approach to generate free-standing 3D carbon structures is developed based on stereolithography printing followed by pyrolysis . By controlling the design, printing and pyrolysis parameters, complex 3D pyrolytic carbon electrodes with minimal features of less than 100 μm and excellent structural uniformity were fabricated. The effects of carbonization condition (kinetics of thermal degradation) and final pyrolysis temperature on the physicochemical properties of the derived carbons were examined. The results show that the microstructural and electrochemical properties of the electrodes are more dependent on the carbonization condition than the pyrolysis temperature. Approximately 20\% higher cyclic voltammetry peak currents (I p ) and 31\% lower charge transfer resistance (R ct ) were recorded for the kinetically-fast carbonized electrodes, compared to the gradually (kinetically-controlled) carbonized ones, which is ascribed to their relatively higher specific surface area measured by N 2 adsorption/desorption technique. Moreover, great flexibility to construct electrodes with different architectures, excellent electrochemical stability and repeatability was observed. Overall, we believe that the proposed approach opens up new possibilities for the simple preparation of free-standing 3D carbon electrodes for a broad spectrum of applications.},

Non-woven thermoplastic veil interleaves have been modified by spray deposition with a GNP dispersion to give either a continuous or strip-patterned distribution. The coated interleaves were used to modify the interlaminar region of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. The fracture surfaces were characterised by scanning electron and optical microscopy. The continuous GNP distribution in mode I prevented the formation of carbon fibre bridging, resulting in similar initiation and propagation values. In mode II, the increased thickness of the interlaminar region, coupled with the uneven fracture surface showed the highest increase in the mode II ILFT for the continuous GNP distribution. The strip-patterned GNP distribution showed reduced carbon fibre bridging compared to the baseline CFRP and thermoplastic interleave laminates. This may be due to small scale fibre bridging between the deposited GNP-strips which also lead to peaks and troughs in the load-displacement response. In mode II, it is suggested that the deposited GNP-strips were sufficiently tough to re-direct the propagating crack from the modified interlaminar region to the adjacent ply.},

In this study, several groups of Ti6Al4V Primitive models are designed and fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The mechanical properties of scaffold are evaluated by mechanical compression test. The morphology of the scaffold model is characterized. The permeability of the scaffold was predicted and evaluated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses. Finally, the evaluation of the effects of Ti6A14V scaffold on cell growth is conducted by cytotoxicity test. The results show that the mechanical properties and permeability of the designed Primitive surface scaffold are pretty good as bone tissue replacement.

It implies the definition of the temperature-time field, T - t , from short-term recorded relaxation curves at different temperatures by establishing the compatibility condition between the temperature dependent relaxation modulus at given time, E ( T ; t ), and the time dependent relaxation modulus for a given temperature, E ( t ; T ). The solution of the resulting functional equation allows the T - t field to be analytically defined by assuming the normalized relaxation function to be a stochastic model properly identified as a survival cumulative distribution function of certain statistical families such as normal or Gumbel ones. As a result, the corresponding master curves in the T - t field for both E - t and E - T functions are directly derived over the whole range of time and temperature, preventing user&#39;s influence on the definition of the classical shift factors and the minimum overlapping requirement over time on the short-term curves. The suitability of the proposed methodology is confirmed by its application to the experimental results from a campaign of relaxation tests on commercial PVB (polyvinyl butyral) at different temperatures.},

This testing procedure enables the determination of the elastic, inelastic and viscoelastic portions with only one experimental test. To investigate the complex mechanical behaviour and its provoking phenomenological damage and deformation mechanisms on the microscale , additional experimental diagnostic methods are employed. Based on the experimental results for a continuous glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) composite with non-crimped reinforcement, a viscoelastic-plastic damage model is developed to describe the complex mechanical behaviour. Therefore, a damage-plasticity model is improved by using additional spring-dashpot systems for the calculation of the viscoelastic overstresses. This mesoscopic model describes the behaviour of single plies of a TPC laminate . After the implementation as a user-defined material subroutine into Matlab and Abaqus (Vumat), the model parameter identification and validation is performed as well as the structural behaviour is predicted.},

The FeCu and FePd (with reduced Pd content) systems were investigated as attractive candidates for a variety of potential applications in magnetic data storage and biomedicine. Confined growth in the restricted cavities resulted in a nanoscale grain size leading to well-defined geometries with sharp edges and corners and an average height of up to 215 nm. Specifically, nine 100 μm × 100 μm arrays of three geometries (cylindrical, rectangular and cruciform) in three different sizes were created. In addition, the total deposition time ranged from 3.5 s (FeCu) to 200 s (FePd), i.e. much faster than by traditional physical vapor deposition approaches and was performed at ambient conditions. Magnetic force microscopy for the cylindrical and cruciform structures revealed virtually no contrast at zero field, suggesting magnetic curling effects (instead of coherent rotation) during magnetization reversal . These curling effects result in low values of remanent magnetization, which is advantageous in minimizing dipolar interactions between the structures either when they are deposited onto the substrate or eventually dispersed in a liquid (e.g. in biomedical applications , as drug delivery carriers, where particle agglomeration is undesirable).},

A 3D thermo-mechanical finite element model for stress-induced solid phase transformations was developed to research the influences of SSPT on stress evolution during laser cladding a Fe-Mn-Si-Cr-Ni alloy coating. In the simulation calculation, the evolution and distribution of stress under two conditions (with SSPT and without SSPT) were analyzed and compared. In the experiment, the phase component and microstructure of the coating were researched adopting XRD and TEM respectively. Calculated results show that SSPT significantly reduces the residual stress in transverse and longitudinal direction , obtaining a more accurate stress result. The experimental results show that the stress generated in laser cladding induces austenite to transform into martensite, releasing residual stress and obtaining low residual stress coating. The present work can provide an available method for the simulation of stress-strain changes caused by stress-induced solid phase transformation and a new idea for eliminating residual stress in laser processing.},

Herein, we discussed the growth mechanism of coral reefs-like structures on the surface of defective layer made by plasma electrolysis (PE) of AZ31 Mg alloy . The PE layer was immersed in a solution containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ) and aluminum phosphate (AlPO 4 ) at ~85 °C under stirring condition, and the results were compared to the case when PE layer was immersed in a solution composed only of partially phosphorylated PVA (PPVA). A detailed examination of the morphology of PE layer immersed in a solution with AlPO 4 suggested that the formation of coral reefs-like structure would occur through a mechanism involving an anisotropic growth of PPVA-AlPO 4 complex composite. It was confirmed that PPVA-AlPO 4 has stronger affinity than PPVA to react with Mg 2+ ions through coordination covalent bonding due to the presence of additional PO 4 3− group. The coral reef-like structures effectively delayed the corrosion of Mg alloy substrate, resulting in superior corrosion protection properties. The shape-controlled synthesis of coral reef-like structures provided a green approach desirable for electrochemical applications of magnesium-based alloys.},

In this work, the high-quality and precise nanoscale line textures were fabricated on aluminum foil , and the influence of pulse laser energy and laser pre-shock processing on the preparation of nanoscale line textures was also investigated experimentally. The morphology of nanoscale line texture was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM), which obtained the best laser shock imprinting parameter. The microstructure and dislocation changes of laser shock imprinted aluminum foil were analyzed by transmission electron microscope (TEM), which explained the improvement of nanoscale line textured aluminum foil in electrochemical and mechanical properties. The nanotribological properties of nanoscale line textured aluminum foil were characterized by the AFM with sharp probe and SiO 2 colloidal probe. The experimental results indicated that nanoscale line textured aluminum foil had the effect of reducing friction and adhesive force between AFM probe and aluminum foil. The laser shock imprinting can fabricate high-accuracy nanoscale line textures on aluminum foil. Compared with the original aluminum foil, the morphology, mechanical properties, electrochemical performance and nanotribological properties of nanoscale line textured aluminum foil were improved.},

Positron annihilation spectroscopy was employed for a study of vacancy assisted clustering of solutes on the atomic scale, type and concentration of open volume misfit defects and local chemical surroundings of defects. Microhardness testing, thermal analysis and microstructure observations were also used. The alloys contain the eutectic grain boundary phases: T -phase and α -Al (Mn,Fe,Si) phase. Positrons are trapped at Zn,Mg-containing Guinier-Preston (GP) zones with no open volume defects and at (precursors of) the η ′-phase particles. Above ~150 °C precipitation of non-eutectic T -phase and coarsening of the S -phase particles are observed. Precipitate-matrix interfaces are characterized by vacancy-like misfit defects decorated by Si solutes. Binding energies of vacancies to various solutes (Si, Zn, Cu, Mn, Sc and Zr) obtained by ab-initio calculations were computed. Si solutes exhibit the highest vacancy binding energy among the constituents of the studied alloys. Other solutes (especially Mg, Sc, Zr) repel vacancies. The alloy with Sc,Zr-addition contains incoherent primary Al 3 (Sc,Zr)-phase. Layered primary particles with different morphological features such as square and polygonal shapes contain Sc,Zr-rich layers.},

Using a constrained crystal structure search method and rigorous bond analysis, we predicted the metastable structures of Al (N 5 ) 3 and Mg(N 5 ) 2 . In contrast to common wisdom, our work demonstrates that metals, especially the multivalent metals such as Al and Mg, can stabilize pentazolate anions by forming strong metal-N bonds. Both compounds are metastable at ambient pressure and temperatures as high as 600 K. The multivalent metals not only stabilize the pentazolate anions but also greatly enhance the energy density. The decomposition of Al(N 5 ) 3 or Mg(N 5 ) 2 can release an energy of 4.61 kJ/g or 3.10 kJ/g, respectively, making them promising candidates as high energy density materials.},

  abstract     = {Increased formability of aluminium alloys has been demonstrated via cryogenic deformation. In previous studies, the microstructures of samples deformed at low temperatures were analysed after reheating to room temperature (RT) and storage. However, after heating the dislocation structure and density of the deformed material do not reflect the cryogenic situation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of flow stress during recovery in Al-Mg and Al-Mg-Si alloys. We examine the RT recovery behaviour of samples pre-strained at 77 K to different strain levels, and evaluate the structural stability upon subsequent deformation. We also study microstructural evolution via in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, starting from initial conditions at cryogenic temperatures to long-term RT-recovery. Recovery of cryogenically deformed samples at RT results in reduction of the flow stress, in dependence on RT storage. The recovery process can be divided into three distinct sections, each based on a different mechanism characterized by either the arranging or the annihilation of dislocations. Subsequent further straining at room temperature after cryogenic forming also generates plastic instabilities and premature fracture due to unfavourable hardening and recovery assisted softening interplay .},

In addition to the lack of investigations on surface roughness and residual stresses in selective laser melting of Inconel 718, process maps were developed for the selection of the best process parameters to achieve the desired values for the three parameters combined. Five laser powers, six scan speeds and three hatch spacings were chosen from the stable single tracks tests. Based on each property, a 99.5\% density or a 2 μm surface roughness or the least surface tensile residual stress of 248 MPa were possible. However, no single process parameter combination was able to achieve good values for all three parameters. Prioritizing density and surface roughness, being crack initiators, over residual stresses for their effect on fatigue failure, it was found that 99.2\% density and relatively low roughness of 3.5 μm are feasible at 320 W, 600 mm/s and 0.12 mm hatch spacing. Finally, opposite to the commonly observed columnar grain in Inconel 718, mixed grain structure was obtained at 600 mm/s and 1000 mm/s, indicating reduced anisotropy.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this work was to study the cold formability of commercially pure Titanium alloy (Grade 2) by a testing methodology known as repetitive bending under tension (R-BUT). A dedicated test rig to perform the test was designed and fabricated to analyse the room temperature deformation behaviour of Ti-50A alloy sheet of 1.2 mm thickness. Samples from three different orientations were tested to investigate the effect of mechanical anisotropy on deformation behaviour. The results confirmed a significant increase in elongation to failure in samples subjected to R-BUT as compared to those subjected to standard tensile tests under similar conditions. This may be due to a delay in localised necking during R-BUT. Finite element analysis (FEA) suggested that a decrease in stress triaxiality in R-BUT could be the reason for enhanced formability of the materials compared to the conventional tension. Furthermore, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) study of the microstructure confirmed the development of highly strained regions that eventually lead to the formation of fine grains in the samples subjected to R-BUT. This could be due to a strain induced dynamic recovery process occurring during the test.},

The CNT suspension was fabricated by the ozone treatment and used to produce UHPC/CNT composites. Using spatially-resolved small angle X-ray scattering, the degree of dispersion of CNTs in UHPC matrix was quantitatively evaluated. It was confirmed that the ozone treatment enhanced the dispersion of CNTs in aqueous solution by formulating oxygenic and carboxylic groups on the surfaces of CNTs. Thus, interfacial interaction between the CNTs and UHPC was enhanced, leading to the higher nucleation effect at early ages. Ozone treatment did not significantly modify the hydration mechanism of UHPC. Instead, it provided multiple nucleation sites and double steric repulsion thorough the improved degree of dispersion of CNTs, which resulted in accelerated hydration at early ages and improved compressive strength at later ages.},

However, limitations occur because of mass transfer resistance through the pores. We describe here a bottom-up approach to optimize the design of such materials, through the analysis and modeling of their porous structure . Electrodes prepared by replicating stacked Langmuir-Blodgett films, with 1-μm diameter interconnected spherical pores, were studied. Since pore window dimensions are around 100 nm, Focused Ion Beam-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) has been performed to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the porous medium . Then, a determination of the geometrical characteristics has been achieved through image analysis. The structure of the sphere packing, the shape and size of the connections between spheres, the distances between spheres, the sphere diameters and the specific surface area have been analyzed. The porous medium is close to a face-centered cubic arrangement of spherical pores, but several deviations from ideality are present: missing pores (point defects), stacking errors (dislocations), and incomplete connection between spheres (only 50\% of the ideal sphere connections are present). The consequence of such defects on transport is studied through image-based simulations of mass diffusion in the actual porous medium and in similar ideal media.},

After the scaffold surfaces were modified by surface amination, the OGP was successfully loaded onto the scaffolds using a electrostatic self-assembly method. The effects of these scaffolds on the biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) were studied in vitro . The modification did not influence the adhesion or proliferation, but had a notable osteogenic effect in vitro. This may be attributed to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) signalling pathway.

This fact provides FFF with an outstanding competitive advantage as compared to the rest of the additive manufacturing technologies. This work aims to investigate the role of infill parameters on the mechanical performance and weight reduction of ULTEM TM 9085 samples processed by FFF, under tensile, flexural, and shear loading conditions in six different orientations with several solid and sparse configurations. Regarding the effect of the part orientation and the infill settings, the experimental results permit to draw conclusions on stiffness, resilience, maximum stress, and type of failure of the printed parts. Three-dimensional compliance matrices for each infill configuration are provided. The analysis of the results correlates the infill configuration with the mechanical performance considering the intra-layer and inter-layer unions.

Owning to the special nanoflower structure assembled by nanosheets, the substrate possesses a large specific surface area, which is conducive to the adsorption of more probe molecules. In addition, the good SERS performance should also be attributed to the synergistic effect of ~10 2 electromagnetic field enhancement of Nb 2 O 5 nanoflower, as well as the strong charge transfer resonance in this substrate-molecule system under the 532 nm incident laser.},

  abstract     = {A sulfonated silica coated polyvinylidene fluoride (S-SiO 2 @PVDF) nanofiber substrate with high strength and ultrahigh surface concentration of sulfonic acid groups was prepared by a three-step simple surface functionalization process. The S-SiO 2 @PVDF substrate was then used as both mechanical reinforcement support and inter-connected three-dimensional proton transport network for chitosan (CS) to prepare thin composite proton exchange membranes for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). As the mechanical support for CS matrix, the S-SiO 2 @PVDF nanofiber framework could significantly improve the dimensional stability, tensile strength , elongation and mechanical damage resistance. Meanwhile, as a proton conduction network, the conductivity of the composite membrane was remarkably enhanced to 21.2 mS cm −1 (about 2.8 times than that of pure CS). Moreover, due to the excellent methanol barrier ability of CS matrix itself as well as the limitation role of the nanofibers, the methanol crossover of the composite membrane was as low as 4.2 × 10 −7 cm 2 s −1 that was only 26\% of commercial Nafion 115. DMFC test showed the composite membrane exhibited the maximum power density of 86.3 mW cm −2 (80 °C), and the power density loss was only 5.4\% even after operating at a constant current of 0.35A cm −2 for 100 h.},

These formulations opened a new avenue of “smart tools” in the development of personalized, noninvasive emerging nanomedicine . However, there is still the risk that smart hybrid system manufactured from a mixture of materials, such as PLGA in combination with synthetic/vegetable lipids and targeting agents might trigger high nanotoxicological responses. This review is focused on the detailed description of PLGA-lipids/oils hybridization concept and its effect on the performances of nanocarriers as powerful, versatile delivery system, the manufacturing methods, the main applications, and their potential clinical impact. The successful design of a hybrid formulation involves two foremost challenges, firstly a comprehensive consideration of essential characteristics of each constituent that form the hybrid system and secondly, a deep understanding of the interactions of hybrid nanocarrier with cells in order to predict the potential toxicity issues and ensure its safe clinical applications.},

Besides, the spherical indentation experiment is conducted on the uniaxially stretched silica gel sample. The theoretical predictions and the experimental results show a good agreement with the difference from each other by less than 14\%, that further validates the reliability of the transparent indentation method in spite of its insensitivity to the initial deformation.

Herein, both theoretical and experimental studies were performed to develop a more efficient and economical method for nano-Mo 2 C preparation. Reaction thermodynamics of gas-vapor system of CH 4 -MoO 3 -N 2 indicates that high-proportion inert gas significantly increases the required carbonization potential (CO/CO 2 ) for Mo 2 C formation, but surplus carbon produced from methane decomposition can trigger water gas producing reaction and Boudouard reaction to help meet the requirement. Nano-Mo 2 C was then synthesized by mixing N 2 -carried MoO 3 vapor with CH 4 under varying conditions including temperature, gas flowrate and vapor concentration. It is found that MoO 3 vapor experienced conversions to monoclinic MoO 2 to cubic Mo to hexagonal Mo 2 C, and all these stages could be finished in as short as about 6 s at 1100 °C with initial molar ratio of CH 4 to MoO 3 over 3.5. The final products were present as porous plate-like single crystals or chain-like polycrystals , which are determined by initial vapor concentration and gas flowrate. Furtherly, electrocatalytic properties of Mo 2 C nanocrystals for hydrogen evolution reaction were measured, and the sample with the largest specific surface area and cleaner surface showed competitive performance over reported nano-Mo 2 C.},

Using a newly integrated shutter controller, specifically developed for precise control over coating design, ternary alloys with full compositional range can be deposited onto single wafers. Programmable shutters allow one to create multilayered thickness gradients of two or three different materials, which can then be annealed to create films with large compositional gradients. Two 50 nm fcc alloys (AlCuAu, AuAgPd) were magnetron sputtered onto (0001) sapphire wafers. The changing chemical composition across the wafer was investigated with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy . AlCuAu showed multiple phases and intermetallics across the wafer, whereas for AuAgPd a solid-solution was observed. Both alloys were coated with 400 nm Al 2 O 3 (atomic layer deposition, ALD), to investigate their potential as adhesion layers for ALD coatings. Adhesion of the bilayers across the wafer was measured with instrumented nanoindentation , producing well-defined delamination-blisters. Small arrays of indents placed over the surface, each location corresponding to different adhesion layer compositions, illustrate adhesion-promoting properties of numerous interface compositions in single samples. For the two bilayer systems, adhesion mapping revealed the areas of optimum adhesion layer composition for best adhesion properties.},

Others are present to the detriment of mechanical behaviour , causing anisotropic properties, a reduction in fatigue resistance as well as the formation of deformation-induced voids during forming. In order to improve the performance of MnS-containing steels, the mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of these inclusions need to be understood. Due to their small size, micro-mechanical testing using nanoindentation and micropillar compression was performed in order to study the properties of MnS. 110 1 ¯ 10 1101¯10 -type slip systems were, in accordance with literature, found as the primary slip system. For specific orientations with low Schmid factors for these systems, however, slip on {100} planes could be activated in micropillar compression, and for both obtained systems, the critical resolved shear stresses for their activation was measured. These findings were subsequently confirmed by electron backscatter-diffraction on cross-sections of deformed micropillars.},

The nanorelief in the same MTC or in different MTCs with the same orientation may have the similar features, which is different from that in the adjacent MTC. The top and bottom edges of one nanorelief correspond to different martensite twin boundaries (MTBs). A bigger stress and a higher plastic deformation distribute around MTC interface than MTB, and the interfacial migration of MTC is greater than MTB. The grain orientation and external stress directly affect the nanorelief and MTC. The biclinic nanorelief (tent-shape and V-shape) evolves from the monoclinic nanorelief. The surface relief angle of MTC is proposed to classify the nanorelief angles and the sum of relief angels (θ 1 and θ 2 ) for two adjacent MTCs satisfies θ 1 + θ 2 = 90°.

To better understand this defect and improve the mechanical properties of FFF 3D printing materials and structures, the distribution and basic mechanical principles of inter-layer failure are explored in detail in this study. Tensile experiments of a wide range of layer thicknesses (0.1 mm to 0.6 mm) and printing angles (0° to 90°) are carried out to find the distribution range and features of inter-layer failure. Additionally, a novel generalized strength model is established to predict the tensile failure strength of inter-layer failure of FFF 3D printing PLA material. Experimental results show that the distribution range of inter-layer failure increases significantly as the layer thickness increases from 0.1 mm to 0.6 mm, and inter-layer failure tends to occur when the printing angle and the tensile failure strength are small. All the Root Mean Square (RMS) error between theoretical results and experimental data of tensile failure strength of inter-layer failure are less than 10\%. Therefore, the theoretical model established in this study has the ability to predict the tensile failure strength of inter-layer failure of FFF 3D printing PLA material accurately.},

A new HM CFRP achieving fiber-direction compressive strength of intermediate-modulus (IM) CFRPs but with more than 30\% higher axial modulus has been recently developed. This work looks into fiber-matrix interface shear strength as a potential mechanism driving the compression strength improvement of the new material system. In-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based single fiber push-out experiments addressing standing challenges associated with manufacturing high-quality samples as well as distinguishing same-diameter HM and IM carbon fibers in the hybrid composite system are used to measure fiber-matrix interface shear strength. The experiments show a 29\% lower average value of the fiber-matrix interface shear strength for the HM carbon fibers compared to the IM carbon fibers in the new material system. Such a significant reduction corresponds to a 22\% lower fiber-direction compressive strength of the HM CFRP without the integrated IM fibers. The results support the idea of integrating off-the-shelf IM carbon fibers with a stronger fiber-matrix interface and a higher shear modulus into HM CFRPs to improve their compressive strength.},

Our previous work demonstrated that 1.0 vol\% GNP/Al composite was successfully produced via multiple wire-drawing at ambient temperature. However, the fabrication of 5.0 vol\% GNP/Al composite was not successful because of the limited cumulative shear strains. Here we described fully dispersed state of 5.0 vol\% GNP in Al by hot-drawing at an elevated temperature 400 °C. The evolution of the microstructures and mechanical properties were investigated in relation to the number of drawing passes. The ultra-fine grains with size 372 nm were obtained via dynamic recrystallization after drawing for six passes (cumulative strain 94\%). In particular, stripping of the GNP into thin layers and their preferential alignment in the wire axis occurred during the shear deformation . As a result, 5.0 vol\% GNP/Al composite produced by six-pass drawing possessed improved yield strength ( σ s , 449 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS, 461 MPa). The results demonstrated the feasibility of dispersing high-content GNP in aluminum alloys by extrusion followed by multi-pass hot drawing techniques.},

With the interwire angle increasing, the welding process stability gets improved. The arc interruptions which frequently occur in the leading arc are eliminated when the interwire angle is &gt;0°. The mutual electromagnetic attraction between the two arcs decreases with the interwire angle increasing due to the increased arc distance. The two arcs move from the groove bottom to the sidewalls, which transfer more heat to the sidewalls resulting in increased weld width. This leads to serious undercutting defects especially when the interwire angle is 20°. The molten metal under the arcs flows to the rear of welding pool under the action of plasma drag force, arc pressure and droplet impingement. As a result, there is no adequate molten metal to fill the sidewalls, giving rise to undercutting defects. The undercutting at the groove sidewall close to the trailing arc is smaller. This is because the liquid metal under the trailing arc is more massive, which means more molten metal flows to the sidewall, alleviating the undercutting defect.},

  abstract     = {Twinning and shear bands are two main deformation structures in magnesium alloys at low temperatures, however, the relationship between these two deformation structures is still under debate. To clarify their relationship and behaviours at low temperatures, rolling tests to various thickness reductions at room temperature (RT) and liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT) were conducted for AZ31 magnesium alloys. The evolutions of shear bands and twinning, and their interactions with geometrically necessary dislocation (GND), were observed during the RT- and LNT-rolling process. Abundant shear bands, evolving from {10 1 ¯ 1¯ 1}-{10 1 ¯ 1¯ 2} double twins (DTWs), were observed in the RT-rolled samples, while a high quantity of twins, including {10 1 ¯ 1¯ 2} tension twins (TTWs), twin-twin interactions and twinning sequence, were observed in the LNT-rolled samples. More importantly, a rarely observed twinning sequence behaviour, namely primary TTW-TTW interactions→ secondary TTW-TTW interactions, creating a 45° 2¯1¯ &gt; misorientation peak, was studied. Abundant GNDs accumulated around these twin-twin interactions, twinning sequence, DTWs and shear bands, while the GND density was low around TTWs. This research delivers a systematic investigation into the deformation structures in Mg alloys during the rolling process from RT to cryogenic temperature and provides insights into the newly discovered twinning sequence and twin-twin interactions.},

  abstract     = {In this research work, graphene-based highly, conductive, flexible, washable, and breathable textile electrodes have been developed using the pad-dry-cure method. The results show that the electrical conductivity of the graphene-coated textile electrodes was significantly improved from 3.5 MΩ to 400 ± 5.0 kΩ for 12 padding passes. The deposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) was acquired on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated substrate using layer by layer (LbL) technique. The resultant electrodes showed decreased sheet resistance from 150 to 50 kΩ for PEDOT:PSS with a low impedance of 40–150 Hz over the electric potential of 1.0 mV for the detection of high-quality electrocardiograms (ECG) and pulse rate response in different conditions such as rest, walking and running. Consequently, the effect of post-treatment was also analyzed using 5.0 wt\% of ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. The sheet resistance was further decreased from 40 kΩ to 130 ±0.5 Ω, which is appropriate for the detection of highly sensitive pulse rate response. The study demonstrates that the pad-dry-cure method can potentially be used for the development of graphene-coated wearable electronic textiles for biomedical and health monitoring devices.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the cicada-inspired nanostructured surfaces have attracted much interest because they possess remarkable bactericidal ability. However, Gram-positive bacteria are less damageable by the nanopillar structure of a cicada wing surface compared to Gram-negative species. To overcome this shortcoming, fluoridated hydroxyapatite (FHA) is employed owing to its effective antibacterial ability against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we design a novel potential antibacterial surface by combining the cicada wing-like nanopillar structure and the FHA together to potentially exert the advantages of physical and chemical antibacterial strategies simultaneously for battling the antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria more effectively. Cicada-inspired FHA nanostructured surfaces have been successfully fabricated on acid-etched titanium (AETi) plates using an electrochemical additive manufacturing (ECAM) method for the first time. The as-prepared FHA nanopillar array consists of close-packed individual nanopillars with diameters, heights, and aspect ratios of ~65–95 nm, ~380–510 nm, and ~4.5–7.5, respectively. The chemical composition of the FHA nanopillar array is similar to that of the Ca 10 (PO 4 ) 6 (OH)F. Individual FHA nanopillars possess high crystallinity , long-range regularity, and flaw-free lattices with the [0001] orientation. Our new, cost-effective, and time-saving method for fabricating cicada-inspired FHA nanostructured surfaces could potentially endow orthopedic and dental implants with enhanced antibacterial performance for biomedical applications .},

Experimental microcompression tests displayed a strain rate sensitive behaviour in the [100] crystal orientation . The [110] and [111] orientations were less sensitive and were not used for identification. Stress-strain curve sensitivity plots revealed that the higher the strain rate, the better the sensitivity.

It was found that the addition of CF and plasticizer synergistically formed a support-structure which guaranteed the CSR to be extruded out easily in the 3DP process. The printed FSS demonstrated its highly stable properties with a gauge factor (GF) of 8–10 at different strain rate , the coincident resistance recovery process in cyclic load of different strain, as well as the stable durability with monotonous peak in 600 strain-release cycles. Furthermore, it was able to distinguish a superimposed load at frequencies of 1/12 Hz and 1/36 Hz with aids of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis. Migrating evolution of AGFs in a stretched CSR was observed to further explore and paraphrase the mechanism of resistance response and the high GF of the FSS. The printed FSS was capable to monitor the movement of various joints and further distinguish a superimposed human motion, showing its potentially practical application in soft robots and wearable electronics.},

  abstract     = {Auxetics are an interesting class of materials that expand in transverse directions when tensile loading is applied. For example, in contrast to conventional materials, an auxetic tube will increase in diameter when stretched along its axis. To date, auxetic tubular scaffolds have been proposed for applications in tissue engineering and soft robotics; however, they have not yet been routinely produced in precisely-engineered microfibre structures using the melt electrowriting additive manufacturing method. Using a custom melt electrowriting device and rotating mandrel collector, scaffolds with a re-entrant honeycomb unit cell pattern were designed and fabricated from polycaprolactone microfibres. These scaffolds were tensile tested to characterise their auxetic properties compared to traditional crosshatch-patterned tubular scaffolds. The auxetic scaffolds exhibited an increase in diameter up to 80.8\%, as predicted from the unit cell pattern at maximum strain of 14.1\%, resulting in a Poisson&#39;s ratio of −5.8. By comparison, crosshatch scaffolds exhibited a similar stress-strain profile to the auxetic tubular scaffold with identical pore size, however significant radial compression was observed leading to a Poisson&#39;s ratio of +5.7. This study reports the design and fabrication of auxetic tubular microfibre scaffolds fabricated via melt electrowriting for the first time and offers a versatile fibre patterning system towards applications in biofabrication and robotics.},

No obvious correlation is found between size dependence of strength and the number of elements in these alloys, but an inverse relation is observed between size effect exponent and the Peierls&#39; stress. The single arm source strengthening model was successfully applied on the entire range of samples from the fcc pure elements to fcc equiatomic MPE alloys. Moreover, the activation volumes (~10 b 3 to ~100 b 3 ) are consistent among the MPE alloys, indicating the main deformation mechanism is similar in these alloys: dislocation-solute and dislocation-dislocation interactions.},

By virtue of the recent advances in multi-material 3D printing technology, new opportunities have emerged to customize the shape memory property from the perspective of composite material design. In this work, we propose a novel layout design strategy to 3D print multi-material composites incorporating heat-responsive SMP and flexible elastomer . Under a given volume ratio of SMP and elastomer, distinct shape memory performances are obtained for different material layouts. The underlying mechanisms are theoretically investigated based on the mechanics of composite materials and finite element (FE) simulations are conducted to provide quantitative predictions for the experimental results. As a demonstration, composites of different material layouts are used as building blocks to fabricate bilayer laminates where the incompatibility of shape fixity are pre-embedded to trigger the programmed active bending.},

We focus on two most important metal AM processes: (a) Laser Direct Energy Deposition (LDED) and (b) Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The ABAQUS AM module is employed to simulate both processes as it provides an automated interface allowing the user to define event data, such as element activation and heat input, as a function of both position and time to achieve process simulation of complex 3D parts. For the LDED processes , thin wall components are simulated, and residual stresses predictions are compared with both FIB-DIC and XRD measurement results at different scales. For the SLM process, overhanging structures with different support thicknesses are simulated and compared with experimental part distortion after support removal. It is shown that the support thickness together with selected process and material properties play a key role in resulting distortions.},

In this paper, the microstructure evolution and elemental diffusion behavior near the interface of the diffusion couple composed of Cr 2 AlC and single crystal superalloy DD5 were investigated at 1100 °C, 1150 °C, and 1200 °C. Elemental interdiffusion between Cr 2 AlC and DD5 occurs significantly, resulting in the formation of a thick layer of Kirkendall holes after 20 h heat treatment at 1100 °C and higher temperatures. The outward diffusion of Ni into Cr 2 AlC and the inward diffusion of Al into DD5 alloy causes the formation of β-NiAl matrix embedded with dispersed Cr 7 C 3 phase. Simultaneously, the precipitation of σ-TCP phase and degradation of the γ/γ′ matrix occurs in the alloy. Additionally, TaC, M 2 C (where M = Ta, W, Cr), and M 23 C 6 (M = Cr, Re, W) compounds are formed near the interface along with the dissolution of σ-TCP phases. It is further found that Al in Cr 2 AlC exhibits the highest average effective diffusion coefficient among the four dominant diffusing elements. It also displays the lowest diffusion activation energy which is due to its relatively weak Cr Al and Al Al bonds.},

As an application, we present a formulation to optimize heat dissipating structures to enhance structural and thermal performance. The pore size, resolution, and porosity of the structures can be controlled to obtain optimized mechanical and thermal performances. Several controlling schemes are introduced which can tailor the design of the porous structures. Design approaches based on the functional variation of porosity, pore size and sensitivity-based porosity control are employed. Numerical examples with different structural loads, thermal loads and boundary conditions are presented to verify the formulation and show the efficacy of the implementation. We also investigate the effect of the controlling parameters on the overall design. The proposed formulation shows good promise to design functionally graded porous structures with targeted porosity in multi-physics systems.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from decellularized tissues and organs has been used as a biological scaffold in a variety of pre-clinical and clinical applications. However, the lack of mechanical properties and shape controllability is a drawback. In contrast, synthetic polymers can be easily engineered with good mechanical performance, but they have limited biological functionality. In this study, we explored a new method to electrospun cartilage-derived extracellular matrix (cECM) and polycaprolactone (PCL) composite nanofibrous membranes. The cartilage is a compact tissue for which electrospinning is difficult. To overcome this problem, the cartilage was sliced into pieces, milled into powders, and digested into a looser structure. The cECM/PCL (mass ratio 50:50) hybrid nanofibers appeared to be smooth, thinner, and uniform with enhanced mechanical properties and wettability compared to the electrospun PCL. Meanwhile, the presence of cECM in the cECM/PCL nanofibrous membranes significantly promoted chondrocyte proliferation in vitro and facilitated cartilage regeneration in vivo . All these results indicate that the cECM/PCL nanofibrous membranes fabricated with good mechanical properties and biocompatibility may represent a promising scaffold for cartilage regeneration. Moreover, this work may offer a convenient and cost-effective method to synthesize ECM-based hybrid nanofibrous scaffolds for other tissue applications.},

In vitro release profile of this nanomembrane exhibited prolonged release profile (~35 days) compared to other extended-release systems of LAs studied so far.

Furthermore, in vivo safety profile of nanomembrane in single or combined use was confirmed by symptomatic, histological and pharmacokinetic analysis.

Besides, the methods utilized in previous researches to construct tissue-engineered osteochondral construct were time-consuming, laborious, complicated, costly and difficult to ensure the quality and integration of multilayered construction. Inspired by the application of titanium mesh cage (TMC) for bone graft in spinal fusion surgery, we attempt to 3D print an integrated tri-layered scaffold with Titanium-Mesh-Cage base which could be filled with autogenous cancellous bone for bone graft to the osteochondral defect. Finally, the results of repairing cartilage defects of knee with this scaffold in goat model were evaluated.

Finite element simulations were carried out to determine the mode I, II and III stress intensity factor distributions over the sample width as well as the geometry factors. Notched samples were prepared in GaAs single crystals by focused ion beam milling. Two crack systems were investigated to improve the understanding of the cleavage behavior in this anisotropic material. Critical stress intensity factors were measured for mode I, II and III loading for the first time on the microscale. Fracture toughness under mode I loading was measured using micro-cantilevers and found to be 0.54 ± 0.04 MPa√m and 0.50 ± 0.05 MPa√m for the {100}〈110〉 and {110}〈100〉 crack systems, respectively. In-plane shear loading (mode II) led to crack kinking and a fracture toughness of 0.48 ± 0.05 MPa√m and 0.72 ± 0.01 MPa√m. Out-of-plane shear loading (mode III) led to multiple kinking processes and the highest fracture toughness of 0.80 ± 0.13 MPa√m and 0.84 ± 0.07 MPa√m. This is most likely due to the pronounced fracture anisotropy of GaAs single crystals and the comparably low resolved stresses on the {110} type cleavage planes, which demand higher critical loads for failure.},

In this work, we firstly proposed a sequential in-situ route to form polypyrrole (PPy) and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 NPs) in sequence within polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix for the hybrid hydrogels with decent mechanical, conductive, and magnetic properties simultaneously, named as Fe 3 O 4 /PPy/PVA hydrogel. The as-prepared hybrid hydrogels exhibited continuous electrons transporting path and magnetic responsive properties. Specifically, a unique combination of high electrical conductivity (up to 1.95 ± 0.17 E −4 S cm −1 ), saturation magnetization (5.42 emu g −1 ) and greatly enhanced mechanical properties (tensile strength up to 575.03 ± 28.32 kPa, elasticity modulus up to 461.19 ± 24.75 kPa). More importantly, these hybrid hydrogels demonstrated potential applications in biomedical electronic devices, such as strain sensors and magnetic navigators.},

In this pursuit, the very high cycle fatigue behavior and the relevant crack initiation mechanism of super austenitic stainless steel 654SMO was comparatively investigated at room temperature (RT) and high temperature (HT, 300 °C). It was found that the heterogeneous microstructure strongly influenced the fatigue failure mechanism, wherein the crack initiation sites transferred from fine grain clusters at the RT to coarse grains at HT. Furthermore, the cross-section of the crack initiation sites revealed that the micro-porosity and accumulative slip bands resulted in the crack originations at RT and HT, respectively. The differences of crack initiation were ascribed to the effect of elevated temperature, which weakened the sensibility of crack initiation to micro-defect in very high cycle fatigue regime. Our study provides new insights in the correlation of high temperature and heterogeneous microstructure, in regards to the crack initiation behavior.},

It is known that quasicrystal (i-phase) content and microstructure in alloys have a decisive effect on the mechanical properties and tribological performance . In this research, four (β + i)-dual-phased quasicrystal alloys with different i-phase content and grain size were developed to alleviate the brittleness of the i-phase with the help of the soft β-phase. The influences of the i-phase content and grain size were investigated through impact test, wear test, and analysis. Through the annealing process , the amount of the i-phase was increased by about 38\% (59.24\% → 81.75\%), and, besides, the grain size of the i-phase was simultaneously increased from 3.47 μm up to 9.98 μm. As the amount of i-phase increased, it was possible to increase the hardness from 712 HV to 763 HV. Meanwhile, the increased grain size (i-phase) reduced the contact stress of the grain during wear testing; thus, the specific wear rate could be decreased from 2.21 × 10 −4 mm 3 /Nm to 0.5 × 10 −4 mm 3 /Nm. Not only that, but an experimental wear equation was obtained using empirical data to predict the wear behavior of the dual-phased alloys.},

In this work, we design a Kirigami structure that can function as a thermal diode providing a symmetry-breaking of heat flux activated by an asymmetric thermal deformation . Large thermal deformation of the metamaterial by an asymmetric arrangement of bilayer-hinges in a symmetric Kirigami geometry is the fundamental principle for the design of thermal diodes. Analytical modeling of thermomechanical deformation, thermal resistance , and thermal rectification together with finite element simulations can help select two base materials and geometric modifications, finally generating a phase-map for the design of thermal diodes with the Kirigami structure. The asymmetric heat flow powered by a large directional thermal deformation can maximize a thermal rectification ratio , which is the essential requirement for the design of thermal diodes. The designed thermal diodes with the Kirigami structure produce a record-high thermal rectification ratio of ~240, implying that we open a new avenue of mechanical metamaterials in thermal engineering. The developed innovation can potentially be applied for the next generation thermal devices such as heat engines, refrigeration, thermal regulations of buildings, and thermal logic devices.},

Numerical literature studies revealed that pattern formation is restricted in (thick) boundary layers causing significant mechanical size effects. This paper aims to experimentally validate these findings on miniaturized specimens, relevant for real applications, and to investigate the effect of increased geometrical and material imperfections resulting from specimen miniaturization. To this end, miniaturized cellular metamaterial specimens are manufactured with different scale ratios, subjected to in-situ micro-compression tests combined with digital image correlation yielding full-field kinematics, and compared to complementary numerical simulations. The specimens&#39; global behaviour agrees well with the numerical predictions , in terms of pre-buckling stiffness, buckling strain and post-buckling stress. Their local behaviour, i.e. pattern transformation and boundary layer formation, is also consistent between experiments and simulations. Comparison of these results with idealized numerical studies from literature reveals the influence of the boundary conditions in real cellular metamaterial applications, e.g. lateral confinement, on the mechanical response in terms of size effects and boundary layer formation.},

  abstract     = {This work aims to enhance the dielectric and piezoelectric properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer filled with zinc oxide (ZnO) powders. Both ZnO nanoparticles and microparticles are used to prepare piezoelectric composites and a comparison of their dielectric responses is carried out. The experimental results reveal that a higher particle concentration gives rise to the increased dielectric permittivity of composites, especially when particles are aligned in the poling-direction-based dielectrophoretic process. Hence, the microparticles are chosen instead of the nano ones because the microscale facilitates the fabrication process of the composite, especially with high filler content . It also makes it possible to clearly record the movement of particles under alternating (AC) voltage application using optical microscopy. Significant improvement in the dielectric and piezoelectric behavior of the proposed composite has been successfully achieved via dielectrophoretic alignment of ZnO microparticles. This technique leads to increased connectivity between ZnO/ZnO interfaces, allowing for the creation of continuous aligned piezoelectric particles inside the polymer matrix . As a result, the piezoelectric effect is considerably boosted. Finally, the dielectric constant, as well as the charge coefficient of the ZnO particles , is estimated through theoretical approaches for composites containing particles arranged in chains or randomly dispersed. The model predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, a finite element model (FEM) is developed using Comsol Multiphysics to evaluate these parameters in a 3D structure, which is then compared to those obtained by the above 2D-analytic models.},

  abstract     = {Complex multi-chamber nanostructures are difficult to prepare in a facile and straightforward manner although they are very useful for designing novel functional nanomaterials. In this study, based on the application of electrospun monolithic composites, a new tri-chamber composite nano structure was fabricated using a special trifluid electrospinning. The composite structure had a common shell and two separate cores, and thus was termed as a sheath-separate-core structure. A homemade structural spinneret was developed to assemble an electrospinning system for fabrication. All the three core/sheath sections of the sheath-separate-core structure were monolithic composites consisting of pH-sensitive polymers ( i.e. Eudragit® series) and an active ingredient (paracetamol). The sheath-separate-core composite nano structure was able to combine the performances of the three electrospun monolithic nanocomposites to provide a smart controlled release profile according to the physiological characteristics of the digestive tract. The reported protocol opens a new way for designing and producing novel functional nanomaterials based on a complex nanostructure and the related process-structure-performance relationship.},

  abstract     = {The compatibility between the majority of thermoplastic veils (TPVs) and epoxies is typically poor, owing to the inherently low surface energies of thermoplastics. This tends to largely affect the toughening performance of TPVs as interlayer materials of carbon fibre/epoxy composites. The traditional methods for surface activation of thermoplastics, such as corona discharge , plasma treatment and acid etches, are not applicable to TPVs as they could cause significant damage to the thermoplastic fibres with nano-/micro-scale diameters. Herein, a UV-irradiation technique was proposed to active the surfaces of polyphenylene-sulfide (PPS) veils, that effectively improved their adhesion with epoxies. Consequently, the effects of an improved veil/epoxy adhesion on the mode-I and mode-II fracture behaviour and corresponding fracture mechanisms of the interleaved laminates were investigated. It was found that an improved veil/epoxy adhesion significantly enhanced the toughening performance of the PPS veils for the laminates manufactured by resin transfer moulding of non-crimp fabrics, by introducing additional carbon fibre delamination and significant PPS fibre damage during the fracture process. In contrast, the increased level of veil/epoxy adhesion inhibited PPS fibre bridging during the fracture process of the laminates produced from unidirectional prepregs , and caused considerable adverse effects on the fracture performance.},

However, developing highly efficient anode materials for the relatively larger radius of Na + and K + ions is still a hot issue. Herein, we report spherical nanoflowers of vanadium disulfide (VS 2 ) with thin petals of 15 nm and high purity of crystallinity , synthesized by one-pot solvothermal method using propylene glycol as solvent without any growth-directing surfactants . Results demonstrate that this spherical nanoflower structure provides a stable framework for Na + /K + insertion/extraction, wherein, SNF-VS 2 not only shows a reversible charge capacity of 329 mAh/g at 0.2 A/g with an initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 88.52\% for sodium ion storage, but also delivers a reversible charge capacity of 383 mAh/g at 25 mA/g, owning an ICE of 74.09\% for potassium ion storage. The high capacity and outstanding ICE make the spherical VS 2 nanoflowers ranking among the most effective transition metal dichalcogenide based anode materials and strongly indicate their promising usability for practical SIB and KIB applications. And the outperforming Na + /K + storage performance is largely due to the abundant interface area with electrolyte and the short ion diffusion paths formed by their ordered flower-like structure.},

In this paper, we will discuss the factors affecting the predicted results of geometrical models by analyzing the whole calculation procedures. When the experimental data is constant, it is found that the predicted results are mainly affected by two factors, which can be concluded as the fitting order of Redlich-Kister equation and the selection rules of three representative points. The influences of the two factors are analyzed in the viscosity prediction of Au-Cu-Ag ternary system .},

Herein, a simple nondestructive method was developed to prepare modified AF with zinc oxide (ZnO) micro-nano structures. Assisted by the adhesion and secondary functionalization of poly L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (PDOPA), ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully “ seeded ” onto the AF surface, and subsequently ZnO nanowires (NWs) were grown on the seed layer. As a result, the surface modification did not cause the significant changes of the tensile strength , and the surface roughness and UV resistance of the modified fibers were significantly improved. After 168 h of UV exposure, the retention of the tensile strength for the modified fiber was as high as 97.2\%. Comparing with the pristine AF-reinforced composite, the interfacial shear strengths of AF-PDOPA-ZnO NP/epoxy resin and AF-PDOPA-ZnO NW/epoxy resin composites increased by 31.8\% and 37.8\%, respectively. Therefore, this effectively nondestructive modification method to grow ZnO nanostructures on a polymer substrate exhibits an extensive application prospect for organic fibers and their composites.},

We evaluate the performance limits of the metallic-glass wave springs, and consider how the undulatory behaviour can be exploited. The metallic-glass springs can operate over the same load-ranges as commercially available crystalline wave springs, but have material volumes (and therefore weights) that are one to two orders of magnitude less. Their energy storage per unit material volume is as high as 2600 kJ m − 3 . We suggest that the undulatory behaviour is important in rendering the springs fail-safe in case of overload. We discuss the range of applicability of thermo-elastic processing, the likely working limit of metallic-glass wave springs, and the potential for application of metallic-glass springs in MEMS devices.},

Loss-separation fitting model for the compound cores mixed with different mass fractions of FeSi powders was built to analyze the relative loss mechanism and source of each part loss. Due to the fact that the magnetic powders were coated with high-quality electrical-insulating layer, the inter-particle eddy current energy loss is only 1/400–1/800 of total energy loss. The volume fraction of non-magnetic phase and pinning effect, which are found to be sensitive to density of cores, play a significant role on both hysteresis loss and excess loss. As compared to the pure Finemet based powder cores, the Finemet/FeSi compound cores mixed with 10–14 wt\% of FeSi powders exhibit a higher permeability and a greater retained permeability at a DC-bias field of 7960 A/m.

In addition, the compressive strength of W-EP/SS bonded magnet is higher than other types of bonded magnets. W-EP/SS composite binder has excellent homogeneity, which can coat the magnetic powders uniformly during mixing and curing, and therefore forms a protective thin film on the surface of the magnet to prevent thermal oxidation under high temperature conditions as well as corrosion during chemical treatments. Moreover, the W-EP/SS composite binder, which combines the toughness of epoxy resin with the rigidity of sodium silicate, endows bonded magnets better mechanical properties .

Nanoamorphous particles mix with oxide particles attached to the wear surface, which provide a lubrication state during dry sliding friction of pearlite steels. HRTEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps show alternating ferrite-amorphous-ferrite lamellar features in the tribolayer. MD simulation results show that ferrite-cementite nanointerfaces with the Bagaryatskii orientation play important roles in the above amorphization, which can be exposited by the deformation response between the ferrite and cementite being inconsistent. A high density of dislocation defects destroys the ferrite-cementite interfaces to create an amorphous nucleation region, and after nucleation, the amorphization will expand into the cementite. This study lays the theoretical basis for revealing the mechanism of cementite amorphization in the tribolayer and will provide new ideas for designing and manufacturing amorphous self-lubricating films or solid materials.},

  abstract     = {Here, we present directed energy deposition (DED) of wrought-like Al 5xxx AlMg alloy by Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS®). A transition from an Al 5083 gas atomized powder feedstock to Al 5754 characteristics of the as-deposited material due to selective evaporation of Mg was observed. Density values obtained by X-ray micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) were compared to those obtained by the Archimedes method. The latter indicated a relative density as high as 99.26\%. Possible origins of porosity are discussed. The as-deposited material was comprised of both equiaxed and columnar grains with no preferred crystallographic orientation and mean grain size of 36 μm. The Young&#39;s modulus , yield stress, ultimate tensile strength , fracture strain , Poisson&#39;s ratio , and total ultimate strain energy (toughness) were determined by uniaxial tensile tests combined with digital image correlation (DIC). Fractography complemented the mechanical testing. A pulse-echo ultrasonic non-destructive test was used to obtain more accurate values of the Young&#39;s and shear moduli and to adjust the value of the yield strength accordingly. The measured mechanical properties meet the requirements of international standards for wrought Al 5754 in its annealed condition.},

Finally, a ballistic assessment of multi-perforated disk (MPD) propellant was carried out using a 30 mm test gun. The results showed that no signs of porosity or defects existed in the propellant printed by the SLA technique. The compression strength and tensile strength were 21.6 MPa and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The 3D-printed propellant exhibited a relatively low linear burn rate and a high pressure exponent value of 1.46.

In this study, the biomedical titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) was covered by yttrium doped titanium dioxide (Y-TiO 2 ) coating via a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) method. By changing the concentration of yttrium acetate in the electrolyte, Y-TiO 2 coating with different mass ratios of yttrium were obtained. The structure morphology and chemical composition of the Y-TiO 2 coating were systematically characterized. The results indicated that the porous and micro-nanostructured Y-TiO 2 coatings were constructed by the pores smaller than 4 μm. Definitely yttrium was not only distributed on the surface but also embedded in the coating. Yttrium mainly existed in form of Y 2 O 3 and Y 3+ state in prepared TiO 2 coating. Element release profiles confirmed that yttrium release slowly from Y-TiO 2 for 32 days. Cell culture tests demonstrated that Y-TiO 2 coating exhibited good biocompatibility on osteoblastic precursor cells and fibroblasts cells with increasing doping concentration of yttrium. Bacteriostasis experiments revealed that Y-TiO 2 coating possess excellent antibacterial property against Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ). Thus, the prepared Y-TiO 2 coating with outstanding biocompatibility and antibacterial capacity provided a preferred strategy for the repair and reconstruction of bone tissues in dentistry and orthopedics.},

In this study, Digital light processing (DLP)-based printing of multichannel NGCs for peripheral nerve regeneration by using gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels was presented. Multichannel NGCs with different inner diameters were successfully fabricated using desired patterns, and optimal printing parameters were investigated. In vitro co-culturing of PC12 cells demonstrated that NGCs supported the survival, proliferation, and migration of neural cells along the longitudinal channel. The results also showed that neural crest stem cells could be induced to differentiate into neurons on fabricated conduits. This method will provide a rapid and accurate manner to fabricate complex NGCs, which can be potentially used to repair peripheral nerves.},

  abstract     = {Most elastomeric vitrimers suffer from mechanical weakness in practical applications. Inspired by the development of strong and tough biomaterials relying on sacrificial bond-detachment mechanisms, herein we describe the biomimetic design of elastomeric vitrimers with mechanical robustness, preservable malleability, and recyclability by engineering sacrificial metal-ligand coordination bonds into exchangeable networks. In particular, we use a commercially available metal complex, aluminum acetylacetonate (Al(acac) 3 ), to catalyze cross-linking based on the silylation reaction between hydroxylated natural rubber and hydrosilanes, thus introducing dynamic silyl ether-based architectures into the rubber matrix . At the same time, the Al 3+ ions can interact with the free oxygen-containing moieties on the rubber skeleton, enabling labile Al 3+ O coordination bonds in the covalent framework to substantially dissipate mechanical energy through reversible bond detachment/reattachment upon deformation. As the organic acetylacetonate ligands of Al(acac) 3 can facilitate the dispersion of Al 3+ ions in the matrix, incorporating a small amount of organometallic complex (0.68 wt\% of elastomer matrix) achieves an unparalleled improvement of the strength , modulus, and toughness of the resulting vitrimers. Moreover, due to their temperature-dependent nature, the Al 3+ O coordination bonds will partially dissociate at elevated temperatures, which only slightly compromises the topological rearrangements of the silyl ether-based network, but barely affects the reprocessability.},

Topography analysis results indicate that when the cutting direction is not along a-axis or c-axis, the spalling defects of conventional cutting groove are asymmetric because the probabilities of activated cleavage/twinning systems vary with machining direction; however, the vibrational cutting groove presents better symmetry and less spalling owning to the propagation of stress wave. The cross-section of cutting groove was obtained by focus ion beam cutting. The cross-section analysis shows that the subsurface defects of conventional cutting groove involve median cracks and lateral cracks , and the main propagating path of cracks is towards downward, which is the cause of the generation of serious spalling; however, lateral cracks are the main defect in the subsurface of the vibrational cutting groove, and they mainly propagate towards the free surface and give rise to material removal. The subsurface quality of cutting groove with ultrasonic assistance is better than that of the conventional cutting groove. It is evident that ultrasonic vibration can prevent the median crack from extending towards bulk material and contribute to improve the uniformity of groove quality.},

The latest research in twinning provides us an overview of new metallic and semiconductor materials based on a better understanding of changes in material properties (like electrical, mechanical, optical, and magnetic properties). It is important to understand how defects and impurities change the characteristics of the materials, as it may be unrealistic to manufacture materials completely free of defects or impurities. Therefore, the types of impurities (defects) in the specific application should be defined or differentiated whether they are desirable or not. The issues related to nanotwinnng defects have been helpful in understanding the current characterization tools that are capable of identifying and detecting defects in different forms of materials. Despite the potential applicability of NT materials, the impact of NT structures on material properties are still in the early stages of research.

Firstly, a parametric level set method is incorporated with the numerical homogenization method to topologically optimize a series of microstructural unit cells with different NPRs. Then, the nonlinear static analysis is respectively applied to different unit cells to check their GS behavior . Secondly, typical microstructures with GS property are selected and simplified to perform the subsequent parametric design to analyze the expected property. Thirdly, the obtained mechanical metamaterials are fabricated by using the additive manufacturing (AM). GS properties of the obtained designs are analyzed and verified by both the simulation and compression experiments. Results show that we could obtain the GS mechanical metamaterial based on NPR properties for their similar characteristics. This study demonstrates that the proposed design framework is effective to tailor innovative layouts of the GS mechanical metamaterials.},

Shortages have been particularly prevalent in western countries which typically rely upon global supply chains to obtain these types of device from low-cost economies. National calls for the repurposing of domestic mass-production facilities have the potential to meet medical requirements in coming weeks, however the immediate demand associated with the virus has led to the mobilisation of a diverse distributed workforce. Selection of appropriate manufacturing processes and underused supply chains is paramount to the success of these operations. A simplified medical face shield design is presented which repurposes an assortment of existing alternative supply chains. The device is easy to produce with minimal equipment and training.

  abstract     = {Owing to its benefit of changing stiffness, Magnetorheological Elastomers (MRE) can be effectively used as base isolator in buildings and bridges to resist unpredictable loading conditions e.g. seismic activities. This research aims to study the effects of using Iron nanoparticles in silicon rubber matrix on dynamic properties of MRE&#39;s and to make MRE more adaptable to seismic forces, specifically at high strains. Micro-sized iron particles were reduced to nanoparticles using a planetary ball milling machine. Samples, using a mixture of nano &amp; microparticles were prepared for different percentage concentrations. The experimental test rig was set up for dynamic shear testing under known amplitude, frequency, and magnetic flux density summing up to total 180 tests. The experimental results revealed that the use of nanoparticles had a significant increase in the effective stiffness by 13\% at higher strains and low flux values. Further attaining MR effect at a higher frequency is difficult using only larger sized fillers however for hybrid MREs, the magnetrheological effect was higher for higher frequency. The maximum MR effect was observed for samples with 40\% iron content.},

  abstract     = {This work shows the design of highly porous membranes with tunable wettability based on poly(2- n -propyl-2-oxazoline) (P n PrOx) nanofibers . Wicking and advanced contact angle experiments demonstrate the high potential for applications requiring specific interactions with aqueous media . P n PrOx is a popular member among the biocompatible poly(2-oxazoline)s due to its thermoresponsiveness in aqueous solutions, enabling the production of ‘smart materials’. On material level, however, many interesting properties of this polymer remain undiscovered. Electrospinning is an ideal technique to transfer the properties observed in solutions to end-material properties, as the polymer is processed into highly porous, nanofibrous membranes. P n PrOx&#39; electrospinnability is here investigated in environmentally friendly ethanol/water solvent systems, ensuring industrial scalability. The nanofibrous membranes show increased hydrophobicity exhibiting the rose-petal effect. Upon functionalization with tannic acid, the hydrophobic membranes are transformed into hydrophilic nanofibers showing water-stability in both fresh and salty water, even below the polymer cloud point temperature. By varying the tannic acid amount, the hydrophilicity can be fine-tuned as the contact area between water droplets and surface, the rate and manner of water uptake and the extent of the rose-petal effect can be manipulated easily. Hence an interesting material is designed for applications in which water caption and transport are important.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the effects of heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of extruded 2196 Al-Cu-Li alloy were examined and the precipitation behavior and strengthening mechanism were investigated. It was found that the solution treatment and artificial aging had a significant strengthening effect on the mechanical properties of the extruded alloy, which was related to the type, size, number density, and distribution of the precipitates. Most of the second phases dissolved back into the matrix after solution treatment. The precipitation sequence of 2196 alloy during aging treatment was identified as: supersaturated solid solution→ GP zone + δ′/β′ (Al 3 (Li,Zr)) → δ′ + θ′ (Al 2 Cu) + T 1 (Al 2 CuLi) → θ′ + T 1 , where T 1 phase played a leading role in the precipitation strengthening. The fracture mechanism changed from ductile fracture to intergranular fracture . The pre-stretching deformation can introduce a large number of vacancies and dislocations, which provide conditions for atomic diffusion and precipitation of the phases, and further improve the mechanical properties of the alloy. Besides, pre-stretching can effectively shorten the time required for peak strengthening, which is only 20\% of the time needed in single-stage peak-aging (170 °C/36 h). Finally, the optimal heat treatment process of 2196 Al-Cu-Li alloy was determined as: 515 °C/90 min solution treatment+3\% pre-stretching+170 °C/16 h artificial aging.},

  abstract     = {Wetting behaviors of structured metal surfaces have received considerable attention due to the wide range of applications for commercial, industrial, and military uses as well as fundamental research interests. Due to its adaptability, precision, and ease of automation, laser-based texturing techniques are desirable platforms to create micro- and nano-structures, including laser-induced periodic surface structures, or hierarchical structures on a metal substrate. However, micro- and nanostructures alone often do not achieve the desired wettability . A subsequent surface chemistry modification method must be performed to attain target extreme wettability for laser textured metal substrates. This review aims to provide a systematic understanding of the interdependence of surface chemistry modification and physical surface structures formed during the laser-based surface engineering methods . The role of surface chemistry on top of the surface structures is presented to decide the final wetting scenario. Specifically, by controlling the surface chemistry of a laser textured surface , wetting can be modulated from extreme hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity , allowing freedom to achieve complex multi-wettability situations. In each section, we highlight the most fruitful approaches and underlying mechanisms to achieve a fitting combination of surface structures and surface chemistry. Durability and stability of the treated surface are also discussed in corrosive and abrasive environments. Finally, challenges in current studies and prospects in future research directions of this rapidly developing field are also discussed. This review will provide a comprehensive guideline for the design of laser texturing methods and the fabrication of extreme wetting surfaces for metal alloys.},

Among the different strategies developed in the latest few years for the targeted delivery of nanotherapeutics, homotypic membrane-membrane recognition is one of the most promising and efficient. In this work, we present an innovative drug-loaded nanocarrier with improved targeting properties based on the homotypic recognition of GBM cells. The developed nanoplatform consists of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) and coated with cell membranes (CM) extracted from GBM cells (Dox-CM-BNNTs). We demonstrated as Dox-CM-BNNTs are able to specifically target and kill GBM cells in vitro , leaving unaffected healthy brain cells, upon successful crossing an in vitro blood-brain barrier model. The excellent targeting performances of the nanoplatform can be ascribed to the protein component of the membrane coating, and proteomic analysis of differently expressed membrane proteins present on the CM of GBM cells and of healthy astrocytes allowed the identification of potential candidates involved in the process of homotypic cancer cell recognition.},

Torsional shear strength and elastic properties of an adhesively bonded glass-to-steel component were measured on several joined steel-to-steel and steel-to-glass samples. An epoxy resin-based adhesive was used as joining material for AISI304 steel and soda-lime glass. The same steel and adhesive were used to obtain steel-to-steel joined sample bars to be tested in asymmetrical four-point bending, for comparison purposes. The indentation elastic modulus of the adhesive, both inside the joined region and as a bulk, was measured by nano-indentation and impulse excitation technique. Finally, the effect of etching on the glass was studied and correlated to the glass-steel joint strength. This study shows that torsion test can be used to provide reliable shear strength values for design and modelling glass-to-steel adhesive joined components.},

The results reveal that the valence effect of raw materials plays an essential role in the evolution of structural and electrical parameters, especially in the resistivity and aging coefficient. XPS quantitative analysis and Raman drift further prove that the Jahn-Teller distortion induced by Mn 3+ cations changes the resistivity and thermal stability. Importantly, a novel double-hopping conduction model was proposed to elucidate the development of electrical properties. It indicates that the valence-induced distortion controls the resistivity and thermal stability of Co 2.77 Mn 1.71 Fe 1.10 Zn 0.42 O 8 ceramics. The research of the relationship between material properties and the valence of the raw materials can be helpful to guide the production and experiment process.

  abstract     = {Stereolithography (SL) is a promising 3D printing method for the fabrication of high dielectric constant polymer matrix composites (high- k PMCs) because of its high geometric accuracy and few manufacturing defects. However, the presence of ceramic filler destroys the fluidity and transparency of high- k PMCs, reducing their 3D printability. In this study, we fabricated barium titanate microspheres (BT-S) to facilitate the SL-based 3D printing of high- k PMCs using radio-frequency thermal plasma spheroidization (RF-TPS) technology. Experimental results showed that the prepared BT-S particles have spherical shape, smooth surface, large particle size, improved mechanical strength and higher purity, which lead to the enhancement in the 3D printability of UV curable high- k composites: i) the employment of BT-S significantly reduces the apparent viscosity and yield stress; and ii) the UV curing depth increased by 542\% maximum. As a result, high- k composites were successfully printed using digital light processing (DLP) technique under low UV light energy . Moreover, the increase of dielectric constant was experimentally verified, which is explained by electrostatic energy increment according to finite element method (FEM) simulations. This study provided an effective approach (i.e. RF-TPS technology) to enhance the 3D printability of high- k PMCs, and also promoted the usage of SL-based 3D printing in advanced electrical and electronic components},

  abstract     = {This paper reports an experimental and theoretical investigation on the fatigue performance enhancement of damaged steel structures by bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) systems considering the temperature effects. First, thermomechanical properties of the epoxy adhesive and CFRPs were examined via dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile tests . The appropriate curing procedure for the structural adhesive was obtained. Next, the fatigue behavior of notched steel plates strengthened by bonded CFRPs was investigated at different temperatures. During the fatigue tests , beach marking and back-face strain techniques were used to monitor the fatigue crack growth on steel components and the damage evolution within the bonding interface. The results show that the high-temperature resistance of the epoxy adhesive can be effectively improved by increasing the curing temperature and duration. The properly cured bonded CFRP patches can effectively enhance the fatigue performance of damaged steel structures. However, and the elevated temperatures significantly degrade the fatigue behavior of the CFRP-strengthened steel components.},

  abstract     = {Search for materials with high charge mobilities among the plethora of synthesizable organic semiconductors is of paramount importance for organic electronics, and virtual screening is expected to guide and streamline this process. However, a model for rapid but reliable prediction of charge mobility in organic semiconductors is still lacking. To address this challenge, a simple “diffusion-of-delocalized-polaron” model is suggested in this study. It considers the most essential factors governing the charge transport: intermolecular electronic coupling, electron-phonon interaction, charge delocalization, static and dynamic disorder. The suggested model reproduces experimental charge mobilities in various organic semiconductors remarkably well, and significantly outperforms another approach previously used for screening of organic semiconductors – the Marcus model. Moreover, charge mobility values predicted by our model are closer to the experiment than those provided by the two state-of-the-art approaches – quantum nuclear tunneling model and second-order cumulant expansion of the density matrix – and are on par with the popular transient localization theory. It is thus anticipated that the suggested model is an efficient tool for the search of high-mobility materials, revealing of structure-mobility relationships and rational design of organic semiconductors. Its possible integration with crystal structure prediction can boost the development of organic electronics.},

A new zone named “triangle zone” (TZ) in the RSFSWed joint was first clearly defined, while the shoulder and pin affected zone (SPAZ) did not exist in the NRS-FSWed joint. The distribution of average grain sizes in each zone of the joints (“M” shape) and the changes in the proportion of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) (“W” shape) are unified with the typical “W” shape distribution of microhardness in the joints. Compared to rotational shoulder, the non-rotational shoulder significantly reduced the width of softened area. In particular, the microstructure of the joints by NRS-FSW with triple facets on the pin surface is finer, denser and more homogeneous. The tensile strength coefficient of the joint welded by NRS-FSW and NRS-FSW with the pin of triple facets increased by 2.3\% and 11.6\%, respectively, compared to the joint welded by RSFSW. Accordingly, the fatigue performances increased by 1.72 times and 3.19 times, respectively.},

Here we evaluated the properties of the fungal composite material produced by novel fungal strains, including Trichoderma asperellum and Agaricus bisporus , grown on oat husk and rapeseed cake after oil pressing. The results showed that the mycelium composites were hydrophobic and strong, particularly when grown on rapeseed cake.

The system is capable to perform indents from small scale up to large indentation depths due to the combination of a 1 N actuator and a frame stiffness of &gt; 1 · 10 6 N m 1·106Nm even at 1100 °C. Dynamic testing allows a continuous determination of the contact stiffness (CSM) and thus also the depth-dependent hardness and indentation modulus. Low drift rates can be achieved by an independent tip and sample heating. Operating the nanoindenter inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a high temperature backscattered electron (BSE) detector opens the possibility of in-situ observations, as high vacuum minimizes oxidation effects. The HT capability of the system is demonstrated on three reference materials: fused silica , molybdenum assessing the change in modulus with increasing temperature using constant strain rate tests (CSR). The creep response of single crystalline Ni has been assessed by strain rate jump (SRJ) as well as a step-load and hold creep (SLH) method. The resulting modulus, hardness as well as the strain rate sensitivity from RT up to 1100 °C are in good accordance with literature data, highlighting the applicability of the system.},

Whereas, an OCB can deform in an undesirable incomplete diamond mode when its shape approaches that of a conventional tube. Additionally, the manufacture of OCBs is still complicated because it involves welding process . Therefore, a novel origami-ending tube (OET) is proposed in this paper. This OET was designed by introducing some small triangular origami patterns into the ends of the tube module, which greatly simplified the manufacturing process because it did not require welding. The validation experiments showed that the OET could deform in DM with a 46\% reduction of F max and a 99\% increase of F m , compared to the conventional tube, even though the geometry of the OET was very close to that of a conventional tube. Combined with the results drawn from the validation experiments, parameters and comparison studies, it could be concluded that the OET performed better than the OCB.},

Herein, an artificial lightning strike experiment was designed to simulate the real-life conditions and investigate the influence of lightning strike on a quasi-isotropic CFRP sample. The lightning strike and corresponding degradation process were observed by using a high-speed camera and infrared thermal imaging. Moreover, lightning-induced damage was assessed by visual inspection and non-destructive testing. The damage behavior of CFRP composites was deduced by analyzing the lightning process and damage modes. The results reveal that the damage is caused by the electro-thermo-mechanical response due to lightning arc flow and Joule heating ablation due to the conductive nature of the CFRP composites. The current work provides an enhanced understanding of the failure mechanism under lightning strike and outlines instructional suggestions to refine the numerical model of lightning-induced damage of CFRP for further study.},

Results show that recrystallization is completed after annealing 8 h at 650 °C and 30 min at 700 °C. Three types of precipitates were identified: large Ti(C,N), medium-size (Ti,V)(C,N) and small (Ti,V)C. The Ti/(Ti+V) atomic ratio in the (Ti,V)C precipitates decreases with increasing radius in the 1–15 nm range, which can be explained by the initial nucleation of a TiC-rich core. The average size of the (Ti,V)C precipitates increases, whereas the number density decreases during annealing. The volume fractions of the three types of precipitates were separately determined by the matrix dissolution method. The volume fractions of (Ti,V)C precipitates obtained by matrix dissolution are comparable even slightly more accurate than those obtained by SANS. The hardness first increases and then decreases when annealing at both temperatures, which can be correlated well with the observed microstructural and precipitate evolution.},

Although there is no atomic pair with positive enthalpy of mixing, nm scale phase separation occurs in the as-melt-spun amorphous alloy , exhibiting double-halo diffraction pattern . The amorphous matrix consisting of two different nm-scale Al-rich and Si-rich amorphous phases polymorphically crystallizes into a metastable hexagonal phase by an interface-controlled nucleation and growth mechanism in the first step of crystallization. The metastable hexagonal phase transforms into the mixture of α-Al, Si and Al 3 Ni phases possibly by a ternary eutectoid reaction in the second step of crystallization.},

  abstract     = {Despite the wide and long-term applications of ultrasonic (US) wire bonding and other US metal joining technologies, the mechanism of microweld changes during the bonding process, including formation, deformation and breakage, is rarely known as it is very difficult to be investigated by experiments. In this work, this mechanism under different surface topographies and displacement patterns is studied by molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that microwelds can be formed or broken instantly. Due to the relative motion between the local wire part and the local substrate part, microwelds can be largely deformed or even broken. The impacts of material, surface topography, approaching distance and vibration amplitude on the microweld changes are investigated via the quantification of the shear stress and the equivalent bonded area. It is shown that these four factors significantly influence the final connection and the interface structure . The analysis of the scale influence on the microweld changes shows that the simulation results at a small-scale are able to represent those at a large-scale which is close to the range of the commonly used surface roughness . This deeper understanding on the microweld changes leads to a better control strategy and an enhancement of the bonding process.},

Results display that the optimum healing temperature (OHT) of each bitumen (wherever unaged or aged) is in the phase transition (PT) zone, and is lower than its softening point, followed by its Newtonian flow temperature. Two types of healing crossover temperature points are found in the healing-temperature curves of polymer modified bitumen (PMB) samples with various aging degrees, indicating the complexity of self-healing transition phenomenon in the aged PMB samples. Hence, the evaluation of aging effects on the self-healing ability of PMBs should be performed in a wide temperature range. Furthermore, the self-healing ability of PMBs is gradually weakened with the deepening of aging extents. Notably, the thermal oxidative aging imparts totally different effects to the self-healing ability of SBS-MB and PE-MB at lower temperatures. Moreover, the results of softening point test, fluorescence microscopy test, frequency sweep test and differential scanning calorimeter test convey that the altered phase structure and polymer distribution of PMBs during aging elicit the healing-temperature curves shift and self-healing transition.},

  abstract     = {The nano-impact test is a technique for high strain rate mechanical characterization of materials at the nano/microscale. However, its use has been limited so far due to the lack of appropriate methods to determine the dynamic hardness under impact conditions. The main limitation up to date has been the determination of the true applied force due to considerable inertia effects. For this reason, dynamic hardness from nano-impact tests has traditionally been computed using an energy-based approach. This work overcomes this limitation by instrumenting the test device with force-sensing capability by means of a piezoelectric load cell. The methodology was evaluated on six materials covering a wide spectrum of mechanical behaviour . The work shows that the energy-based approach used so far yields significant errors on the determination of dynamic hardness, explaining contradictory results existing in literature, and identifies the main sources of error with the aid of finite element simulations. As a result, a new energy-based approach to determine dynamic hardness that overcomes the current limitations is proposed.},

Here, a heating geometry that provides ultra-large temperature gradients is proposed. Using finite element analyses, the geometrical parameters of the proposed design were optimized through a systematic parametric investigation. The resulting temperature gradients were evaluated for electrically conductive stainless steel (SUS) 304L and insulating 8 mol\% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ). The temperature gradients within the samples were 80 and 122 °C/mm for SUS 304L and 8YSZ, respectively. The heating geometry was used to fabricate functionally graded versions of the two materials, which showed gradual changes in the porosities, grain sizes, and hardness. Lastly, the temperature gradients were then quantitatively validated through temperature measurements and single-temperature sintering experiments.},

To verify the model, fibrous monoliths (elongated hexagonal ZrB 2 -rich cells in a continuous C-rich matrix) with different volume fractions of a C-rich phase were considered. Architectures containing 10 and 30 vol\% of C-rich phase showed EFT values about 42\% more than that of pure ZrB 2 . Increasing the C-rich phase to 50 vol\%, dropped toughness significantly, which is in agreement with the experimental results. Replacing hexagonal cells with cylindrical, triangular, or square cells of the same cross-sectional area changed the toughening mechanism and EFT. The orientation of the interface between the soft and hard phases with respect to the crack orientation also affected the energy required for crack propagation , and in some cases resulted in a higher EFT (even up to 70\% of pure ZrB 2 fracture toughness) either by suppressing uniform crack propagation or making crack cranking. Results not only show that the model can predict fracture toughness but also provide insight to improve toughness by engineering different microarchitectures.},

Nonetheless, their applications in advanced electronics and industrial uses are limited by significant leakage current under high voltage, which is considered the principal cause of device energy consumption and short lifetime. Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to focus on alternative capacitor structure-based polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE-CTFE) terpolymers to efficiently limit the leakage current and lead to enhanced electrical breakdown with negligible degradation of polarization level. The novel bilayer capacitor was constructed by depositing a thin barrier layer of high polar PVDF-HFP copolymer on the terpolymer via a rapid solution-casting technique. The relationship between leakage current, dielectric strength and conduction mechanisms was investigated. Implementation of such a barrier layer led to a significant reduction (70\%) in leakage current and ferroelectric losses (approximately 90\%), thus boosting the performance of multilayered material up to 50\% of enhanced energy-storage efficiency. Experimental results are very promising, allowing to confirm that combining both terpolymer and copolymer in a hybrid multilayer design makes a possibility to achieve the best compromise in terms of energy efficiency, dielectric properties , and breakdown strength.},

The addition of zirconia was found to accumulate along alumina grain boundaries and resulted in significant grain refinement. The zirconia doping largely reduced crack formation during processing compared to that of pure alumina samples. In the case of 10 wt\% zirconia, cracking during deposition was nearly completely eliminated, but meanwhile porosity was increased. Through grain refinement and crack reduction in 10 wt\% zirconia samples, bending strength was shown to increase by nearly four times the value obtained with pure alumina. Fracture toughness was also shown to increase by 1.5 times with addition of 5 wt\% zirconia, which was attributed to the crack interaction with zirconia doped grain boundary and stress induced tetragonal to monoclinic transformation of zirconia. These findings indicated the potentials of dopants during laser direct deposition of ceramics and can further be used to tailor the properties of additively manufactured ceramic components.},

At the same time, the optimized radius at the node is introduced to reduce stress concentration. The as-built AlSi10Mg lattice was well formed without large appeared voids and cracks. A full-scale three-dimensional finite element (FE) model was established to evaluate the macroscopic deformation of the lattice structures and the microscopic stress and strain evolution in the solid struts. Local plastic stresses were found to generate near the nodes, thus forming plastic hinges , while most of the struts remain elastic.

The results show that all conversion coatings are amorphous and comprise two layers: a porous layer that contacts the substrate and a compact overlay. Coatings that are produced using a bath with Ce are more resistant to corrosion than those that are produced in a bath without Ce ions. Coatings that are stored in the Mn Ce bath for 2 weeks are significantly less resistant to corrosion than coatings that are produced using an as-prepared Mn Ce bath. The salt spray test results of coatings that are produced using the as-prepared bath and stored for 2 weeks are found similar because the bath is rendered more stable by the addition of pyrophosphate.},

Using uranium nitride as an example, a computational thermodynamic approach identified a decomposition pathway to convert uranium nitride to uranium metal at temperatures exceeding 2500 K under conditions of rapid material cooling. To realize these extreme conditions, laser-induced heating, which enables fine control of process location and rapid cooling, was utilized for high-temperature modification of material. Uranium nitride was irradiated by a controlled laser under several gaseous conditions including high-vacuum, argon, and nitrogen environments, resulting in uranium metal at yields up to 96\%. The complete decomposition leading to pure uranium metal occurs at the high temperature surface region, where laser-based heating induces a surface depression and molten pool of material. The observed kinetic phase behaviors in this study fundamentally differ from previous uranium decomposition studies where small uranium metal precipitates from the nitride bulk are formed at the surface of uranium nitride.},

  abstract     = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer manufacturing is emerging, with multiple studies to focus on the design of interfacial reinforcement to ensure the maximum of composite properties, but also respectively to be able to align with zero defect manufacturing. The controversy on the engineering approach is a data-driven task that can be efficiently tackled by involving Artificial Intelligence in order to establish unbiased structure-property relations. In the present study, nanoindentation mapping data were processed with Machine Learning classification models to identify the interfacial reinforcement. The data preparation included normalization and sorting out of highly similar data with k-means clustering, since nanoindentation on epoxy matrix does not enhance insight on the mechanism of reinforcement. The trained models included neural networks, classification trees, and support vector machines . Realization of models&#39; performance was evaluated on the test dataset as screening to obtain best fitted models for each algorithm. Transfer learning potential was demonstrated by extrapolating the prediction of best trained models to a validation dataset at different indentation depth with support vector machines outperforming the other models. Overall accuracy was 67\% on the test dataset, F1 Score was 65\% in the prediction of reinforcement mechanism classes and 72\% in case of pristine specimen, while accuracy on validation dataset was 72.7\%. Prediction metrics were comparable to other case studies of real-world classification problems. Computational time-cost for tuning and training was sustainable and equal to 2.3 min.},

The surface morphology of the coatings progressively changed from a well-defined cauliflower structure to a tetrahedral and pyramid-like structure and the cross-section morphology became more compact with Ag incorporation. A decrease of coating&#39;s hardness and Young&#39;s modulus was observed with Ag additions, due to the incorporation of the soft silver on the structure. The coatings showed excellent thermal stability and revealed a good control to the Ag diffusion towards the surface in protective atmosphere . Ag additions did not affect the onset oxidation point of films. However, the oxidation resistance of the films was reduced with Ag inclusion, due to its additional transportation during the oxidation process, promoting additional paths for ions diffusion, giving rise to a less protective Ti-Si-O layer and contributing to the formation of big crystals of rutile on the top.},

The amplification from radius = 1.8 ± 0.4 nm ultra-small silver NPs was explored. Increasing NP density redshifts and widens their plasmon that, according to simulations for NPs arrays, is originated by the reduction of the interparticle distance, d, becoming remarkable for d ≤ R . Inter-particle interaction red-shifts (&gt;130 nm) and widens (&gt;90 nm) the standard plasmon of non-interacting spherical particles. Graphene partly delocalizes the carriers enhancing the NIR spectral weight. Raman amplification of graphene phonons is moderate and depends smoothly on d while that of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) varies almost exponentially due to their location at hot-spots that depend strongly on d . The experimental correlation between amplification and plasmon position is well reproduced by simulations. The amplification originated by the ultra-small NPs is compared to that of larger particles, granular silver films with 7 &lt; R &lt; 15 nm grains, with similar extinction values. The amplification is found to be larger for the 1.8 nm NPs due to the higher surface/volume ration that allows higher density of hot spots. It is demonstrated that Raman amplification can be efficiently increased by depositing low density layers of ultra-small NPs on top of granular films.},

In this work, we have synthesized a lithium zinc stannate phosphor Li 1.6 Zn 1.6 Sn 2.8 O 8 :Cr 3+ (LZSO:Cr) for broadband NIR light sources. The LZSO:Cr phosphor exhibited broadband excitation band matches exceptionally well with the emission of commercial 450-nm blue light-emitting diode (LED) chips. As expected, the broadband emission of infrared radiation from 650 nm to 1200 nm was realized due to the unique crystal field environment, where Cr 3+ ions were substituted in two distorted octahedral sites. The broad emission spectrum exhibited peaks around 830 nm and 930 nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ~190 nm and internal quantum efficiency of 53\%. The FWHM could be tuned to ~220 nm by co-doping with Al 3+ ions because of the crystal splitting. The luminescence properties including excitation, emission, decay time, and their relationship between the lattice crystal properties have also been investigated. A phosphor-converted LED (pc-LED) was packaged by combining the phosphor with a 450-nm blue LED chip, which proves the feasibility of our design strategy for broadband NIR light sources.},

When a plane force was applied to the arch films, the force is concentrated at the outer rim of the arch structure. The effective piezoelectric response can be enhanced by &gt;70 times because of the stress concentration and the measured effective piezoelectric response can be as high as 1990 pC N −1 . The arch films exhibit an enhanced energy harvesting performance when they are utilized as mechanical energy harvesting devices. The output power density was improved by &gt;2700 times compared with that measured in the films without arch structure.

In the present study, a thermodynamic knowledge-based MLFFNN has been developed to predict the martensite start temperature (M S ) of steels that accounts for the variations in critical driving force (ΔG c ) and austenitization temperature (T γ ). This is achieved by integrating two crudely estimated properties (ΔG c and T γ ) in the feature space. Instead of using the original dataset directly, the feature space was reshaped by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The genetic algorithm was implemented to find a suitable hyperparameters set that was able to induce a model with high predictive capability . The resulting neural network performs well in the present dataset, and the RMSE in the unseen datasets is 21.52 K. Benchmarking of the MLFFNN predictions against JmatPro-V8 calculations also shows a significant improvement in predictive accuracy. Results indicate KPCA and the integration of crude estimation property (CEP) boost the predictive accuracy of MLFFNN. Besides, the present study also demonstrates the CEP strategy is general enough to be employed in several well-known machine learning methods including support vector regression, decision tree and Gaussian process regression.},

Lap shear tensile tests of URW welds show significantly improved mechanical properties , including higher strength , better ductility and higher amount of energy absorbed prior to failure compared with RSW welds. Optical micrographs of the weld cross section show that the ultrasonic vibration enhances nugget formation and minimizes porosities defects. Besides, equiaxed crystal structure is generally observed in the nugget center of URW welds whereas the majority of RSW fusion zone is dominated with columnar grain structure. In situ thermal imaging of the two processes shows a lower temperature distribution , smaller heating and cooling rates during URW. This is attributed to the ultrasonically assisted fracture and breakdown of surface oxides and contaminates, which reduces the contact resistance and accordingly heat generation rate.},

Four different sets of process parameters were selected for laser polishing of initially annealed samples made from tool steel H11. In a sequential, multi-step process using continuous and pulsed laser radiation (Nd:YAG) a significant reduction of surface roughness was achieved.. The remelted layers were analyzed using roughness measurements, white light interferometry, X-ray diffractometry, electron backscatter diffraction, glow discharge emission spectroscopy , and nanoindentation hardness measurements. Laser polishing leads to a grain refinement and a significant increase in hardness. A minimal surface roughness of Ra = 50 nm was achieved in an Argon process atmosphere with an additional 6 vol\% CO 2 . In particular the carbon concentration was significantly reduced within the remelted layer. The lower carbon concentration is correlated with a decreased maximal surface hardness down to 366 HV. High residual tensile stresses of up to 926 MPa can be introduced by laser polishing. Overall, high temperature gradients and, in particular, decarburization due to carbon diffusion processes were identified to be the major driving force for significant changes in surface roughness and microstructural properties.},

  abstract     = {Machining processes have made technological leaps in achieving ultraprecision material removal and surface finishing at the submicrometric scale. At this level of precision, size effects have dominated machining investigations while surface effects have often been overlooked. The majority of micromachining research works are ignorant of the potential implications that these phenomena bring as the characteristic length approaches the ultraprecision machining level. In this review, physicochemical and physical surface effects are discussed by examining the theoretical developments and applications of each phenomenon in machining. These effects include the Rehbinder effect, solid coatings, and extrusion-cutting. Substantial mesoscopic analyses have been performed on metals with the Rehbinder effect and extrusion-cutting but the inherently different material deformation characteristics in microcutting invite further investigations. While solid coating effects have been reported at the microscale, its discovery questions the influence of other inevitably formed surface coatings (i.e. oxide layers). To these ends, key areas for future research in the microcutting of engineering metals and brittle materials are proposed in addition to the integration with unavoidable size effects. As machining technology and material characterization techniques progress into the nanometric scale, there is a need to rally efforts towards the embrace of surface phenomena in microcutting.},

  abstract     = {Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a method of 3D printing that enables large elements to be built, with reasonable printing times and costs. There are, however, uncertainties relating to the structural performance of WAAM material, including the basic mechanical properties, the degree of anisotropy, the influence of the as-built geometry and the variability in response. Towards addressing this knowledge gap, a comprehensive series of tensile tests on WAAM stainless steel was conducted; the results are presented herein. As-built and machined coupons were tested to investigate the influence of the geometrical irregularity on the stress-strain characteristics, while material anisotropy was explored by testing coupons produced at different angles to the printing orientation. Non-contact measurement techniques were employed to determine the geometric properties and deformation fields of the specimens, while sophisticated analysis methods were used for post processing the test data. The material response revealed a significant degree of anisotropy, explained by the existence of a strong crystallographic texture, uncovered by means of electron backscatter diffraction. Finally, the effective mechanical properties of the as-built material were shown to be strongly dependent on the geometric variability; simple geometric measures were therefore developed to characterise the key aspects of the observed behaviour.},

By employing walnut polyphenols modification, the dispersibility of BT particles in the SR matrix and the compatibility between BT and SR were greatly improved, which resulted in enhanced mechanical performance of the DE composites. Dielectric property measurement showed that DE composites containing walnut polyphenols modified BT particles (WNBT) had higher dielectric constants and lower dielectric losses than that of DEs with unmodified BT particles. Furthermore, it was found that the walnut polyphenols modification resulted in decreased dielectric loss tangent of the DE composites, suggesting an improved compatibility between the modified BT particles and SR. Finally, the static and dynamic electromechanical performance of the DE composites were evaluated. The SR/5\% WNBT composite achieved the highest actuated area strain of 38\% among the SR based composites used in this work. Moreover, the actuated area strain of SR/WNBT composites exhibited excellent electromechanical stability during the application of cyclic voltage signals .},

X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) techniques were used to identify the impact damage volumes, damage distribution and damage modes of 3D woven composites. Results indicated that the off-axis angles have significant effects on the LVI and CAI mechanical behavior and final failure mechanisms. Furthermore, Micro-CT revealed that off-axis samples exhibit more damage volumes and out-of-plane deformation. More importantly, the ultimate CAI strength of all the samples are largely governed by the global buckling. However, the formation of buckling damage in 0° samples runs from one edge of the specimen to the other side, whereas that in 30° and 45° samples mainly occur along the weft direction.},

During welding process , a number of reversible chemical reactions involving [Mg] and MgO generation or consumption occurred in the heat affect zone for Mg treated shipbuilding steel, and the temperature for more MgO formation just meet the thermodynamic conditions that the solid solution behavior of pinned particles TiN started to accelerate. Due to the extremely low disregistry value between MgO and TiN, the newly generated MgO which was determined by the [Mg] content in steel was highly likely to precipitate on the original TiN particles, delayed the solid solution of TiN, and generated more stable pinned particles.},

  abstract     = {Phenolic foam (PF) is widely used as exterior-wall insulation material but has poor mechanical properties and high friability. To improve the robustness of PF without sacrificing its inherent advantages, a novel reactive tung oil-based toughener that contains P and Si is synthesized and embedded into the rigid molecular structure of PF as long, flexible chains to fabricate biomass-based PFs (TDKPFs). The introduction of these long, flexible chains effectively improved the compressive and bending strengths, which were almost 180\% and 198\% that of pure PF, respectively. The TDKPFs had a lower thermal conductivity of 0.0316 W/(m·K), suggesting superior thermal insulation . Notably, these TDKPFs solved the reduction in flame resistance that is caused by the introduction of alkyl long chains and had a high limiting oxygen index of 41.7\%. Cone calorimetry tests indicated that the peak heat-release rate of the TDKPFs was reduced by 15.6\%. In particular, the total smoke release of the TDKPFs was 7.29 m 2 /m 2 , a reduction of 75.8\% over pure PF (30.2 m 2 /m 2 ), indicating superior smoke-suppression. The mechanism analysis revealed that a compact hybrid barrier with rich polyphosphate and silica formed, inhibiting the transfer of heat, O 2 , and mass during combustion. Thus, TDKPFs have great potential as insulation materials.},

  abstract     = {Currently, kinematic field measurements for studying the mechanical behavior of materials and structures use common optical methods, such as mark tracking techniques, grid methods and correlation techniques. These techniques are employed over a region of interest ranging from micro to millimeter scale. However, when studies need to be conducted on even smaller scales such as sub-micrometric scale, the use of more complex means of observation is required. In this case, the work can be achieved using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the Focused-Ion-Beam (FIB) as marking technique. An adaptation of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method Heaviside-based Digital Image Correlation (H-DIC) is chosen to investigate the mechanical behavior and taking into account local fractures. As the studied problem is to extract strains from a fractured material using a displacement field measurement method, derivative computation for strain determination is not well adapted. The proposed approach consists in extracting the residual strains from local first gradients of H-DIC, which are less perturbed by the fractures. Various tests were performed to evaluate the validity of this new proposed approach. An application to study the mechanical behavior of a metallic composite (Al/ ω -Al-Cu-Fe) is proposed. A particular exploitation of all field lies in the good separation of the strain fields and the cracked part. A discussion that focus on the comparison between a conventional DIC analysis and its extension was presented on the zones without or with fractures.},

Artificial aging treatment introduces nanosized precipitates into the bimodal microstructure, in which the number and growth rate of precipitates are different: the number in PPs is larger than that in SSGs due to the higher density of dislocations and lattice distortions in PPs, while the growth rate in SSGs is higher than that in PPs owing to the higher solute concentration in SSGs. As the number and size of precipitates are optimized in the bimodal microstructure, i.e., in peak-aged state, remarkable increments of 56.1\% and 130.3\% in ultimate tensile strength and yield strength while a moderate increase of 6.3\% in ductility are achieved compared with the as-fabricated state, which overcomes the trade-off in strength and ductility of conventional aging-treated 6061 alloys with unimodal microstructure. The strengthening comes from the geometrically necessary dislocations induced by the deformation incompatibility of bimodal microstructure and from precipitate strengthening by nanosized precipitates, while the toughening is from the enhanced dislocation accumulation in this alloy.},

  abstract     = {Sensitive on-line detection of Cu 2+ in lubricating oil of marine power plant is important for displaying equipment wear status and fault pre-judgment in real time. However, there are few reports on in-situ, portable and highly sensitive Cu 2+ detection devices in organic media before. In this report, CsPbBr 3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are employed as fluorescence probe for Cu 2+ detection in microfluidic chip. The size effect of the CsPbBr 3 QDs on the detection performances is firstly investigated. To obtain preferable sensitivity and detection limit, polymethyl methacrylate opal photonic crystals (PMMA OPCs) film is developed as microfluidic sensor substrate, which can tremendously improve the fluorescence intensity of PQDs as high as 26-fold. The enhancement effect can be attributed to the coupling between photonic crystal stopband effect and the excitation light field. Moreover, the use of photomultiplier module for fluorescence signal measurement enables the detection device to be portable. The novel strategy offers the advantages of higher sensitivity (8.62 μM –1 ) and lower detection limit (0.40 nM). Otherwise, this sensor also provides wide detection range and good selectivity, thus, it will have potential in oil quality in-situ detection and mechanical wear prediction in the future.},

  abstract     = {Support structures are needed due to the complexities of induced structural, thermal and process factors in Selective Laser Melting (SLM). To date, little systematic study is found to unveil the support removability by a post-machining process. This paper presents an experimental study of removing 316L stainless steel cone and block supports by milling. The effect of different supports is identified by the variation in the microhardness distribution and microstructure of the workpieces. The milling performance of cone and block supports at different cutting depths is studied on the surface finish, surface roughness , milling force, and tool wear and chip formation. The cone supports are subjected to severe collapse, whilst the block supports are mainly removed by localized shearing . The milling force and specific cutting energy of cutting block supports are lower than that of cone supports, and so is the tool wear. A finite element method (FEM) model is developed to explain the removal mechanisms. The results of this study provide an essential reference and unique insight into removal of metal support structures. Moreover, the removability of supports, which is derived from the post-processing stage, should be considered as a new factor in the support design for additive manufacturing .},

A series of two-dimensional (2D) representative volume element (RVE) models are generated automatically by embedding Ti-Al 3 Ti core-shell structured particulates in an A356 matrix. Microstructure-based 2D RVE of monolithic Al 3 Ti particulate reinforced A356 composite (Al 3 Ti p /A356) is also simulated for comparison. The ductile fracture of both Ti core and A356 matrix as well as the brittle fracture of the Al 3 Ti shell are considered. The simulation confirms that the high elongation of the (Ti-Al 3 Ti) cs /A356 composite is attributed to the uniform distribution of the overall ductile globular reinforcing particulates, which prevent a premature failure effectively by reducing local stress concentration both on and inside the core-shell structured particulates. The surrounding ductile phases of the Al 3 Ti shell blunt the crack tips effectively and, therefore, restricting the propagation of the cracks in a nominal strain range of 2.2\%–6.1\%. For both (Ti-Al 3 Ti) cs /A356 and Al 3 Ti p /A356 composites, the simulation results are in good agreement with microstructural observations during an in-situ tensile test in a scanning electron microscope .},

  abstract     = {Additively-manufactured PEEK orthopedic implants have recently gained extensive attention due to their prominent characteristics such as good biocompatibility , low radiographic artifacts and similar elastic modulus to native bones. However, the inherent drawback associated with PEEK implants was their biologically inert surface which caused unsatisfactory cellular response and poor adhesion between the implants and surrounding soft tissues. Here we developed a sulfonation-treatment strategy to create microporous architectures onto the filaments of the additively-manufactured PEEK lattice scaffolds. The sulfonation time in the range of 30–45 s was found to facilitate the formation of uniform microscale pores throughout the printed PEEK lattice scaffolds and simultaneously have slight effect on their composition and mechanical properties . Biological results showed that the presence of microscale pores on the additively-manufactured PEEK lattice scaffolds significantly improved the spreading, proliferation and calcium deposition of bone-specific cells in comparison with the untreated PEEK lattice scaffolds. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the sulfonation-treated micropores facilitated the adhesion of newly-regenerated soft tissues to form tight implant-tissue bonding interfaces. The presented method provides a promising approach to improve the surface bioactivity of additively-manufactured PEEK lattice scaffolds for enhanced cellular response and soft tissue adhesion.},

  abstract     = {Silicon (Si) has attracted attention for use in lithium ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and its natural abundance. However, significant change in the volume of Si electrodes during repeated cycles causes dramatic capacity degradation and reduces the benefits of its attractive qualities. Here, it is reported for the first time that a derivative of natural spider silk is effective for retaining the capacity and decreasing the volume expansion of Si for use in Li-ion batteries as electrodes. Relative to the Si-electrode with polyvinylidene fluoride (SPVDF), the Si-electrode containing binder with the dissolved spider silk (SWS) cells achieved significant enhanced capacities with cycling stability during repeated cycles. The SWS electrode at 250 mA g −1 showed the discharge/charge capacities of 3642/1938 mAh g −1 at 1st cycle, 1789/1541 mAh g −1 at 2nd cycle and then reduced to 1142/1054 mAh g −1 at the 5th cycle. However, the capacities of the SPVDF electrode were 3903/2694 mAh g −1 , 1455/1211 mAh g −1 , and 458/435 mAh g −1 . Furthermore, the discharge capacity of SWS was 333 mAh g −1 at the 38th cycle, but that of SPVDF showed 323 mAh g −1 at the 7th cycle. Such superior performance with good cycling ability may be attributed to the unique properties of spider silk: the folded crystal layer with semi-amorphous structure, the superior properties of viscosity and adhesion, and the close stacking by the protein blocks as well as the side chain R-group of crystal β-sheet. The combination of these characteristics was able to restrain the deleterious change in the volume of Si materials substantially, and to provide superior electrochemical characteristics of lithium ions .},

DSC scans of each micropart traced nearly the same path, which indicated that their glassy states were still almost identical after processing. The precise control of the temperature and applied load enable the final products to achieve almost the same thermal histories and also geometric shapes .

The thermal conductivity and dielectric properties of composites containing GBN are then systematically investigated. The thermal conductivity is significantly enhanced (~140\%) in GBN/epoxy composites containing only 5 wt\% of GBN.

Study on the compression properties shows that at a fixed strain rate , the yield strength and yield drop all increase with decreasing temperature.

Failure analysis of the armour modules and penetration weight calculated by the measured residual penetration were applied to characterize ballistic performance of the ceramic armour modules. A simulation calculation was employed to investigate the inner impact process and the results corresponded well with the experimental ones. The damage initiation and propagation in ceramic, and the stress field distribution in the projectile were presented and analysed. The results showed that the cover plate can effectively reduce the damage of the target due to the extension of a dwell period compared with a ‘no cover’ structure. Low- elastic impedance material covers promote the impact stress distribution in ceramic leading to great improvement in ceramic ballistic performance. Moreover, the effect of cover material properties and energy dissipation at different impact periods was discussed.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasonic vibration has received widespread attention for its dramatic effect on grain refinement and microstructure modification during casting, additive manufacturing , cold rolling, and cutting, changes which can significantly improve the mechanical and physical properties of components. As a novel ultrasonic vibration cutting method, rotary ultrasonic elliptical milling (RUEM) has been introduced to mill the alloy Ti-6Al-4V. However, the effects of ultrasonic elliptical vibration on the microstructures of machined surfaces in end milling of Ti-6Al-4V are still unclear. A comprehensive study on the surface characteristics and sub-surface microstructure in RUEM of Ti-6Al-4V was conducted. The results show that the uniform textures, in the form of ridges mapped on the machined surface in RUEM, varied with the cutting speed. Compared with conventional milling, microchip debris adhesion on the machined surface was significantly reduced by using RUEM. Moreover, intense plastic deformation in the sub-surface was obtained, and nanocrystalline layers, with grain dimensions of 10 nm to 100 nm, were fabricated on the processed surfaces of RUEM. Additionally, the improvement in sub-surface microstructure increased the surface micro-hardness from 21.22\% to 33.84\%. This study allows an in-depth understanding of sub-surface deformation and surface nanocrystallization in RUEM of Ti–6Al–4V.},

  abstract     = {Bone defects are a major threat to human health, and heterotopic bone provides advantages that other materials do not provide in the treatment of bone defects. MPEG-PCL microspheres loaded with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2/MPEG-PCL-MS) are an emerging means of culturing heterotopic bone. However, the effect of such microspheres on the quality of heterotopic bone osteogenesis has rarely been studied. The performance of heterotopic bone as a bone repair material has also rarely been reported. To explore the effect of microspheres on heterotopic bone osteogenesis and to explore the performance of heterotopic bone in bone repair, we designed compression tests, nanoindentation tests, and a finite element (FE) simulation. The effects of microspheres on the quality of heterotopic bone osteogenesis and performance of heterotopic bone as a bone repair material were evaluated from the mechanical properties , material properties , and FE simulation. The results demonstrate that eight-week heterotopic bone using microspheres has suitable mechanical and material properties, performs well in bone repair FE simulation, and can meet the material requirements of bone repair. Hence, this heterotopic bone as bone repair material has promising potential for clinical applications, and provides a good strategy for combination between tissue engineering and pharmaceutical science.},

  abstract     = {Design of shape memory alloy based structure in high–frequency or dynamic applications needs to build on a luminous comprehension for high speed deformation mechanisms of the corresponding material. In present work, dynamic responses and bulk texture evolutions are studied in martensitic NiTi through multi–scale characterization efforts. The objective is to quantitatively decompose the macroscopic strain according to deformation mechanisms and construct a phenomenological constitutive model. This study uses quasi–static in – situ and dynamic ex – situ neutron diffraction techniques to follow the evolution of bulk texture, twin volume fraction, and active twinning modes under various strain rates . It is demonstrated that the mechanical responses are strongly rate sensitive. The observation is attributed to the variation in slip activity. A distinct twinning mode change during compression is captured through in – situ neutron diffraction, and the shear induced reorientation is well described. Based on experimental observations, a constitutive model that includes effects of elasticity, reorientation of accommodation twinning, and plasticity is constructed and validated in a wide strain rate range. The overall results provide insights into strain rate dependent mechanical response of martensitic NiTi in both experiment and model aspects. This work will guide the design and application of shape memory alloys, especially in dynamic condition.},

Experimental approaches on a lab-scale setup equipped with a pulsed fiber laser system were developed to investigate the effect of laser scan settings. Properties of low-energy laser single sintered layers are studied experimentally, and the influence of laser power and pulse duration is discussed. A layer of sintered porous material was characterized in terms of the pore size, layer thickness, porosity and thermal conductivity. The results show that sintered porous layers can be fabricated by effectively connecting metal powder in the powder bed similar to a sintering process or partial melting. The porosity of fabricated structures was 51\%–61\% and the average pore radius ranged between 22 and 29 μm. We found that the thermal conductivity of a single powder particle is 31.5\% of the sintered layer value and the thermal conductivity of the sintered layer is 4.8\% of its solid material.},

  abstract     = {Functionally graded (FG) iron/tungsten (Fe/W) composites are considered for stress-relieving interlayers in tungsten-steel joints , required in future fusion reactors. The macroscopic gradation of the two materials allows relaxation of thermally-induced stresses and hence extend the lifetime of the cyclic-loaded dissimilar materials joints. While many properties, e.g. thermal expansion and strength , of the as-manufactured Fe/W composites are promising with respect to the anticipated application, the temperature-induced microstructural changes and their effect on the material properties remain largely unexplored. Given that the thermodynamic system of Fe W contains two types of intermetallic phases, understanding the microstructural changes in the FG Fe/W composites is crucial for long-term operation of fusion reactors. In the present work, the microstructure of ultra-fast sintered Fe/W composites containing 50 and 75 vol\% tungsten is studied via electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in as-manufactured and thermal aged conditions (300, 500, and 800 °C for up to 72 h). The hardness and modulus of selected composites are measured via nanoindentation , and the fracture toughness of the Fe W interfaces is tested via notched micro-cantilever bending tests . The results from microstructural and micromechanical analyses are discussed, and the materials are evaluated for their application in fusion reactors based on the microstructure-to-property relationship.},

The micromorphology and chemical structure of the PPX layer on the powder surface, as well as the conversion mechanisms, has been investigated systematically. Several methods have been used to estimate the amount and thickness of PPX layers. The corresponding amorphous powder cores (AMPCs) were also prepared. With the increasing thickness of the PPX layer, the saturation magnetization ( M s ) of the powder decreased slightly but the magnetic flux density ( B s ) of the AMPCs kept at a similar level thanked to the enhanced green density. In addition, the DC bias performance was improved and core loss ( P cv ) was reduced. Compare with other coating materials like epoxy and silicon resin, the PPX layer provided better insulation and higher lubricity for the AMPCs, thus reduced the P cv and improved the DC bias performance. The AMPCs coated by PPX-3 exhibited excellent comprehensive soft magnetic properties , which were promising for high-power and high-frequency applications.},

In this work, a Si 3 N 4 powder-based laser-cladding process has been developed in order to improve the biological response to biomedical zirconia. The process resulted in the formation of a composite coating with Si 3 N 4 particles dispersed in nano-crystalline/amorphous silicon . Microscopic observation showed that the layer is adherent to the substrate. The application of the laser cladding treatment resulted in an increase of the roughness, further enhancing the probability of interaction with biological tissues and consequently the bioactivity . Testing with human osteosarcoma cell lines resulted in the formation of bone tissue with high collagen maturity, high carbonate to phosphate ratios and good tissue mineralization , but lower cell proliferation when compared to stoichiometric Si 3 N 4 . The bone tissue quality parameters, as measured by Raman spectroscopy , resulted to be comparable to healthy human bone tissue and suggest that laser-cladded Si 3 N 4 treatments might be able to improve the stability of zirconia implants.},

To this end, a generalized stacking fault energy analysis is employed on dense (π 1D ) and loose spaced (π 1L ) π 1 planes. The crystal shearing resistance is extracted by using a minimum-energy path (MEP) finder called the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The MEP regarding 1 ¯ 012 10 1 ¯ 1 π 1 L slip system shows that the unfaulted crystal structure is recovered in the middle of the path with non-straight and pronounced curved slip trajectories. Besides, it will be revealed that metastable configurations on the half of the MEP for 1 ¯ 012 10 1 ¯ 1 π 1 L slip system are indeed related to a dissociated 〈 c + a 〉 extended dislocation of loose pyramidal-I 〈 c + a 〉 slip, 1 / 3 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 23 10 1 ¯ 1 π 1 L . Also, after extracting the dissociation mechanism related to this dislocation, it will be shown that loose pyramidal-I 〈 c + a 〉 slip can involve shuffling. Moreover, the MEP for dense pyramidal-I 〈 a 〉 slip, 1 / 3 1 ¯ 2 1 ¯ 0 10 1 ¯ 1 π 1 D , shows transmutation of this slip into CTW in the middle of the path. This transmutation process will be further examined on CTW growth, and it will be demonstrated that this CTW mechanism is energetically more favorable compared to other twinning mechanisms.},

Previous research has proven the effectiveness of iron-based shape memory alloy (Fe-SMA or memory-steel) reinforcements for the prestressed strengthening of structures. The unique function of the material, i.e., the so-called shape memory effect , enables cost-effectiveness and presents simple ways to prestress defective building components. Ribbed memory-steel bars have only been available recently. This study aimed to investigate their performance in a novel strengthening technique, named near-surface mounted (NSM) method. Bond experiments with short bond lengths were performed to investigate the feasibility of this configuration and to identify the effects of several design parameters including: groove dimensions, bar diameter , bar material, cover depth, mortar strength , and concrete strength. The use of a digital image correlation system enabled detailed measurements of slips, crack width, and surface strain. An analytical procedure based on the differential equation of bond behaviour was developed, which enabled the calculation of slip, strain, bond shear stress, and load capacity. The results show that ribbed memory-steel bars can be used in an NSM configuration due to high bond capacity. The cover depth, substrate strength and elastic modulus had a significant effect on the failure mode and bond capacity.},

In this study, to fully consider the degrees of freedom of material design, a multi-scale framework using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is proposed to predict the effective thermal conductivities of hierarchical cement-based PCESCM. The representative volume elements (RVEs) of cement-based PCESCM covering nano-, micro-, and meso-scale are established capturing the complex structural characteristics. Afterwards, an LBM-based thermal conduction model is proposed to simulate the thermal conduction through the reconstructed RVEs. The results indicate that at the nano-scale the thermal conductivity of colloidal C-S-H increases with the packing density of gel particles for both saturated and dried states. At the micro-scale, the thermal conductivities of matrix and PCM composite are highly dependent on the degree of water/PCM saturation. At the meso-scale, the incorporation of PCM composites can lead to a reduction in thermal conductivity. In general, the simulated thermal conductivities of hierarchical cement-based PCESCM using the LBM-based model agree well with the measured values or the estimated results using the analytical model.},

In this work, environmentally friendly porous Fe x Si y intermetallics are prepared by elemental powder reactive synthesis as anodes in zinc electrowinning for the first time. The as-prepared porous Fe x Si y anodes (Fe 3 Si, Fe 5 Si 3 , and FeSi) have been investigated in terms of electrochemical performance. Among the three anodes, porous Fe 5 Si 3 anode shows relatively better comprehensive properties in 160 g·L −1 H 2 SO 4 . Porous Fe 5 Si 3 anode exhibits electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability under the condition of zinc electrowinning, which guarantees a service life up to 400 h. The activity for OER shows that porous Fe 5 Si 3 anode is delivering an overpotential of 1.072 V and tafel slope of 326.6 mV·dec at current density of 50 mA·cm −2 . The electrocatalytic activity is positively correlated with the open porosity. The oxides formed in the anode surface are mainly composed of Fe 2 O 3 and amorphous SiO 2 , which protect the anode against corrosion and help to the activity for OER. This result demonstrated that Fe 5 Si 3 as alternative anode material has potential application value in industry.},

  abstract     = {High temperature resistant coating is becoming a key technique to improve the heat resistance of aerospace heat-resistant components. In this paper, Ti6Al4V/Inconel625 gradient coating was fabricated by laser melting deposition. The results show that the microstructure changes with composition gradient, from lamellar structure consisting of lamellar α and β phases to equiaxed structure. With the increase of the proportion for nickel-based alloy, alloying elements and concentration of solute increase in molten pool. Furthermore, the nucleation rate increases due to the increase of alloying elements, which leads to the microstructure refinement. The phase composition of gradient coating changes in the sequence of α + β → α + β + Ti 2 Ni → Ti 2 Ni + β → Ti 2 Ni + CrNi 2 + γ-Ni. The hardness of gradient coating increases as the relative percentage of Inconel625 correspondingly. When the relative percentage of nickel-based alloy reaches 100\%, the hardness reaches a peak of 855 HV 1 . The hardness is attributed to the contribution from the formation of Ti 2 Ni precipitates, CrNi 2 compounds as well as the solid solution hardening . For the high temperature properties, there is a diffusion zone at the interface between Ti6Al4V base layer and transition layer. The transverse microcracks are produced between layers at 800 °C.},

In particular, the use of flexural hinges endows distinct advantages towards miniaturization and fabrication; however, there are limited applications due to the limited loading and fatigue resistance of the hinges. In this study, we focus on testing and characterizing mechanical properties of flexural hinges so that our findings could have immediate applications in 3D-printed origami structures. We introduce an aramid fiber composite hinge and compare it to a single-material polyamide and a multimaterial photopolymer hinge. We investigate the impact of the materials and geometric design parameters on the load carrying capability and flexural properties. Furthermore, the fatigue behavior of the hinges is characterized, identifying the constitutive mechanisms. We consolidate all the data and findings to construct a comprehensive design parameter – property map , which serves as a guideline for optimizing hinge performance for a given set of required properties.},

This work focuses on the energy density dependence of texture anisotropy and mechanical properties processed by selective laser melting (SLM) of IN 718 superalloy at different laser scanning speeds . It was found that strong columnar grains and 〈001〉 fiber texture become insignificant due to insufficient epitaxial growth as energy density decreases. The discrepancies in Taylor factor distributions induced by texture anisotropy are mainly responsible for the difference in tensile mechanical properties for samples built at different orientations. High Taylor factors lead to the increased strength of diagonally built testing samples. In addition, grain refinement enhances the strengthening effect as energy density decreases.},

Three bolts composed of different manufacturing materials—aluminum alloy (AL), die steel (DS) and stainless steel (SS)—are successfully 3D printed, and the desired geometric profile is achieved with high precision. Prior to printing, the digital file of the prototype (PT) bolt is obtained by a 3D laser scanning system . Afterwards, mechanical tensile tests , infrared thermography (IRT) tests and digital image correlation (DIC) tests are carried out. The mechanical testing results indicate that the peak strength of the DS bolt is approximately twice that of the PT bolt. The IRT results show that the maximum temperature on the surface of all bolts except the AL bolt increases as the load increases, and the minimum temperature on the bolt surface is barely impacted by loading. DIC indicates a feasible relationship between the load and strain for the PT bolt, AL bolt and DS bolt. Overall, the AL bolt is not suitable for replicating the PT bolt, whereas the DS bolt and SS bolt are suitable choices. The conclusions established in this study provide new measures for future research regarding laboratory bolting tests and even engineering bolting trials.},

Among the four different particle size aerogels, the SA-2 sample consisted of 20.31 ± 1.21 nm particles with narrow size distribution had high temperature resistance and low thermal conductivity . Compared with the traditional acid-base two-step prepared silica aerogels, the monodisperse silica aerogels can significantly increase the temperature resistance while maintaining a low thermal conductivity (0.02723 W·m −1 ·K −1 ). The sturdy skeleton structure formed by the interconnection of large particles can effectively inhibit the viscous flow between aerogel particles and avoid pore collapse caused by skeleton failure which can maintain a stable structure until 900 °C and retain a relatively complete structure at 1000 °C with only about 35\% volume shrinkage after 2 h heat treatment. At 1100 °C, the viscous flow between aerogel particles and pore collapse cannot be effectively suppressed, and the pure silica aerogels can only be used during a short period at 1100 °C. The results will be meaningful for the design of super thermal insulation materials with high temperature resistance and low thermal conductivity.},

In notched components , the concept of cyclic plastic zone (CPZ) is commonly utilized for fatigue cracking analysis, in which the CPZ size normally relates to the material strength. In particular, materials with higher yield stress have shown smaller CPZ size and vice versa. According to this, a new approach for determining closed-form stress at the notch tip is proposed by considering the size of cyclic plastic zone, which can be used for the notch tip stress evaluation along the load direction under cyclic loadings. By implementing FE analysis, experimental data of 304 stainless steel, 40Cr steel and Ti-6Al-4V alloy are utilized for model validation and comparison. Results show that the scope of damaged CPZ alters the notch tip stress under fatigue loadings, and the proposed model yields better correlation of fatigue life predictions with experimental results of the three materials than other two models.},

Addition of Cu and Al in Fe-Ni steel increased the dislocation density of martensite and promoted the co-precipitation of Cu and Ni 3 Al nanoparticles upon aging. The Fe-Ni-Cu-Al steel achieved a yield strength of 1350 MPa at 525 °C aging for 2 h, of which ~950 MPa is contributed by dislocation strengthening and co-precipitation strengthening. The dislocation density in experimental steels was determined in the range of 10 15 m −2 , which gave rise to a strengthening contribution of over 400 MPa. Meanwhile, the extremely high dislocation density acted as preferred precipitation sites for the co-precipitation of nanoscale Cu and Ni 3 Al particles. The contribution of co-precipitation strengthening was calculated as 413 MPa, while the contribution of strengthening relying on solely Cu precipitation in Fe-Ni-Cu steel was only 144 MPa. As increasing the aging temperature, Ni 3 Al particles showed faster coarsening rate than that of Cu particles, which led to a significant decrease in the strengthening increment of Fe-Ni-Cu-Al steel.},

Moreover, CSF had a unique single-side loading characteristic and its resistance changed from 98.4\% to 102\% of the initial value with the bending angle varying from −112.5° to 112.5°, so CSF could be used as sensors to monitor the mechanical activities effectively.

  abstract     = {A three-dimensional (3D) sintering method of bulk magnetron targets has been developed recently. However, the use of bulk target had the following limitations: constrained geometry, limited chemical-phase composition, small size and cost-effectiveness. Thus a novel approach of surface sintering (2D) was arranged by a method of electromagnetic discharge evolution without applying any mechanical press. In the proposed method, the internal energy of pulsed plasma flux (~102.3 J) was dissipated at a tungsten (W) powder interface, therefore providing a form of sintered body with a density of 9.24–14.21 g/cm 3 in the crystal structure of (α)-W. The morphology view indicates that, for the most part of sinters, only a subsurface (&lt; 100 nm) was well-consolidated, which was in accordance with an almost fourfold increase in thermal diffusivity there, as showed the results of laser flash analysis. Subsequently, the decrease in mean porosity distribution (V v ) from 42.4\% to 27.1\% in consolidated surface was confirmed by using the microcomputed tomography (μCT) reconstruction. The (2D) sintered target was then used in the synthesis of pure metallic films by gas injection magnetron sputtering. As a result, a conductive (β)-W phase was recognized (103–405 μΩ cm), giving a promising hope for spintronic device applications.},

The results revealed that a steady shock front was generated and propagated in the composites. The shock stress was attenuated with the propagation distance and the attenuation effect became more obvious as the stress increased. The shock velocity had a linear relationship with the particle velocity and the relationships for the composites with 40 and 50 vol\% Al were very similar.

  abstract     = {Tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) with diameters &lt;6 mm have broad applications. However, maintaining graft post-implantation patency and function is still difficult to achieve and of urgent necessity. In this study, we use an effective strategy to make the large-pore electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) cotton material (Cotton) and utilized immunoreactive pre-cultivation to prepare a small diameter autologous TEVG. The material assessment via scanning electron microscopy revealed that Cotton has favorable characteristics that make it suitable for immunoreactive pre-cultivation. It also possesses great mechanical properties . Due to strong reshape ability of Cotton, designed vascular patch and vascular scaffold and others could be obtained. For vascular scaffold, Cotton was wrapped around a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube and implanted subcutaneously in rats for up to 2 weeks to prepare autologous TEVGs. Autologous TEVGs were then transplanted into the abdominal aorta of the same rat. Cotton TEVG formed functional graft with favorable patency after transplantation for 4 weeks. Histological results showed that the TEVGs had characteristics similar to that of the native aorta. Our results indicate PCL cotton material could be a kind of shapeable material and used to create a promising biocompatible and functional vascular graft over a relatively short period of time.},

  abstract     = {The double vertical explosive welding process produces two composites in one explosion and improves the energy utilization efficiency. However, the interface morphology at different positions shows obvious unevenness. 2D and 3D models of double vertical explosive welding were established by SPH . The interface morphology and process parameters were analysed. The relationship between the interface morphology and process parameters was discussed, and the pressure condition was the most suitable wave-forming condition in this paper. The interface morphology of the whole plate was predicted by combining the pressure condition with the contours of the flyer plate of the 3D model. A relevant experiment was carried out, and samples at different locations were observed under an OM . The results indicated that the wave interface and jetting were reproduced well in the 2D models. The distribution of the wave interface presented a butterfly shape. A straight interface existed at the detonation point and the boundary areas. The distribution of interface morphology in the experimental results was basically the same as those predicted by the numerical simulations. In addition, a discontinuous convex block was observed in the straight interface. Evidence of a vortex, jetting and an island region existed in the large wave interface.},

  abstract     = {A layered structure has a better effect on improving performance of the graphene-reinforced composites due to its unique two-dimensional structure and excellent properties. In this paper, a novel “one-step” electrochemical route was proposed for synthesizing the graphene-reinforced ultrathin copper (Cu) foil with high performance. The process includes: 1) A loose graphene oxide (GO) membrane, was prepared by electrophoresis deposition (EPD), that allows Cu ions passing through; 2) According to the difference of Cu deposition potential on different substrates, a potential step was designed for electrodepositing Cu successively on both sides of the GO membrane, i.e., the bottom Cu layer forms under low over-potential, while the top Cu layer forms under high over-potential. The experimental results show that the foil thickness reaches to as thin as 4–5 μm, and the tensile strength is almost twice as large as that of pure Cu foil. The process is simple, controllable and possible mass production, and expected to further practical applications in fields of Cu clad plate, printed circuit board and lithium-ion battery cathode collector system for saving raw material and also the space. In addition, this work proposes a new idea for preparing the layered composites via electrochemical route.},

  abstract     = {The main aim of this paper is to present a topology optimization method for a local resonator , in order to tailor flexural bandgaps in plate structures. The local resonator is required to be designed systematically in order to tailor the bandgap at the desired frequency range. In previous studies, beam or plate-like resonators were usually used for the design purpose, but the freedom of design is limited particularly when the allowable dimensions are highly limited. Regarding the design issue, this research presents a systematic method using topology optimization to design the local resonator with the maximized bandgap at the target frequency. A plate-like resonator is parameterized to fully exploit the allowable design space of a unit cell. The topology optimization is carried out with the non-gradient based algorithm i.e. simulated annealing (SA). To assist the SA, which requires a large number of function evaluations, two computationally efficient finite element (FE) approaches, namely plate modelling and the reduced Bloch mode expansion, are combined with the topology optimization. In addition, numerical techniques are applied to solve issues arising in the design process (i.e. design disconnection, hinged design, and design redundancy). Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method for creating bandgaps at frequencies below 500 Hz. The results exhibit increases in vibration isolation up to 20 dB at the designed frequencies.},

  abstract     = {The full-field deformation characterizations of a metal undergoing large plastic strains are difficult to be obtained from the conventional true stress-strain curves. In this study, we proposed using a simple non-contacting technique, digital image correlation (DIC) with laser speckles, to evaluate large plastic deformations of metals, especially for thin metal foils and for the forming at high temperatures. The feasibility and accuracy of this DIC technique were confirmed by conducting uniaxial tensile tests using different materials. As results, the measured strains indicated a good accuracy with an error range of 6\% in measuring the large plastic deformation at room temperature and 10\% in measuring a large strain up to 0.6 at a high temperature of 400 °C. The strain distribution measured by DIC with laser speckles and with artificial speckles showed good agreement, confirming the feasibility of this DIC technique for measuring large plastic deformations. By using this technique, the evolution of plastic zone was successfully investigated for thin metal sheets with a thickness of 0.5 mm. Furthermore, the strain fields involving localizations of 50 μm thick metal foils forming at room temperature and a large plastic deformation of metal tubes forming at 400 °C were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Two configurations were set up by exchanging the place position of the upper and lower plates under the same parameters. When higher Mg content alloy located as the upper plate, the evaporation of Mg led to the instable welding process and the lower actual heat input, which affected the weld morphology. The solidification microstructures near the fusion line of the two joints were observed by SEM and analyzed by coupling temperature field and phase field method simulation results, longer and wider intergranular liquid channels and more severe solute segregation occurred in 6061/5182 joint. The results validated that 6061/5182 joint had a higher crack sensitivity than 5182/6061 joint. Moreover, crack sensitivity had a greater influence on tensile property than other factors by testing. The two joints presented significantly different porosity and pore morphology. Dense and fine pores appeared when more Mg element content in the upper plate, which related to the failed escape of Mg vapor and the attenuation of laser energy in thickness direction. Moreover, microhardness decreased as Mg element content increasing, because of the dilution effect of the strengthening phases.},

Multi-stability enables deployable implants to transform their shape from some compact retracted state to the deployed state where they take their full sizes and are load-bearing. We combined multiple design features to develop a new generation of deployable orthopaedic implants . Kirigami cut patterns were used to create bi-stability in flat sheets which can be folded into deployable implants using origami techniques. Inspired by Russian dolls, we designed multi-layered specimens that allow for adjusting the mechanical properties and the geometrical features of the implants through the number of the layers. Because all layers are folded from a flat state, surface-related functionalities could be applied to our deployable implants. We fabricated specimens from polylactic acid , titanium sheets , and aluminum sheets, and demonstrated that a deployment ratio of up to ≈2 is possible. We performed experiments to characterize the deployment and load-bearing behavior of the specimens and found that the above-mentioned design variables allow for adjustments in the deployment force and the maximum force before failure. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of decorating the specimens with micropatterns.},

The ablation resistance and interlaminar shear strength of the composite were investigated. Results showed that the functionalized ZrSiO 4 sol had positive effect on composite modification. Due to the improved interfacial adhesion between the carbon fabric and resin, the shear strength of the functionalized ZrSiO 4 sol modified composite increased by 11\% compared to the unmodified composite. Furthermore, the mass ablation ratio of the functionalized ZrSiO 4 sol modified composite was 30\% lower than that of the unmodified composite. The surface ceramic layer with a main phase composition of ZrO 2 provided an oxygen insulating effect and protected the inner material from serious oxidative ablation.

Recoverable strain is due to the martensitic transformation, for which more than one variant per grain can be activated. The majority of the activated variants exhibit high Schmid factor . The variant selection can be influenced by shear transmission across grain boundaries, when the geometrical compatibility between the neighboring habit plane variants is favourable; in these cases variants that do not have the highest Schmid factor, with respect to the macroscopically applied load, are activated. The experimentally determined transformation strains agree well with theoretical calculations for single crystals. The non-recoverable strain is due to deformation slip in austenite , twinning in martensite and residual martensite. The results are discussed in view of possible twinning modes that can occur in austenite resulting in significant non-recoverable strain.},

The effects of the thermal distribution strategy on the welding process , penetration ratio, microstructure, and tensile strength are investigated by varying the electrode positive/electrode negative (EP/EN) ratio. With the ratio decreasing, more energy is conducted to the wire, thereby decreasing the high-temperature holding time. When the ratio decreases from 8:1 to 1:8, the thickness of the Ti-6Al-4V/seam transition zone containing a Ti Cu interlayer and Ti 5 Si 3 intermetallic layer decreases from 118 to 81 μm. Along with the decrease in the interlayer thickness, the joint tensile strength initially increases from 216.28 to 261.69 MPa and then decreases to 211.29 MPa. A high EP/EN ratio results in a thick Ti-6Al-4V/seam transition zone that includes a Ti 5 Si 3 layer. A low EP/EN ratio results in a thin Ti-6Al-4V/seam transition zone that includes Ti 5 Si 3 distributed in the grain boundary. Both conditions reduce the tensile strength of the joints. The highest tensile strength is obtained when the ratio is 8:8, under which a thin transition zone and concentrated Ti 5 Si 3 intermetallic layer can be generated.},

Plate forming accuracy could be improved by reasonably controlling laser power and scanning velocity. The bending angle of the plate was approximately in direct proportion to H e . The crystal grains of the formed plate under optimized process parameters were refined without lamination phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {The Cu-Ni-Si alloy has widely applications in the lead frames and electronics industries due to its high strength and conductivity. In this work, hot deformation behavior of the Cu-1.5Ni-1.1Co-0.6Si and Cu-1.5Ni-1.1Co-0.6Si-0.1Cr alloys were investigated through the isothermal compression tests using the Gleeble-1500D thermo-mechanical simulator operating at the temperature ranging from 500 °C to 900 °C and 0.001–10 s −1 strain rate . The deformed microstructure was characterized by the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and the transmission electron microscopy . The constitutive equations of the alloys were established. According to the microstructure analysis , it can be observed that the grain size of the alloy with Cr was more uniform. In addition, the misorientation angle of 14.19 during recrystallization was significantly lower than 24 after the recrystallization, which means that the migration rate of grain boundaries is slow. The texture of the Cu-Ni-Co-Si alloy at 800 °C is the Goss {011}〈100〉 texture and {001}〈100〉 cubic texture, while the Goss texture at 900 °C is replaced by the {011} 〈112〉brass texture. The effects of Cr on precipitation phases were analyzed, and the precipitated phases were (Ni, Co) 2 Si, Co 2 Si. The addition of Cr promoted precipitation and significantly reduced the precipitate size . The addition of Cr can improve the strength and activation energy of the alloy. The activation energy was 569.8 kJ/mol and 639.5 kJ/mol, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Graphene oxide has been proven to be a promising anti-penetrant shield for Mg alloys against their over-rapid biodegradation, but the weak interfacial bonding between graphene oxide and Mg alloy is the main obstacle for effective protection. In this study, magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles are coated on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) surface and then introduced in AZ61 alloy by laser melting, expecting to strengthen the interfacial bonding between Mg matrix and RGO. The results reveal that MgO acts as an interfacial bridge between Mg matrix and RGO and constructs nanoscale-contact and distortion areas with RGO. Moreover, MgO and α-Mg form a semi-coherent interfacial structure, in which an orientation relationship of MgO (‾200)//α-Mg (‾110‾2) and a small planar disregistry of 7.5\% are detected. These interfacial characteristics indicate strong bonding at both the RGO/MgO and MgO/α-Mg interfaces, which thereby strengthens the protective capability of RGO. Compared with AZ61-RGO composite and AZ61 alloy, the AZ61-RGO/MgO composite present 13.3\% and 34.0\% decreases in corrosion rate , respectively. Meanwhile, the compressive strength and hardness of AZ61 alloy are also enhanced owing to the strengthened interfacial bonding. These findings demonstrate that the RGO/Mg interfacial strengthening is a promising candidate for improving the degradation behavior of Mg alloys.},

We observed a “smaller is stronger” size effect in the yield strength as a function of pillar diameter, D, of both alloy phases for all temperatures, with a power-law exponent, m, decreasing with temperature for the FCC phase, and remaining constant for all temperatures in the BCC phase. We found reduced work-hardening rates and more extensive strain bursts during deformation at lower temperatures in all samples. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of similar FCC and BCC HEA compression that displayed deformation dominated by dislocation slip at all temperatures. We discussed theories of low-temperature strengthening in HEAs, compared them to our experimental data and assessed how they manifest in the observed temperature-dependent size effect and work-hardening.},

Magnetic drug targeting has been shown to be an effective strategy by manipulating therapeutics inside the body using a magnetic field and an iron oxide carrier. However, the effective targeting range of current magnets limits this method to small animal experiments or superficial parts of the human body. Here we produce clinically translatable magnet designs capable of increasing exposure of tissue to magnetic fields and field gradients , leading to increased carrier accumulation. The iron oxide nanoparticle capturing efficiency was first assessed in vitro using a simple vascular flow system. Secondly, accumulation of these particles, following magnetic targeting, was evaluated in vivo using a range of different magnet designs. We observed that our bespoke magnet produced a 4-fold increase in effective targeting depth when compared to a conventional 1 T disk magnet. Finally, we show that this magnet is readily scalable to human size proportions and has the potential to target 100 nm particles up to a depth of 7 cm at specific locations of human body.},

However, the anisotropic discrepancy between microstructure and host bone is still unclear, and the mathematical relationship to design microstructures with controllable anisotropy has not been established. In the study, the numerical method for anisotropic evaluation of microstructures was developed from the generalized Hooke&#39;s law by the finite element method and programming. The 3D spatial distributions of effective modulus surfaces for four porous units were analyzed. The mapping relationship between anisotropy coefficient and geometric parameters was built. Finally, the comparison of anisotropy was investigated systematically. The numerical method can characterize the spatial distribution of modulus and anisotropy effectively. Modulus anisotropy can be controlled by adjusting geometric sizes and the response mechanism of modulus spatial distribution caused by the distribution of materials was revealed. The ratio of modulus extremum indicated that is necessary for the accurate evaluation of modulus and the influence of anisotropy on the service performance. This study not only evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the mechanical anisotropy between porous structures and host bone, but also will lay the foundation for the functional bionic design of 3D printing porous prosthesis.},

In each unit cell, Voronoi tessellation is used to generate uniformly distributed seed points. Finally in the design space, all seed points are Voronoi tessellated globally, and the edges are cylindered with corresponding beam radius values. With this design method, not only can the lattice structures with uniform or graded distribution of porosity be generated, but the customized lattice structures can also be generated according to the porosity of each unit cell. Through the analysis of model data, it is verified that the uniform distribution of seed points in this paper is stable and the porosity of the model is consistent with the design value. The distribution of pore spheres between pores is used to illustrate that the lattice porous structures designed in this paper is globally controllable and locally uniform.},

The present study exploits a wide range of micro-scale experimental techniques to shed light on fatigue failure mechanisms of Laser Metal Deposition IN718 Ni-base superalloy, and to study the effect of shot peening treatment. Thorough microstructural and fractographic analyses revealed the main deformation mechanism associated with twinning during crack propagation , while crack initiation was found to be promoted by both slip system deformation and twinning around microstructural defects, rather than at sample free-surfaces. It was found that precipitates played a major role in determining the deformation mode . It was discovered that in this case-study, shot-peening residual stresses may have a detrimental effect , in view of the presence of the largest defects within a region where tensile residual stress was present. The results presented here improve understanding of failure mechanisms and thus define future directions of development for manufacture optimisation.},

The extent of compatibility achieved via the one-step was evaluated by tensile, morphological, rheological, and thermal properties. The obtained results indicated that the adhesion promoters, especially p-MDI, contributed efficiently to an improved tensile behavior of the resulting composites with a tough tensile-fracture surface compared with incompatibilized PLA/tannin composite. Moreover, these composites displayed a plateau-like rheological behavior , enhanced complex viscosity, higher melting and thermal degradation temperature.

  abstract     = {Stress shielding is one of the main problems that lead to bone resorption and revision surgery after implantation. Most of the commercially available metallic non-porous bone implants have a much greater stiffness than the native human bones and are prone to cause stress-shielding. With an open cell structure and intricate architecture, hyperbolic minimal surfaces offer several advantages such as less stress concentration, high permeability and high surface area to volume ratio, thus providing an ideal environment for cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. This paper explores the use of porous bone implant design based on Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) which is additively manufactured with ceramic material (Alumina) using Lithography-based Ceramics Manufacturing (LCM) technology. A total of 12 different primitive surface structure unit cells with pore size in the range of 500–1000 μm and porosity above 50\% were considered. This is one of the earliest studies reporting the 3D printing of TPMS-based structures using ceramic material. Our results suggest that the choice of material and a porous TPMS-based design led to fabrication of structures with a much lesser compressive modulus comparable with the native bone and hence could potentially be adopted for bone implant design to mitigate the stress-shielding effect.},

  abstract     = {During the deformation of Mg alloys , {10-12} extension twin, as one of the most active deformation mechanisms , contributed much to the formation of basal texture, yet little to dynamic recrystallization (DRX) grains, i.e., effective grain refinement. In this work, {10-12} extension twin had been creatively utilized to achieve grain refinement and property improvement in a Mg-Gd-Y alloy by multi-directional impact forging (MDIF). Firstly, flourishing {10-12} extension twins divided the parent grain into many fine independent regions (~10 μm). Meanwhile, a large number of twin boundaries were pinning mainly by interaction with neighboring dislocations in twin or matrix. Secondly, those pinned twin boundaries can effectively accumulate dislocation slips and promote the formation of extensive low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs). These high densities of LAGBs can further subdivide the independent regions provided by extension twins into micro-regions (~5 μm). Thirdly, those fine micro-regions developed to be DRX after a dynamic recovery. Finally, we obtained a yield isotropy high-strength Mg alloy with an ultimate tensile strength of 354 MPa after MDIF of 110 passes. This work proposed a brand new insight to prepare wrought Mg alloy with fine grain, yet without strong texture, which is beneficial to better formability and mechanical property isotropy.},

  abstract     = {The low-velocity impact response of closed-cell aluminium foams using various shaped indenters has been investigated. Impact tests were conducted using an instrumented drop-tower with flat, hemispherical, conical and truncated-conical indenter at impact energies ranging from 46.8 J to 105 J. The effects of variation of indenter shape and impact velocity on mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of foam have been explicitly investigated. The results show that the mechanical response of closed-cell aluminium foams under low-velocity projectile impact significantly depends on the indenters&#39; nose shape and initial impact energy. The deformation mechanisms of foam for different shaped indenters have been elucidated using reconstructed X-ray micro-computed tomography (XCT) images of the indented specimens. A good correlation between the indenter shape and deformation mechanisms has been observed. The structure-property relations of foams during dynamic indentation have also been explored by analysing the XCT images of the indented specimens. The parameters that influence the energy absorption capacity of the material are also presented.},

The existing phase transformation models, that are established based on isothermal transformations, are either difficult to reflect the real transformation process or complicated for use. Therefore, in this paper a succinct model suitable for the transformations at any cooling path was developed by separating the transformation process into a series of linear cooling steps. First, the transformation behaviors during linear cooling processes were studied by thermal expansion experiments, and then a kinetic model of the transformations at constant cooling rates was developed based on the JMAK law. Second, the additivity of the transformations during linear cooling processes was proved, and therefore the additivity rule was extended to calculate the incubation period of the transformation during non-linear cooling process. Finally, based on the crystallization model built by T. Ozawa, the new transformation model was established, and its reliability was proved by experiments.},

Its toughness value is the highest among Fe-based BMG family. The origin of high toughness was also investigated in detail by using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the high toughness are attributed to atomic-scale structural heterogeneity that resulted from large free volume, high content of metal-metal bonds and high structural disorder degree, which can promote the multiple shear bands and hinder the subsequently propagation. This work provides useful guidelines for developing tough FeNi-based BMGs with high strength and excellent soft magnetic properties from an atomic structural perspective.},

The ordered structure has been identified to be related to oxygen vacancy ordering. However, the cause of its formation remains a mystery. In this study, with a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) investigation based on negative-Cs imaging (NCSI) and atomic-column position analysis, we observed tensile strain in the above-mentioned α-Fe 2 O 3 NWs and revealed that the ordered structure was actually periodic interplanar gap expansions induced by oxygen vacancy accumulations. These findings were further confirmed in a monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis of the α-Fe 2 O 3 NWs. The EELS data indicated that, in comparison to pristine α-Fe 2 O 3 , the α-Fe 2 O 3 NWs possessed expanded average Fe O and O O interatomic distances and were oxygen-deficient. Clarifying oxygen deficiency in the α-Fe 2 O 3 NWs was not attributed to an insufficient oxygen supply during the NW growth, we concluded the ordered structure formed to accommodate tensile strain in the α-Fe 2 O 3 NWs. This work demonstrates the applicability of integrating NCSI and monochromated EELS for the examination of strain-induced microstructural and microchemical variations in lightly strained metal oxides .},

In particular, the role of TO-CNF and ChNC concentrations in filament drawing and the effect of drawing speed on the mechanical properties of composite filaments were investigated. Moreover, conductive filaments were fabricated by mixing single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with TO-CNF dispersion and further complexing with the ChNC aqueous suspension. A conductive filament with an electrical conductivity of 2056 S/m was obtained. However, the increase in the SWCNTs content reduced the mechanical properties of the formed filament compared to neat TO-CNF/ChNC filament.

  abstract     = {In this study, we build a nanostirrer, in which the circular graphene nanoflake can be driven to rotate on graphite substrate by four wedged diamond needles (DNs). Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the rotationally distributed DNs provide strong repulsion to the nanoflake via their tip atoms. Once the circumferential component of the repulsive force is non-zero, it actuates the flake to rotate at gigahertz. The stable rotational frequency (SRF) of the flake can be obtained when the friction moment from substrate balances the driving moment from DNs. Results also demonstrated that, at temperature lower than 100 K, stronger compression from DNs will introduce larger SRF to the flake due to stronger driving force from the DNs. Under the same conditions, a smaller flake has higher SRF. When changing the layout angles of DNs in a range with width of ~90°, both the SRF and rotational direction of the nanoflake change monotonously. These characteristics suggest a clue for design of a nano-stirrer with controllable rotation for potential applications, e.g., separation and purification or generating nanoflow field through the gigahertz rotary flake.},

With the aid of computational thermodynamics, this work designed two model alloys: Fe-37.4Ni-6.1Al-2.9Ti (FNAT) and Fe-45.2Ni-5.9Al-8.5Si (FNAS). Both alloys were designed to contain a similar amount of L1 2 precipitate in Fe-Ni matrix without forming other precipitates. Density-Function-Theory (DFT) calculation was coupled with computational thermodynamics to predict the critical radius at which the precipitates change shape from spherical to cuboidal. The calculation results suggest that critical radius for the FNAT alloy is about two orders of magnitude larger than that for the Fe Ni Al Si alloy. Phase stability and morphology of the L1 2 precipitates in these two alloys were experimentally investigated through X-ray diffraction, atom probe tomography, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy . The L1 2 precipitates in the Fe Ni Al Si system were found to be cuboidal and rod shaped, with much larger size than the spherical ones in the Fe Ni Al Ti system, agreeing with the calculation results. This work suggested that coupling computational thermodynamics with DFT calculations can be reliably used to design L1 2 precipitates in Fe Ni based alloys.},

In this strategy, p -aramid nanofibers with an average diameter of 16 ± 4 nm and an average length of 382 ± 89 nm were employed as membrane matrices. Prior to the immersion of the cast film into a coagulation bath , a pre-evaporation protocol was carefully designed and introduced to provide a slower exchange rate between the good solvent and the non-solvent, which delayed the demixing process between p -aramid nanofibers and thus yielded an asymmetric membrane with a denser active layer as well as a loose substrate layer. The resultant membrane showed excellent FO water flux, NaCl rejection ratios, tensile strength , thermal properties, and solvent resistance . The membrane reported in this work may provide a promising candidate for separation applications and the results reported herein will facilitate the development of high-performance nanofibrous membranes.},

Multiple phases other than Ni phase, i.e., α-W and β-W, were found to coexist when the content of W was presumably beyond its solid solubility limit in Ni. Noticeable retardation of the densification of Ni was observed depending on the content of W in the resultant film electrodes fired at different temperatures up to 1200 °C. As expected, electrical resistivity of the film electrodes depended on the progress of densification. A large variation of electrical resistivity with different W contents was observed at the low temperature of 900 °C while the variation became very small at high temperatures of &gt;1100 °C for all the films. The successful late densification indicates that the Ni-W alloy system is suitable as a microcircuit electrode with a reasonably low electrical resistivity of ~10 −5 Ω cm.},

Lack of fusion pore and spherical keyhole pore were found. The porosity decreased with an increase in the volumetric energy density (VED). The crystallographic texture characteristics along the build direction were investigated using electron backscatter diffraction analysis. It was confirmed that, similar to other materials, pure Mo tends to form a crystallographic texture. A strong fiber texture was observed at a high laser power (350 W) and low scan speed (400 mm/s). However, this fiber texture changed completely to a fiber texture when the scan speed was increased to 800 mm/s. Scan speed had a significant effect on the resulting texture characteristics directly. Other process parameters, laser power, layer thickness and hatch distance had an effect indirectly by changing the VED value on the texture.},

  abstract     = {A novel alumina-assisted treatment process was proposed to manufacture fully densified and perfectly spherical WC-Co particles for thermal spraying applications. In as-sprayed coating, the decarburization phenomenon common in previous studies was almost entirely eliminated, and a unique binder structure with nanocrystalline and amorphous Co co-existing was obtained. Owing to the strengthening effects of nanocrystalline Co and WC/Co interfacial bonding , the wear resistance of the new coating was 4 times higher than that of the conventional coating prepared with a porous feedstock . Instead of plastic deformation , interface fracture and micro-cutting that mainly occurred in conventional WC-based coatings, fracture of WC grains and subsequent oxidation dominated wear failure of the new WC-Co coating. The present work opens up new opportunities for the fabrication of dense ceramic-metal composite particles and wear-resistance enhancement of cermet coatings.},

  abstract     = {X-ray computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a powerful tool for the 3D characterisation of materials. However, in order to obtain a useful tomogram, sufficient image quality should be achieved in the radiographs before reconstruction into a 3D dataset. The ratio of signal- and contrast-to-noise (SNR and CNR, respectively) quantify the image quality and are largely determined by the transmission and detection of photons that have undergone useful interactions with the sample. Theoretical transmission can be predicted if only a few variables are known: the material chemistry and penetrating thickness e.g. the particle diameter. This work discusses the calculations required to obtain transmission values for various Li(Ni X Mn Y Co Z )O 2 (NMC) lithium-ion battery cathodes. These calculations produce reference plots for quick assessment of beam parameters when designing an experiment. This is then extended to the theoretical material thicknesses for optimum image contrast. Finally, the theoretically predicted transmission is validated through comparison to experimentally determined values. These calculations are not exclusive to NMC, nor battery materials, but may be applied as a framework to calculate various sample transmissions and therefore may aid in the design and characterisation of numerous materials.},

  abstract     = {The stress-strain characteristics of nonlinear visco-elastoplastic architectural fabrics show a mechanically saturating behaviour in cyclic tensile tests : stiffness changes decline, the increase of permanent strain decreases and the nonlinear material behaviour increasingly approaches a linear behaviour. Appropriate stress-strain paths for elastic material models for the structural analysis must be taken from load cycles in which the saturation processes are finished to a satisfactory degree. Generally, consistency of elastic analysis of fabric strutctures is achieved when it is based on the fabric&#39;s saturated state and the closely linked stable amount of presstress in the structure. To determine load cycles correlated to the saturated state, a new method is proposed here which considers three different inspection characteristics: irreversible strain increment , total strain increment and intensity of nonlinearity. Biaxial saturation tests with 1000 load cycles are performed on a PVC-coated polyester fabric . For each inspection characteristic, saturation development curves are generated. They are fitted by functions with horizontal asymptotes and are thereby extrapolated, revealing that for the tested polyster fabric tens of thousands of load cycles are required to achieve a satisfying state of saturation. The meaning and implications for biaxial testing and analysis of textile structures is discussed.},

  abstract     = {The dependence of oxidation rates on grain orientation has been observed for austenitic alloys suggesting crystallographic control of such processes. To better understand these observations, the active and transpassive oxidation behaviors of an austenitic AISI 316L stainless steel were investigated using vertical scanning interferometry (VSI). The oxidation rates of &gt;100 unique grains were measured and related to their crystallographic orientations (i.e., with respect to the surface normal direction) as identified using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The oxidation rates follow a scaling that is given by: {001} &lt; {101} &lt; {111} for grains undergoing both active and transpassive oxidation. The corrosion tendencies of {001} and {101} grains indicate that the activation energy of dissolution follows a scaling similar to that of the surface energy. However, the high corrosion rates of {111} grains, which feature a surface energy lower than those of the {001} and {101} grains, is attributed to their lower tendency to adsorb passivating species, from solution, that leads to a net reduction in the activation energy of oxidation. These insights provide improved understanding of the crystallographic controls of oxidation processes, and thereby suggest processing pathways for enhancing the oxidation resistance of stainless steels.},

However, challenges exist in determining the crack length, in producing geometry and notch geometry, in defining of the initiation toughness and in extracting the size independent crack resistance curves. In this study, we assess current approaches of measuring the fracture toughness of semi-brittle materials by elasto-plastic fracture mechanics. We investigate the notch geometry (through thickness notch and bridge notch), the notch depth and the method of determining in situ the crack length for ultrafine grained tungsten . Further challenges due to the overlap of sample size and crack process zone are identified.

Again, the precipitation of the reinforcing θ phase provided numerous nucleation sites .

These new technologies require the development of optimized materials with two-folded capabilities, able to satisfy functional in-service requirements but also showing a proper printability. Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) is among the most interesting thermoplastic materials to be implemented in a LFAM device due to its excellent wettability and mechanical properties. This research focuses on the development and characterization of ASA and carbon fiber (CF) ASA composites suitable for LFAM. The rheological, thermal and mechanical properties of neat ASA and ASA containing 20 wt\% CF are addressed. The results evidence the higher performance of the CF loaded composite compared to the raw ASA polymer (i.e., the 20 wt\% CF composite shows a 350\% increase in flexural Young&#39;s Modulus and a 500\% increment in thermal conductivity compared with neat ASA). Additionally, both materials were successfully printed along perpendicular directions (X and Z), showing the maximum tensile strain for the composite printed along the X orientation as was expected. The results of the flexural tests are comparable or slightly higher than those of injected parts. Finally, the fracture surface was analysed, identifying different types of porosity.},

When 0.16 wt\% of Al was added to the plain C-Mn steel, the impact behaviour significantly improved even though Widmanstätten ferrite (WF) was present. This improvement was due to refinement of the grain boundary carbides and removing the N from solution as AlN. The hot rolled steels all contained WF but when Nb was added more WF formed as well as martensite/retained austenite (MA) giving poor impact behaviour. Reducing the hardenability from that shown in previous work by decreasing C from 0.1 to 0.06 wt\%, Nb from 0.03 to 0.02 wt\%, and cooling rate from 33 to 17 K/min had no effect in improving the impact performance of hot rolled Nb steels. To ensure optimum properties not only is it necessary to reduce the hardenability, but WF formation must be discouraged by having a high Ar 3 . This can only be presently achieved by refining the austenite grain size via control rolling the Nb containing steels; the benefit of adding Al can then, readily be seen. Suggestions are made as to how this might be achieved for hot rolling.},

Although paraffin wax actuators are a convenient solution for microactuators, high force macroscopic actuators are not established yet. On a macroscopic scale the design of the actuator housing and the manufacturing process are challenging. The presented concept consists of a closed housing, which surrounds the phase change material. A compact actuator design without sealed moveable parts is realized. Thus, the actuators provide high axial forces . Compared to existing solutions an increase in performance by a factor of 7 could be achieved. The essential actuator structure is introduced, characterized and the challenges in manufacturing are discussed.

In this method, PA12 fibers with desired diameters are first prepared by melt spinning of PA12 pellets. Then, short PA12 fibers after being cropped are dispersed and melted in the hydrosoluble polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrix. During the subsequent thermal treatment process, the molten PA12 fibers spontaneously disintegrate via Plateau-Rayleigh instability and the resultant near-spherical particles are then released by dissolving the PEO matrix with water. In-situ optical microscopy and kinetic analysis based on the Tomotika&#39;s model indicate that the diameter of particles is mainly determined by that of fibers while the transformation dynamics depend largely on the temperature of thermal treatment. The utilization of a two-step thermal treatment can effectively accelerate the fiber-to-particle transformation dynamics. The powder prepared has an excellent flowability similar to that of commercial powders due to its high degree of sphericity , smooth surface and narrow size distribution. Calorimetry results indicate that the powder prepared had a narrow melting range and wide sintering window.},

  abstract     = {Laser surface engineering was successfully used to engineer a nano carbide composite coating on a low carbon steel substrate. Two powder precursors of B 4 C and B 4 C+ 4 wt\% Fe were utilized with different laser powers and processing speeds. A smooth crack free coating layer was achieved with B 4 C+ 4 wt\% Fe powder precursor. The phase evolution and microstructure characterization of the coating layer were conducted using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy . Microscopy observations revealed a fine dendritic microstructure consisting of α-Fe phase dendrites with nanosized B 4 C precipitates, while the interdendritic regions contained mainly Fe 2 B and Fe 3 C phases. The retention of B 4 C in the coating layer was observed only at high laser power with high scanning speed. This is due to the lower stability of B 4 C with respect to Fe 2 B and Fe 3 C phases as confirmed with density functional theory based thermodynamic calculations . The hardness increased nearly seven fold for the nano-composite coating compared to the steel substrate due to evolution of high hardness ceramic phases, in addition to the refinement of the microstructure. This laser coating has a high potential in advance engineering applications where a thick coating layer with high hardness is required.},

The crack initiation was detected by the AE signals, and the time evolution of stress concentration and hydrogen diffusion were calculated by FEM. The effect of hardness and plastic strain on the hydrogen diffusion coefficient was explicitly introduced into the governing equation in FEM. The criterion and indicator parameter for the crack initiation were derived as a function of maximum principal stress and locally accumulated hydrogen concentration. The results showed that the cracking criterion derived by AE and FEM is useful for predicting the cold cracking behavior and determining the critical preheat temperature to prevent hydrogen-induced cracking.},

A vascular system houses healing agents within its hollow channels or interconnected networks which are incorporated within a cement matrix . It is the only self-healing approach that has the capability to address different scales of damage in cementitious materials . The main aim of this work is to develop a novel vascular network inspired by nature for self-healing in cementitious systems . To achieve this, a biomimetic three-dimensional (3D) vascular network was designed and generated following Murray&#39;s law for circulatory blood volume transfer. The designed structures were constructed through 3D printing and assessed in a cement-based matrix. One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models were also designed, printed and embedded into cement prisms to compare with the 3D vascular system. Load recovery was used to assess recovery in mechanical properties after the sample was cracked and pumped with sodium silicate for 28 days. Mechanical testing assessed the compatibility of the system with the surrounding matrix as well as the functionality of the network in delivering and releasing the healing agent at the location of damage. This initial proof of concept work confirmed the ability of all vascular systems to deliver the healing agent after a damage event, and the 3D vascular system demonstrated a significantly enhanced healing performance.},

Neutron based stroboscopic techniques have previously been introduced for measuring strains undergoing cyclic processes but have not been used for tribological applications. This work presents a novel approach for measuring the evolution of radial strain in a rotating bearing through part of the component&#39;s lifetime. A cylindrical roller bearing was pre-overloaded to increase the probability of damage within a reasonable experimental time and to help develop further understanding of the influence such events have on bearing life, notably for the application of wind turbine gearbox bearing failure. The stroboscopic neutron diffraction technique was successful in measuring time-resolved contact strain, with a significant increase in compressive radial strain being observed after a suspected failure had been detected using condition monitoring techniques, implemented for validating damage propagation . Cyclic contact strains associated with rolling contact fatigue were also evaluated using neutron diffraction.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an insight into the premature Type IV cracking was undertaken to clarify its mechanisms in Grade 91 steel pipe weldments . High-resolution microscopy observations of the as-welded heat-affected zone (HAZ) reveal that the commonly recognized fine-grained region susceptible of cracking on the edge of HAZ belongs to the inter-critical HAZ (ICHAZ), rather than the fine-grained HAZ (FGHAZ). Instrumented indentation tests uncover that the ICHAZ is the weakest region across the weld, exhibiting the largest displacement and the lowest hardness in three thermal stages. Localized deformation of matrix grains and high stress triaxiality in the ICHAZ promoted nucleation of creep cavities along grain boundaries. This localized deformation was induced by the creep strength mismatch of matrix grains with different Cr concentrations. Cavity-free regions exhibit a relatively homogenous Cr distribution, whereas, an inhomogeneous Cr distribution is observed in the cavity-containing regions. It is believed that this local Cr inhomogeneity in the ICHAZ is caused by the partial dissolution of Cr-rich M 23 C 6 carbides and an insufficient homogenization during rapid welding thermal cycles.},

Accordingly, two strain-approach-based fatigue models were developed and allowed accounting for the different influence of stress, and strain, concentration on the fracture behavior for static failure, LCF and HCF . To account for the variation of mechanical properties with fiber orientation , Autodesk Moldflow Insight simulations were performed, and the resulting fiber orientations were mapped into Abaqus via the mapping program Autodesk Helius.

The predictive power of the constitutive models was assessed for a wide range of plastic strains, from the start of the plastic region up to a strain value of 1, including strain hardening at the beginning of the flow curve. Comparisons between experiments and models by means of the Pearson correlation coefficient and relative errors, considering different strain ranges, showed that the goodness of the models depends strongly on the considered strain range. Results revealed that the Garofalo-Arrhenius model provided the highest accuracy at any strain range, followed by the Hensel-Spittel models and the newly proposed Johnson-Cook model, which performed more accurately than its commonly employed modified version.},

Particularly, a facile tubular deposition modeling method was established, in which deionized (DI) water was selected as the core and first coextruded with the elastomeric shell and then scarified and replaced by injecting liquid metal (LM). To weave the continuous single core-shell fiber, tactile sensing nodes were formed easily and precisely to position-registered mechanical pressure stimuli. The resistive responses including sensitivity, coupling and reliability of the sensor architecture were examined, and the tracing mode was performed. Furthermore, the tactile sensor could be directly patterned on a 3D surface.

First-principles calculations indicate that Ca atoms substituting for La atoms would decrease the stability of Al 11 La 3 and result in that Al 11 La 3 become metastable even at 0 K.

This result explicitly shows that, even at low growth temperatures of ~550 °C, not all of the supplied indium is incorporated into the quantum well (QW). Moreover, the residual indium can become incorporated into the GaN matrix on either side of the QW. Both QW thickness and the photoluminescence (PL) emission energy showed a self-regulating behavior. The apparent thickness did not exceed 2 MLs even when the deposited InN thickness is as large as 5 MLs. The PL emission shows a continuous redshift with the deposited InN from ~370 nm for 0.5 ML until it saturates at ~423 nm for &gt;2 ML.

In present study, graphene oxide (GO) was introduced into PVDF scaffold manufactured via selective laser sintering , aiming to enhance piezoelectric effect of PVDF by increasing β phase content. In detail, the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO could form strong hydrogen bonding with fluorine groups of PVDF. The interaction would force the fluorine groups to be arranged in parallel and perpendicular to the polymer chain, thereby inducing the transformation from α phase to β phase. Results demonstrated that the PVDF/0.3GO scaffold with improved β phase exhibited the maximal output voltage (~8.2 V) and current (~101.6 nA), which were improved by 82.2\% and 68.2\%, respectively, in comparison with pure PVDF. In vitro cell culture confirmed that enhanced electrical charges could significantly improve cell behavior. Moreover, the scaffold presented a 97.9\% increase in compressive strength and 24.5\% increase in tensile strength , which was attributed to GO reinforcements forming strong interaction with PVDF chains. These positive results suggested that the scaffold might have possible application in bone tissue engineering .},

  abstract     = {Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) can cause expansion and cracking of concrete. Despite significant progress over the past 80 years, the molecular structures of the ASR products remain poorly understood. These reaction products are present in very small amounts within concrete aggregates, which severely limit their chemical and physical characterizations . In this study, synthesis of an ASR product structurally identical to that formed in field concrete is achieved in large quantities at 40 °C. The temperature is found to affect the formation of different types of crystalline ASR products: 12.0 Å (&lt;40 °C), 10.8 Å (around 40 °C), and 13.1 Å (60–80 °C for K-shlykovite), which all have layered silicate-sheet structures. Both 10.8 and 13.1 Å ASR products cannot swell at high relative humidity. This suggests that swelling of the studied crystalline ASR products by uptake of water cannot be the mechanism of ASR-induced expansion at 40 to 80 °C. These findings help to better understand ASR in concrete and pave the way for developing innovative solutions for limiting ASR.},

Three kinds of intermetallic phases, namely ε-Mg 3 Ag (or ε-Mg 26 − x Ag 7+x ), β′-Mg 2 (Al,Ag) 3 , and γ-Mg 17 Al 12 , were observed to aggregate together following certain crystallographic orientation relationships (ORs) as: (001) ε //(1 1 ¯ 1¯ 2) γ and [100] ε //[110] γ (OR1), (001) ε //(110) γ and [001] ε //[110] γ (OR2), (01 1 ¯ 1¯ ) β ′ //( 1 ¯ 1¯ 10) γ and [100] β ′ //[110] γ , and (001) β ′ //(010) ε and [100] β ′ //[100] ε . TEM observations combined with the corresponding phase diagrams reveal that the ε phase firstly formed during solidification, then the γ phase nucleated on the ε phase, and finally, the β′ phase nucleated on the γ phase. This special intermetallic phase composition which owns numerous fine particles and many semi-coherent interphase boundaries results in high-strength and high-ductility for the casting QA61 alloy.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, ZnMg-Zn bilayer coatings with different Mg concentrations and layer thicknesses are deposited on steel substrates by a thermal evaporation process. Thermodynamic calculations reveal that the work of adhesion at the ZnMg/Zn interface (~1.6 J/m 2 ) is lower than that at the Zn/Steel interface (~3 J/m 2 ). This indicates that the ZnMg/Zn interface is inherently weaker than the interface between Zn and steel substrate. The interfacial adhesion strength quantified by the scratch test shows that the adhesion strength at the ZnMg/Zn interface decreases with increasing the Mg content and reaches 66 MPa at 16.5 wt\% Mg. It is found that the presence of interfacial defects largely decreases the adhesion strength compared to a defect-free coating. Meanwhile, it is also concluded that the interfacial adhesion strength at the ZnMg/Zn interface does not depend on the thickness of Zn interlayer . The results of the present investigation show that the interfacial adhesion strength is not the only governing parameter for the adhesion performance of the ZnMg-Zn bilayer coatings in forming process, but the thickness of the layers as well as interfacial defect density also play important roles in the adhesion performance.},

  abstract     = {Electrodeposition of stainless steel-like materials such as FeCrNi alloy into micro- and nanotemplates provides a sustainable framework for creating biomedical-oriented micro- and nanocomponents with outstanding characteristics. While Cr(III)-based electrodeposition represents a ‘green’ alternative to toxic Cr(VI), its use is limited by Cr(III) aqueous chemistry which leads to the incorporation of impurities and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). These factors are responsible for low deposition efficiencies, brittleness and porosity. The current work sought to investigate the use of ‘green’ Cr(III)-glycine electrolyte to improve FeCrNi electrodeposition from Cr(III) precursors. Mixed-solvent electrolyte containing ethylene glycol (EG) was employed to reduce HER aftereffects. FeCrNi mixed EG electrolytes were compared to their aqueous counterparts to observe differences in Cr(III)-glycine complexation, coatings&#39; composition and current efficiency. The feasibility of this method for creating nanostructures was verified by template-assisted electrodeposition using anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates. This study established that mixed-solvent electrolytes are an effective strategy to improve Cr(III)-based plating of alloys into miniaturised moulds. For the first time, electrodeposited FeCrNi nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes (NTs) were achieved via the framework developed in this work. The possible mechanisms controlling the morphological variations in FeCrNi nanostructures were discussed in relation to the kinetic and growth models in single metal electroplating into nanotemplates.},

Different concentrations of 0–8 g/L Na 2 WO 4 were added into the MAO electrolyte and its effects on the MAO behavior and coating microstructure were investigated. The results showed that the addition of Na 2 WO 4 enhanced the MAO reaction intensity on the part of Al alloy (P-Al) in the Al-Ti composite plate and correspondingly increased the coating thickness, while the reaction intensity and coating thickness on the part of Ti alloy (P-Ti) was decreased. XRD analysis confirmed a formation of WO 3 in both side coatings of the composite plate, and W 6+ was detected similarly by XPS spectra. SEM observations indicated that the surface porosity and thickness of the P-Ti coating was reduced, while those of the P-Al coating was increased with the increase of Na 2 WO 4 concentration. TEM analysis verified that corresponding oxide phases and WO 3 were formed in the different MAO coatings on the P-Al or the P-Ti and the addition of Na 2 WO 4 enhanced the coating compactness of the transition zone. EDX detection proved that W concentration in the P-Ti coating was higher than that in the P-Al coating. The nano-indentation tests showed that the hardness and Young&#39;s modulus of both side coatings were improved with adding Na 2 WO 4 . A competitive mechanism was proposed for the MAO process with the addition of Na 2 WO 4 , and the distribution of electrical energy was found to be balanced in both sides of composite plate.},

  abstract     = {Bamboo-grained Ni-Mn-Ga microwire is promising for achieving considerable magnetic-field-induced strain due to less neighboring grain constraints to the twin boundary motion. Such reduction of resistance to interface motion also favors the reduction of hysteresis in magnetic refrigeration. Here, bamboo-grained Ni-Mn-Ga microwires were successfully synthesized by a melt-extraction technique and subsequent high temperature heat treatment at 1323 K for 3 h under Argon atmosphere . Corresponding microstructure, martensite transformation (MT) behaviors and magnetocaloric properties were investigated. The high specific surface area of the microwires favored the element evaporation at high temperature, leading to a heterogeneous composition state, which is responsible for the MT temperature (range) change and the multi-variants state in the bamboo-grained microwires. Nearly no magnetic hysteresis loss was obtained. The increased compositional variation led to the partial overlap of the MT and the magnetic transition, resulting in the improvement of the working temperature interval ~71 K and net refrigeration capacity ~255 J/kg under μ 0 H = 5 T, which is heretofore the largest value reported in Ni-Mn-based Heusler alloys. When utilized as refrigerant in a cooling device, such small-sized microwires can increase the contacting area between the material and the heat-transfer agent, which helps the heat exchange and thus improve the refrigeration efficiency.},

The layout design includes the curvilinear path and non-uniform distribution of stiffeners. Firstly, the path of curvilinear stiffeners is defined by the piecewise linear function, and the non-uniform distribution of curvilinear stiffener cluster is described by the proposed representation method based on the PCHIP interpolation function . In addition to the layout design, the variable profile design method of grid-stiffened structures is also proposed in this paper. The variations of the thickness and height of stiffeners are represented by curves respectively. Similarly, the variable profile design of stiffeners is realized by designing the curves. On this basis, various novel configuration of curvilinearly grid-stiffened panels can be obtained by the integrated layout and profile design. The effectiveness of the proposed integrated design framework is validated by numerical examples. Compared with the initial design, the final integrated design improves the critical buckling factor of the grid-stiffened panel by 73.09\%, which shows a great design potential of this kind of variable-stiffness structure compared to constant-stiffness structures.},

To improve the strengthening effects , dislike the conventional nanosheets and laminated graphene embedded in graphene reinforced metal-matrix composites (GRMMCs), here a strategy is presented, via molecular dynamics simulations, to derive a new GRMMC in the form of nanoscale Cu grains fully enclosed by graphene-boundary (GrB). It is demonstrated that the strong dislocation storage and lacking conventional GB-mediated mechanisms in the designed GRMMC could result in extremely high strength of 8.77 GPa and pronounced strain hardening rate compared with nanocrystalline Cu. The design of GB engineering through replacing metallic GBs via GrBs may pave a new way to tailoring GRMMCs without anisotropic limitations, realizing excellent strength and strain hardening capacity.},

  abstract     = {Optimization of process parameters of major aerospace composites manufacturing techniques is essential for manufacturing high-quality aerospace components. However, studying many parameters through experimental approaches is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Modern X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) technology has made it possible to monitor the complete manufacturing process “in-situ,” due to its high spatial resolution and very short acquisition time. The scanned data can then be used to generate numerical models for predicting different process parameters. This article presents a comprehensive review of the design and modeling aspects of key aerospace composites manufacturing techniques using the XCT procedure. Key functioning of XCT is reviewed with a view to adopt several modeling approaches ranging from mesoscale to macro-scale models for composites processing. The XCT machine parameters during image acquisition and post-processing determine the accuracy and computation time, which are also discussed in detail. The applications of XCT-based material models are reviewed for process characterization of autoclave and out-of-autoclave manufacturing. Current aerospace manufacturing characterization techniques, combined with advanced modeling approaches using XCT and CFD tools, show great potential for designing modern material models that will help in the design of better manufacturing processes for next generation aerospace parts.},

A method of parametrising the spaceframe through its constituent unit cells is proposed, and Genetic Algorithm (GA) multi-objective optimisation is used to optimise its topology, size and geometry as a generic structure. The superior performance of the topology optimised periodic spaceframe is highlighted in terms of structural rigidity, large deformation capability, buckling and vibrational modal analysis in compare to equivalent beam structures of identical weight and comparable domain.

Methods including powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy are usually combined to characterize the crystalline structure in these “amorphous” materials. Until now, these methods, however, have failed to show the crystallization of individual crystals in three dimensions. In this work, in-situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (BCDI) reveals the growth and the strain variation of individual crystals in the Fe-based MGs during annealing. There is preferential growth along the surface of the MG sample particles during the crystal formation and fractal structure formation around the developing crystal surfaces; there is also strain relaxation happening from the inner parts to the surfaces of the developing crystals while cooling. The work leads to propose that during the crystallization of Fe-based MGs, the growth of the individual crystals follows a two-step procedure; and at higher temperature after the first crystallization period of the Fe-based MGs, the crystallization of α-Fe could be a competitive process between the growth of α-Fe crystals and the erosion from other elements.},

The transformed fraction versus time curves yielded excellent fits to the classic Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model with a constant nucleation rate during transformation process (Avrami exponent, n of 4). Addition of nucleation agent accelerated the transformation by shortening the incubation period, but the nucleation rate decreased to zero in the following transformation ( n = 3). Furthermore, coarsening grain size depressed β → α transformation and led to the saturation of nucleation sites in the vicinity of half transformation ( n decreasing from 4 to 2). The simple, convenient, and reliable method proposed showed high sensitivity with detection limits of about 2\%, and it could be a promising approach to study and predict solid-state phase transformation kinetics .},

The fully-soft flat bifilar coil, based on the Tesla coil design, can be fabricated by encapsulating a cost-effective, easy-to-implement, and scalable liquid-metal-elastomer-tube in a soft planar composite. By combining pneumatic actuation of the soft coil with application of a high voltage across the two electrodes, a morphologically adaptive and soft electroadhesive is demonstrated and can be used to lift lightweight and flexible textiles from curved surfaces. At the same time, capacitive, resistive, and inductive sensing functionalities can be achieved by interrogating the bifilar coil. This stretchable bifilar coil has the potential to enable soft multimodal adhesives such as entirely-soft electro-magneto adhesives with incorporated soft resistive, capacitive, and inductive sensing for soft robotics and implantable devices .},

  abstract     = {Driven by the competitive market that product designers face today, a growing interest emerges in exploring experiential material qualities to enhance product experience. The maturing of the research area calls for standardization to evolve to more streamlined and systematic approaches to conduct characterization experiments. To this aim, we conducted a literature review on 64 cases of experiential characterization studies in the materials and design domain. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art, formulate an overview to facilitate systematic studies to explore experiential qualities of materials, and identify gaps or opportunities for further research. The presented learnings shed light on the following aspects used in materials experience studies: (i) variables, (ii) stimuli, (iii) interaction modalities, (iv) experimental set-up, (v) methods employed in the conducted studies, and (vi) respondents. Two important gaps were identified with regard to the physical material representations in an abstract form as a critical element for multimodal material characterization experiments, and to an integration of extensive user aspects beyond demographic variables to facilitate consumer segmentation . Additional future research suggestions were formulated, concerning within-material-class comparisons, complementary methods and experimental set-up, and the temporality of materials experience.},

  abstract     = {We explore the application of computer vision and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict material properties (e.g., compressive strength) based on SEM images. We show that it&#39;s possible to train ML models to predict materials performance based on SEM images alone, demonstrating this capability on the real-world problem of predicting uniaxially compressed peak stress of consolidated molecular solids samples. Our image-based ML approach reduces mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by an average of 24\% over baselines representative of the current state-of-the-practice (i.e., domain-expert&#39;s analysis and correlation). We compared two complementary approaches to this problem: (1) a traditional ML approach, random forest (RF), using state-of-the-art computer vision features and (2) an end-to-end deep learning (DL) approach, where features are learned automatically from raw images. We demonstrate the complementarity of these approaches, showing that RF performs best in the “small data” regime in which many real-world scientific applications reside (up to 24\% lower RMSE than DL), whereas DL outpaces RF in the “big data” regime, where abundant training samples are available (up to 24\% lower RMSE than RF). Finally, we demonstrate that models trained using machine learning techniques are capable of discovering and utilizing informative crystal attributes previously underutilized by domain experts.},

Therefore, unit cell and sandwich beams with lattice cell cores were modeled, simulated, manufactured, and tested. The change in lattice cell shape from a periodical structure into a non-periodical structure was shown on a demonstrator. A simulation of the sandwich beams was conducted using full solid and forward homogenization models with simple and complex elastoplastic fitted unit cells (UCs). The test specimens were printed, and three-point bending (3PB) tests were conducted. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data for truss-based lattice structures for periodic (7\% deviation) and non-periodic lattice cell cores. To verify the design approach, a demonstrator of a segment of a racing motorcycle front fairing was designed and manufactured.},

The aim of this work was achieved with the application of the proposed coupled experimental-numerical procedure. Firstly, an appropriate set of basic tests was proposed and performed with experimental data acquisition, and then simulated numerically in equivalent conditions. Subsequently, the combination of experimental and numerical results allowed the fracture surface of Armox 500T to be built with the biharmonic spline interpolation method. The obtained initial fracture surface was calibrated in an iterative procedure based on the results of quasi-static perforation tests with pointed, flat and hemispherical punches. Finally, the predictive capability of the developed fracture surface was confronted with other failure models disclosed in the literature for Armox 500T. The proposed failure model provided a response that was found to be qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the other models because it accurately reflected the experimentally observed perforation patterns and force histories. On the basis of the character of the designed surface, it can be stated that Armox 500T armor steel demonstrates high sensitivity of fracture properties to both triaxiality and the Lode parameter.},

In this paper, we report the evolution sequence of the arc weld pool flow that observed via fast in-situ synchrotron X-ray imaging. Varying flow regimes attribute to the dominance of characteristic forces within the weld pool during rapid solid-liquid-solid phase transformation. Our analysis indicates the general sequence in the arc, surface tension and gravity driven force domination. Welding process parameters appear to influence significantly in determining the domination interval and the intensity of individual force. In some instances, arc and surface tension driven forces can prevent pores, which causes porosity in final welded structures, escaping from the melt pool. Preliminary relations between power input levels, diffract force domination regimes, flow patterns and pool surface changes in fusion welds are suggested by considering the behavior of multiple weld pools.},

  abstract     = {Silicon carbide ceramics have many excellent properties, such as high melting point, high strength, high thermal conductivity, high hardness, high stiffness, good chemical resistance, good electrical conductivity and remarkable wear resistance. Therefore, SiC ceramics are useful for various tribological applications. Nevertheless, SiC ceramics usually exhibit poor friction characteristics under unlubricated sliding contacts, which can greatly deteriorate the durability and reliability of a tribosystem. In this work, the tribological research progress of SiC ceramics was summarized based on microstructural characteristics, self-lubrication methods, surface characteristics and external factors. First, tribological performance of SiC ceramics can be improved by controlling microstructural characteristics, such as reducing grain size of SiC ceramics, acquiring elongated SiC grains, reducing the content of grain boundary/intergranular phase, crystallizing amorphous grain boundary phases, hardening intergranular phases, controlling cracks propagation way. Second, good self-lubrication property for SiC ceramics can be obtained by annealing heat treatment, adding the secondary phase or producing porous SiC ceramics. Third, tribological performance of SiC ceramics can be improved by proper surface processing or surface modification, such as proper roughness, surface texture or coating technology. Fourth, tribological performance of SiC ceramics is affected by various external factors. Besides, the research trends of SiC ceramic tribology in future were proposed. This work aims to provide some reference for the design of SiC ceramics with high wear resistance and low friction.},

Post-cutting examination of a crystal&#39;s subsurface revealed a distorted Si I layer and an amorphous Si with embedded nanocrystalline Si-III and Si-XII. As a result of insufficient contact pressure during laser-assisted cutting, the amorphous Si was directly generated from the Si I through the collapse of the crystal lattice rather than from the intermediate high-pressure phase Si-II. The newly-formed amorphous Si crystallized partially during the laser-assisted cutting and transformed into metastable Si-III and Si-XII phases caused by the laser annealing effect . In comparison to machining without laser assistance, it was found that dislocation activity was increased by a factor of ~8 × 10 14 when laser assistance was applied. This gave rise to enhancement of plastic deformability of the material, with the critical ductile-brittle transition depth of cut increasing from 150 nm to 395 nm and the thickness and extent of stress in the distorted Si I subsurface layer being reduced.},

Here we highlight the reaction pathways involving first the formation of oxide intermediates, followed by the generation of a highly protective and low-shear transition metal disulfide tribofilm on a tailored WN-based coating, affording coefficients of friction as low as 0.05 combined with an extraordinary wear protection (i.e., no measurable wear on sliding surfaces even after 100 h of testing).

In addition, many Ta 2 O 5 submicro particles appeared on the microporous surface, which formed micro-submicro structures. Compared with PI, the surface roughness , hydrophilicity, surface energy and protein adsorption as well as apatite mineralization of STPC in simulated body fluid were obviously enhanced, which increased with Ta 2 O 5 content increasing. In addition, STPC exhibited antibacterial performances due to the presence of -SO 3 H groups and Ta 2 O 5 . Furthermore, the responses (adhesion, proliferation and differentiation) of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to STPC were remarkably promoted with the increase of Ta 2 O 5 content.

This study presents a method to perform FEA of lattice structures with accurate results. All inputs required to simulate compression testing of lattices in FEA were investigated, these included the modelling type, element size, number of unit cells required, boundary conditions and the material model. The effect of these variables on the modulus and yield strength of a lattice structure was studied. Lattices with two unit cell structures, varying unit cell sizes and relative densities were additively manufactured in stainless steel, compression tested and compared to FE simulations . The material model for the FE simulations was obtained from tensile testing individual micro-struts of varying diameters. FE simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results with an average error for the modulus and yield strength of ~10\% and 17\% respectively. The methodology presented should provide a foundation to accelerate development and adoption of these structures.},

  abstract     = {A secondary AlSi7.5Cu3-(Fe,Mn) alloy with small additions of Mn and Fe was processed by an innovative rotational outward solidification casting process to produce a functionally graded aluminum (FGA). A cylinder was produced in a single step presenting two well-defined metallurgically bonded layers (A and B) with distinct chemical composition, structure and mechanical properties . Both layers were deeply characterized through different techniques. Layer A microstructure has more than 50\%vol. of the primary α-Al 12 (Fe,Mn,Cr) 3 Si quasicrystal approximant phase embedded in an Al-FCC matrix. On the other hand, layer B presents the typical hypoeutectic microstructure of the conventional AlSi7.5Cu3 alloy. Microhardness of the primary α-Al 12 (Fe,Mn,Cr) 3 Si phase and macro-hardness profile of the FGA were measured. It was found that the hardness of layer A is approximately 1.6 times higher than layer B. This new FGA may be an alternative for producing parts that require gradient properties such as, for instance, automobile engine blocks.},

Experiments for single tracks and part samples were conducted for verification. Three kinds of molten pool states were identified and investigated: unstable state, transition state and stable state. The unstable state is characterized by numerous balling defects, where the bulk density is severely deteriorated. The transition state is featured by the transition region where the melt velocity is relatively lower, and the molten pool is vulnerable to the necking defect. The molten pool with a depression region is identified as the stable state. A small depression is favorable for improving the surface quality of single track and the bulk density. However, exorbitant energy input will convert the depression into a keyhole. Additionally, a threshold of the scanning speed was found, where the bulk density peaked. Over the threshold, the density decreased continuously with the speed increasing. However, the density slightly decreased by 1.5\% when the speed was below the threshold; this anomaly was ascribed to the residual pores induced by the recoil pressure .},

This study proposed 3D printed degradable calcium phosphate scaffolds with antibacterial functions for regeneration of jaw bone. Calcium phosphate powders and berberine were combined to modulate the printing inks. Porous scaffolds were fabricated by direct extrusion 3D printing and cross-linked with sodium alginate in situ. The dimensional size, shape and porosity of scaffolds were precisely customized by 3D printing. Berberine-loaded scaffolds show sustained release of antimicrobial drugs. By adjusting the concentration and cross-linking time of calcium chloride, the cross-linking degree of the scaffold can be adjusted and the drug load of the scaffold can be controlled. The young&#39;s modulus of 3DP scaffold was about 1.3 MPa. After freeze-drying, the shrinkage was about 24.4\% and less swelling was observed, indicating that the scaffold had sufficient structural stability. In vitro biological test showed that the 3DP scaffold had low cytotoxicity and it was beneficial to MC3T3 cell adhesion and proliferation. 3D printed calcium phosphate scaffolds with controlled-release antibacterial properties is a promising biomaterials for jaw repair.},

Scanning electron microscopy and CT analysis were used to quantitatively characterize the microcrack zone. The results demonstrated that thermal-pressure aging treatment could eliminate cracks and further improve the density and mechanical properties. The density and mechanical properties of the M-10F samples improved by the largest margin, its density increased by 1.9\% and its tensile and compressive strength increased by &gt;100\%. The improvement of the density and mechanical properties were related to the processing parameters, the initial density, and the binder content . The thermal energy and compressive stress provided to the system during thermal-pressure aging treatment can promote the binder migration at the interface. In addition, small melamine particles that are prone to displacement and rotation may migrate with F2311 to fill cracks. These processes could collectively reduce damage and defects, partially or completely heal cracks, and restore the structure and properties of the material. Crack healing under pressure and temperature indicates that thermal-pressure aging treatment has high potential for damage repair of composites with a thermoplastic binder.},

  abstract     = {Microencapsulation of healing agents has been applied to realize the self-healing function of polymeric composites . In practice, however, microencapsulation of a liquid amine is very complicated because it is soluble in water and most organic solvents . In this paper, we report a new approach to preparing amine microcapsules that constitute a dual-microcapsule epoxy-amine self-healing system for epoxy composites . Ethylenediamine (EDA)-containing microcapsule with epoxy-EDA shell was successfully synthesized via interfacial polymerization in a water-in-oil emulsion. There were three key factors to solve the problem of microencapsulated a liquid amine, including preparation of epoxy-EDA shell prepolymer , a small amount of deionized water into core material, and polydimethylsiloxane as the continuous phase. A series of methods including Fourier transform infrared, differential scanning calorimetry , optical microscope , and scanning electron microscope were carried out to prove that microcapsules were suitable for preparing self-healing composites. Healing efficiency of self-healing epoxy achieved to 80.4\% with 12 wt\% epoxy-containing microcapsules and 8 wt\% EDA-containing microcapsules. In general, this work provides a novel preparation method of liquid amine microcapsules. This novel and effective self-healing system may be useful for the development of epoxy-based structural composites for various applications.},

The additively manufactured samples exhibit a yield strength around 1700 MPa combined with a plastic strain of about 0.5\% after yielding despite the residual porosity of 1.3\%, which is distributed uniformly in the samples. The propagation of shear bands in the bulk metallic glass prepared by SLM was studied. The specific wear rate and the worn surfaces demonstrated that similar wear mechanisms are active in the SLM and the as-cast samples. Hence, manufacturing the glass in layers does not adversely affect the wear properties. The same holds for the corrosion tests, which were carried out in 0.01 M Na 2 SO 4 and 0.1 M NaCl electrolyte. The anodic polarization curves of SLM samples and as-cast samples revealed a similar corrosion behaviour . However, the SLM samples have a slightly reduced susceptibility to pitting corrosion and exhibit an improved surface healing ability, which might be attributed to an improved homogeneity of the additively manufactured glass.},

In this paper we develop a novel homogenization scheme to connect the microstructural parameters of constituent phases and the AC frequency to the dielectric breakdown strength and energy storage density of the overall composite. The major microstructural features covered are the graphite volume concentration, imperfect bonding effect, graphite aspect ratio, percolation threshold, filler-dependent electron tunneling, Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, and frequency-dependent electron hopping and dielectric relaxation. A thermodynamic framework is developed to describe the evolution of a dielectric damage parameter with respect to the electric field. We highlight the developed theory with validation through the experimental data of graphite/PVDF composite over a wide range of graphite volume concentration and AC frequency. The results indicate that the dielectric breakdown strength of the graphite-polymer composite decreases with respect to the graphite volume concentration, while the energy storage density increases with it.},

Diamond grinding tools with complex geometry are manufactured with picosecond orthogonal and quasi-tangential laser ablation . Hitherto, laser manufacturing required a special axis configuration and optical beam deflection devices are utilized. Here, strategies and processes on a scanhead-free configuration using ultra-short pulsed laser are discussed enabling straight-forward implementation in industry. This rapid and flexible approach for the production of master tools for industrial grinding processes reveals benefits compared to conventional techniques. The manufacturing time is comparable to standard processes, however, increased grain protrusion is attained with the presented laser sharpening strategy. An ablation study for maximal material-removal rate reveals the impact of wavelength, strategy, and repetition rate at high average power up to 100 W. A combined laser manufacturing routine enables an ablation rate of 35 mm 3 min −1 and a maximal geometric deviation of 3 μm after finishing. The final grinding tools are sharpened by a radial laser process preferentially removing the metal-based binding material. Hence, high-precision diamond grinding wheels with a mean error of smaller 1 μm over millimeter-sized contours can be manufactured. The meta-stable diamond structure persists and is assessed via Raman spectroscopy studies at laser cut grains.},

A range of analyses were undertaken to determine the presence of any mechanisms that could have caused this unexpected life increase; vacuum thermal exposures, small punch tensile, nanoindentation , microscopy and transmission Kikuchi diffraction. It was found that few of the mechanisms investigated were likely to have an effect on the change in life with the exceptions being; reduction in dislocation movement and crack deflection as a result of a recrystallised zone at the surface, variation in hardness of different regions due to a γ′ depleted plastic zone and a hard ceramic oxide , and reduced initiations due to the presence of a ‘healing’ chromium oxide scale .

Digital image correlation is used to measure the crack length and the displacement fields at the specimen surfaces for both grain sizes, from which the fatigue crack growth (FCG) rate, crack opening displacement and stress intensity factor range are determined. The FCG for coarse grain Ni is most significantly retarded whereas the nanocrystalline Ni is least affected by the overload due to an increased yield stress and a more planar crack surface morphology. As a result, FCG retardation by plasticity, surface roughness and residual stress-induced crack closure are reduced.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we have synthesized a flexible ZnO@C foam for its potential applications in energy production and storage devices based on the simple and versatile method. The fabricated ZnO@C foam exhibited enhanced capacitance compared to commercially available Ni foam. The fabrication process involves the synthesis of ZnO nanostructures , deposition of ZnO@C nanostructure on Ni foam, and finally, removing Ni substrate to have ZnO@C foam. Based on cyclic voltammetry , galvanostatic charge-discharge curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy , it was concluded that the ZnO@C foam has a suitable electron transfer rate and conductivity. ZnO@C foam provides a high areal specific capacitance of 1120 mF cm − 2 at a current density of 4 mA cm − 2 . The proposed flexible foam has potential applications in the fabrication of solid-state supercapacitors as well as fuel cells.},

Compared to the conventional BaTiO 3 /PVDF nanocomposite, the BaTiO 3 @TiO 2 /PVDF nanocomposite in this report takes advantage of the small particle size and the gradient dielectric design of the interface, which enhances the electric displacement as high as 65\% and the breakdown strength of 20\% simultaneously. A maximal discharged energy density of 11.34 J·cm −3 is achieved under an electric field of 420 kV·mm −1 in the nanocomposite film containing 5 vol\% BaTiO 3 @10 wt\%TiO 2 .

The dynamic compression behavior, micromorphology, ignition threshold, ignition delay time, and failure characteristics of the aluminum/polytetrafluoroethylene reactive material were investigated. The results indicate that the material&#39;s sensitivity continuously increases with temperature. Moreover, three cases of ignition delay times (500–700, 1000–1100, and 1600–1700 μs) correspond to the time of the second, third, and fourth stress pulses, respectively. The combined results of scanning electron microscopy and high-speed photography show that the polytetrafluoroethylene fibers are stretched out due to their thermal softening at 125 °C, which in turn prevents the reactive material from being ignited at the third pulse. At 205 °C, the fractured specimen can be bonded between the bars by the remarkable polytetrafluoroethylene fibers, enabling the reactive material to be ignited at the third and fourth stress pulses. This study deepens our understanding of the impact ignition mechanism of aluminum/polytetrafluoroethylene reactive materials.},

Polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) with average diameters ranging from 32 to 132 nm, in contents from 1 to 9 wt\%, were used. The PNPs act as nucleation sites for the silica network, which grows with similar structure to the purely inorganic one, although more hydrophobic and thus stable under atmospheric conditions. The macropore and mesopore morphologies of the nanohybrid materials are significantly modified by the presence of the PNPs. The effects of PNP size and content on the hybrid aerogels properties are not independent: for each PNP dimension, there is a particular content that results in a minimum value of apparent density, maximum porosity and larger mesopore dimensions. This content corresponds to the critical aggregation concentration of the PNPs, which depends on the particles&#39; size.},

For the latter, we quantify their inherently coupled normal to shear strain behavior , making use of homogenization analysis techniques. We subsequently derive the equations that characterize the bending mechanics of beams with an inner bending to normal loading coupling, starting from first principles. Thereupon, we compute the normal forces required to equilibrate the effect of bending loads on beam structures, providing relevant closed-form parametric expressions. Using the derived analytical formulas, we carry out both numerical simulations and experiments for the case of cantilever beams .

Three thermoplastic polymers act as dispersing host material for the luminescent dye Lumogen Red 305 (LR305). Molecular dynamics simulations provide numerical access to Hildebrand solubility parameters , which are an estimate for the mixing compatibility of dye with polymer matrix . Actual emission intensity measurements from material samples are compared to Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations. Some samples show an increased absorption, which led to the hypothesis that there exist optically passive dye aggregates if the dispersion is not optimal. The best-performing polymer/dye pair is identified and used to melt-spin fibers. Geometrically defined bundles of LSC fibers are studied in a scenario of white light illumination and variation of illumination-angle. This experiment simulates a theoretical daily course-of-sun illumination in absence of atmospheric effects. We report optical conversion efficiencies of the prepared LSCs between 2\% and 15\%, depending on illumination angle and bundle geometry.},

This is due to excessive osteoclast activity and a lack of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) integration at the implant-bone interface locally in the setting of osteoporosis. In order to inhibit local excessive bone resorption and promote bone integration, we have constructed a porous titanium/poloxamer 407 hydrogel system loaded with zoledronate (ZOL), a bisphosphonate, to promote osteointegration in a rabbit model of osteoporosis. This composite scaffold (ZOL/gTi) showed good biocompatibility and sustained ZOL release along with the degradation of hydrogel. Not only does this system provide a three-dimensional structural network for BMSC proliferation but also locally released ZOL promotes proliferation and osteogenic differentiation while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. After implantation of ZOL/gTi into a distal femoral defect in the rabbits, micro-CT, histological, push-out, as well as genetic and protein analyses revealed significant promotion of osteointegration with the aid of this composite scaffold. Here, we provide an important theoretical basis for the research and development of bioactive implant interfaces for patients with osteogenic defects, such as osteoporosis.},

However, generating stress-strain curves from numerical methods such as finite element method (FEM) is computationally intensive, especially when considering the entire failure path for a material. As a result, it is difficult to perform high throughput computational design of materials with large design spaces, especially when considering mechanical responses beyond the elastic limit. In this work, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to predict the entire stress-strain behavior of binary composites evaluated over the entire failure path, motivated by the significantly faster inference speed of empirical models. We show that PCA transforms the stress-strain curves into an effective latent space by visualizing the eigenbasis of PCA. Despite having a dataset of only 10 -27\% of possible microstructure configurations, the mean absolute error of the prediction is &lt;10\% of the range of values in the dataset, when measuring model performance based on derived material descriptors, such as modulus, strength, and toughness.

Selective laser sintering was employed to fabricate morphologically-controlled non-orthogonal scaffolds without the need for additional support structures. Uniaxial compression testing revealed that the elastic modulus of the resultant PCL scaffolds with sinusoidal filament networks can be widely tuned in the range of 1944.0 ± 228.7 kPa to 27.3 ± 12.0 kPa by adjusting the filament period and amplitude-to-period ratio. During periodical compression, the scaffolds experienced a rapid strain-induced softening process within the first 10 cycles of compression. A balanced stage with similar compression responses reached and stably maintained even when the scaffolds were further compressed to 200 times. The presented method might provide a promising approach to design and fabricate various flexible scaffolds with tissue-specific geometry and mechanical properties for soft tissue engineering .},

  abstract     = {The water-soluble sand cores (WSC-sand) used in the investment casting of complex three-dimensional metal parts are highly susceptible to casting defects . Our objective in this study was to optimize the fabrication process for a novel high-strength WSC-sand comprising magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) composite, based on thermodynamic analysis using a thermochemistry software package (FactSage) and experimental verification. Preliminary analyses and experiments were used to derive the optimal preparation conditions for high-strength WSC-sand-MG: raw sand (equal weights of magnesia oxide and graphite), binder (2 wt\% MgSO 4 at a concentration of 30\%), and heating temperature (200 °C). Subsequent experiments revealed that the optimal quantity of reinforcing agent (RA) (kaolinite) was 2 wt\%. The efficacy of the fabrication process was validated by creating metal casts (SNCM220 at a casting temperature of 1600 °C) using two types of WSC-sand-MG-RA samples. Nondestructive radiographic testing images and photographs of the finished casting products verified the efficacy of the proposed fabrication strategy in terms of surface smoothness and inside pinholes. The results presented in this paper provide a valuable reference for the preparation of WSC-sand from the perspective of quality and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Silicon is brittle at ambient temperature and pressure, but using micro-scale samples fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) plasticity has been observed. However, typical drawbacks of this methodology are FIB-damage and surface amorphization . In this study, lithographic etching was employed to fabricate a large number of 〈100〉-oriented Si pillars with various diameters in the micro-scale. This allowed quantitative study of plasticity and the size effect of FIB-free Si in the brittle temperature range (25–500 °C) by conducting monotonic and transient microcompression in situ in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Lithographic pillars achieved the ideal strength in temperature range of 25–100 °C and displayed significantly higher strengths (30–60\%) than FIB-machined pillars because of the undamaged surface and the oxide layer confinement. The activation energy of deformation revealed a transition in dislocation mechanisms as a function of temperature. Strain rate sensitivity and activation volume measured from strain rate jump and stress relaxation tests indicated the surface nucleation of kink-pairs associated with the constricted dislocation motion in Si during deformation at temperatures below the brittle-ductile transition. A modified analytical model is proposed to accurately evaluate the size-dependent strength of covalent crystalline Si. The weak size effect observed in Si is attributed to the surface nucleation of dislocations and high lattice friction during their motion.},

  abstract     = {Multi-jet electrospinning arranged in an arc array with sheath gas has been developed for the high-efficiency production of nanofiber membranes. The arc array constrains the electric field interferences among multiple nozzles and the sheath gas in laminar flow overcomes the electric repulsive force among the jets. The stretching and focusing effect from the sheath gas reduces both the nanofiber diameter and the diameter range, which helps to realize the continuous stable multi-jet electrospinning to fabricate uniform nanofiber membranes. After the treatment of 98\% concentrated sulfuric acid for the reactive exchange groups and a hot-pressing process, the membrane is then applicable to electrodialysis applications. Thanks to the net structure, there are many ion transmission passageways within the membrane, leading to the low membrane resistance and high ion transmission efficiency. Experimentally, the increase of membrane thickness results in the decrease of porosity, ion exchange capacity (IEC) and selective permeability and the increase in membrane resistance. The electrodialysis tests show good ion selection performance with a high desalinization ratio of NaCl solution.},

In this work, 3D flexible carbon nanofibers (CNFs)/TiO 2 @MoS 2 core-shell hierarchical nanostructures were prepared on the surface of CNFs by combining electrospinning, hydrothermal method and in situ growth. We investigated the behavior of CNFs/TiO 2 @MoS 2 as electrode material, which showed desirable electrochemical performance in terms of ultrahigh specific capacitance and long-term stability. The CNFs/TiO 2 @MoS 2 exhibited ultrahigh specific capacitance (510.4 F g − 1 at 0.5 A g − 1 ) superior to CNFs/TiO 2 (53.8 F g − 1 at 0.5 A g − 1 ) and prominent rate capability at high scan rates. Specifically, the capacitance retention of CNFs/TiO 2 @MoS 2 remained about 95.7\% even after 3000 cycles at 3.5 A g − 1 , which indicates considerable cycling stability. Hence, this work presents a novel strategy for the construction of cost-effective, flexible and high-performance 3D electrode materials, and confers in-depth understanding of nanocomposites with relatively light quality. The fabricated nanocomposite can have attractive application prospects in energy storage systems and can even be extended to wearable and portable energy storage equipment.},

Lower reactant dosage (no matter CDA or TDI), can induce smaller shrinkage (~12\%) after supercritical drying, and even to achieve lower density (~0.06 g/cm 3 ) of CDBAs. Monolith CDBAs have typical three-dimensional networks with lamella reinforced fiber-like skeletons and nanometric pores. Such reinforced networking structure with lamellas as reinforcement is responsible for the maximum compression strength of ~1.29 MPa at 10\% strain and compressive modulus of 21.86 MPa in CDBAs. Besides, the excessive addition of TDI leads to accelerate the growth of secondary fiber-like skeletons to ultimately divide the large pores into the small ones inside the formed network. This structural evolution enables to synergistically reduce gaseous thermal conductivity by means of Knudsen effect and increase that of solid part due to wider solid contacted area. The minimum total thermal conductivity of ~0.0313 W m −1 K −1 at ambient environment is obtained when the synergetic effects reach up to the critical balance, whose solid and gaseous proportions are calculated as 51.76 and 48.24\%, respectively.},

The present work investigated the microstructural evolution in the regions from the drilled hole wall to the inner matrix of the soft magnetic 49Fe-49Co-2V alloy after the common drilling experiments were carried out. The microstructures and microhardness in different regions near the hole wall along the radial direction were characterized with OM, SEM, TEM , EBSD and Vickers Microhardness tester. The experimental results show that the nearest region to the hole wall is constituted of nano-sized refined grains. It exhibits a disordered BCC phase due to the rapid cooling from the high temperature during the drilling, different from the dual-phase of BCC and B2 of the matrix. The second-nearest region to the hole wall is distributed by a huge number of dislocations, leading to a maximum in microhardness. The microstructural evolution contributes to the variation of the microhardness, which increases firstly, reaches a maximum, and then decreases to the level of the matrix with the distance increasing from the hole wall. This variation tendency is discussed in light of both refined grain-boundary strengthening and dislocation strengthening mechanisms .},

Based on the displacement-time series and largest Lyapunov exponent during serrated flow, two distinct types of dynamic behaviors were identified at room temperature, i.e., the serrated flow dynamics transforms form a self-organized critical state in traditional BMGs to a more chaotic state in high entropy BMGs (HE-BMGs). This may originate from their local structural difference that the solvent-solute architecture in conventional BMGs is broken in HE-BMGs. Furthermore, sluggish diffusion in HE-BMG can effectively retard relaxation kinetics, which leads to the deviation of HE-BMGs from the conventional BMGs in terms of the relationship between the chaotic behavior and temperature. Indeed, the insignificant change in dynamic complexity of HE-BMG conforms to its increased structural stability at elevated temperatures, which was soundly elucidated from both topological and kinetic factors. This study is of significance in understanding the configuration complexity and structure stability in HE-BMGs and helpful for designing BMGs with promising properties against external mechanical and thermal agitations.},

This threat is a major concern for space stations , where antibacterial surfaces would be ideal for materials which also need to be corrosion-resistant, hard and durable.

The microstructures are made of nickel deposited on a substrate which is composed of a gold layer on top of the silicon . The microstructures were fabricated with UV-light assisted nanoimprint lithography . These superhydrophobic microstructures have a well-defined alignment and shape which does not have any detrimental effect on the plastic deformation of the substrate. Similar structures were coated with carbon by hot-filament chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD) for a duration varying from 30 min to 120 min. Raman spectroscopy shows that the coating is composed of graphite, due to nickel-induced graphitisation during the deposition process . The antibacterial evaluation shows the bare nickel microstructures offer no antibacterial properties despite their superhydrophobic behaviour. On the other hand, the graphitic coated microstructures demonstrate significant antibacterial properties. Especially, 30 min HFCVD coated samples was antibacterial against E. coli and S. aureus with Gram-dependence and dependent on the coating deposition duration.},

In this paper, a novel design based on Miura-ori pattern, with varying geometries throughout its volume, is proposed and analyzed under quasi-static compression. Both experiments and numerical simulations indicate that the new design, both two-dimensional graded (2DG) and three-dimensional graded (3DG), can generate periodically graded stiffness as well as superior energy absorption. The sensitivity of the graded behavior to various parameters of the problem is studied. It appears that both in-plane and out-of-plane graded stiffness can be accomplished with an appropriate introduction of the geometric gradients. As to the coupling effect, when the 3DG model is compressed in the z-direction, the existence of the x-directional gradient tends to reduce the stress level and specific energy absorption ( SEA ), whereas when compressed in the x-direction, the opposite trend is observed regarding the z-directional gradient. Comparing with the conventional design, the proposed design can achieve an increase of 129.68\% in SEA in the optimal case. In general, the proposed origami metamaterial, whose behavior can be customized and programmed, shows great potential in engineering applications where a non-uniform response is needed.},

  abstract     = {Despite advanced sterilized and aseptic techniques, biomaterial-associated infections are still posing a great threat to human life. Therefore, constructing antimicrobial coating that exerts potent antimicrobial activity combined with low cytotoxicity is of great significance. Herein, an antimicrobial coating on the surface of silicone elastomer (PDMS) has been successful constructed, which based on maleopimaric acid quaternary ammonium cation (MPA-N + ). The surface morphology and chemical composition of modified PDMS (PDMS- g -MPA-N + ) were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PDMS- g -MPA-N + possess excellent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive bacterial ( Staphylococcus aureus ) and Gram-negative bacterial ( Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) strains. In addition, confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging demonstrated that it also can effectively inhibit bacterial biofilm formation over 5 days. Most importantly, PDMS- g -MPA-N + exhibited excellent biocompatibility, which induced no significant hemolysis and cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. The study demonstrated that the silicone elastomer surface grafted with MPA-N + enabled the incorporation of a renewable biomass to effectively combat bacteria and biofilm formation for biomedical applications .},

These features challenge the design of tissue engineered cartilage and repairing effect. In this study, a supramolecular-polymer double network (DN) hydrogel was designed to estimate the cartilage regeneration capability. This consisted of self-assembly of peptides supramolecular networks and covalent polymer networks together, and the designed hydrogel demonstrated excellent mechanical properties with Young&#39;s modulus of ~209 kPa, the compression limit of it was &gt;70\%, the toughness was ~47 kJ m −3 and associated with fast recovery in seconds. Compared with single network hydrogel, this DN hydrogel exhibited better performance in cell viability and differentiation. A rabbit model of cartilage defect was employed to verify the effect of treatment as proof of principle. After 12 weeks&#39; in vivo study, the cartilage defects were repaired significantly by biomimetic DN hydrogel. The native cartilage-like extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell arrangement were observed in the regenerated tissues. We anticipated that this hydrogel design might be a promising solution in artificial engineering of cartilage and other elastic tissues due to its excellent elasticity, toughness, fast recovery, stress unloading properties, and cartilage regenerative capability.},

  abstract     = {To establish the relationship between mechanical properties and microstructural features , it is necessary to comprehensively describe microstructural characterizations. In present study, an efficient and innovative quantitative method of interleaved degree in lamellar microstructure was developed. Firstly, four types of microstructural variables were defined as key factors that confirmed the microstructural features. Lath length ( L ) and variation coefficient for distribution of lath angle ( CV ) were measured to obtain dimension information of laths, and number of lath intersecting points per area ( N ) and uniformity of lath intersecting points ( U ) were defined to describe the lath distribution and the lath intersection complexity. Then, the microstructural variables were normalized based on multiple attribute decision-making. Finally, the equation of interleaved degree in lamellar microstructure was established based on entropy weight method. Present quantitative method was applied to analyze the interleaved degree of TC17 alloy containing a basketweave microstructure. It was shown that interleaved degree was higher at a deformation temperature of 930 °C, a height reduction of 40\% and a strain rate of 0.1 s −1 and decreased with increasing cooling time. Besides, a model that can theoretically calculate fracture toughness based on tensile properties was utilized to prove the prediction ability of interleaved degree.},

This work innovatively reveals that in equilibrium, the conductance of the newly designed porphyrin-graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) molecular wires would increase with the length, presenting appealing “even” conducting superiority, different with pure-GNRs molecular wires. Such anomalous transport behavior is not related with edge states of GNRs but the contribution of the porphyrin part in the transport. More interestingly, this “even” conducting advantage would be more prominent with slightly larger voltage, originated from narrower HOMO-LUMO gap of “even” assembled molecular wires. Besides, one of these hybrid molecular wires shows exceedingly strong transmission. This work suggests valuable applications of these new-assembled molecular wires in nano-electronics.},

  abstract     = {Uranium dioxide (UO 2 ) is widely used in nuclear reactors. This fuel has a low thermal conductivity (TC). Increasing its TC can effectively enhance the safety of reactors and fuel efficiencies. A prevalent approach to increasing the TC of UO 2 is to inject a second phase material with a high TC into a UO 2 matrix. Due to operational difficulties in the fabrication, deployment, and testing of such composite fuels, measurement data regarding effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of these composite fuels are rarely available, which hinders the development of these composites. To overcome such a barrier, finite element method is utilized to generate massive simulated measurements over the concerned composites. Subsequently, a novel algorithmic method is developed that automatically learns from gathered simulation results to accurately and reliably: 1) predict the ETC of a composite fuel according to its given structural characteristics, and 2) reversely infer the structural characteristics of a composite fuel from its expected ETC. The relative error of forward prediction and inverse design is &lt;5\% by the new algorithm. The new computational solution provides a novel and effective approach to developing new composite fuels with significant design acceleration and cost reduction.},

Microstructure-property relations in 316L stainless steel are revealed in this study using isothermal heat treatments as an investigative tool. As-built material was heat treated to selectively remove microstructural features such as melt pool boundaries, microsegregations and the as-built grain structure to evaluate their influence on yield and failure behaviour. Anisotropic yield behaviour was found to be caused by microstructural features alone and not influenced by porosity. However, ductility and failure were dominated by lack of fusion porosity. The alignment of pores between tracks along layer boundaries was found to cause anisotropic ductility. Three strengthening mechanisms in as-built material were identified as grain boundaries, chemical segregation and dislocation density . Heat treatments were categorised into three regimes: recovery, homogenisation and annealing. The findings of this study show that the shape, size, orientation and distribution of pores are crucial parameters for evaluating the structural integrity of parts produced by laser powder bed fusion.},

Here, frame stiffness-enhanced in situ tensile tests were perform on defect-scarce nanowires, where the tensile deformation response of the nanowires is measured by local strain analyses. The influence of frame stiffness on incipient plasticity is evaluated by an energy criterion that considers the energy release rate during the incipient plastic event, which gives rise to a condition for stable plasticity. Without altering the underlying deformation mechanism , the presented results demonstrate that the ductility of defect-scarce nanowires can be substantially extended. As a consequence, the full evolution of plastic deformation within defect-scarce nanowires is captured, which include observations of local yield events and the propagation of plasticized zones.},

In addition, both low- and high-cycle fatigue criteria are used to compute the fatigue factor at each material point, indicating its degree of safeness with respect to fatigue.

  abstract     = {The migration behavior of intermetallic compound (IMC) layer with some distance to the interface was observed in twin-spot laser welding-brazing of AA7075-T5 aluminum to DP590 galvanized steel . The microstructure characterization of different types of IMCs was systematically discussed using scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam and transmission electron microscopy methods. It was found that the dense plate-like IMC layer formed at the interface was η-Fe 2 Al 5 phase and the acicular IMC was θ-FeAl 3 phase, while the sparse plate-like IMC layer that migrated into the weld metal was the mixture of the θ-FeAl 3 phase and molten Al. A 3D thermo-fluid numerical model was developed to predict the melt flow behavior and analyze the mechanism of the migration behavior of the IMC layer. The simulation results revealed that the downward violent flow under the twin-spot center impacted the sparse IMC layer and entered into the gap between the steel and IMC layer, forming a broken migrated IMC layer. The joint strength increased with maximum migration distance and the maximum joint strength of 133.14 MPa was obtained. Thicker and sparse IMC was formed at the interface when the migration distance increased, which was adverse to the joint strength.},

  abstract     = {Degradable porous polymeric structures are attractive candidates for biological tissue scaffolds, and adequate mechanical, transport, chemical and biological properties determine their functionality. Aside from the properties of polymer-based materials, the scaffold&#39;s meso-structure controls its elasticity at the organ length-scale. This study investigated the effect of the meso-structure on scaffolds&#39; mechanical and transport properties using finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A number of poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) - based scaffolds were 3D printed, analyzed by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and mechanically tested. We found that the gradient (G) and gradient and staggered (GS) meso-structure designs led to a higher scaffold permeability, a more homogeneous flow inside the scaffold, and a lower wall shear stress (WSS) in comparison with the basic (B) meso-structure design. The GS design resulted in scaffold stiffness as low as 1.07/0.97 MPa under compression/tension, figures that are comparative with several soft tissues. Image processing of micro-CT data demonstrated that the imposed meso-structures could have been adequately realized through 3D printing , and experimental testing validated FEA analysis. Our results suggest that the properties of 3D-printed PCL-based scaffolds can be tuned via meso-structures toward soft tissue engineering applications. The biological function of designed scaffolds should be further explored in-situ studies.},

In this work, novel heterostructural carbon-doped inorganic nanoassemblies (TiO 2 /C nanofibers, NFs) were designed and synthesized in site via easy-processing electrospinning technique . Three different carbon contents of TiO 2 /C NFs were obtained as 2 wt\%, 4.5 wt\% and 13.6 wt\% by regulating precalcination conditions, respectively. P(VDF-HFP) was chosen to incorporate with different nanofibers as prepared due to its relatively high dielectric constant . A comparative study on dielectric energy storage performance of the TiO 2 /C NFs/P(VDF-HFP) nanocomposites has been systematically presented. The results reveal that the dielectric constant and the energy density are significantly enhanced for nanocomposites with appropriate content of doped carbon inside NFs. At relatively low doping content, the carbon nanoparticles could well disperse in TiO 2 /C NFs for forming numerous micro-capacitors, which is beneficial for enhancing interfacial polarization and suppressing loss. This work provides insights into the effect of the carbon-doped nanoassemblies for further improving energy storage capability of polymer nanocomposites for high-performance device applications.},

For appropriate shape changes, 4D printing has been developed using shape memory materials or multi-material structures with different deformation behaviors in response to an external stimulus. In this study, an efficient 4D printing method was developed using a material extrusion (ME) type 3D printer and a single thermoplastic polymer without a shape memory function. To impose different deformation behaviors in a single thermoplastic material, the printing paths were programmed intentionally, and the resulting anisotropy was used to generate a unique thermal deformation in response to a thermal stimulus. The anisotropic thermal deformations of the longitudinally and transversely printed parts were investigated by analyzing the directional size changes of homogeneously laminated bars. This anisotropy was then used to enable 4D printing by applying heterogeneous lamination in which the transverse and longitudinal printing paths were used consecutively. This heterogeneous lamination showed bending deformation after heat treatment, and the effect of lamination strategy on the order of bending was investigated experimentally. The proposed 4D printing method was further applied to induce localized bending deformation by laminating isotropic and anisotropic regions selectively, which enabled a self-assembly function.},

  abstract     = {The initial formation of athermal martensite was proven to accelerate the subsequent bainite formation kinetics during isothermal holdings below the martensite-start temperature ( M s ). The presence of prior athermal martensite (PAM) within the phase mixture is expected to modify the overall mechanical response of these newly-designed multiphase steels. Differences stem not only from the balance of product phases, but also from the effect of tempering of the PAM with variations in the applied holding time. This work investigates the effect of tempering time on the mechanical behaviour of the PAM and, as consequence, on the overall mechanical response of these microstructures. Results show that, for short holding times (several minutes), PAM yields similar to as-quenched martensite while, for longer holding times, its yielding behaviour becomes comparable to the one exhibited by typical tempered martensite . Furthermore, the use of Kocks-Mecking curves for the analysis of the mechanical performance confirms the bainitic character of the product phase isothermally formed below M s . Tailoring the bainitic-martensitic microstructure with variations of the holding time below M s enables to obtain advanced multiphase steels with comparable mechanical properties to those exhibited by conventional bainitic steels, but in shorter processing times due to the acceleration of bainite formation.},

A finite element model of the indentation was developed and validated against measurements of the local multiaxial stress fields during indentation, characterized by means of X-ray nanodiffraction analysis with a spatial resolution of 500 nm. By means of numerical fracture mechanics the effect of the multilayered structure on the formation and morphology of mode II cracks is analyzed. The configurational force concept was applied to investigate the crack driving forces and crack extension angles of static cracks in different geometrical arrangements. The simulation results agree well with the experimental findings and reveal a shielding effect preventing an interface-near crack from entering the CrN layer with the higher compressive residual stresses . Furthermore, the possibility to match the numerical results with the locally resolved experiments allowed determining validated material parameters for the deformation and fracture behavior .

  abstract     = {The interaction of microstructural evolution , precipitation and mechanical properties of cold rolled 27Cr–4Mo–2Ni steels stabilised by Nb/Ti during annealing are investigated. Prior deformations provide an acceleration effect on bulk sigma precipitation and increase the starting precipitation temperature to ~1000 °C, which can induce a brittle fracture mode for annealed specimens. The precipitation temperature of Fe 2 Nb-type Laves phase is observed to be as high as 1050 °C, and these nanoscale Laves phases are intertwined with Nb 2 C particles, which are located at sub-grain boundaries. The abnormal relationship between the grain size and the annealing temperature, which is also related to the formation of Nb-containing particles, is determined. The transformation from Nb 2 C to Laves phase below 1050 °C release C atoms into the matrix around the Nb 2 C particles. This further leads to Lüders deformation during tensile test because of Cottrell atmosphere formation. The γ-fibre texture development during the annealing process is explained based on orientated nucleation and orientation growth theory. Super ferritic stainless steels exhibit a good combination of strength and ductility via Laves phase precipitation control during annealing at approximately 1050 °C for 5–60 min; these properties are advantageous for their application with strong γ-fibre texture.},

Our results indicate that the size of the primary silicon particles (PSPs) increased with increasing temperature, while it decreased with increasing magnetic flux density (MFD). The solid solubilities of the Al matrix were 0.84 wt\% and 0.53 wt\% for the ribbons annealed at 0 T and 8 T, respectively. HSMF decreased the precipitation rate of Al from the PSPs and retained the solute trapping effect in the PSPs during annealing. After annealing the ribbon, the Al matrix retained the lattice distortions under the HSMF. Applying a HSMF led to the coexistence of grain boundary strengthening , particle strengthening, dislocation strengthening, and solid solution strengthening, so the hardness and elastic modulus increased with increasing MFD. Compared with the ribbon annealed at 8 T, the ribbon annealed at 0 T had a hardness and elastic modulus improved by 139.47\% and 1053.2\%, respectively. This paper presents a new way to design heat treatments and even solidification processes for metallic materials by controlling their diffusion by applying an HSMF.},

  abstract     = {When submicrocrystalline metal materials were first made available, their beneficial properties opened up various interesting design applications. However, several shortcomings soon became clear. One large problem is their complicated fabrication process, which cannot be applied on a large-scale industrial level. Another particularly vexing issue is their microstructural instability, which, even at lower temperatures, causes grains to rapidly coarsen. In this study, we have overcome these two problems in a submicrocrystalline Ti-Cu binary alloy . Contrary to conventional ideas of “microstructural heredity,” we have found that deformation with an initial coarse lamellar α′ microstructure when prism slip systems have been activated can remarkably refine grains to the submicron scale. We have also developed a strategy to improve the microstructural thermostability through Cu alloying, so that the submicrocrystalline grains formed during deformation at elevated temperatures can successfully be retained to room temperature. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the fabrication of submicrocrystalline titanium alloys using conventional hot rolling technology, which gives this alloy potential for further development within the titanium industry.},

Different porosities of porous interiors, combined with different wall thicknesses of outer casing, were designed. By implementing a continuum damage mechanics (CDM)-based biodegradation model into finite element simulations, the mechanical properties and degradation rates of the implant were predicted. The results showed that the implant with 70\%–75\% porosity and 0.5 mm wall thickness had the optimal structural strength and degradation rate. This implant structure was then fabricated. Compression tests and X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning were carried out to investigate the material properties and the structural transformation of the implants respectively. Moreover, an in-vivo rabbit model was used to evaluate the degradation behaviours of the implant at different time points. The results showed that this novel Mg implant had a relatively sturdy material strength and the porous structure did benefit the ingrowth of bone tissue and expedite the healing process.},

  abstract     = {Intermingled fractal unit (IFU), composed of many fractal units with different fractal characteristics and geometries, is used to reconstruct the pore fractal characteristics of porous materials. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D)-IFU model for characterising the pore structure of hybrid basalt-polypropylene fibre-reinforced concrete (HBPRC) was developed, and the applicability of this model was verified by test results. The results indicated that the volume fraction of the macropore (≥100 nm) of HBPRC increases with the addition of fibres. The higher fibre content causes a larger volume fraction of the macropore. Moreover, the lower matrix strength of concrete causes a more significant effect of fibres on the macropore of HBPRC. Compared with other fractal models , the 3D-IFU model not only has excellent simulation capability for cumulative porosity distribution and pore size distribution but also has high fitting accuracy for the total porosity, critical pore size and threshold porosity of HBPRC. Furthermore, the fractal dimension of the pore size distribution, derived from the 3D-IFU model, well reflects the effect of fibres on the pore structure characteristics of HBPRC.},

Compression stress-strain curves demonstrate typical elasto-plastic behavior with prominent strain hardening, strain rate strengthening, as well as thermal softening effects of the material. While growing oscillations and marked strength decrease due to shear band widths decrease observable on the shear stress-strain curves illustrate the localized shear induced adiabatic thermal effect and size effect of polymer materials. Post compression-shear to initiation phenomenon recorded by high-speed photography reveals the necessity of fracture process to initiation, apart from the intense shear work and loading rate effect. Employing the constitutive parameters determined at elevated strain rates and temperatures, 3D full size finite element modeling was performed. On the basis of a good agreement of the simulated and tested shear stress-strain curves for specimens of different shear band widths, a more direct insight into the deformation and stress evolution at the vicinity of the predesigned shear zones was analyzed and obtained.},

In the present work, we elucidate cutting mechanisms of HMX-based polymer bonded explosive (PBX) in orthogonal cutting by numerical simulations based on a cohesive finite element framework. The polygonal HMX crystals with a particle volume fraction of 90\% are modeled by a linear elasticity model, while the HTPB binders are described by a rate-independent hyperelastic model coupled with a rate-dependent plasticity model . Furthermore, cohesive elements are implemented in both crystal particles and binders to describe thermal-mechanical coupling-induced material failure behavior in the cutting process of PBX. Simulation results reveal different deformation modes of PBX, as well as their correlations with machining results. Furthermore, it is found that depth of cut has a strong impact on the cutting processes of PBX, in terms of material failure mode, subsurface damage and energy dissipation . These findings provide important guidelines for the design and synthesis of energetic materials with high machinability.},

However, deformation of the bridge structure during fabrication process and post treatment is still a typical problem. In this paper, the deformation of aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg flat bridge structure with various span lengths was investigated by numerical simulation and experiment. The longer the span is, the greater arch bending deformation is. A mechanism of deformation of bridge was discussed. During selective laser melting process, the first layer of bridge bends upward because of no constraint. Then the arch bending results less or no powder on it after powder sweeping for next layer. The bridge bends up further during the formation of the following layer. These alternative phenomena cause the evolution of deformation. However, as the bridge becomes thicker and thicker, its stiffness increases, which leads to the difficulty of its further bending. Therefore, after some layers, there is even no further bending during the forming of following layers with the arch shape kept in the initial layers. Decreasing the laser energy density for the bridge area and using supports are helpful for the reduction of the arch bending deformation.},

Graphene aerogel/TiO 2 (GA/TiO 2 ) composites were fabricated by an infiltration method using porous GA as a framework. GA with different pore sizes and morphologies was tuned by changing concentration of graphene. The structural morphology of the graphene layer structure transformed into porous structure as the graphene concentrations increased. In addition, mechanical properties and tribological behaviors of GA/TiO 2 composites with different graphene concentrations were comparatively investigated. The results show that the TiO 2 particles are more uniformly filled into the GA with higher graphene concentration due to the porous separation effect. Therefore, the GA/TiO 2 composites of higher concentrations have a better elongation and mechanical properties. Simultaneously, the tribological behavior is excellent owing to the self-lubricating properties of graphene and tiny TiO 2 , and the TiO 2 cluster can effectively prevent the crack propagation . Moreover, the tribological performance of the GA/TiO 2 samples under wet friction conditions is better than that under dry friction conditions due to the self-transport operation of lubricants assisted by the through capillary action , besides the self-lubricating effect of graphene and tiny TiO 2 particles.},

The bitumen-rubber interaction process (mainly swelling) significantly changes the mechanical properties of both bitumen and rubber phases. This study aims to predict the complex moduli of CRMB binders with more representative constituent parameters using micromechanical models . To achieve this goal, frequency sweep tests using a dynamic shear rheometer were performed on the liquid phase of CRMB and swollen rubber samples to represent the essential properties of bitumen matrix and rubber inclusion. In addition, the numerical swelling model was developed to estimate the effective volume concentration of rubber after swelling. Results show that the liquid phases of CRMB are stiffer and more elastic than the neat bitumen while the swollen rubber is softer and more viscous than the dry rubber. The effective volume concentration of rubber can increase to 2.126 times as the blend percentage based on the finite element analysis . Using the liquid phase of CRMB binder and swollen rubber properties as the micromechanical model inputs yield more accurate predictions. The used four micromechanical models predict well at higher frequencies while underestimating the complex modulus at lower frequencies.},

The axial tensile strength of aerogel-spun and dry-spun CNT fibers increased by 20.6\% and 11.9\% under individually compressed at 60 MPa and 90 MPa, respectively. The tensile moduli of both fibers increased by 0.05 GPa. Followed by reduction of tensile performance as compressive strain level increased. The corresponding electrical resistance of both deformed CNT fibers increased more rapidly than that of the uncompressed fibers. In the cyclic compression mode, the axial tensile strength and modulus decreased by 40\% and 45.7\% for the aerogel-spun CNT fibers and by 17\% and 14.2\% for dry-spun CNT fibers owing to permanent damage accumulation. Scanning electron microscope examinations showed that tensile failure mode after compression transitioned from slippage into a new mode based on the fracture of CNT bundles.

With these templates, coding arrays of CuMWs with diameters of 2–10 μm are fabricated. The geometries of the obtained templates and CuMWs arrays are shown to be consistent with the design values.

SESF in the hexagonal-close-packed ( hcp ) Mg matrix forms a local face-centered-cubic ( fcc ) environment, and hence our thermodynamic analysis is based on the Gibbs energy comparison between hcp and fcc phases over the Mg-Zn-Y ternary composition ranges, using the calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) method aided by the first principles calculations. We find that the Zn/Y co-segregations at the SESF provide a remarkable condition that the fcc layers become more stable than the hcp -Mg matrix. Furthermore, within the SESF, the following spinodal-like decomposition into the Mg-rich solid-solution and the Zn/Y-rich L 1 2 -type order phase causes a significant reduction of the total Gibbs energy of the system. These spontaneous thermodynamic behaviors explain why the fault layers can be remarkably stabilized in the LPSO-forming ternary Mg alloys , and also support a phenomenological origin of the Zn-Y clustering with the L 1 2 -type short-range order, which is known to occur for the LPSO phases and has been confirmed for the present SESF by electron microscopy experiments.},

  abstract     = {Flexible sensors based on the highly elastic Polyurethane (PU)-containing textile substrates have been frequently incorporated in enormous wearable applications. However, the desirable sensing properties such as stable sensitivity, small hysteresis and good repeatability depend on the mechanical resilience of the textile substrates. This paper conducts a systematic investigation into the mechanical hysteresis of the PU-containing textile substrates, from fibers to yarns and then fabrics. The impact of fiber materials, yarn structures, and fabric constructions on the overall tensile properties of the PU-containing substrates were examined. It was found that fibers of high elasticity, stable yarn structure with excellent recovery, as well as appropriate fabric construction are effective to reduce the mechanical hysteresis of the textile substrates. Coated strain sensors based on different substrates were then fabricated. Results show that smaller mechanical hysteresis of the PU-containing substrates generally led to lower electromechanical hysteresis and better repeatability of sensors. This paper gives all-round consideration of the fibers and structure features of substrates to provide recommendation for reducing mechanical and electromechanical hysteresis of sensors based on PU-containing textiles and benefiting the design and optimization of other flexible sensors.},

In this process, the two immiscible polymer phases are extruded and drawn into fibers. In the fiber composite , the PBT nano-fibrillar reinforcement phase typically has an average diameter of less than 200 nm. The results show that the presence of the long aspect-ratio nano-fibrils enhances the foamability of the PP matrix, and the foamed samples achieved high thermal insulation properties (~32 mW∙m − 1 ∙K − 1 ). As the capital investment and development time costs of the existing technologies for improving foamability are high, the new manufacturing method can provide significant economic and technical advantages for producing highly expanded and insulating PP-based foams.},

Previous work has revealed that finite element (FE) models generated from XRMCT scans of cylindrical coating specimens reproduce their response in uniaxial compression accurately. In this work, we use FE models generated from XRMCT scans to study the pressure-sensitive yield strength of the porous coating. Since the coating is known to have a graded pore structure through its thickness, data from an XRMCT scan of a full coating sample is divided into twenty-four sublayers across the coating thickness, from which FE models are generated. These FE models are used to perform numerical limit analyses to map the yield locus for each sublayer, which are utilized to calibrate an analytical yield surface. A strong correlation is found between the fitted yield surface parameters and the average porosity of the sublayers. This observation is used to propose a constitutive model where the yield strength depends on the porosity and its evolution with deformation. The constitutive model is implemented as a user subroutine in a commercial explicit FE solver and validated against experimental component tests, showing good agreement.},

An ultrasonic treatment for 1 h was used to disperse CMCs (1–3 wt\%) within an epoxy resin, which was subsequently infused through glass fabrics to develop hierarchical composites containing both macro and micro-scale reinforcements. It was observed that CMC dispersion in the epoxy resin was homogeneous at 1 wt\% CMC and further increase in CMC concentrations led to linear increase in both agglomerate size and total agglomerated area. Addition of 1 wt\% CMC to the composite matrix drastically changed the glass fibre-epoxy interface and led to a maximum improvement of 65\% in interlaminar shear strength , 14\% in tensile strength , 76\% in flexural strength , 111\% and 119\% in fracture energy in tensile and flexural modes, 9.4\% in impact strength , 13.5\% in storage modulus , 21.9\% in loss modulus and 13 °C in the glass transition temperature of composites.

This study proposes a reactive extrusion method using poly-carbodiimide compounds. The effects of the feeding position of the poly-carbodiimide compounds in the twin screw extruder , type of carbodiimide compounds, and proportion of carbodiimide compounds on the extrusion reaction and static mechanical properties were elucidated. The toughness of the glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 66 was improved by the increase in molecular weight of the polyamide 66 related to the addition of the carbodiimide compounds. The wear resistance properties were significantly improved by the addition of carbodiimide compounds for both glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 66 and aramid fiber-reinforced polyamide 66 materials. In addition, a synergistic improvement in the toughness was also observed with the addition of both carbodiimide compounds and a maleic anhydride modified olefin polymer to the glass fiber-reinforced polyamide 66 material.

Meanwhile, new grains across the welding interface are formed. Moreover, it is found that the enrichment of Zn and Si and the existence of micro-voids retard the diffusion of Fe and Al on the Fe/Al interface, and the thickness of diffusion layer ranges from 1 μm to 5 μm. Compared with the extruded bar without wire rope, there is a stress drop of 17.6 MPa on the stress-strain curve of the composite bar, but its mechanical properties are not obviously improved due to the worse Fe/Al bonding interface and the brittle Fe Al solid solution.

At these scales, the nature of dislocation-mediated plasticity changes radically: sub-micrometer metallic samples exhibit high yield strengths, however accompanied by detrimental intermittent strain fluctuations endangering structural stability. In this paper, we studied the effects of plate-like θ ′-Al 2 Cu precipitates on the strength and plastic fluctuations of Al-Cu alloys from micro-pillar compression testing. The particularity of our samples is that the plate-like precipitates have diameters commensurate with the external size of the Al-Cu micro-pillars. Our results show that these plate-like precipitates can strengthen the materials through the Orowan mechanism at large sample size. However, the breakdown of the mean-field pinning landscape weakens its suppression effect on plastic intermittency. On the other hand, the plastic intermittency can be inhibited efficiently at small sample size by using the plate-like θ ′-Al 2 Cu precipitates penetrating the entire micro-pillar, in association with the presence of {100}-slip traces along the coherent precipitate/Al matrix interface and enhanced strain isotropy . Besides these experimental observations, we also aim to extract the laws common in different Al alloys , and address the specific plastic mechanisms for Al-Cu micro-crystals.},

The discussion of deformation mechanisms relies on defining a new yield surface using a combination of experimental measurements and finite element simulations that enable the representation of three distinct behavioral features of IN718 lattice structures under mechanical loading including (1) tension-compression asymmetry of strut-level response; (2) tension-compression asymmetry of the aggregate response; and (3) hydrostatic pressure sensitivity of the strut-level response. Typically, the VHM is used to describe the aggregate response of lattice or foam materials to global loading. The VHM model could be directly applied at the strut-level; however, this would assume a one-to-one correspondence between the local and global response. Such an assumption is not justified a priori and could alter the evolution of the local deformation mechanisms and the resulting analysis of failure modes and structural degradation. Therefore, we introduce a modified VHM (or MVHM), which represents a more appropriate yield criterion. The Johnson-Cook damage criterion and damage evolution law , which is based on Hillerborg&#39;s fracture energy method, are coupled with the MVHM to investigate the damage initiation and evolution, and their influence on the global stress-strain response using finite element simulations.},

In the present study, an innovative process called coaxial one-side resistance spot welding (COS-RSW) is proposed to fabricate Al5052 (Al) and CFRP joints . Based upon our newly developed finite element code JWRIAN, the electric-thermal-mechanical coupled process of COS-RSW is modeled and validated with experiments. The influences of welding current, welding time and electrode force on CFRP molten zone are investigated in detail. The results show that the depth of molten zone has a strong correlation with both welding current and welding time. A relative low welding current or short welding time that results in the Al/CFRP interface temperature below the melting temperature of the resin matrix is insufficient to form a sound connection between the two sheets. While excessive current or too long welding time may lead to overheating of CFRP and decomposition of the resin matrix, which increases the risk of weak joining. Furthermore, it is found that the depth of molten zone increases even at the cooling stage, which indicates accurate simulation for both the heating and the cooling stages of the COS-RSW process is indispensable.},

  abstract     = {Achievement of macroscale superlubricity from the hydration effect could provide a potential application for artificial articular cartilage. In this work, two zwitterionic polymers, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA), were used to synthesize a P(MPC-co-SBMA) copolymer hydrogel through the additional polymerization of the alkane carbon-carbon double bond. The incorporation of MPC promoted the water-binding property of copolymer hydrogels as well as improved their anti-compression capability. A superlubricity state with a friction coefficient of approximately 0.002 was achieved when a P(MPC-co-SBMA) copolymer hydrogel hemisphere slid on a sapphire in water, which demonstrated its dependence on sliding velocity , load, and aqueous lubricants. The superlubricity mechanism was mainly attributed to the hydration effect from zwitterionic MPC and SBMA polymer chains, which led to the formation of a uniform hydration layer on the hydrogel surface and the strong adsorption of water molecules on the sapphire surface , which provided additional stabilized hydration layers. These findings might provide insight into the superlubricity mechanism of zwitterionic hydrogels based on the hydration effect, thereby broadening their extensive applications.},

The composites, which are based on needle-like polyaniline (PANI) and high quality electrochemical exfoliation graphene (EG), can be a potential candidate for sodium batteries cathode due to favorable structural and morphological properties. Kinetics analysis of cyclic voltammetry has evidenced the diffusion controlled and pseudocapacitive controlled contributions of charge storage in the EG-PANI composite cathode. For the first time, the full sodium cell based on the EG-PANI composite was constructed and the rate capacities reached up to 64 mA h g − 1 at the current densities of 100 mA g − 1 . In addition, the readily available composites bearing high conductivity and high-quality contact interface also enable the design of efficient supercapacitor . Specifically, the specific capacitance of EG-PANI composites electrode is 736 F g − 1 at 0.2 A g − 1 , and the specific capacitance can be achieved to 410 F g − 1 under 10 A g − 1 (high current density). The synergistic effect of EG and PANI provides a remarkable storage capacity.

The Li evaporation loss, which was only 9\%, was significantly suppressed compared to the ordinary electron beam welding. However, joining failed within the unfused region due to the poor atomic diffusion . As a result, Cu nano-coating, with a 300 nm thickness, was sputtered to the butt surface of base metal to accelerate atomic diffusion. After adding Cu nano-coating, the unfused region achieved an effective joining since the eutectic α-Al + Al 2 Cu appeared at 821 K, indicating that an equiaxed crystal zone, which joined two base metals, was formed at unfused region. Reasons for the presence of equiaxed crystal zone were examined. Dispersed strengthening phases including θ′ (Al 2 Cu) and T 1 (Al 2 CuLi) were observed to be present in both the fusion zone and equiaxed crystal zone, corresponding to a higher tensile strength and increased hardness value in equiaxed crystal zone.},

The novelty of the work is based on the introduction of χ phase into the Fe-based hypoeutectic alloy with the aim of reducing the mean free path of the matrix and increasing abrasive resistance. The phase composition was studied using in situ neutron and ex situ X-ray synchrotron diffraction. The microstructural evolution was analyzed via scanning and transmission electron microscopy and modelled using CALPHAD thermodynamic calculations . The mechanical behavior of the evolving microstructure was quantified using high-speed nanoindentation mapping. At low temperatures (650 °C), the χ phase nucleates mainly in dendrite areas and exhibits a needle-like morphology caused by high misfit with the ferritic matrix . At higher temperatures (800 °C), the χ phase nucleates on carbide/matrix interfaces and in dendrites and is characterized by a blocky morphology. Simultaneously, the evolution of M 23 C 6 carbide morphology towards a continuous and solid network of precipitates was observed. Such changes in the alloy&#39;s microstructure induced an increase in hardness of about 16\% and resulted in the reduction of the average scratch depth in comparison to as-cast state.},

The extracted interdiffusion coefficients in α-Fe at temperatures between 700 and 1100 °C and in Γ at 750 and 700 °C using the forward-simulation analysis (FSA) extend the experimental interdiffusivity measurements to the whole solubility range of these two phases. Three impurity diffusion coefficients of Zn in paramagnetic α-Fe were also determined by the FSA and show good agreement with the literature data. The temperature dependence of the Zn impurity diffusion coefficients in both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic α-Fe phases across the Curie temperature T C was established by analyzing the reliable experimental results as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Herein, a novel chemical preparation method is employed to obtain magnetic EG composites with excellent radar attenuation performance in the 2–18 GHz range. Ferrocene is first intercalated into the natural flake graphite to form ferrocene graphite intercalation compounds (FGICs), and then oxidises to Fe 3 O 4 during the thermal expansion of FGICs at 900 °C, while the FGICs are converted into magnetic EG composites in this process. The success of ferrocene intercalation reaction is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy , fourier transformation infrared spectroscope, X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies. The components and radar attenuation property of the magnetic EG composites are discussed. Both Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3 exist in the final EG composites and a high radar attenuation of −18 dB at 18 GHz is obtained, while the ferrocene/graphite ratio in the FGICs is 20\%. The excellent radar attenuation property of the magnetic EG composites, together with good homogeneity and dispersion in air, can allow the composites to be used in many potential applications in radar countermeasure.},

Such models have shown accurate predictions within relatively narrow compositional range, closely related to the limitations of the database employed. Nevertheless, by testing those models with a large database, including a wider range of temperatures and compositions, the authors have observed that such narrow compositional ranges cause these models to be inaccurate. The strain rate is also an important parameter that has been ignored in previous works, and deeply affects mechanical behavior . In this work, we propose a more robust model, which includes the contribution of the strain rate and wider composition and temperature ranges by integrating different formulations, providing improvement at predicting yield strength with respect to previous models.},

The results show that the DOPA-bFGF- and DOPA-PonG1-modified PLGA nanofibrous films exhibited bionic performance, improved tensile strength, and hydrophilicity. DOPA-bFGF and DOPA-PonG1 exhibited stronger binding abilities to films compared with bFGF and PonG1.

Whereas the compression 〈101〉 fiber parallel to ND in the partially DRX processes is sharpened. Moreover, the instantaneous decrease of strain rate leads to the highest fraction of Σ3 grain boundaries, indicating the lowest pole density. Cube-Twin component adjacent to Cube component contributes partly to the formation of Σ3 grain boundaries. The findings provide insights into the microtexture characteristics and enhance the understanding of the orientation dependence of the mechanical behavior of nickel-based superalloys.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the distribution of microcracks in titanium alloys (TC4) before and after electropulsing treatment (EPT) was observed by X-ray microscopy (XRM). The results show that EPT has obvious healing effect on internal microcracks in the TC4 tensile specimen . Based on Mises yield criterion and the results of finite element analysis in the internal microcrack healing process in titanium alloy, the elastic-plastic deformation characteristics during microcrack healing were analyzed. The results show that the plastic deformation around the microcrack is nonuniform due to the uneven distribution of temperature and thermal compressive stress during EPT. The region with large plastic deformation looks like a thick-walled ellipsoid-shaped ring surrounding the microcrack, where the elongation of the material along the normal direction of the microcrack surface is the main cause of the microcrack closure. The deformation ring plastic flow model was proposed to explain the microcrack closure mechanism by pulse current.},

Typical morphological patterns of reversed austenite transformed from lath martensite are revealed by the simulation results, containing acicular austenite (γ A ) formed along the martensite lath boundaries and globular austenite (γ G ) formed along the high angle prior austenite grain boundaries. It is also shown that the growth of γ A, as governed by a combined displacive and diffusional mechanism, is accompanied by a higher enrichment of alloying elements (Mn and Ni) compared with γ G , which is governed by a diffusional mechanism. Meanwhile, γ G tends to grow preferentially to one side of the prior austenite grain boundaries, due to the presence of partial non-orientation relationship with adjacent martensite laths during the transformation. At the later stage of the reverse transformation, invasive growth behavior of γ G to γ A after impingement is found due to the minimization of gradient energy in the system and the concentration difference of alloying elements within the two types of reversed austenite. A possible mechanism for grain refinement during intercritical annealing process is finally proposed.},

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersion Spectrum (EDS) were employed to observe the evolution of microstructures under thermal-shock cycles. Results show that some floccus Co 3 W 3 C precipitated around the WC particles after several thermal-shock cycles. These precipitates and the carbide particles correspond to the locations with the high-stress concentration. The mechanical properties evolution under thermal-shock cycles was analyzed by Nanoindentation tests. The nanohardness presents no noticeable change with thermal-shock cycles. However, the reduced modulus demonstrates a decreasing trend with the thermal-shock cycles. The variation of the mechanical properties has an unestimated relationship with the residual stress and densities of dislocations caused by thermal shocks. Furthermore, the present work pointed out that the precipitates around the carbides are the places where the thermal fatigue crack initiated. How to deal with the precipitates will be the optimized way for this material.},

In this study, the novel auxetic structure based bone screws were designed, and mechanical properties and fixation strength were evaluated. Auxetic unit cells (A1–A6) were introduced into the design of screw bodies after a mechanical evaluation. Tubular auxetic structures (TA1–TA6), auxetic screws (AS1–AS6) and one non-auxetic screw (NS) were manufactured using 3D-printing. The fabrication process well reproduced the original designs despite the some mismatch in the macro and micro morphologies. Tensile tests on specimens were conducted experimentally and computationally. The relationship between NPR and fixation strength of the screws was investigated by computationally bone-pullout test. Among all screw designs, AS2 generated the largest stiffness and strength, and better NPR, AS5 produced the highest NPR, and smallest stiffness and strength. Maximal pullout force within low-, mid- and high-density bone was shown in AS5 (399.39 N), AS6 (561.07 N) and AS2 (1185.93 N) respectively. It was concluded that varying auxetic structures altered the screw&#39;s mechanical properties especially its functional properties. The bone-screw fixation could be improved by auxetic structures while other design factors should also be taken in account.},

Numerical simulations using an in-house-developed crystal plasticity finite element method code were also conducted. A high-resolution inverse pole figure of a slice across the nano-indention was obtained via the focused ion beam technique coupled with precession electron diffraction . The simulation results corresponded closely to the experimental observations. In the slice, the region beneath the indentation inner-edge and the region beneath the indentation facet underwent the greatest degree and the second-greatest degree of lattice rotation, respectively. In contrast, for the region directly below the indentation center, the lattice rotated first, but the orientation changed only slightly during the entire process. The bright field transmission electron microscopy and the geometrically necessary dislocation densities provided experimental confirmation of such orientation features. Furthermore, the nucleation and continuous growth process of subgrains was numerically predicted by virtually tracking the misorientation angle (&gt;10°) map at different indentation depths in three-dimensional space. Thereafter, the evolution of each slip system type was captured at typical local regions of the indentation, leading to an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanism.},

The influence of SLM process parameters (laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing) on the microstructure and mechanical property in ODSN has been investigated, using Taguchi method (TM) and Response surface methodology (RSM). Orthogonal array and Box-Behnken design were utilized to design the experiments. Analysis of variance, signal-to-noise ratio, main influence diagrams, 3D response surface, and the corresponding contour plots were measured to evaluate the effects of factors on the tensile strength . By comparing the results of the experiment showed that optimum parametric combination from TM and RSM induced better tensile strength. The optimum process parameters were predicted, validated, and subsequently employed to build samples to assess mechanical properties during 25–1000 °C. The samples produced using SLM showed approximate tensile strength, compared to hot extruded ODSN of similar composition.

The incorporation of three-dimensional (3D) printing into the fabrication of soft robots facilitates the customisation of their functions by the strategic placement of functional materials into locations that may be inaccessible by conventional manufacturing methods. Most current 3D-printed soft robots, however, are fabricated without considering their autonomy. In four-dimensional (4D) printing, the functionality of a soft robot is introduced during the printing process. To control this functionality, specific functional materials are embedded in desired locations. Four-dimensional printing and machine learning techniques provide new possibilities for developing stand-alone closed-loop 4D-printed soft robots.

SEM and micro-CT investigations revealed that aragonite was mainly concentrated near the edges of the composite samples, except in WPI300, which had homogeneous aragonite distribution. The pore diameters ranged from 18 to 778 μm while averaged pore size was the lowest for WPI0 at 30 μm and highest for WPI200 at 103 μm. The mean compression modulus was highest for WPI300 at 3.16 MPa. After 28 days in physiological conditions WPI300 had maximum mean swelling of 4.3\% and there was the highest degradation rate for WPI200 and WPI300 and lowest for WPI100 and WPI0. The osteoblast-like MG63 cell metabolic and alkaline phosphatase activities in direct contact experiments with composites increased with increasing aragonite content over 3 weeks. Moreover, the degradation products of these composites were non-cytotoxic and led to mineral-like deposits in extracellular matrix. These WPI-aragonite biocomposite hydrogels are potent candidates for bone repair applications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, transparent solar technology has attracted increasing attention, which has the potential to let many of the surfaces of our buildings environment be turned into solar harvesting arrays without impacting their function or aesthetics. Glazing with nanostructured surface possessing different solar absorption ability from different directions is studied currently as a route to reduce the environmental cost of keeping appropriate indoor temperature. Here a transparent and solar thermal metasurface based on low cost copper plasmonic nanostructures is proposed and a maximum 25\% difference in absorption from different sides is demonstrated experimentally. The spectra show strong activity in the infrared and still have transparency for visible light, which can be further improved by optimizing the structures according to the simulations. These materials are suitable as an alternative design of window glazing for energy saving.},

However, these EPs are more flammable than EPs cured using other curing agents. When sufficient curing agents meet requirement for flame safety, optical properties are often diminished. To solve the problem, an intrinsic curing agent (PTDP) consisting of phosphorus and sulfur was designed and prepared from polyethylenimine (PEI), thiourea and diphenylphosphinyl chloride. This curing agent was used to obtain a multi-functional epoxy resin (PTDP-EP). PTDP-EP displayed excellent transparency with transmittance up to 90\% due to no change in the amorphous structure of EP. In addition, owing to the introduction of sulfur in PTDP, the refractive index of PTDP-EP increased to 1.591 from 1.495 for reference PEI-EP. Further, the EP with the addition of 30 wt\% PTDP displayed a UL-94 V-0 rating and a limiting oxygen index of 30.4\%. Moreover, the total heat release and total smoke production were respectively decreased by 61.0\% and 64.3\% compared with the corresponding values for EP containing no PTDP. Further study confirmed that joint action in the gas and condensed phase led to the fire safety of PTDP-EP during burning.},

Conventional synthesis routes for these materials always require multiple processing steps, long durations and elevated temperatures. In this study, thermodynamic calculations were employed to predict the feasible synthesis reactions , possible impurities and reasonable processing parameters. Then, ceramic powders of SrTaO 2 N and BaTaO 2 N were fabricated through direct calcination of SrCO 3 /BaCO 3 and Ta 2 O 5 with urea as nitrogen source by using a modified pressureless spark plasma sintering set-up. High-purity oxynitrides can be obtained within 10 min. Thermal stability, corrosion resistance and dielectric property were evaluated. The results showed that SrTaO 2 N was thermally stable up to 475 °C in air while that temperature for BaTaO 2 N was 605 °C. The oxynitrides possessed a good resistance to hot water and strong acid/alkali. BaTaO 2 N had a very high room-temperature relative permittivity up to 9550 with a dielectric loss down to 0.001 at 100 Hz, while the values for SrTaO 2 N were 3141 and 0.017 respectively. The temperature dependence of permittivity for BaTaO 2 N was weak at −10–200 °C. The efficient synthesis method enabled the fast preparation of the tantalum-based oxynitride materials for energy storage applications .},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has the capability to build complex parts with internal features, which have many advantages over conventionally manufactured parts. This makes AM an alternative for advanced manufacturing sectors. AM components suffer from defects due to the lack of understanding in the build process. This makes the adaptation of AM in safety-critical industries, such as aerospace, problematic. The current AM work flow calls for costly off-line inspections to qualify components as defect-free. The layer by layer nature of the AM provides an opportunity for an on-line inspection to take place. This can provide early detection of defects as well as information for optimization and repair of the build. Laser Induced Phased Arrays (LIPA) present themselves as a viable remote, non-destructive, ultrasonic technique capable of being implemented as part of an on-line inspection of AM. Lasers are used to generate and detect ultrasound and a phased array is synthesized in post-processing. This paper demonstrates the capability of LIPA to successfully detect and locate features within AM components off-line. Cylindrical features as small as 0.2 mm in diameter and 26 mm above the inspection surface were detected using LIPA and verified using X-ray computed tomography (XCT).},

This hierarchically organized feather structure provides a smooth vane to bear the load from the airflow; however, the feather vane is vulnerable to disruption by external pulling forces during collision with the branches of a tree and hitting some small obstacles in flight or strong turbulence. The feather is unable to carry the weight of the bird&#39;s body if the vane could not be recovered immediately. Here we discovered that the feather vane can be re-established easily by birds themselves. A bird can always recover its feather vane from ruffled state by shaking its wings and preening its feathers with its beak because of the cascaded geometries of barbs and barbules. This biophysical mechanism of self-healing suggests that the hierarchical vane structure can be used to design artificial feathers for a flapping robot.},

During the simulation, the influence of key process parameters on the temperature field, including scanning speed, molding chamber temperature and nozzle temperature, is analyzed in detail. Furthermore, an experimental platform with an adjustable molding chamber temperature for the FFF parts is established. Case studies for making Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)-based parts were carried out to validate the approach. Results showed that among the process parameters, the molding chamber temperature had the most significant effect on the warping deformation of the FFF parts. The optimal parameters for the FFF process with ABS under the analyzed conditions were 50 mm/s for the scanning speed, 80 °C for the molding chamber temperature of, and 180 °C for the nozzle temperature, respectively.},

Based on the ability of selective laser melting to produce near net shape parts with any complex geometry directly, Cu-Cr-Zr copper alloy lattice structures with high density were manufactured and studied for the first time. A series of lattice structures were designed by a mathematical approach named Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces and their mechanical properties , microstructures and deformation behaviors were systematically studied. The effects of cell size and volume fraction on their mechanical properties and energy absorptions were analyzed and evaluated. The results demonstrate that the mechanical and energy absorption properties of the lattice structures varied dramatically with the changes of cell size and volume fraction. Due to the good plasticity of the copper alloy, stress-strain curves of the lattice structures exhibit a long stress plateau without stress collapses, which is very beneficial for energy absorption. The deformation of the lattice structures occurred uniformly and was caused by the struts bending without cell breaking and struts fracturing.},

More specifically, for a particular example of magnetic inclusions used in the experiment, the stiffness could assume an arbitrary value from the range approximately between −5 kN/m and 5 kN/m depending on the stage of the mechanical deformation and aforementioned factors. This range can be also conveniently adjusted depending on the size and properties of magnetic inclusions.

The precipitation kinetics in PA + RTR alloys during isothermal heat treatment at 100 °C were systematically investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and Vickers hardness measurements compared to its counterpart without pre-ageing treatment (i.e. RTR).

Specially, our study shows, for the first time, that many GPII zones come from second nucleating in PA + RTR alloy at 108 h, which may ascribe to the pre-ageing treatment. More importantly, the pre-ageing treatment not only makes both two hardness peaks of PA + RTR alloy appeared ahead of but also higher than those of RTR alloy, by virtue of the enhanced precipitation kinetics in PA + RTR alloy.},

This method greatly improved the material utilization rate and achieved unsupported manufacturing compared with other additive manufacturing methods. In the paper, the overall experimental process and the forming principle are analyzed in detail. The experiment aims to fabricate multi-angle pyramid lattice cells. The manufacturing process of inclined rods in each direction is studied, and the manufacturing process of the whole cell is analyzed as well. The molding mechanism and droplet transfer modes in the forming process are discussed. The optimum forming angle is between 45° and 90°.

  abstract     = {An artificial synapse that can perform both learning and memory functions was realized using an amorphous Ta 2 O 5 memristor. A Pt/Ta 2 O 5 /TiN memristor, with an amorphous Ta 2 O 5 film grown at 100 °C, exhibited reliable bipolar switching properties at the various conductance states required for artificial synapse applications; in addition, it exhibited the transmission properties of physiological synapses. Various other synaptic properties were also obtained from the Ta 2 O 5 memristor by modulating the input bias. The metaplasticity of a physiological synapse, which is a preliminary-spike-enhanced synaptic function, was also emulated in the Ta 2 O 5 memristor via the metaplasticity of potentiation/depression and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity of the Ta 2 O 5 memristor can be understood via the construction and destruction of oxygen vacancy filaments in the memristor.},

  abstract     = {We report the synthesis and characterization of a multifunctional composite obtained by integrating micron-sized Ni 52 Mn 26 Ga 22 Heusler alloy particles into a polysulfone matrix. The Heusler alloy powders were synthesized by the ball milling of as-spun Ni 52 Mn 26 Ga 22 ribbons and subsequently incorporated into a polysulfone matrix using the solution casting process. The microstructural, magnetic and thermomechanical properties of the alloy-polymer composites were investigated. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed the presence of a 14M modulated crystal structure along with a hierarchical twinning system down to the atomic scale. Magneto-metric and thermomechanical testing revealed that the prepared composite demonstrates a magnetocaloric effect with a usable refrigeration capacity of 3.1 J/kg under a moderate magnetic field change of 1.38 T as well as a wideband energy absorption capability at a low 5 wt\% loading. The disadvantages of bulk Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals such as inherent brittleness and difficulty of production may be overcome by the incorporation of micro-size particles into a flexible polymer matrix without compromising with its functional properties. Our work demonstrates a tailored processing route to obtain multifunctional composites for possible applications in spot cooling and broadband energy absorption.},

This work combines recently discovered advantages of hybrids with one constituent having a helical architecture with the benefits provided by severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods. The hybrids are made by embedding copper helixes in melted aluminium and subjecting cast hybrid ingots to different SPD techniques. The electrical conductivity , microstructure features and strength of the produced samples are discussed in relation to effect of SPD and annealing on both constituents and an interface zone formed during the hybrids&#39; production. It was shown that between all processing techniques the reciprocal extrusion (RE) has the great potential for production of lightweight conductors with high conductivity and enhanced strength. A new model describing the effective electrical conductivity of hybrid samples, consisting of an aluminium matrix with an embedded copper helix and intermetallic containing interface, is developed and justified by experimental data. The model is shown to be instrumental for analysis of the effect of the helix&#39;s parameters and interface width on effective conductivity of the hybrid samples and could be used for optimal design of hybrid conductors.},

These materials utilise natural fungal growth as a low energy bio-fabrication method to upcycle abundant agricultural by-products and wastes into more sustainable alternatives to energy intensive synthetic construction materials. Mycelium composites have customisable material properties based on their composition and manufacturing process and can replace foams, timber and plastics for applications, such as insulation, door cores, panelling, flooring, cabinetry and other furnishings. Due to their low thermal conductivity , high acoustic absorption and fire safety properties outperforming traditional construction materials, such as synthetic foams and engineered woods, they show particular promise as thermal and acoustic insulation foams. However, limitations stemming from their typically foam-like mechanical properties , high water absorption and many gaps in material property documentation necessitate the use of mycelium composites as non- or semi-structural supplements to traditional construction materials for specific, suitable applications, including insulation, panelling and furnishings. Nonetheless, useful material properties in addition to the low costs, simplicity of manufacture and environmental sustainability of these materials suggest that they will play a significant role in the future of green construction.},

In this paper, a mild thermolysis method was developed to prepare VO 2 nanoparticles with controlled size and morphology, which was then used to build the nanothermochromic films. By using vanadyl ethylene glycol (VEG) nanorods as a precursor, VO 2 nanoparticles can be obtained at a thermolysis temperature as low as 250 °C within 5 min under static argon atmosphere . The VEG nanorods with uniform size and excellent dispersity were prepared from amorphous vanadium oxide nanopowders synthesized by electrochemical anodic-oxidation of vanadium target. The influence of the thermolysis conditions on the microstructure, phase transition and thermochromic properties of VO 2 nanoparticles were investigated and discussed. By combining with transparent conductive substrate ITO , the VO 2 nanoparticles films demonstrate an active optical switching performance, and the optimal thermochromic properties with T lum of 48\% and ∆T sol of 11\% can be achieved.},

Herein, we investigate several spring-reinforced cylindrical geometries representational of an articulating fuselage that operate in large-scale bending without buckling. Finite element models analyze design performance under loading and in bending and are compared to experimental prototypes. Axial compression tests are conducted to compute bending work as a function of articulation angle. Strong agreement between model predictions and experimental measurements is observed. Using mechanics-based graphical materials selection, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites or lightweight metal alloys are determined to be the most promising materials for successful designs. For the spring-reinforced design space, machined spring-reinforced designs are superior at lower values of articulation work (25 N⋅m) for 25° of articulation.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge of the decomposition process of the microstructure during the precipitation reaction is a requisite step in many cases for exploiting their unique properties. While the earlier work demonstrated that the formation of one-dimensional (1D) Guinier–Preston–Bagaryatsky (GPB) zones is critical for the initial- and peak-hardening of the Al-Cu-Mg alloys, the essential questions remain: what are the basic structural features and the precursors of GPB zones, and how do these precursors transform to the GPB zones? Here we employ atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first-principles calculations to address these problems. In mostly GPB zones-strengthened alloys, we identify two atomistic building blocks of 1D GPB zones, which merge together maintaining a crystallographic orientation of [014] Al . These two particular structures are formed from initial copper double (Cu 2 ) column-skeleton, associated with charge transfer between adjacent Cu and Mg as well as Cu and Al inside the structural units and at the interface between two building block units. Existence of initial and transitional phases is further suggested by ab initio calculations based on STEM observations and image simulations. These results demonstrate the atomistic mechanisms governing Cu 2 columns-guided nucleation, growth, maturation and coarsening of the atomistic building blocks of GPB zones.},

  abstract     = {Aluminum and silicon are common alloying elements for tuning the stacking fault energy (SFE) of high Mn steels . Today the theoretical investigations on the Fe-Mn-Al/Si systems using Density Functional Theory (DFT) are very scarce. In the present study, we employ a state-of-the-art longitudinal spin fluctuations (LSFs) model in combination with DFT for describing the magnetic effects in Fe-Mn based alloys at finite temperature. We find that the traditional DFT-floating spin results fail to explain the experimental trends. However, the DFT-LSFs approach properly captures the Al-induced increase and Si-induced decrease of the SFE of the base alloy in line with the room-temperature observations. This finding highlights the importance of LSFs in describing the Al/Si effects on the SFE of Fe-Mn based alloys. We point out that the effects of the non-magnetic Al and Si additions on the SFE are in fact determined by the magnetic state of the host matrix. In addition, we estimate the role of carbon addition in the alloying effects of Al and Si. The present results provide a convenient pathway to access the important mechanical parameters for designing advanced high-strength alloys.},

However, high operating temperature hinders the development of MOS-based gas sensors. To detect SF 6 decomposition components (including H 2 S, SO 2 , SOF 2 , and SO 2 F 2 ), here, we have synthesized cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs) via a facile hydrothermal routine, followed by functionalization with Au, Ag, and Pd noble metals to improve sensor performance. Our developed CeO 2 -based sensor exhibited high response to target gases at a low working temperature. After doping various metals into the CeO 2 NPs, we acquired distinct patterns of dynamic responses for SF 6 decomposition components. Au functionalization could maximize the enhancements of sensor responses to H 2 S (976\%), SO 2 (153\%), and SOF 2 (151\%) at 100 °C, and a Pd-modified CeO 2 -based sensor exhibited optimal response to SO 2 F 2 at a relatively high temperature of 250 °C. In addition, high response values, short response–recovery times, good repeatability, and low detection limits were also obtained from CeO 2 -based sensors. Our results verified that doping different noble metals into CeO 2 NPs should be a promising strategy to design high-performance gas sensors for SF 6 decomposition component detection.},

Two films were grown on SrTiO 3 substrates with high (∼ 1°) and low (∼ 0.1°) miscut angles, respectively. As expected, high miscut angle leads to suppression of multi-variant growth. By means of SQUID magnetometry, comparable relaxation effects were observed in both the multi-variant and the nearly single-variant sample. Differences in the magnetization reversal process were revealed by magnetic force microscopy. It showed that the multi-variant growth leads to higher density of defects acting as pinning or nucleation sites for magnetic domains, which consequently results in deterioration of magnetic properties . It was demonstrated that the use of high miscut substrate is important for fabrication of high quality SRO thin films with low density of crystallographic defects and excellent magnetic properties.},

Here we show that the design of the texture of woven fabrics is an important parameter to play with in order to achieve higher water repellency, which could help relax the limitations set by more environmentally-friendly coating materials . A mathematical framework is first developed to describe the roughness of woven fabrics and its relationship with water repellency, and metrological aspects of the characterization of the roughness of such fabrics by profilometry are discussed. The roughness of eight different fabric surfaces is then characterized, together with their water repellency after having been coated by wax-based, silicone-based or perfluorobutyl-based commercial polymer formulations. Fabrics of measured roughness lower than a critical value are in a partially-wet state with a substantial pinning of the droplets on their surface and an absence of roll-off whatever the type of hydrophobic coating. Above this critical value, the fabrics enter the superficially-wet state, in which the contact angle becomes controlled by the amount of air trapped in the texture. In this regime, the roll-off angle strongly depends on the wetting hysteresis of the coating material.},

  abstract     = {Virgin biopolymers are often brittle, which means that they need efficient, sustainable, non-toxic plasticizers for most practical applications. Although the mechanical properties of biopolymers plasticized with e.g. sugars have been extensively investigated, the explanation why efficient plasticization normally only occurs above 20 wt\% plasticizer is still lacking. In this work, starch/glycerol was used as a model system to show that all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to capture the transition region at 20–30 wt\% plasticizer, where plasticization becomes pronounced. Tensile properties and PVT data (densities and glass transition temperatures) were obtained both from MD simulations and from measurements on real starch/glycerol materials, confirming that MD could capture the experimentally observed transition region. Also, the simulated glycerol diffusivity correlated well with the trends in the mechanical properties. Percolation theory was used to derive a probable explanation of the observed transition. The results indicate that the MD methodology can be used also for other polymer/plasticizer systems and has the potential to be a valuable tool for optimizing the type and amount of plasticizer in a given polymer, as well as being a tool for the design of new efficient plasticizers.},

In this research, a progressive microforming system with blanking and extrusion operations to make two types of pin-shaped plunger parts by using brass sheets was developed, and the grain size effect was investigated from the aspects of deformation load, dimensional accuracy, microstructural evolution and surface quality. It is revealed that the grain size effect results in the deviation of punch stroke and the variation of part dimension. The formation and characteristics of shear band and dead metal zone are related to velocity gradient and strain accumulation. The forming defects including micro cracks , micro pits, uneven surface and longitudinal surface texture easily occur on the body and tail feature, and micro voids appear with the coarse-grained material. The circular surface, however, shows the desirable quality with each grain size. All these findings provide a basis for mass production of complex pin-shaped microparts by progressive microforming and enrich the knowledges from deformation behavior and product quality assurance aspects.},

  abstract     = {X-ray tomography has emerged as a uniquely powerful and non-destructive tool to analyze defects in additive manufacturing . Defects include unintended porosity, rough surfaces and deviations from design, which can have different root causes and can vary significantly among samples. Powder material properties , non-uniform delivery of the powder layer, deformation during manufacturing, deviations from optimal process-parameters caused by changes in the laser beam, the optical components and the scanning system operation, may result in lack of fusion pores, metallurgical pores, keyhole pores, etc. These different types of pores have different typical sizes, shapes and 3D distributions. All types of defects have effects on the mechanical properties of a final part. The use of X-ray tomography to visualize pores in parts (non-destructively) prior to mechanical testing has allowed us to improve our understanding of the effect of this porosity on the mechanical properties of the part (also referred to as “effect of defect”). This can provide the possibility to discriminate critical defects from harmless ones, and thereby build confidence in additive manufacturing processes. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge with regard to the “effect of defect” in metal additive manufacturing, and highlights some relevant examples from our recent work.},

These results reveal that sensing properties of SGCs come from the morphology change of graphene flakes. It is also confirmed that the relative sliding of overlapped graphene flakes leads to the linear sensing characteristics, and the disconnection of graphene flakes brings about the non-linear sensing effect. Additionally, the influence of length of graphene, initial resistance and pre-stretched treatment on sensing performance is investigated.

CPCs with a blend composition of 50/50 wt\% resulted in the finest co-continuous structure and selective MWCNT localization in PLA. Therefore, these composites were selected for sensor tests. Thermal annealing was applied aiming to maintain the blend structure but improving the sensing reversibility of CPC sensors towards high vapor concentrations. Different sensing protocols were applied using acetone (good solvent for PS and PLA) and cyclohexane (good solvent for PS but poor solvent for PLA) vapors. Increasing acetone vapor concentration resulted in increased relative resistance change ( R rel ) of CPCs. Saturated cyclohexane vapor resulted in lower response than nearly saturated acetone vapor. The thermal annealing at 150 °C did not change the blend morphology but increased the PLA crystallinity , making the CPC sensors more resistant to vapor stimulation, resulting in lower R rel but better reversibility after vapor exposure.},

For unirradiated particles, crushing experiments using a unique hot cell, combined with in situ X-ray computed micro-tomography (XCT) imaging, were conducted at room temperature (RT) and at 1000 °C. Although the SiC layer on the particles is presumed to provide ‘mechanical stability’ to the TRISO particles, results showed a remarkable reduction (~45\%) in the crushing strength of the PyC-2 particles at 1000 °C compared to RT. The fracture patterns of the two types of particles, both at the contact zone and on subsequent propagation, differ significantly at RT and 1000 °C. Further, irradiated particles (irradiation temperature: 1000 ± 20 °C; irradiation doses: 1.08–1.23 dpa and 1.49–1.51 dpa) were imaged by XCT; 250 PyC-1 particles and 223 PyC-2 particles were studied in total and the change in radius/layer thickness in each type was examined. It was found that the buffer densification was lower in PyC-1 particles compared to PyC-2 particles, and the PyC layer shrank in the PyC-I particles, whereas it expanded in PyC-2. Results are discussed in terms of how the residual stresses can impact the high-temperature and post-irradiation behavior of these particles.},

However, injection molds are easy to fail in high–intensity and high-pressure environments. Therefore, it&#39;s necessary to improve their hardness and tensile strength to prolong the service life of injection molds. In this work, Selective laser melting (SLM), an additive manufacturing technology was utilized to process 5 wt\% TiC/AISI 420 composites. The influence of volumetric energy density (η) on relative density, constitutional phases, microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. The results indicated that insufficient energy input could cause defects such as pores and crack in the parts, while a part with near-full density could be fabricated if the applied η was properly settled. The ring-like structure that was comprised of thin “metal-ceramic” interface along the grain boundary was distributed more uniform with the increase of applied η. The SLM-processed sample showed a best mechanical properties at highly applied η (320 W, 850 mm/s, η = 85.6 J/mm 3 ). It had an elevated micro-hardness (592.2 ± 53.6 Hv), an enhanced tensile strength (1452.5 MPa) and an improved elongation (8.65\%), which was higher than that of the cast AISI 420 stainless steel.

The model&#39;s predictions of unseen data were found to be in good agreement with most experimental values.

The novelty of the methodology is the combination of advanced techniques for accurate control on the micropore-level allied with a generic framework for the design of macropore and structural levels. The ability to design ordered macroporous should be combined with adequate and controllable implantation of surface functionalities. With this combination of advanced techniques for macro and micro-pore control, it is possible to produce catalysts that unlock traditional trade-off compromises between diffusion, pressure drop and heat transfer. To demonstrate this novel methodology, we have designed and 3D printed a cubic iso-reticular foam in AlSi10Mg. After producing the support, its entire internal area was anodized to high-surface alumina followed by Pt deposition. We have verified the reproducibility of this technique by manufacturing a catalyst for a demonstrator with 8 m length.

The face sheets were appropriately designed to be thicker than the foils comprising the core to obtain high failure moments and flexural rigidities . Using this approach, we successfully realized mechanical properties superior to those of the elytra of beetles at a comparable areal density. The mechanical behaviors of the panels were evaluated via theory and finite element analysis (FEA), and the optimal combinations of the two thicknesses of the foils comprising the face sheets and the cores for achieving the maximum strengths for the given areal densities were identified.

In this paper, a simple and effective strategy for synthesizing high thermal conductivity copper-graphene (Cu-rGO) was proposed. The microstructure, thermal properties and thermal management capabilities of the composite film were studied. It was found that the obtained Cu-rGO film exhibits excellent flexibility and high thermal conductivity (637.7 W m − 1 K − 1 ). It indicates that the introduction of graphene effectively enhances the thermal conductivity of Cu matrix. Besides, the experimental results show that the Cu-rGO film has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and excellent heat transfer properties. This work provides important guidance for the preparation of high thermal conductivity composites that meet the growing heat dissipation requirements in the future.},

  abstract     = {Microstructures of type 304 austenitic stainless steel , produced through thermo-mechanical processing, were analysed with large area EBSD and optical image analysis assessments of the attacked grain boundary cluster after DL-EPR testing. The thermo-mechanically processed microstructures were exposed to acidified potassium tetrathionate (K 2 S 4 O 6 ) solution under tensile stress and the lengths and distributions of the initiated intergranular crack nuclei were assessed. The crack populations were quantified by fitting a Gumbel extreme value statistics distribution to evaluate their characteristic crack length. A factor (susceptibility parameter) is introduced to rank the degree of susceptibility to intergranular stress corrosion cracking of thermo-mechanically processed microstructures. This accounts for the network connectivity of the sensitised grain boundaries, the grain size and the degree of sensitisation. Similar rankings are obtained for this susceptibility parameter and characteristic crack lengths of the assessed microstructures, in which the thermo-mechanical treatments increased the population of grain boundaries with resistance to stress corrosion cracking .},

The contact was generated by a spherical tungsten carbide indenter under quasi-static, drop weight and ballistic loading conditions. In all circumstances, a ductile deformation region containing dislocations developed below each contact impression. The dislocation density distribution complies with the shear stress distribution predicted by the Hertzian contact model. Ballistic loading resulted in secondary material flow, giving a maximum dislocation density 5–10 times higher than that dictated by the Hertzian contact model. Quantification of dislocation density distribution allowed a critical shear stress for dislocation generation to be estimated. In this alumina ceramic, the critical shear stress is estimated at 2.55 ± 0.10 GPa. Cold work hardening and comminution under dynamic loading are discussed as possible mechanisms for the enhanced dislocation activity under dynamic impact.},

However, they exist in a relatively unexplored region of quasi-limitless composition space. Thus, to enable the development of promising compositionally complex alloys, such as HEAs, high-throughput methods are needed. Such high-throughput capabilities are developed and presented in this work. In situ alloying through additive manufacturing was employed to produce arrays of different HEA compositions. Sample arrays were then characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), all while remaining on the build plate. The top surface of each sample was compositionally homogeneous, as determined by EDS, and each sample exhibited a single-phase, disordered crystal structure, as determined by XRD. CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) modeling was used to determine the equilibrium phases of each HEA composition at lower temperatures, the results of which were compared with XRD results. Implications of high-throughput synthesis techniques and the coupling of high-throughput characterization and modeling techniques are discussed in the context of alloy development .},

Stiffness variation is employed to control the dynamic response of frame structures equipped with such joints. The joint is made of a shape memory polymer (SMP) core which is reinforced by an SMP-aramid composite skin. A controlled stiffness reduction of the joint core material, induced by resistive heating, results in a shift of the structure natural frequencies. This work comprises two main parts: 1) characterization of material thermomechanical properties and viscoelastic behavior ; 2) numerical simulations of the dynamic response of a one-story planar frame equipped with two such variable stiffness joints. The experimental material model obtained through Dynamic Mechanical Analysis has been used to carry out modal and non-linear transient analysis. However, control time delays due to heating and cooling as well as fatigue are not considered in the numerical simulations. Results have shown that through joint stiffness control, the fundamental frequency shifts up to 8.72\% causing a drastic reduction of the dynamic response under resonance loading. The SMP-aramid skin is effective to restrain the joint deformation in the activated state while maintaining viscoelastic damping properties .},

The deposition parameters mainly include incident energy, incident angle and substrate temperature. The simulation results indicate that incident energy and substrate temperature have a significant effect on the surface roughness of deposited NiTi film. However, incident angles below 30° have little influence on surface roughness of NiTi film. The simulation results show that increasing substrate temperature and incident energy can enhance the intermixing between substrate and film. The content of Ni on the NiTi film surface increase significantly with the raise of incident energy. The defect analysis of the deposited film demonstrates that incident angle mainly affects the number of voids and vacancies in the film. For film samples of different deposition conditions, the films deposited at larger incident angles contain more voids and vacancies. While the films deposited at higher substrate temperatures contain fewer voids and vacancies.},

Focusing on three aspects— highly elastic materials, sacrificial materials, and actuation units , we aim to develop an additive manufacturing strategy that allows the fabrication of highly elastic soft structures more efficiently. First, silicone thinner is used to tailor the mechanical properties of the soft silicone elastomer. We found out that adding 20\% volume thinner to the silicone improved the ultimate tensile elongation of 3D printed silicone samples upto 1260\%, which is the highest among all the 3D printed soft materials previously reported. However, in a cyclic tensile test , this strain is not achieved; instead, the maximum strain was 600\%. Second, carbohydrate glasses are introduced as sacrificial materials for 3D printing silicone with hollow channels. Few configurations of pneumatic and hydraulic actuators are developed by forming channels in the silicone elastomer via 3D printed sacrificial carbohydrate structures and subsequently dissolving. The 3D printed structures actuated successfully to get morphed shapes, which showed that our method is effective for manufacturing of functional soft robotic structures.},

For this, based on the theory of machinery, five links, which represent the joint parts and the thigh-femur, and six joints are connected to develop the coupling mechanism. A cylindrical joint is adopted to avoid impact between the hip joint and thigh-femur. Three constraints are enforced to configure the proposed coupling mechanism. A specific mechanism of four links and five joints is constructed, which not only reduces one link but also possesses the analytical solution. Equations of motion of this mechanism are derived using vectors and verified via a case study. The vector graphic method is proposed for planar rotation decomposition of the joint parts. A prototype of the new mechanism is 3D printed and tested. Experiments reveal that new mechanism can work in any body orientation. In this way, the proposed coupling mechanism and vector graphic method help improve the spacesuit hip joint.},

If guided and somehow designed, wrinkles could be in fact used as an alternative printing way for realizing complex surface geometries and thus employed as an innovative bottom-up process in the fabrication of nano- and micro-devices. For these reasons, the prediction of wrinkles of films adhering on flat as well as on structured substrata is a challenging task, genesis and development of the phenomenon being not yet completely understood both when thin membranes are coupled with soft supports and in cases where the geometry of the surfaces are characterized by complex three-dimensional profiles.

The proposed approach, which drastically reduces the computational effort, furnishes a helpful way for predicting both qualitative and quantitative results in terms of wrinkling patterns, magnitude and wavelength, by also allowing to follow the onset of film instabilities and the progressive evolution of the phenomenon until its final stage.},

The FRs was applied to flame retarded UPR thermosets and the fire retardancy, moisture resistance , mechanical properties and flame retarded mechanisms of UPR/FRs were comprehensively investigated. When as low as 15 wt\% FRs was incorporated, UPR/FRs achieved UL-94 V-0 rating during vertical burning tests and the limiting oxygen index value reached 27.9\%. FRs stimulated UPR matrix to form uniform, stiff and dense char layer on materials surface during combustion process . Besides, the phosphine and phosphine oxygen radicals and inert gases generated from FRs exerted the inhibition and dilution effect in gas phase. Thus, the heat release and effective heat combustion of UPR/FRs were conspicuously suppressed. Moreover, UPR/FRs retained satisfactory flame retardancy and mechanical performance after water resistance tests. The moisture resistance of UPR/FRs was evidently enhanced compared with UPR and it led to the maintenance of electrical insulation properties of water treated UPR/FRs.

In this process, the environmental input (&lt;1Hz) is converted into mechanical energy through the postbuckling behavior of the MM, and the mechanical energy is transformed into electrical power by the piezo layer. Nanoscale hexagonal MM is fabricated and tested, and the spin-coating technique is introduced to grow the piezo layer (e.g., PVDF-TrFE) on the MM. Analytical models are developed to obtain the electrical power generated by the MM-PENG. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical predictions and satisfactory agreements are obtained. Parametric studies are carried out to investigate the influences of the pattern ratio, geometric ratio and scaling ratio on the output electrical power.

The hardness in the (0001) plane is higher than that in (2−1−10) and (0−110) planes. The indentation imprints as well as the corresponding elasticity after unloading process were analyzed. Our results reveal that the dislocation nucleation and propagations dominate the indentation induced plastic deformation of rhenium. The pronounced anisotropy of dislocation propagations was evaluated. The anisotropies of the mechanical responses may result from the related anisotropy of dislocation propagations. In addition, we revealed the indentation responses of rhenium at high temperatures up to 2300 K, and the corresponding plastic deformation mechanisms were discussed. The results presented not only provide an answer for the questions about indentation responses of rhenium, but also offer insight into the plastic deformation mechanisms, which could provide reference data for its potential applications.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing interest in the application of supercapacitors in energy storage systems due to their high specific power, fast charge/discharge rates and long cycle stability. Researchers have focused recently on developing nanomaterials to enhance their capacitive performance of supercapacitors. Particularly, the utilisation of fibres as templates has led to theoretical and practical advantages owing to their enlarged specific surface area, which allows fast electrolyte-ion diffusion. In addition, the inclusion of redox-active components, such as transition metal oxides (TMOs) and conducting polymers (CPs), into the fibres is believed to play an important role in improving the electrochemical behaviour of the fibre-based materials. Nevertheless, supercapacitors containing TMO- and CP-based fibres commonly suffer from inferior ion-transport kinetics and poor electronic conductivity, which can affect the rate capability and cycling stability of the electrodes. Therefore, the development of TMO/CP-based fibres has gained widespread attention because they synergistically combine the advantages of both materials, enabling revolutionary applications in the electrochemical field. This review describes and highlights recent progress in the development of TMO-, CP- and TMO/CP-based fibres regarding their design approach, configurations and electrochemical properties for supercapacitor applications, at the same time providing new opportunities for future energy storage technologies.},

Yet, their low mechanical rigidity and limited processability hinder many of their potential applications. In this work we describe the reinforcement of a synthetic biomimetic and β-sheet rich FAQRVPP-LDLK12 SAP by its integration with a naturally occurring polysaccharide - guar gum - to produce a shapeable and thermo-responsive composite hydrogel . Extensive characterization was performed via rheological measurements, CD spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, and AFM analyses. Composite hydrogels show preserved nanostructured morphology and cross-β structure aggregation typical of SAPs, improved mechanical properties (peaking at 1:1 weight ratio with G′~60 kPa) with self-healing and stress-relaxation propensities: they also exhibit reversible repeatable gel-sol transitions in response to thermal stimuli. Thanks to the dynamic properties of guar gum, stretchability was extended far beyond 5\% strain of standard SAPs and processability allowed for the production of knotted threads and long (&gt;10 cm) flexible sheets. Composite hydrogels of guar gum and SAPs may be added to the growing library of biomimetic SAP hydrogels used in 3D-printing, wound healing, suturing and beyond.},

The joints were impacted with energies between 5 J and 30 J at room temperature and the impact damage was evaluated through microscopy and ultrasonic C-scan. Two damage types were identified: barely-visible impact damage with mainly shear-driven damage in the first plies of the composite and visible impact damage with delamination and premature failure of the rivet-composite interface owing to peel stresses upon the impact event. The joint strength and fatigue life were not compromised by the barely-visible impact damage, while a 40\% decrease of quasi-static strength and lower fatigue resistance were achieved for visible impact damage. Despite altered fatigue behavior of impacted joints, damage accumulated towards fatigue was not critical to the joint mechanical integrity, confirmed by the residual strength of up to 96\% after 10 6 cycles for 20 J impacts.},

After ultra-precision cutting the material, we found that the cutting process of high-entropy alloy has no obvious damage to the cutting tools and two distinct phases (FCC α-Al phase and Al/Al 2 Cu/MgZn 2 quaternary eutectics phase) were formed on the finished surface under the observation of scanning electron microscopy. By comparing the size of two phases and the morphology of undeformed chips cut by diamond tool and polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) tool, the material surface cut by PCBN tool was subjected to greater extrusion force and friction during machining, leading to more remarkable increase in surface microhardness .},

In this work anisotropic microstructural damage and cracking of multiphase Zn1.8Al1.8Mg alloy coatings produced by hot-dip galvanization process on a steel substrate have been studied extensively. Nanoindentation coupled with orientation image microscopy (OIM) is utilized to determine the local micro ductility/strength of the existing phases as well as the orientation dependent micromechanical properties of primary zinc grains. Plastic deformation and damage behavior of the coating are evaluated through in-situ tensile/bending tests, micro-digital image correlation and in-situ OIM analyses. Stress distribution fields and nucleation sites of cracks within the coating microstructure are investigated using extended finite element method . Three quantitative plastic deformation-based criteria are revealed to correlate the coating microstructure to micro-mechanical properties to comprehend the cracking phenomenon. In particular, the binary eutectic is identified as the most detrimental constituent for compatible plastic deformation. Local strain hardening exponent and Schmid factor of primary zinc grains are found to play a significant role in clarifying the cracking behavior . The results of this study are considered as an important step towards designing microstructure controlled ZnAlMg coatings with superior formability.},

The results showed that the netlike eutectic carbides were significantly reduced after super-high temperature pretreatment. Due to the increase in supercooling during super-high temperature pretreatment cooling, the inter-laminar spacing of pearlite was reduced from 300 nm to 100 nm. When the ductile iron with superfine pearlite was reheated, a large amount of Fe 3 C particles were retained inside the prior austenite grains. After austempering, a superfine ausferrite matrix with a length of 1–3 μm and a thickness of 50 nm was obtained. The main reason for this refinement is the increased number of nucleation-sites for the austenite grains and the retardation-effect of Cr on their growth. TEM results indicated that a possible orientation relationship between bainitic ferrite with a cubic lattice and precipitated Fe 3 C particles with a orthorhombic lattice is (01 1 ¯ 1¯ ) α-Fe //(210) Fe3C , and their boundaries are coherent boundaries. The CADI obtained by S&amp;A treatment has an impact toughness 120\% higher than the traditional CADI without sacrificing hardness, and has excellent wear resistance under high wear load.},

Compared with wrought Inconel 625 superalloy, Inconel 625 superalloy fabricated by DED shows a higher flow stress, lower peak stress, and lower deformation activation energy under the same hot compression conditions. The fraction of recrystallized grain and recrystallized grain size increases with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. At lower deformation temperatures , continuous dynamic recrystallization is the main mechanism of DRX. However, discontinuous dynamic recrystallization becomes the predominant operating mechanism of DRX at high deformation temperature. In addition, the kinetics of DRX in DED Inconel 625 superalloy is much slower than that in forged Inconel 625. The results also show that DED Inconel 625 superalloy has higher thermal stability than that of forged Inconel 625 superalloy, which makes it possible for DED Inconel 625 superalloy to be employed at high temperatures.},

As a result, the sample shows high ultimate tensile strength of up to 707 MPa, while maintaining a total elongation of 30\%. The sample fabricated with a low scanning speed (800 mm/s) shows high ductility with total elongation to failure of 55\%. The improved ductility is mainly attributed to the elimination of residual pores and melting pool boundaries, which result in brittle features in the as-built samples. The results indicate that selective laser melting may act as a physical metallurgy method to modify the microstructure, and thus improve the mechanical performance of metallic materials.},

A close to homogeneous grain distribution along the polymer surface were achieved by using a simple solvent casting method for their magnetocaloric properties studies. From XRD analysis , it was found a unit cell volume shrinkage by increasing the powder concentration followed by a reduction on the amount of secondary monoclinic phase as a result of interfacial interactions . As a consequence, a weakening of secondary phases effect on the composite magnetocaloric behavior is observed as a result of the effective hydrostatic pressure from the difference between thermal expansions of matrix and filler.},

It was established that star macromolecules are non-uniformly distributed in the matrix and form aggregates; they increase in the size up to ~60\% during swelling of membranes in deuterated acetic acid. In pervaporation, the total flux through the membrane rises with increasing both the star macromolecule content in membrane and water concentration in the feed.

Here, it can be found that a single layer non-stoichiometric WO x film exhibits excellent solar selectivity (solar absorptance of 0.84 and thermal emittance of 0.053). With the aid of a SiO 2 anti-reflective layer, the absorptance is significantly raised to 0.92, and the emittance remains unchanged. The spectral selectivity is on par with those of multilayer SSACs . A thermal annealing result indicated that the as-fabricated SSACs possessed outstanding thermal stabilities reaching up 400 °C in vacuum.

In this study, the buckling analysis of additively manufactured cellular columns was conducted. The effect of unit cell size and height of the column on the critical buckling load and post-bucking behavior of compressive columns constructed with periodic cubic structure was investigated using experimental and simulation-based studies. The results exhibited that the unit cell size and cellular column height significantly affect the critical buckling load while the total mass, volume fraction, and column dimensions remain the same. The critical buckling load increases with the increase of unit cell size or decrease of cellular column height. The largest unit cell size (8.72 mm) has the maximum critical buckling load, followed by unit cell sizes of 4.74 mm and 2.5 mm, respectively. Moreover, the failure of cellular columns having larger height-to-width (h/w) ratio, happens due to global buckling, whereas, local bucking dominates for smaller h/w ratios. Additionally, it was found that the unit cell size significantly affects on the post-buckling behavior; the samples of larger unit cells failed in a brittle manner and this trend continuously changed from brittle to ductile as the unit cell size reduces.},

The microstructure analyses of the achieved joints were conducted using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) cooperated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system. Tensile, three-point bending, and nanoindentation tests were carried out to investigate the mechanical properties .

In addition, a novel vortex structure, good for preventing crack propagation from the brittle melted area, was observed at the Ta/Fe interface. Finally, the corrosion test indicated that the corrosion resistance of Q235 plate was remarkably improved after being coated by Ta foils using explosive welding.},

A series of quasi-static tests are conducted to compare the mechanical behaviour of the hybrid interlocking assembly plate with those obtained from the monolithic plate and the interlocking assembly plate without soft interfaces. The results show that the hybrid assembly plate has a remarkable flexural compliance with less damage in the bricks compared to the other two. The effect of lateral confining load on the structural behaviour of the hybrid interlocking assembly plate is also investigated. In addition, a 3D numerical model is established to predict the overall behaviour, failure mode and the damage distributions of the hybrid assembly plate. Then the hybrid assembly plate under various lateral confining loads and with different friction factors between rubber and bricks is studied numerically. It is found that, although the maximum transverse force is influenced by the initial confining load and the friction factor, the mechanical behaviour of the hybrid structure is consistent in large deformation .},

This work reviews the current state of repeatability/reproducibility in metal additive manufacturing, specifically in powder bed fusion technologies such as selective laser melting (SLM) and electron beam melting (EBM). The repeatability issues present in these AM processes is shown to be pervasive across the available literature. The additive manufacturing process is separated into pre-process, para-process and post-process stages and a critical review of the causes and impact of repeatability found at these stages is conducted. Key parameters of these stages: powder properties, laser characteristics and post-processing are studied in depth as sources of variation that can diminish repeatability. An understanding of the limitations of analysing repeatability from the current literature is developed and areas for further research towards the improvement of repeatability are identified.},

The test method used to produce the delamination process under mode III fracture is known as the Longitudinal Half Fixed Beam (LHFB) method, used in previous studies by the authors, which was shown to be a valid method for generating the delamination process in composite sheet materials subject to mode III fatigue loading. The experimental data from the fatigue tests were treated with a probabilistic model based on the Weibull distribution . This model facilitates the identification of relevant aspects of the fatigue behaviour of these materials, such as the estimation of fatigue strength for periods of time greater than those tested here, as well as the reliability of the results.

The effect of Ag ion content on the resistivity and microstructures of the modified conductive film was investigated, and the flexibility and relative resistance change of the modified conductive film were measured by the cyclic bending test and compared with the traditional Ag flake ink. Consequently, the modified conductive film sintered from Ag flake/ion-0.5 in. exhibits low electrical resistivity of 4.83 × 10 −5 Ω·cm, which is 42.9\% lower than the Ag flake film sintered from the Ag flake ink, and the modified conductive film still displays smaller changes in resistivity and relative resistance after the cyclic bending tests. The enhanced conductivity and flexibility are attributed to the bridging effect of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) generated from the in–situ decomposition of Ag ion ink.

Comprehensive electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) examination was conducted to check how the heterogeneous microstructural developments were affected by the geometrical and crystal orientations of the colony. A crystal plasticity model was employed to quantify the heterogeneous deformation and orientation evolution during compression. The heterogeneous globularization behavior is interpreted from the orientation perspective by relating the orientation spread within alpha lamellae to the slip activation, strain partitioning in the constituent phases as well as microstructural phenomena such as deformation banding and dynamic recrystallization . The activation of the prism and basal slips in alpha phase and strain partitioning between the alpha and beta phases would enhance the orientation spread, which accounts for the relatively high globularization efficiency in inclined colonies.},

  abstract     = {A 3D printing technique has been developed which enables the treatment of osteosarcoma via personalized local chemotherapy. A series of in vivo trials were conducted which closely mimicked real clinical chemotherapeutic conditions. We have shown that 3D printed poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) implants are exceptional carriers for anticancer drugs and can be designed with finely tuned physical morphologies and controllable micropore structures. Their favorable biodegradability, in vitro cytotoxicity, in vitro blood compatibility, in vivo subacute toxicity, and in vivo sensitization tests have confirmed their biocompatibility and pharmaceutical properties. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that local chemotherapy with the assistance of the as-prepared PLLA implant exhibits an anti-osteosarcoma efficacy superior to traditional chemotherapy through a series of in vivo anti-osteosarcoma tests according to clinical protocols. The proposed 3D printed drug delivery system can simultaneously realize individual local chemotherapy, multi-drug delivery, long-term sustainable drug release, and non-reoperation in osteosarcoma treatment. Our studies enable the utilization of the 3D printing technique in the treatment of osteosarcomas and guide future clinical trials. The established techniques and principles can also be adapted to the local chemotherapy of other tumors.},

The mechanical properties of as-received hollow alumina spheres ceramic can be tailored by the sintering procedure. The results indicated that the sample sintered at 1400 °C exhibited a low bulk density of 1.005 g/cm 3 and a low thermal conductivity of 0.656 W/mK.

The separation of Th from rare earth elements (REEs) is of great importance in environmental governance and clean-energy development. In this work, a monolithic cerium (Ce) doped silica aerogel-like with flexibility was synthesized using a low consumption and rapid technique, and it was used in a continuous solid-phase extraction as an adsorbent for the selective separation of Th/REEs. The batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption efficiency of Th(IV) can be up to 96\% when abnormally high levels of metal ions (20 ppm) exist. Under the same conditions, the adsorption efficiency of REEs is at a near-zero level, which demonstrates the great selective separation of Th/REEs for the aerogel-like. The results also indicated that Th(IV) could desorb from the adsorbent in weak acidic media, which is friendly to the environment. Therefore, the material has application prospects for the separation of Th/REEs and removal of radioactive contamination from the environment.},

Here, we adopted two-step hydrothermal method to functionalize zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires on the NF surface driven by strong intramolecular interaction. The perfect integration of the root-like NF and PLA matrix via the laterally-grown ZnO nanowires enabled the corresponding composite to present excellent interfacial adhesion. This can be exemplified by the substantial increases of 157\% and 403\% in interfacial shear strength and the debonding energy compared to PLA/pristine NF composite . Finally, a comprehensive understanding on the interfacial reinforcement caused by the laterally-grown ZnO nanowires was elucidated based on finite element method and the fracture morphology after the single fiber pull-out test. This study can provide an interfacial manipulation strategy on topological architecture to improve the interfacial properties of the environmentally-friendly PLA/NF biocomposite, which is instructive to achieve the large-scale application.},

The sol-forming properties of five different ratios of PFEA and MMA were investigated. As the proportion of PFEA increased, the oleophobic performance increased but the solubility of the copolymer gel in acetone decreased. The water and oil contact angles would reach the maximum values when PFEA content was the highest. When the mass ratio of PFEA to MMA exceeded 50\%, functionalized sodium bicarbonate powder showed a good floating performance on water and aviation kerosene surface. In fire experiments, pure sodium bicarbonate powder was hard to extinguish aviation kerosene pool fires while FSB powder could extinguish the flame easily.

This was done using spherical TC4 particles and 3–5 layered GR powders. GRs were adopted onto the surfaces of the TC4 particles through a chemical modification method. Partial GRs were retained and some titanium carbide (TiC) phases in nanoscale were in-situ generated through a reaction between the GR and TC4 matrix during the sintering stage. The well-dispersed GR/TiC hybrid reinforcements at the TC4 spherical matrix formed a 3D network architecture. Compared with pure TC4, the GR/TC4 composites exhibited higher compressive strength and ductility when the GR concentration was &lt;0.5 wt\%. In light of tensile results, the 0.25 wt\% GR/TC4 composites showed improved tensile strength with acceptable tensile ductility. The enhanced mechanical properties can be attributed to the network interface strengthening mechanism and matrix grain refinement in the network. The factors affecting mechanical properties of the network structured GR/TC4 nanocomposites were discussed. The conflict between strength and ductility in metallic materials is a vital problem. A good balance of strength and ductility was achieved in the GR/TC4 composites by controlling the GR distribution state in a network architecture.},

This combination is here called Hot Stamping and Quenching and Partitioning process (HSQ&amp;P). The partitioning step was performed at 400 °C for 100 s in all cycles. Microstructural features were comprehensively studied using electron backscattered diffraction and nanoindentation techniques. HSQ&amp;P samples showed a good combination of ductility and high-strength due to the presence of: retained austenite , inter-critical ferrite with low stored internal strain energy, grain refinement via DIFT-effect (deformation induced ferrite transformation), martensite, and bainite . Significant internal stress relief was caused by carbon partitioning, which was induced by the DIFT-effect and the partitioning stage. This also led to a considerable stored energy, which was characterized by the Kernel average dislocation and geometrically necessary dislocation analysis. In addition, predominant {110}//strain direction crystallographic texture was identified, which promotes slip deformation and enhances the mechanical properties . Moreover, remarkable amounts of fine film-like retained austenite oriented along compact crystallographic directions (i.e., 〈111〉 and 〈112〉) were observed. Finally, subsize tensile test verified the optimum mechanical behavior of HSQ&amp;P specimens.},

Results show that kinking of α 2 /γ lamellar colonies and periodic morphology variation of β 0 phase mainly contributed to the initial flow softening, while DRX of γ phase and periodic morphology variation of β 0 phase contributed to the lateral flow softening of Ti-42.9Al-4.6Nb-2Cr with duplex structure. Kinking of lamellar colonies was caused by appearance of stacking faults pairs in γ lamellae and fracture of α 2 lamellae. Lamellar colonies were decomposed by DRX of γ phase and growth of adjacent lamellae in the kinked area. Additionally, periodic morphology variation of β 0 phase was related to intensive deformation systems, which can be easily-activated, and fast DRX behavior via rotation of subgrains during isothermal compression.},

Conventional lightweight refractories focus on the fabrication of Al 2 O 3 -based, spinel-based, or Al 2 O 3 -spinel based refractories with micro-sized closed pores. In this study, lightweight magnesia-based aggregates with smaller nano-sized pores were fabricated by the decomposition of magnesite by using nano-sized Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 as additives. The lightweight magnesia containing nano-sized intracrystalline pores (100–300 nm) had a relatively low thermal conductivity of 4.539 W⋅m −1 K −1 at 500 °C with a bulk density of 3.37 g/cm 3 and a closed porosity of 4.3\%. Moreover, the formation mechanism of nano-sized intracrystalline pores was proposed, and the effect of nano-sized additives on the sintering properties was discussed. We concluded that nano-sized Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 raise the number of nano-sized intracrystalline pores by increasing their migration distance required to separate from the magnesia grains. With the joint addition of nano-sized Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 , the lightweight magnesia possessed the lowest thermal conductivity, as well as excellent strength , owing to the generation of intergranular MgAl 2 O 4 spinel. Furthermore, the nano-sized Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 also promoted the sintering of magnesia resulting in the formation of cation vacancies ( ⁎ ⁎ V M g ⁎ ⁎ VMg⁎⁎ ).},

The fitting line of the ballistic limit for the B 4 C/Al bumper is obtained, and its critical projectile size can be improved by about 20\% in comparison to the conventional Al alloy Whipple shield configuration. Based on the damage features of bumper and rear wall, the B 4 C ceramic phase of B 4 C/Al composite is the key reason to break the projectile into smaller fragments or liquid droplets of debris cloud. The Al plastic phase with three-dimensional network enhances the toughness of B 4 C/Al composite bumper, which plays an important role in avoiding structural failure caused by shock waves.

  abstract     = {For multifunctional structural supercapacitor , pore structure can store lots of aqueous electrolyte in the matrix and interconnected pore structure can offer numerous channels for ion movement during charge-discharge. This paper first investigates the effects of pore forming with hemp fiber on the performance of structural supercapacitor. Various contents of hemp fiber were employed to alter the pore structure of the magnesium phosphate electrolyte containing 2 M KOH. Plenty of macropores causing by adding large content of fiber are normally bad for mechanical properties , yet they are beneficial to change the pore structure of structural electrolyte. The results show that porosity and pore connectivity of the structural electrolyte are gradually increasing from 8.3\% to 18.6\% and from 5.6\% to 15.5\% with the content of hemp fiber increasing within a certain range, respectively. Thus the specific capacitance of structural supercapacitor gradually increases by 46.8\%. The results of multifunctionality of structural supercapacitor show that the sample with the most developed pore structure appears for an optimum balance between mechanical and electrochemical performance.},

  abstract     = {Nano-materials have various promising properties to concrete material . However, the poor dispersion of nano-materials remains to be a big challenge which impairs the target performances and thus increases the economic cost. In this study, we focused on one of the most widely used nano-materials, nano-SiO 2 and investigated the influence of its dispersion on the early age hydration of cement pastes . A recently developed method was applied to chemically graft polycarboxylate superplasticizer onto nano-SiO 2 particles to produce well dispersed particles with the shell core structure (nano-SiO 2 @PCE). Dispersity of nano-SiO 2 @PCE in deionized water (DI water) and in simulated pore solution of cement pastes was carefully characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) techniques. The effects of nano-SiO 2 dispersion on the early age hydration of cement pastes were investigated. The results showed that with good dispersion only 0.5\% by mass of nano-SiO 2 can significantly accelerate hydration. The retarding effect unintentionally caused by PCE was observed to influence particularly on the length of induction period rather than other stages of hydration. BNG model was used in the end to quantitatively analyze and shed more lights on the influence of nano-SiO 2 on the kinetics of C 3 S hydration.},

Common PDMS elastomers have a dielectric permittivity of only about 3 and thus elongations interesting for real applications occur only at high voltages. In this work, a new class of silicone-based elastomers with increased permittivity are synthesized starting from polymethylvinylsiloxane and thioacetic acid via a photo-induced thiol-ene reaction, whereby polar thioacetate groups are introduced at every siloxy unit. The silanol end-groups of the formed polymer are subsequently used for cross-linking into thin films using a condensation reaction with poly(methylhydrosiloxane- co -dimethylsiloxane). These films show good mechanical properties and have a low glass transition temperature (-58 °C), which allows for a wide range of use temperatures. Further they have an increased permittivity ( ε’ = 4.7) and an increased sensitivity to electric field as compared to regular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers. Our new elastomers are easily accessible and can be processed into very thin films, which allows access to actuators operable way below 1000 V. An actuation strain of 12.8\% at an electric field of 21.5 V/μm was measured.},

The interfacial interaction between fillers and matrix is of significant influence in agglomeration of fillers and mechanical/damping properties of as-prepared composites. Here, polydopamine (PDA), (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (KH550) and ionic liquid (1-aminoethyl-3methylimidazolium bis ((trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl) imide)) were used to not only functionalize CNTs for suppressing their agglomeration, but also regulate the interfacial interaction between CNTs and carboxylated butadiene nitrile rubber (XNBR) for achieving excellent mechanical properties and better damping properties . The storage modulus of composites rose by 80\% (from 1392 to 2488 MPa) with the addition amount of 2.2 wt\% CNTs-KH550 and the tensile strength rose by 110\% (from 0.32 to 0.68 MPa) with 3.0 wt\% CNTs-IL. In addition, the damping degradation of composites caused by the agglomeration of fillers was resolved. The results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that the strong interfacial interaction of CNTs-PDA and CNTs-KH550 is mainly attributed to hydrogen bond interaction, while the interaction of CNTs-IL is determined by hydrogen bond interaction and van der Waals&#39; (vdW) force. The functionalized CNTs with excellent interfacial interaction and dispersion have bright application prospects in the field of composite.},

Herein, a morphing cylinder is optimized to minimize both its work to actuate in bending as well as radial deviations . Based on derived linear elastic mechanics of a cylindrical shell in bending, it was determined that favorable designs have high circumferential and low axial stiffnesses . We investigate circumferentially reinforced composites that limit radial displacement and allow for out-of-plane bending. Designs of flexible skins with embedded or underlying reinforcement were modeled, fabricated, and compared to unreinforced skins. Finite element analyses predicted the bending kinematics and structural responses. Digital image correlation used during the bending of physical prototypes generated strain contour plots of cylinder surfaces. Strong agreement between model predictions and experimental measurements was observed. The dimensions of each archetype were systematically varied via finite element modeling to obtain a set of nondominated designs capable of 25° of bending without buckling or large radial displacements. For the examined designs, it was determined that flexible skins reinforced with embedded rings were optimal at low (8–15 N · · m) and high (&gt;250 N · · m) values for the work to articulate while flexible skins reinforced with underlying helical springs were optimal at moderate values (15–250 N · · m).},

The mechanical performance of all compositions was evaluated under bending and compressive loadings . Life cycle assessment was used to investigate the greenhouse gas emission and embodied energy of the developed composites. The results reveal that PVA fibers greatly enhanced the mechanical performance of all reinforced mixtures with deflection hardening behavior and improvement in compressive strength .

Due to its hydrophobicity , Cur solubilization is a great challenge. Thus, Cur solubilization by pluronic F-127, gelation capacity of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and porosity enhancement by TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) can inaugurate a biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel system for Cur delivery. In this study, a Cur incorporated physically crosslinked TOCN-PVA-Cur hydrogel was prepared by a freeze-thaw process, which released Cur to accelerate wound healing. The viscosity of the hydrogel was increased by increasing the PVA concentration. In vitro studies revealed that, L929 fibroblast cells internalized curcumin within 4 h of incubation. After the application of the TOCN-PVA-Cur into rat full-thickness skin wounds, the percentage of wound closures was increased compared to that in the control group. Distinct neoepidermise and granulation tissue formed in hydrogel treated groups and collagen fibers accumulated near defect areas at the two weeks after treatment.

  abstract     = {Debonding between the skins and the core in a sandwich structure is a critical failure mode in automotive applications; once debonding occurs, the load carrying capacity of a sandwich structure drastically decreases. In the present paper, the effect of using three core materials, with different cell characteristics, on the interfacial strength between the foam cores and a CFRP skin is investigated through mechanical testing and numerical modelling. A key finding is that foams with a coarse cellular structure favour a high resin uptake at the interface during the manufacturing process, which results in a stronger interfacial bonding between the foam and the CFRP. During Mode I loading, the thick resin layer at the interface postpones crack initiation and kinking in the core, whilst under Mode II, this resin layer delays the collapse in compression of foam cells under the crack tip. Thus, the importance of including this thick resin layer in the FE modelling was demonstrated. Finally, as the CZM was shown to be unable to predict the unstable crack propagation within the core, an alternative approach has been suggested which has the significant benefit of not requiring experimental testing of the interface between the skin and the core.},

The experimental analysis is supported by constitutive Finite Element Analysis with cohesive zones to determine adequate gauge factors to correlate the load instability upon splitting to the fracture toughness Kc. The role of densification on pillar splitting was critically examined. The results show a fragmentation of the micro pillar into three parts, a failure pattern as proposed by Sebastiani et al. (Philos. Mag., 95 (2014) 1928). Therefore, the applicability of pillar splitting to (anomalous) glasses is confirmed. Cohesive zone FEA delivered the gauge factors required for fracture toughness calculation. The influence of densification on those factors, however, was found to be small for indentation cracking and negligible for pillar splitting. With the corresponding set of gauge factors fracture toughness values in good accordance with literature could be determined. Inside the SEM , moreover, electron beam irradiation has been found to enhance the fracture properties of fused silica.},

Herein, the poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-coated NiCo 2 O 4 rod-like micro-nano structures/reduced graphene oxide (NiCo 2 O 4 RMNs@PEDOT2/RGO) hybrid is synthesized.

Particularly, the PEDOT is employed as a conductive wrapped layer and caking agent reduced interface resistance and quicken transport electrons from NiCo 2 O 4 to the surface of RGO. Benefitting from the above synergistic effect of three components, the hybrid demonstrates high sensitivity (0.679 mA mM -1 cm -2 ), the low detection limit (it is estimated to be 0.031 µM), and a wide linear detection ranges of 0.388 µM–140.068 mM for H 2 O 2 detection, which observably outperforms detection performances of previously reported other composites. The influence of morphology and interface structure of the hybrid towards performances is detailed.

  abstract     = {Retaining chemical heterogeneity of 2:14:1 grains and forming continuous grain boundaries are two critical contributions to the strong magnetism in multi-main-phase (MMP) magnets. However, the ideal grain boundary microstructure is usually achieved at the expense of weakening the chemical heterogeneity, which poses a big challenge. Here we report a versatile strategy to balance the chemical heterogeneity and microstructure of MMP Nd-Ce-La-Fe-B magnets through tailoring liquid-phase-sintering. At optimum 1040 °C sintering, MMP magnet with 27 wt\% Ce–La substitution level exhibits an equivalent weight-bearing capacity to 40MGOe commercial Nd-Fe-B, which is attributed to the joint contributions from retained chemical heterogeneity, essential densification , homogeneous grain size distribution and continuous intergranular phase network with ordered I a 3 ¯ Ia3¯ structure. When shifting sintering temperature T s towards the higher or lower range, the deteriorated magnetic properties are dominated by distinct restraints. With T s above 1040 °C, the decreased coercivity is mainly restrained by the negative role of gradual chemical homogenization and abnormal grain growth , as verified by experimental and simulated results. However, with T s below 1040 °C, the unsatisfactory magnetic performance mainly roots in insufficient densification and discontinuous grain boundary. These advances may deepen our understanding on designing high-performance MMP magnets with balanced contributions from modified microstructure and retained chemical heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {The effects of Cr addition on microstructures, mechanical properties and deformation behavior of near-rapidly solidified low-density Fe-20Mn-9Al-1.2C (wt.\%) steel strips were investigated. It was found that Cr addition increased the volume fraction and size of δ-ferrite, and decreased the precipitation of κ-carbides in this low-density steel strip. The yield strength of the near-rapidly solidified steel strips was decreased significantly, but the ultimate tensile strength and the total elongation didn&#39;t obviously change. However, after cold rolling with 20\% reduction, the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of Cr-containing steel strips were significantly higher than that of the Cr-free steel strip. It was attributed to the fact that the decrease of κ-carbides caused by Cr addition facilitated the formation of high-density slip bands during cold rolling deformation. The ultimate tensile strength and total elongation of cold-rolled 3Cr (wt.\%) steel strip were 1270 MPa and 21\%, respectively. A double (Slip-band and Microband) hardening mechanism was proposed for the strain hardening behavior of the low-density steel strips, and the number of nanoscale κ-carbides played a crucial role in the strain hardening rate at the early strain stage.},

Aiming to understand the formation of IMCs and their transition, the present work employed first-principles calculations of thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature and pressure together with diffusivities of Al and Cu from the literature. Agreeing with experimental observations, the predicted IMC formation sequence in the low-energy welding region is as follows. θ-Al 2 Cu forms first due to the fast diffusivity of Cu in the Al-matrix. θ-Al 2 Cu then transforms to η 2 -AlCu because of the fast diffusivities of Al/Cu in θ-Al 2 Cu. In the high-energy welding region, the stable γ 1 -Al 4 Cu 9 and the metastable θ’’-Al 3 Cu are also formed in addition to the aforementioned θ-Al 2 Cu and η 2 -AlCu. η 2 -AlCu and considerable γ 1 -Al 4 Cu 9 are the major phases in the high-energy welding region. The present approach, combining experiments and calculations, is proven to be a practical way to understand non-equilibrium metallurgical processes , as demonstrated through the study of VFAW Al-Cu joints.},

Despite outstanding progress in bionic engineering to simulate water movement within trees, biomimetic design in one-dimensional (1D) fiber assemblies is still limited. Here, an advanced composite yarn structure inspired by the moisture transfer in trees is reported. Utilizing the scale difference between cotton fibers and electrospun nanofibers , the engineered tree-like-core spun yarn effectively transported liquid moisture from one side of the yarn to the other. The core structure of the spun yarn was precisely designed by controlling the fineness of the nanofibers and the thickness of the nanofiber layer. Moreover, fabrics based on the tree-like-core spun yarn had reduced relative water content on the top surface (0\%) and a high one-way transport index of 846\%, which is more than twice as high as traditional fabrics, demonstrating potential for moisture-heat transmission, biosensors, and microfluidics applications.},

The aim of this paper was to design porous permanent implants using the deformed primitives to better withstand the stress and transfer the load. Mechanical compression tests showed that higher volume fraction and function periodicities of primitive units will lead to denser structures which are stronger under loading. Finite element simulations were then conducted on ten different cases including intact healthy knees, knee joints with solid meniscal implants, and knee joints with meniscal implants with eight types of deformed primitive surfaces. Compression and shear stresses, stress concentrated areas and meniscal extrusion displacement were evaluated under the posture of balanced standing. Compared to the solid meniscal implant, the proposed porous implants reduced both stress extremes, stress concentration area and the displacement of meniscal extrusion. Meanwhile, the proposed PCU implants can be fabricated with 3D printing technology, indicating a good clinical application.},

An appropriate electroless plating method for coating carbon fibers in woven form was developed. The uniform and compact coatings could be generated stably at a temperature of 70 °C and pH 4.0, and the addition of a disperser improved the deep plating ability and promoted bidirectional plating. More than 80\% of the coated woven fibers exhibited excellent coating properties, which offered sufficient fixation and protection of the fibers for subsequent processing. A synchrotron X-ray radiography analysis indicated that the spontaneous infiltration behavior mainly stemmed from the chemical reaction between Al and Ni, rather than the simple physical filling of the fiber interspaces with molten aluminium. The infiltration process could be divided into three typical periods, namely the slow infiltration, rapid infiltration, and stable infiltration periods. Moreover, the coated fibers oriented in the direction perpendicular to the infiltration direction were more easily infiltrated than those oriented in the direction parallel to the infiltration direction.},

Through studying the effect of the proportion of ethanol in the solvent and the amount of solvent on the surface tension, the conductivity and viscosity of the spinning solution, and the spinning solution with the best spinnability were explored. The prepared Fe 3 O 4 fibers had high saturation magnetization and maintained excellent flexibility.

Deformation induced ferrite transformation followed by continuous dynamic recrystallization of the dynamically transformed ferrite is found to be the key mechanism for the formation of the ultrafine grained structure. Due to application of high amount of strains specifically within α+γ phase regime, the α-phase subdivided into several subgrains . These α-subgrains are strongly pinned by the γ/α grain boundaries and thereby restrict the dynamic recovery of the ferrite through reknitting and unravelling subgrain boundaries. On the application of further straining, the misorientation angle between these subgrain boundaries increases continuously through accumulation of the dislocations and finally, ultrafine ferrite grain structure is developed through continuous dynamic recrystallization.},

The cladding microstructure is formed by nickel dendrites surrounded by borides and homogeneously scattered pure silver pockets encapsulated within molybdenum and chromium sulfides that arise from the thermal decomposition of MoS 2 during deposition. Particular attention is devoted to the latter, since their local mechanical and frictional properties are completely unknown. The nanotribological results show that chromium sulfides have a high hardness and a low intrinsic friction. This implies a twofold role in friction reduction. They provide intrinsic low friction and support friction reduction by silver smearing thanks to their high hardness. The presented microstructure is able to effectively control and reduce friction down to a value of 0.25 in vacuum at room temperature and 300 °C by the smearing of silver over the chromium sulfides. This friction reduction mechanism is enhanced by thermal softening of the pure silver phase at elevated temperatures, contrary to air atmosphere, where smearing is hampered by silver oxidation . This overall tribological performance makes the presented claddings potential candidates for space applications.},

  abstract     = {Using atomistic simulations , we present a systematic investigation of the shear mechanisms of three {111} bimetal interfaces, focusing on the influence of the dislocation spacing and bonding scheme across the interface. The evolution of interface sliding process reveals that all the initial shearings are nucleated at the regions of dislocations and their nodes. The interface with small lattice misfit could accommodate the shear strain via the dislocation loops gliding into neighboring massive coherent regions, exhibiting a comparatively low shear strength . However, at the interface with dense dislocation network, the adjacent gliding dislocation loops interact with each other and prohibit further interface sliding. Considering the γ surfaces of three {111} interfaces, it is found that the miscellaneous bonding scheme across the interface can vary the preferred sliding directions and prevent the necessary transformation of the incipient sliding directions, which eventually increase the shear resistance. The shear strength of the Ni/Al {111} interface is increased by six times after alloying, verifying the cooperative strengthening effect contributed by the dense interfacial dislocations and miscellaneous bonding scheme.},

Experimental results demonstrate that both Co and Zn are important to the formation of the specially coiled NCNTs.

Furthermore, even at a thin thickness (1.5–2.0 mm) the minimal reflection losses of the optimized micro-nanostructures can reach −10 dB. The enhanced microwave absorption property can be explained by increased dielectric loss caused by defects and N dopants , better impedance matching characteristic, and the unique helically coiled structure.},

Results show that the addition of Nd can affect the grain size, crystal orientation and secondary phase of the alloys. The corrosion resistance of Mg-6Gd-2Y-χNd-0.2Zr alloys increases with the increase of Nd content from 0\% to 0.5 wt\%, and then decreases from 0.5 wt\% to 1.5 wt\%. A minor 0.5 wt\% addition of Nd can improve the corrosion resistance of Mg-6Gd-2Y-0.2Zr alloy. The grain size of the four alloys is in a range from 4 μm to 7 μm and the 1.5Nd alloy with the smallest grain has the highest corrosion rate . The highest corrosion resistance of 0.5Nd alloy is attributed to the highest intensity of (0001) basal texture and the less amount of secondary phases. However, the higher fraction of secondary phase is the main reason for the highest corrosion rate of 1.5Nd alloy.},

  abstract     = {The application of wire + arc additively manufactured (WAAM) aluminum alloys has been restricted by the porosity defect, which is generally detrimental to the mechanical properties . Suppressing of micropores in the WAAM components has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Inter-layer rolling was introduced to eliminate micropores during the WAAM deposition of the Al–Cu6.3 and Al–Mg4.5 alloys. The distribution characteristics and individual morphology of micropores were revealed by the X-ray diffraction tomography . Key findings demonstrated that the number, volume, size, and roundness of micropores in rolled alloys decreased similarly with increasing loads, eventually achieving a density of over 99.9\%. After the heat treatment, the homogeneous distribution of fine (around 5.3 μm) and spherical (0.70–0.74) micropores was realized in the 45 kN rolled alloys. All the evaluated indicators of micropores in the 45 kN rolled + heat treated alloys were superior to the post-deposition heat treated state. The evolution mechanisms include the reprecipitation of hydrogen pores, formation of vacant voids, and re-opening of unclosed pores. The hybrid technique of WAAM + rolling + heat treatment has great potential in promoting mechanical properties of WAAM alloys. The results will provide a theoretical guidance for the design of high-performance WAAM aluminum alloy components.},

Since the two mechanisms were previously investigated using very different solute sets, hitherto there is no clear understanding of the relation between them. Based on the newly proposed descriptors for the mechanisms, high-throughput calculations are performed for 63 solutes. Our results confirm that the two mechanisms are strongly correlated. In most of the cases, the same solute has the same effect on the deformation through both mechanisms.},

At a lower gas flow rate, the absorption of residual water and scattering of aerosol particles on laser beam caused UWLD instability and decreased molten metal wettability. Upon increasing the gas flow rate, the aerosol particle density decreased, increasing the laser density and decreasing the cooling rate of molten metal; thus, the height and deposition angle of UWLD track decreased as the corresponding width and fusion depth increased. The microstructures of the deposited metal at a gas flow rate of 10 L/min were composed of the coarse lath α phase in upper region and the acicular martensite α′ with different size scales in middle and bottom regions. With increasing the gas flow rate to 20 L/min, the microstructure was primarily acicular martensite along with a small amount of α phase, and the martensite exhibited a larger grain size and stronger texture.

In addition to the WC-Co substrate pillars, new composite pillar combination consisting of substrate, TiN interlayer and carbonitride hard coating were tested. The study targeted to document and analyze interactions between different phases and components (substrate, interlayer and coating) while subjected to compressive stress . It is found that deformation of the substrate depends mainly on the assemblage and the distribution of WC and Co phases within the pillar. The phase assemblage is subjected to changes after deformation which has an impact on the stiffness. Detailed analysis of plastic deformation within WC coarse grains pointed out that strain energy can be extensively dissipated in this phase by means of single and multiple slip. The composite/hybrid pillar formed by association of the substrate and the coating enhanced the ultimate strength in comparison to their respective individual components, highlighting the effective load-bearing response of coating and substrate acting as a coated system. This assessment was further supported by the excellent interfacial strength attested by the established TiN interlayer between the substrate and the coating.},

The results show that isothermal ω forms at about 398 K and above, and the growth of isothermal ω is accompanied by a rejection of solute atoms from ω into β. The composition partitioning increases internal elastic strain energy and hydrostatic pressure resulting from the coherency of isothermal ω phase in β. Moreover, the isothermal ω phase becomes hard and even undeformable due to composition partitioning based on first-principles calculations. It is suggested that the internal elastic strain stabilizes the β phase , which suppresses {332} deformation twinning and leads to dislocation glide and stress-induced ω phase transformation in the alloy aged at low temperature. And the embrittlement of the alloy aged at high temperature is thought to arise from undeformability of isothermal ω phase.},

Besides using the conventional cross-sectioned microstructure image, the real-time synchrotron radiation imaging and synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique was also used to investigate the microstructure, focusing on the in-situ growth behaviour of the primary (Cu,Ni) 6 Sn 5 intermetallic and elemental distribution that had occurred in the Sn-0.7Cu-0.05Ni-1.5Bi. Other essential properties of solder material, such as wettability, electrical resistance, and shear strength , were also determined.

Additionally, the addition of 1.5 wt\% Bi resulted with a 3\% reduction of its electrical resistance while increasing the wettability of the solder alloy. 1.5 wt\% addition of the Bi element also found to have contributed to a significant increment of shear strength relative to that of the Sn-0.7Cu-0.05Ni.

  abstract     = {This study evaluates the heat treatment effects on microstructural and mechanical properties of A357 alloy. Solution treatments performed at 540 °C for 6, 8, and 10 h represent identical microstructures and show that the eutectic phase is partially dissolved into the matrix, resulting in Si particles of similar shape and size. Contrarily, heat treatment parameters influence Mg 2 Si precipitates length rather considerably; 8 h solution treated-peak aged condition produces the smallest sized needle-shaped βʺ precipitates and contributes principally in the achievement of higher ductility. It is identified that over-aging not only enhances the length of the precipitates; however, it also causes the partial transformation of needle-shaped βʺ into rod type βʹ precipitates. This phenomenon is the core reason for the reduction in hardness and ductility simultaneously, while enhancement in strength characteristics slightly upon over-aging. Entropy values of differential scanning calorimetry thermograms and calculated dimples diameter of fractured surfaces are fairly aligned with mechanical properties and agree with microstructural characterizations of nano-sized precipitates analyses. Developed relationships among precipitates size (length), ductility, and quality index indicate that precipitation mechanism does not merely contribute to the achievement of superior strength properties; nevertheless, it also plays a crucial role in determining the ductility of A357 cast alloy .},

It was found that the EARA tremendously promoted the recrystallization behavior of the cold rolled alloy, leading to the grain refinement and texture weakening. Besides, the following EAA accelerated the coarsening of the strengthening δ′ phase. As a result, there was a remarkable improvement in strength and ductility, among which the increase in strength was mainly due to the combined effect of precipitation of δ′ phase and grain refinement, while the increase in elongation was mainly attributed to the grain refinement and texture modification. The rapid recrystallization during EARA was substantially attributed to the promotion effect of electropulsing on dislocation climb , which further resulted from not only the higher diffusion coefficient of vacancies under the application of electropulsing but also the another diffusion flux of vacancies induced by electro-migration.},

The method introduced here converts dispersed oxide particles to a gaseous reactant using reduction, such that independent stages of pore formation and expansion can be achieved by using more than one oxide chemistry. This is demonstrated using silver and copper oxides distributed within a silver matrix. As the temperature is raised, the silver oxide reduces first and creates porosity. As the temperature is raised further, the copper oxide reduces and creates additional porosity. This allows the pore morphology and grain size to be uniquely controlled while still maintaining the simplicity and scalability of the process. The microstructural development is studied through a combination of isothermal annealing , optical dilatometry , and focused ion beam cross-sectioning, and implications and strategies for other alloy systems are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The influence of Eu additions upon the silicon phase and mechanical properties of Al-40Zn-6Si alloys have been investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). The primary Si was discovered to be remarkably refined and modified to nodular with 0.5\% Eu addition. Meanwhile, the plate-like eutectic Si was modified to a fibrous structure . The effect of Eu on nodular primary Si was clarified from five aspects: (a) the adsorption of single Eu atomic column at the twin boundary, inducing stacking faults and parallel twins, (b) the adsorption of single Eu atomic column and triangle-like Eu-rich clusters at the junction of Si twins, inducing multiple twins, (c) the adsorption of Eu linear distribution along the twin boundary, inducing poisoning of twin plane re-entrant edge (TPRE), (d) the adsorption of Eu linear distribution at special grain boundary ∑9 twin, reducing the lattice distortion and grain boundary energy, (e) the solute entrainment within Si. These results prove that the widely accepted impurity induced twinning (IIT) and poisoning of TPRE mechanisms are valid for nodular primary Si. By addition of 0.5\%Eu, the ultimate tensile strength and elongation were enhanced by 31\% and 358\% respectively.},

  abstract     = {Silicones have desirable properties such as skin-safety, high temperature-resistance, and flexibility. Many applications require the presence of a hard body connected to the silicone. Traditionally, it has been difficult to create strong bonding between silicones and hard materials. In this study, a technique is presented to control the bonding strength between silicones and thermoplastics through mechanical interlocking. This is realized through a hybrid fabrication method where silicone is cast onto a 3D-printed mold and interlocking structure. The influence of the structure&#39;s design parameters on the bonding strength is explored through theoretical modeling and physical testing, while the manufacturability of the 3D-printed structure is ensured. A CAD tool is developed to automatically apply the interlocking structure to product surfaces. The user interface visualizes the theoretical strength of the cells as the designer adjusts the cell parameters, allowing the designer to iteratively optimize the structure to the product&#39;s load case. The bonding strength of the presented mechanical interlocking structure is more than 5.5 times higher than can be achieved with a commercially available primer. The presented technique enables custom digital design and manufacturing of durable free-form parts. This is demonstrated through application of the technique in over-molded products, airtight seals, and soft pneumatic actuators.},

However, preparing plant oil-based vitrimers with high glass transition temperatures (T g ) and strength remains challenging. A novel and fully bio-based vitrimer with a T g above room temperature was synthesized from ESO and a rosin derivative-fumaropimaric acid (FPA) and exhibited excellent self-healing, shape memory, and reprocessing due to the presence of dynamic covalent bond exchange. The fully bio-based ESO-FPA vitrimer exhibited a T g of 65 °C and a tensile strength of 16 MPa, which resulted from the rigid structure and tricarboxylic groups of FPA. The effect of transesterification reactions on the network structure was confirmed through stress relaxation. Our work expands the applications of commercial ESO in vitrimer materials and provides a novel approach to prepare bio-based vitrimers with desirable properties.},

Several configurations, parameterized by varying the fold angle, were mechanically tested under compression and impact loads . It was found that the specific elastic compression modulus of these novel designs was higher, ranging from 594 MPa/kg to 926 MPa/kg, than existing origami-inspired structures made based on the popular Ron-Resch design, which had specific elastic compression moduli between 15 MPa/kg to 365 MPa/kg. A finite element model further analysed the stress distribution of the core structures under compression loads. The impact testing results showed that the pattern of the tessellated cores affected the amount of impact force transferred through the samples, whereas the fold angle of the origami-inspired design had little impact on the results. The rectangular structure was shown to transfer approximately 50–75\% of the force transferred by the triangular structure under impact loads.},

First, the mechanical properties are addressed – as a function of surface-type, orientation, and size. Our results show systematic strengthening and a drastic drop in ductility as the material section is reduced. These changes are rationalised and linked to changes in microstructure, chemistry, and surface quality. Strengthening is due to combined changes in α-lath thickness, oxygen enrichment , and prior-β grain size. The microstructural changes are due to the differences in the ratio between contouring and hatching laser strategies as the sample size decreases. Changes in the chemical composition is due to an increase in the surface-to-volume ratio as the sample size decreases. Lost of ductility is due to poor surface quality – smaller sections show rougher surfaces – and grain orientations. Finally, these findings are used to develop a set of conceptual design maps of strength and ductility as a function of the component type, thickness, and orientation.},

As a typical 3D auxetic material, 3D cross-chiral structures (CCS) possesses significant auxetic behavior and the mechanical properties can be tuned over a wide range. In this paper, mechanical responses of CCS are systematically investigated by experiments, numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Three typical failure modes are observed during the compression process . As the tilt angle of struts increases, the CCS shows a transition from the compression-dominated to the bending-dominated deformation mechanism . The Young&#39;s modulus of the CCS can be enhanced 8.5 times, simply by changing the angle of the strut by 20°. The CCS can also show a higher energy absorption capacity with absorption efficiency of about 50\%, which is higher than most previously reported cellular materials. Additionally, a new theoretical model based on large deformation theory is established to predict the plastic yield stress, and good agreement is obtained with the numerical simulations and experiments, which indicates that the present model can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimation. The results of this paper may be helpful for designing of energy absorbing devices and personal protection with 3D auxetic materials.},

The addition of TiC nanoparticles is found to improve the interdendritic feedability of liquid metal and as a result reduces the volume fraction of microporosity by two orders of magnitude compared to a conventionally cast Al–Cu alloy. This method, which is mechanistically associated with a pore-dominated process, acts to significantly improve the fatigue strength, fracture toughness and uniform elongation of the cast Al–Cu alloy to values which, to the best of our knowledge, represent the highest ever achieved for a cast aluminum alloy .},

WJ was decellularized and then electrospun with PCL to form a WJ/PCL scaffold. The results indicated that the WJ/PCL scaffold possessed appropriate mechanical properties , suitable biodegradation, excellent hydrophilicity , increased adherence rate, low immunological reactivity, and good biocompatibility when compared with pure WJ or pure PCL scaffolds. Importantly, the WJ/PCL scaffold showed chondroconductive capabilities with ASC in vitro culture for 4 weeks.

Furthermore, relevant key factors are weighted by an in-house Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to define the most promising design options to be implemented in two plants belonging to the EII sector. For the ceramic sector, the design resulted in a shell-and-tube system with 1188 kg of a PCM melting at 885 °C and encapsulated in double concentric tubes, involving a storage capacity of 227 MJ. Similarly, 1606 kg of PCM, whose phase-change temperature is 509 °C, is selected for the steel sector providing a PCM-TES system capable to store 420 MJ.},

  abstract     = {Despite magnesium limited formability at room temperature, split sleeve hole cold expansion of AZ31B sheet was successfully implemented. Microstructural analysis showed greater hardness in the immediate vicinity of the notch, which was due to high dislocation density and extensive twinning created because of substantial compressive radial strain during the process. Contribution of twinning in accommodating the tensile tangential strain is believed to be the underlying reason why the sheet endured large plastic strains. Residual stress measurements confirmed variations through the thickness, with the highest value being at the exit side of the sheet. The fatigue performance of cold expanded samples revealed that different degrees of cold expansion result in various levels of life enhancement. Optimum degree of expansion was found to be 5\%, which leads to 3 times fatigue life improvement compared to the as-received condition, due to the imposed microstructural changes, including developed compressive residual tangential stresses and the greater hardness at the notch root . Abovementioned factors contribute to enhancement of fatigue life through postponing the crack initiation and impeding the crack propagation .},

  abstract     = {Refilled friction stir spot welding is proposed to replace friction stir spot welding to solve the problem of keyhole in joining of light metals. However, it is rather challenging to ensure the mechanical property of refilled friction stir spot welding joints because of hook defect. In this study, a novel method was proposed to use graphene nanosheets to strengthen the tip of hook defect and improve overall mechanical properties of joint. The joints of AA2014 aluminum alloy with 0.6\%wt graphene nanosheets were fabricated by refilled friction stir spot welding. The results show that the tensile/shear strength of joint increases by 31\% and the fracture toughness also is improved by nearly 20\% with graphene nanosheets. Extension in fatigue life was achieved on joint with graphene nanosheets. Microstructural observations, fracture characteristics and electron back scattered diffraction analysis were systematically investigated to clarify the mechanism for improvement of strength and toughness. The synergetic effect including grain refinement, load transfer, dislocation strengthening and crack bridging, caused by graphene nanosheets, leads to hardening behavior of graphene nanosheets pinned zone and a significant crack deflection during fracture process, which contributes greatly to improving strength and toughness of joint.},

Our model system, MoN/TaN, combines materials well-known for their high ductility as well as a strong driving force for vacancies. In this work, we reveal and interpret peculiar structure-stability-elasticity relations for MoN/TaN combining modelling and experimental approaches. Chemistry of the most stable structural variants depending on various deposition conditions is predicted by Density Functional Theory calculations using the concept of chemical potential. Importantly, no stability region exists for the defect-free superlattice. The X-ray Diffraction and Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy experiments show that MoN/TaN superlattices consist of distorted fcc building blocks and contain non-metallic vacancies in MoN layers, which perfectly agrees with our theoretical model for these particular deposition conditions. The vibrational spectra analysis together with the close overlap between the experimental indentation modulus and the calculated Young&#39;s modulus points towards MoN 0.5 /TaN as the most likely chemistry of our coatings.},

Electrospinning&#39;s fast solvent evaporation is able to induce in liquid NBR/PCL pairs thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) structure that holds stable over time without any further processing. The slight relative solubility of the polymers pair promotes a homogeneous blend formation with low T g regions of blended NBR/PCL, avoiding phase separation. Such nanofibers show also a PCL-like crystal phase that is surprisingly higher than plain PCL nanofibrous counterpart and seemingly promoted by NBR/PCL interaction at molecular scale . The obtained nanofibrous-TPE morphology is reproducible, stable with time up to at least two years and is detected in a wide range of blend compositions (up to 80\%wt NBR). Such a morphology reflects in good mechanical properties , which are analysed with a fitting model taking into account nanofibrous structure. Its impressive fitting ability helps interpretation of tensile tests behavior, carried out via normalization of force data with respect to sample mass, highlighting the contribution of liquid rubber in improving both elastic modulus and properties at failure. Such rubbery nanofibers represent a cost-effective powerful tool for the production of advanced self-damping composite materials with improved overall mechanical properties.},

  abstract     = {Biosynthetic production of vanillin via microbial biotransformation offers a low-cost alternative for manufacturers to meet the consumer demands for natural vanillin. However, identifying the high vanillin-producing microbial strains among multitudinous samples using the current analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectroscopy (MS) is time consuming, cumbersome and costly. Here, we propose an alternative low-cost and rapid aptamer-based capacitive assay for sensitive and selective vanillin recognition based on the preferential binding affinity and stability of the aptamer-vanillin complex. This redox-free approach measures the changes in non-faradaic capacitance of transducing graphene-oxide (GO) activated gold electrodes immobilized with vanillin-specific aptamer. Aptamer-vanillin interaction on the GO surface alters the aptamer conformation causing surface charge redistribution detected via capacitance-frequency characteristics. The aptasensor showed a wide dynamic detection range of 10 pM-10 nM and a low limit of detection (LOD) of ~9.91 pM, which is the best reported so far. Finally, validation of the capacitive aptasensing against high-performance LC (HPLC) reference containing vanillin dissolved in a complex M9 medium with interfering compounds (ferulic acid and glycerol), to mimic typical microbial biotransformation, demonstrated good sensitivity and selectivity. The successful proof-of-concept can be translated to high-throughput electronic multi-analyte screening kits supplementary to existing analytical tools.},

In present work, several novel multilayered diamond/β-SiC composite architectures were deposited on cemented tungsten carbide substrates by hot filament chemical vapor deposition. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) observation reveals periodic multilayered configurations with diamond/β-SiC composite layers and microcrystalline diamond (MCD) or nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) layers. Moreover, Rockwell indentation, scratch and nano-indentation tests indicate that multilayered diamond/β-SiC composite and MCD coating possess not only good adhesion (52.9 ± 0.5 N) and crack propagation resistance, but also high hardness (83.6 ± 3.5 GPa) and modulus (856.1 ± 87.5 GPa) among all as-deposited coatings. For this configuration, the hardness of the coating is inherited from the MCD layer, while the low residual stress, enhanced adhesion and crack propagation resistance are due to the composite coating and multilayer architecture. Thus, the mechanical properties of diamond coating are improved by the innovative diamond/β-SiC composite multilayer, which provides a potential approach for high-performance diamond coated cutting tools.},

Hence, the combination of multiple components or hierarchies from natural source through a facile method may stand out as a forerunner to materials design and application. Inspired from metalloprotein, this study reported an organic-metal biosystem based on chromium (III) complexed collagen fibrous matrix (Cr-CFM). The obtained Cr-CFM retains inherent conformation of collagen and its fiber morphology in the skin. Compared with pristine CFM, Cr-CFM showed enhanced waterproofness and breathability . Due to coexistence of hydrogen bonds and newly introduced chromium (III) complexing linkages, Cr-CFM exhibited water-adaptive mechanical property. In this organic-metal biosystem, hydrogen bonds show reversible cleavage-reformation under water interference while chromium (III) complexing linkages remains stable. Such combination of “switch” and “netpoint” facilitated water responsive shape memory ability of Cr-CFM with shape fixation and recovery reaching over 80\%. The reveal of relationship between structure and coalesced properties of Cr-CFM herein is believed to promote progress of smart protein materials and give inspirations to synthetic polymers.},

Detailed TEM characterisation of resulting nanoscale precipitates after AC, or Water Quenching (WQ), and subsequent artificial ageing demonstrate that η′ and η 2 hardening precipitates dominate in T6, whereas the overaged T7 state contains η 2 and η 1 , where the latter accounts for approximately 50\% of the relative phase fraction.

Two phases with high aspect ratios were nucleated on dislocations: The C phase and a previously reported phase, which we named here the ‘E phase’. The crystal structure of E was solved experimentally as monoclinic with core composition Mg 6 Al 2 Si 2 Cu 4 , supported by density functional theory calculations. It was determined that the order of pre-deformation and natural ageing had an influence on the relative fractions of the aforementioned phases formed during artificial ageing.

Optical metallographic and electron backscattered diffraction analysis results demonstrated that beam oscillation could achieve the transformation of solidification microstructure from oriented dendrite grain to equiaxed dendrite grain. Further, the application of beam oscillation might retard solidification cooling speed and strengthen the formation of γ γ -fiber texture that is conducive to the improvement of ductility. According to the acquisition of dynamic feature pictures with high-speed camera, the local rapid movement of laser spot resulted in a more stable keyhole without fluctuation and the intensification of melt flow. Temperature curves calculated by finite element method simulation showed that lateral laser oscillation made the temperature distribution of molten metals nearby the center of weld more uniform even negative temperature gradient.

Corrosion behavior, mechanical integrity and fatigue behavior in two corrosive electrolytes of these two alloys were investigated. The results revealed a better short-term corrosion property for Mg0.5Zn0.2Ge alloy, but an improved long-term corrosion resistance for Mg0.5Zn0.2Ca alloy, resulting from the different protective abilities of surface layers and microstructures of the alloys. Although Mg0.5Zn0.2Ca alloy presented relatively lower strength owing to the weaker texture, it owned better mechanical integrity than Mg0.5Zn0.2Ge alloy due to the more uniform corrosion in salt spray, indicating the significant effect of localized corrosion on mechanical integrity of materials. Furthermore, the corrosion of the alloys in electrolytes decreased the fatigue resistance for both alloys, but Mg0.5Zn0.2Ca showed higher sensitivity to corrosive environments under cyclic loading. The comprehensive studies of these two alloys highlight the interactions between corrosion and mechanical integrity and/or fatigue behavior of materials and suggest the importance of the investigation of the overall properties when new Mg alloys are developed and evaluated for practical applications.},

The aim is to systematically unravel the strengthening via the addition of ‘modern’ microalloying elements Mo versus Cr besides Nb. These elements have been proposed to provide significant additional strengthening during such processing but the mechanisms yet remain unknown. Therefore, three model Fe-1.6Mn-0.04C-0.1Nb+0.5Mo/Cr steels were warm-rolled at ∼600 °C with an overall reduction of 50\% followed by ageing. It was found that Mo leads to an increase in hardness of ∼20\% compared to the base alloy, whereas Cr provides only a minor hardening increment. SEM, EBSD, TEM and atom probe were used to reveal the beneficial effect of Mo versus Cr. It was found that Mo is more effective delaying dislocation recovery. We also report that Mo partitions into nanoscale Nb–C solute clusters and precipitates of NbC and Fe 3 C during ageing, retarding the coarsening of these phases. However, Cr was found to partition into Fe 3 C only, and does not contribute to the nature of the dispersion of clusters and NbC.},

The average diameter of the optimal CS-TP nanoparticles was 205 ± 14 nm, and encapsulation efficiency of 66.7\% ± 9.9\% was achieved. The effects of CS-TP nanoparticles on the physicochemical properties of the GEL/CS-TP composite films were studied. Our results showed that the combination of CS-TP and grass carp gelatin (GEL) can not only weaken the strong interaction between GEL and TP, but also improved the swelling and mechanical properties of GEL. Furthermore, GEL/CS-TP30\% composite film showed strong barrier and good mechanical properties, low UV transmission, exhibited high free radical-scavenging ability and prolonged the stability of an easily oxidizable oil for over 14 days, making it a suitable film for use as an edible packaging material.},

The results in vitro demonstrated that the magnetic scaffolds not only stimulated cell adhesion and viability, but also enhanced proliferation rate and alkaline phosphatase activity. Meanwhile, the compressive strength and modulus were increased by 81.9\% and 71.6\%, respectively, which were determined by the rigid enhancement effect of MNPs. Moreover, the magnetic scaffolds were implanted into rabbit radius bone defect in vivo , and the results indicated that the magnetic scaffolds significantly induced substantial blood vessel tissue, fibrous tissue and new bone tissue formation at 2 months post-implantation, revealing the excellent bone regeneration capability.

In particular, it is widely used to produce tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds. The diameter of the electrospun fibers strongly affects the achievable resolution and consequently influences several other physical and mechanical properties of the fabricated scaffolds . However, compared to general extrusion-based additive manufacturing (E-AM) techniques, the factors influencing the size of the fibers are more complex owing to the presence of the electric field. In this study, several critical and effective process parameters in the MEW process are first investigated and then optimized to achieve the desired fiber diameter . Moreover, the fiber placement accuracy, which is essential for fabricating heterogeneous scaffolds with highly accurate features, is studied by considering the “lag effect” due to relative movement between the collector and the spinneret . In addition, an optimization strategy is proposed to avoid the error introduced by the “lag effect” while achieving the desired fiber diameter. This strategy can be used to adaptively control the process parameters. Finally, the proposed approach is validated and adopted for fabricating heterogeneous scaffolds to culture cells.},

  abstract     = {Identifying the properties of the bond strength between aggregates and asphalt binders is critical to understand the strength and fracture behavior of asphalt mixture . Some efforts have been made on the effect of aging on the bonding property of the asphalt binder. However, there is no consensus result and the mechanism that drives the change of bonding property remains unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the influence of aging on the bonding property, and to explain the reason lies behind. To achieve this goal, four neat asphalt binders were treated with short-term aging and long-term aging. The bond strength and the adhesion force were measured by binder bond strength test on a macro scale and atomic force microscope on a micro scale , respectively. Based on the result obtained in this study and previous publications along with the adhesion theories, it is found that a moderate aging contributes to the bond strength while a sever aging does not necessarily improve the bond strength. The change of bond strength under an aging condition can be explained by the cohesion force in asphalt binders and the adhesion force between asphalt binders and aggregates. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the cohesion force increases with aging time as a result of asphaltenes association. The adhesion force increases initially and then decreases, and the wettability is thought to be responsible for the reduction of adhesion force. The adhesion reduction can be observed on the three phases (catana phase, peri phase, para phase) of the asphalt binders, which leads to the adhesion reduction on the whole asphalt binders. These findings help to provide a better understanding of the change of bonding property of asphalt binders during an aging process, which contributes to the improvement of bond strength by enhancing the wettability of each phase in asphalt binders appropriately. The results have practical significance and can help to optimize the materials production process.},

However, the phase transformation behavior between a parent grain and synthesized ligaments surrounded by penetrating liquid metal channels remains unknown, despite its importance on the final physical properties. In this study, the temperature effect on the transformation mechanisms during the LMD process is investigated. At a low temperature of 600 °C, a fcc grain of (FeCo) x Ni 100− x precursors transforms to bcc FeCo ligaments by following unique orientation relationships (ORs), which differ from the well-known ORs like Bain, Kurdjumov-Sachs and Nishiyama-Wassermann. A few select variants are generated in the proposed ORs, and the formation of coincident site lattice boundaries is shown to play a crucial role in the variant selection to reduce the internal energy of the initial nanostructure . However, at a higher temperature of 800 °C, the crystal orientation of ligaments prefers to align in the direction, which is parallel to the flow direction of Mg melt, owing to a strong interaction between the melt and ligaments. Ligaments are elongated along with the fiber texture, and this transformation behavior is irrelevant to the parent orientation.},

For metacomposites composed of vertically arranged microwires, for both 1 mm and 0.5 mm spacing, the permittivity turned to negative in certain frequency bands. The simultaneous existence of short periodic curved length and spacing benefits the broadening of frequency band under which metacomposites exhibits single-negative behavior.

It then recommends a process for fabrication of the nanotexture. Based on the model, its thermal stability is assessed via molecular dynamics simulations. The nanotexture may experience out-of-plane fold or in-plane shrinkage at different temperatures due to the three factors including bending of the ribbons, relative sliding between the ribbons at their overlapping areas, and strong van der Waals forces between the GRs. In addition to the global deformation of the nanotexture, it has experienced local deformation at pores which depends on the chirality and gaps of the GRs. For a nanotexture formed from armchair GRs, it is relaxed to be a quasi-periodic porous medium with similar pore size. The mechanism is that the armchair GRs have non-smooth edges, and are locked at their contact areas in relative sliding. In water, the in-plane shrunk nanotexture does not expand to be a plate even at 500 K. However, in argon, it expands to be a plate with periodic hexagon pores.

The energy band structure and density of states calculations suggest that LiGaOS is an insulator with a wide indirect band gap of ∼5.44 eV. The CI-NEB calculations reveal that the “kick-off” collective migration via Li-interstitials is the dominant conduction mechanism for Li-transport, with an extremely low energy barrier of 0.05 eV. The corresponding Li-ion self-diffusion coefficient estimated by transition state theory is in the order of magnitude of 10 −3 cm 2 /s at room temperature, with the dominant charge carrier being Li-interstitial.

  abstract     = {The layered oxyselenide BiCuSeO was recently discovered to be a promising high thermoelectric material due to its intrinsically low thermal conductivity . However, the rather high electrical resistivity of undoped BiCuSeO may preclude its potential thermoelectric applications. Herein, we achieved enhanced thermoelectric performance in rare-earth Sm-doped BiCuSeO by the band structure engineering. The replacement of Bi 3+ by Sm 3+ leads to the improvement of electrical conductivity , from 34 S cm −1 for pristine BiCuSeO to 79 S cm −1 for that of Bi 0.94 Sm 0.06 CuSeO at 873 K. Coupled with the large Seebeck coefficient (251 μVK −1 ) and relatively low thermal conductivity (0.58 Wm −1 K −1 ), the figure of merit ZT is significantly increased from 0.49 for pristine BiCuSeO to 0.74 for Bi 0.94 Sm 0.06 CuSeO at 873 K. According to the first-principles calculation, the enhanced thermoelectric properties was ascribed to the decreased band gap by the substitution of Sm. Upon 10\%Sm substitution, the band gap of BiCuSeO decreases from 0.50 eV to 0.34 eV, which promotes the density of states near the Fermi level . The present study suggests that rare-earth element can be effective in modifying the band structure of BiCuSeO and thus improving its electronic transport properties.},

  abstract     = {Compliant machining processes, such as bonnet polishing, can be used on hard and brittle ceramic materials such as alumina and silicon carbide, to produce ultra-precise surfaces with sub-micron form accuracy and nanometric surface roughness . However, a comprehensive understanding of the removal mechanism in such process is lacking. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed that is based on the existence of “three zones” in compliant machining process, namely elastic recovery , plastic removal and brittle fracture . The inherent relationships of the three critical pressures with actual pressure, due to compression of the elastic bonnet tool and asperity effect, are established and analyzed in association with different material removal behaviors. Analysis indicates that pad asperity plays an important role in material removal and that lower material hardness combined with higher tensile strength contributes to enlarged plastic removal zone, and thus higher manufacturability. Removal footprints and polishing tests were then generated to verify accurate prediction of the material removal rate under different conditions and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The microstructure and reinforcement mechanism of the CF/EP composite was further investigated. The results indicate that the Fe 3 O 4 @GO can increase the ILSS of the CF/EP composite by 12.9\%, and it can further enhance it to 41\% under the magnetic field orientation. Furthermore, it was observed that the oriented Fe 3 O 4 @GO can also improve the flexural strength and tensile strength of the CF/EP composite by 29.7\% and 40.9\%, respectively.

Microstructured electrode surfaces increase EET rate in bioelectrochemical systems, thus enabling higher sensibility and power output as well as the detection of bacteria and biofilms in bioelectrochemical sensors. However, many aspects of the EET process, particularly in early biofilm stages, are still poorly understood. We report a microstructured gold electrode maintained at oxidative potential to support the growth of Escherichia coli , measure the electrochemical output, and analyze the EET rate during early biofilm formation. The charge outputs of the modified electrodes are up to 22\% higher than the control electrodes, enabling the electrochemical detection of early E. coli biofilms. The electrode microstructures promote biofilm attachment, as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging. Following biofilm formation, the resistance to charge transfer at the biofilm-electrode interface decreases and the capacitance increases as shown by EIS analysis. Overall, these results contribute to the understanding of EET in early biofilms, towards developing sensitive bioelectrochemical sensors for biofilm detection.},

In this paper, a new type of Ag complex conductive ink modified by PVAc (poly vinyl acetate) was proposed to enhance the conductivity and foldability of rapidly sintered Ag patterns. The conductive ink was fabricated by mixing silver oxalate as Ag precursor, 1,2-Diaminopropane as complexing reagent, methanol and isopropanol as organic solvents , and a small amount of PVAc as binding agent. Compared to the Ag complex ink without PVAc, the modified ink shows a better sintered microstructure with higher flatness and density after fast sintering at 140 °C–200 °C for 2 min, indicating that the addition of PVAc has a positive effect on the stability of Ag nucleation and microstructure formation. A low resistivity of 5.17 μΩ cm and an improved foldable property can be achieved at 180 °C by sintering the PVAc modified Ag complex ink on PI (polyimide) substrate, which indicates that the proposed ink is promised to be applied in printed circuits and flexible electronics.},

Based on this threshold value, the grains were divided into fine and coarse grain sets. A good linear relationship was found between the fractal dimension of the fine grain set ( D g1 ) and the fraction of Σ3 gain boundaries (GBs) ( F Σ3 ). The distribution characteristics of the three types of GBs satisfy multifractal and generalized fractal characteristics. Importantly, the fractal structural parameters of the Σ3 GBs control the distribution characteristics and complexity of the total grain boundary network (GBN). Combined corrosion test, a quantitative relationship between the corrosion thickness loss and the Σ3 GBs fractal parameter as well as corrosion time was established. In the end, the optimal microstructure characteristics for improving the intergranular corrosion resistance of TWIP steel are discussed from the GB perspective.

The microstructural features and mechanical properties of the designed alloy, TC4F, are compared with other alloys in Ti–6Al–4V class by combining experimental characterizations and thermodynamic calculations . TC4F alloy not only maintains strength , hardness, and elongation similar to baseline TC4 but also exhibits improved fracture toughness comparable to TC4_ELI and even superior to TC4_DT under the heat-treated condition. It opens up a new cost-reducing way to enhance fracture toughness in place of controlling interstitial contents, showing potential in engineering applications . The discerned mechanisms indicate that the trace addition of Fe gives rise to composition redistribution between V and Fe in the β phase , boosts the lattice distortion and vibration, thereafter enhances Young&#39;s modulus and fracture toughness. It has been validated and verified by experiments, thermodynamic calculations, and Hahn-Rosenfield empirical research. The enhanced fracture toughness also benefits from the kinked β+α lamellar microstructure at crack tip as well as the improved fracture surface due to the Fe addition. The enlarged plastic zone, redirected crack propagation , and more dimples with even-distributed size additionally contribute to the improvement of fracture toughness.},

[Acta Materialia, 2010, 58: 2155–2164]. Our recent experiments of degenerate seaweed in directional solidification of an Al-4.5 wt\% Cu alloy by employing (100)[011] orientated planar-front seeds motivate this work. We found that the way of symmetrical columnar dendrites impinging is the lateral movement of the grain boundary by adjusting the dendritic primary spacing. The elimination rate of degenerate seaweed at the converging grain boundary increases rapidly as the misorientation angle is increased. This can be explained by the increase of the lateral component of the real tilted dendritic direction with the increase of misorientation angle. This proves the finding from our experiments. Predicted results also show that the degenerate seaweed can overgrow the tilted dendrite at the diverging grain boundary. This is not consistent with experimental results. Moreover, our results show that grain boundary angles at the two grain boundary angles increase with the misorientation angle increasing.},

Instead of using Ti sheets, pure Ti powder was initially deposited on steel plates using cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM). Then well bonded Ti/steel clad plates were obtained through hot-rolling and annealing operations. The mechanical properties of the clad plates at different processing stages were evaluated by performing a series of tensile tests and shear tests. It was revealed that the Ti/steel clad plates had excellent shear strength (280 Mpa), ultimate tensile strength (UTS, 564 Mpa) and decent elongation (EL, 18\%). Microstructural investigation of the specimens was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was revealed that cold spraying offers good pre-bonding of Ti with the steel plate thereby suppressing cracking and oxidation at the interface. Hot-rolling treatment repaired the pores/defects in the as-sprayed Ti coating and resulted in metallurgical bonding between Ti particles as well as Ti/steel interface, which remarkably improved the strength of the material. High dislocation density in the clad plates were further eliminated by the annealing treatment through recovery, recrystallization and grain growth mechanisms, which greatly improved the toughness of the samples.},

To understand these properties, it&#39;s necessary to characterize the chemical ordering and identify order-disorder transitions through efficient simulation and modeling of thermodynamics. In this study, a robust data-driven framework based on Bayesian approaches is proposed for the accurate and efficient prediction of configurational energy of high entropy alloys. The recently proposed effective pair interaction (EPI) model with ensemble sampling is used to map the configuration and its corresponding energy. Given limited data calculated by first-principles calculations, Bayesian regularized regression not only offers an accurate and stable prediction but also effectively quantifies the uncertainties associated with EPI parameters. Compared with the arbitrary truncation of model complexity, we further conduct a physical feature selection to identify the truncation of coordination shells in EPI model using Bayesian information criterion. The results achieve efficient and robust performance in predicting the configurational energy, particularly given small data. The developed methodology is applied to study a series of refractory HEAs, i.e. NbMoTaW, NbMoTaWV and NbMoTaWTi where it is demonstrated how dataset size affects the confidence when data is sparse.},

The in-situ synthesized nanoscale TiB w or TiC p ceramic reinforcements, exhibiting a quasi-continuous (TMC1) or full-continuous structure (TMC2), could play a prominent role in determining the microstructure refinement and mechanical properties of the composites. Results indicate that the SLM-processed nanocomposites exhibit a maximum increase of 45\% of Vickers microhardness and 26\% of ultimate compressive strength over the Ti-64 alloy. The enhancement of mechanical properties is mainly attributed to the second-phase strengthening, grain refinement strengthening as well as solid solution strengthening induced by the interstitial carbon in Ti matrix.

Numerical simulated results have been well validated by experimental measured data. Owing to the inherent motion mechanism of LFW, interfacial heat flow varied with time periodically, resulting in the periodic evolution of interface temperature. The distribution of stress field at stationary side alternated dynamically with respect to that at oscillatory side. During LFW of GH4169 to FGH96 superalloys, more heat flowed into the GH4169 superalloy, which resulted in greater temperature gradient than that at side of FGH96 superalloy. More softened materials were extruded out from interface at GH4169 side owing to their better flow property.

  abstract     = {Biological materials that are composed of hierarchical microstructures embedded in a matrix material can display enhanced mechanical or material properties compared to an unstructured mixture of the same constituent materials. In this work, ultrasound directed self-assembly was integrated with 3D printing (direct-write (DW)) in a new manufacturing process called “ultrasound DW”, to enable the fabrication of engineered materials with properties mimicking those of natural materials. This process allows 3D printing feedstock that consists of a liquid photopolymer resin with dispersed microfibers , and enables fabricating materials with lines of aligned carbon microfibers. The effect of the ultrasound operating frequency and print speed on the alignment of the fibers, distance between adjacent lines of aligned fibers, as well as the resulting electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of the samples were evaluated. The results showed that the lines of aligned fibers in the material samples display statistically significant differences in terms of the distance between the adjacent lines of aligned fibers when looking at the factors of the ultrasound operating frequency and the print speed. The lines of aligned fibers form local percolated networks resulting in electrically conductive areas. The ultrasound DW process allows the fabrication of materials with integrated substructures that tune specific material properties.},

  abstract     = {Magnetic properties in iron oxide nanorods , which have many applications in biomedicine, catalysts, and magnetic resonance imaging, depend on their manufacturing processes and phase structures. Although various structures on iron oxide have been reported, there is a lack of understanding of the property-phase relationship for iron oxide nanorods. Herein, we report an economical route to synthesize iron oxide nanorods with alterable phases including akaganeite (β-FeOOH), hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 ), maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3 ), and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). Detailed analysis of the synthesis methods , phase structures and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanorods identified the relationship between the phase structure and the magnetic properties. The findings reported in this paper show that the excellent tunability of magnetism in iron oxide nanorods will pave the way for selecting the best manufacturing process to meet the desired properties of specific applications such as carriers in biomedicine, magnetic recording materials, gas sensors and catalysts applications.},

  abstract     = {Mechanical properties of synthesized sodium silicate mineral, Na-kanemite, was investigated by synchrotron-based high-pressure x-ray diffraction experiment and first-principles calculations. Under hydrostatic pressure, the 020 interlayer peak was substantially diffused while a new 011 peak formed at 0.4 GPa due to the reduction of Pbcn symmetry. Upon unloading, the diffused interlayer peak reappeared to its original position with a less peak intensity and the newly formed peak disappeared. This temporal but reversible phase instability related to the symmetry reduction, can be induced from the vibration effect of water molecules contained in interlayer region that can more significantly affect the structural response of crystals with poor crystallinity and stacking disorder. There is a good agreement of pressure response between experimental data and calculations using GGA functional. In addition, conducted analysis on bond variation revealed that contraction of thickness and distortion of Na layer under pressure which caused partial charge redistribution. Suggested elastic properties and charge data will be used to develop reliable force-field database for further molecular dynamics simulation and diagnose macroscopic impact from alkali-silicate reaction damaged structure.},

Unfortunately, the strength and toughness are often mutually exclusive, and are therefore difficult to be enhanced simultaneously. Here, a bioinspired parallel-scan path is proposed to increase both the strength and toughness with in-plane isotropy . In this method, a Bouligand structure is adopted to increase the fracture deflection and energy absorption. Result shows that at the optimal rotational angle 15°, the ultimate strength and toughness can be improved over 12\% and 100\%, respectively, along with good in-plane isotropy. To investigate the mechanics of the improvement, the fracture surface is analyzed and the finite element (FE) simulation is performed. Our results suggest that the optimal mechanical properties can be obtained at a certain rotational angle by controlling the stress under a moderate level, and maximizing the fracture surface during its propagation. The method is simple and highly adaptive, and may offer a good mechanical reinforce capability in extrusion based 3d printing.},

This proposed method will have significant meaning in revealing the fracture mechanism of the bituminous materials since the traditional specimen sizes and the self-healing property of the asphalt hinder the further micro-scale investigations in this field. With the help of the pioneering designed tests, the damage variable based on the micro-crack density was proposed and was verified by the experimental results.

The addition of di-iodomethane (CH 2 I 2 ) alkyl-halide could enhance the PSC efficiency by retarding the crystallization and improving the surface morphology of the perovskite photoactive film through supplying iodine cleaved by ultraviolet energy during IPL process. The maximum efficiency and fill factor of the PSCs fabricated by IPL annealing were 12.56\% and 78.3\% for the rigid glass-FTO slides, and 7.6\% and 64.75\% for flexible PET-ITO substrates when processed in the ambient with relative humidity of 60\%, respectively. The annealed materials were characterized through Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–Vis, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. In addition, impedance spectroscopy (IS) and current-voltage measurements were conducted to study the functionality of fabricated cells.

The newly designed LIS was manufactured by infusing low-melting cocoa oil and efficient photothermal Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles into anodized aluminum oxide substrate. Upon irradiation with infrared light , the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles could absorb light energy and melt the solid lubricant into slippery liquid. The dual actions of surface heating and slipperiness of melted lubricant promoted the thawing of frost/ice and de-adhesion of ice block. Additionally, the durability of LIS was strengthened by the combination of the self-healing effect of the melted lubricant, and the robustness of the solid state. The hydrophobic lubricant diminished the lubricant loss during repeating freezing/unfreezing cycles and withstood longtime flowing water impact. The proposed concept of switchable hydrophobic/slippery lubricant will advance the design of durable LISs and provide a promising LIS platform for deicing application.},

  abstract     = {Incremental solidification (IS) of small batches of metal powders is a fundamental process in various additive-manufacturing (AM) and 3-D printing (3DP) operations. Here we show the feasibility of an IS process implemented by a compact, all-solid-state microwave applicator. In this compact scheme, the localized microwave-heating (LMH) process is conducted in a nitrogen shielding environment, and hence the microwave power is reduced to only ∼0.1 kW (compared to ∼1 kW in a previously reported magnetron-based IS process). This shielding prevents the plasma excitation (which intercepted most of the microwave power in the previous experiments in air atmosphere), and hence significantly improves the efficacy of the LMH-IS process. This paper introduces the compact LMH-AM concept, and its novel implementation by a transistor-based microwave system. Experimental and theoretical results of the LMH-AM process applied to bronze- and iron-based powders are presented. The powder is provided to the LMH interaction region in small batches, on demand. A contactless magnetic confinement is demonstrated for ferromagnetic powder batches. The experimental products obtained are tested, and their mechanical properties are evaluated. The potential applicability of the solid-state LMH technology to full AM and 3DP processes is discussed.},

To enhance mechanical disruption of oxide film on the steel, multilayer FSB (ML-FSB) process was proposed by adding a thin (3 mm thickness) and soft aluminum sheet as interlayer . The first FSB pass created bonding between the thin interlayer and steel substrate with 4.7 μm thick FeAl 3 without Zn residue, having 55 MPa shear strength . The second FSB pass created bonding between the thin interlayer and thick 5083Al clad with a diffusion zone with a little Zn, having 50 MPa shear strength. This work provided a new way to fabricate “thick clad” layered composite with “strong substrate”, and suggested that mechanical route for strong substrate and metallurgical route (eutectic reaction) for Al for removing oxide film should be preferential and available in FSB.},

Homogenous dispersion of the combined nanofillers in the CS matrix resulted in a remarkable enhancement in tensile strength , water resistance and surface hydrophobicity at low loadings. In addition, the tensile strength and surface hydrophobicity of CS–PAL–ZP ternary composites were higher than those of CS–PAL or CS–zein composites with the same amounts of individual filler. These results clearly confirmed the synergistic reinforcement of hydrophilic PAL and hydrophobic ZP in improving the various properties of CS-based composite.

  abstract     = {Multifunctional composites that combine high load-bearing properties and energy storage capacity have potential application in next-generation electric vehicles. The effect of high structural bending loads on the flexural properties and electrical energy storage capacity of sandwich composites containing lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries embedded within the polymer foam core is explored in this paper. Three-point bend tests which induce failure by plastic indentation or cracking of the core are performed on sandwich composites containing single or multiple LiPo batteries. The bending properties of the sandwich material are not changed significantly by embedding batteries within the core. The energy storage capacity of the sandwich composite can be increased by inserting multiple batteries without adversely affecting the bending properties. Furthermore, the internal electrical resistance and capacity of the batteries is not degraded when the sandwich composites are damaged by high bending loads. The implications of the results for the design of light-weight multifunctional sandwich composites with high energy storage capacity are discussed.},

The optimal CEF-NF/Ag/WPU film (0.183 mm) displays an ultra-high electrical conductivity of 11986.8 S/cm and a superior EMI-SE of 102.9 dB, which demonstrates the Ag deposition can effectively improve the electrical and EMI shielding performance. Compared with the film without an enhanced-pressing, the EMI-SE of a CEF-NF/Ag/WPU film with an enhanced-pressing showed an increase of about 37.5\%. The porous structure deposited with Ag particles coating endows this composite film with remarkable EMI-SE at a thin thickness and lightweight ( SSE t up to 5808.7 dB cm 2 g −1 ) which outperforms most works. At last, this CEF-NF/Ag/WPU film performs outstanding reliability after ultrasound treatment, bending test and thermal reliability test.

The algorithm was verified by establishing a groove model and used to characterize grooves of three different carbon fibers. The results show quantitative difference of average groove size of three carbon fibers. The distribution of groove size accords with the lognormal distribution , and the fitting degree is between 0.8 and 0.97.

The as-preapred SiMaC was characterized by SEM-EDS, TG-DSC, and BET. Various factors such as pH, m/V, time, and initial concentration of Sr(II) were studied. The maximum adsorption capacity towards Sr(II) was as high as 142.5 mg/g at 298 K. The adsorption equilibrium was almost obtained within 30 min. Moreover, SiMaC was easily and fastly regenerated by 0.1 M HCl and exhibited no obvious decrease in adsorption capacity after five times of successive adsorption-desorption cycles. Most attractively, the uptake rate of Sr(II) reached more than 99\% in real river and lake water mediums, as well as reached 76\% in real seawater mediums. Finally, XPS and FTIR were used to analyze the adsorption mechanism towards Sr(II).},

  abstract     = {Protein therapy gained a reputation of the most direct and safe approach for treating various diseases, yet biodegradation and loss of bioactivity of fragile therapeutic proteins limit their wide medical use. Recently, a new hard templating technology using decomposable mesoporous vaterite CaCO 3 crystals became extremely popular strategy for formulation of protein nano(micro)-vectors. This study deciphers how protein bioactivity depends on protein loading/release for this technology utilizing catalase as a promising antioxidant therapeutic agent. Catalase has been loaded into CaCO 3 using two approaches: i) passive - via adsorption (ADS) into pre-formed crystals and ii) active - via co-synthesis (COS) in the pH range 8–10. Crystal morphology, protein secondary structure and enzymatic bioactivity, and protein retention upon washing are assessed. The activity reduction (∼70\% for COS and ∼20\% for ADS) is caused by both protein exposure to an alkaline medium and protein aggregation induced by Ca 2+ . The aggregation significantly governs protein release kinetics. Catalase loading into the crystals is pH-independent and van der Waals interactions dominate over the electrostatics, while catalase activity strongly depends on pH. This study implicates the prime role of loading/release mechanism in the preservation of protein bioactivity and guide for the control over the retention of protein bioactivity.},

  abstract     = {The microprocess of brittle fracture in steel is suggested to occur because microcracks appearing in the brittle layer at the grain boundary propagate driven by increased piled-up dislocation. Thus, loading plastic deformation , equivalent to the increase in dislocation, is directly connected to the increase in brittle fracture risk. Because of these mechanisms, prestraining means approaching the limits of the material, which could lead to deterioration of fracture toughness . For a lifetime evaluation of steel structure, it is important to generalize the effect of various cyclic prestrains . In this paper, material toughness changes when tensile and compression prestrain occur were investigated. A general three-point bending test was employed to evaluate fracture. Synthetic analysis using Conventional Mechanism-based Strain Gradient Plasticity (CMSGP) theory, in which dislocation density is used to determine the amount of material damage, was carried out as well as employing conventional macroscopic material damage consideration rules. The consistency of the simulation and the experimental results were supported by the Electron Back Scattered Diffraction Pattern (EBSD) observation. Additionally, critical stress was calculated, and the change in critical stress for prestrain conditions was investigated. Then, the mechanism of critical stress changes could be expressed by the yield point increase and dislocation density.},

Although a number of treatment methods for tracheal reconstruction have been developed, reconstruction of critical sized defects (&gt;6 cm) is always a major challenge in trachea surgery. In the field of tissue engineering, reconstruction of tissues using artificial substitutes has shown promises in addressing this challenge, particularly with much success in tracheal reconstruction achieved by multiple institutions. The aim of this study is to develop an off-the-shelf treatment method that can be achieved without imposing cells even for urgent applications to tracheal disorders or injuries. We designed an off-the-shelf tracheal graft without imposing the cells for the concept of urgent transplantation from a porous PCL bellows framework that we developed in our previous works. We then evaluated the application of our off-the-shelf treatment method using an artificial graft in vivo at a proof-of-concept level using a rabbit model. We successfully demonstrated the potential of an off-the-shelf tracheal graft with luminal collagen stratification for immediate application in emergencies that require an artificial graft.},

The microstructural, mechanical and thermal insulation properties of the composites were investigated, and the effect of the BN content on the microstructure and properties was also clarified. The results indicate that the obtained mesoporous composites exhibit low thermal conductivity (0.04–0.20 Wm −1 K −1 ) and high-temperature resistance (∼1300 °C). As the BN content increased from 0 to 15 vol\%, the compressive strength of the composites increased from 2.2 to 20.3 MPa.

Isothermal sections of the Al-Cu-Fe system at 700, 800, and 1000 °C were constructed over the whole composition range by investigations of three Cu/Fe/Al 5 Fe 2 diffusion triples and forty-seven equilibrated alloys using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Based on experimental measurements and reasonable assumptions, eleven, eight, and six three-phase equilibria were obtained at 700, 800, and 1000 °C, respectively. The existence of the ternary I-Al 6 Cu 2 Fe icosahedral quasicrystalline phase was confirmed at both 700 and 800 °C, and the ternary ω-Al 7 Cu 2 Fe phase was only found at 700 °C. The stable composition range of the I phase was measured to be Al 67-56 Cu 24-31 Fe 9–13 and Al 66-58 Cu 23-28 Fe 11–14 at 700 and 800 °C, respectively. A wide continuous solution region formed among the α-Fe, β-AlFe, and Cu 3 Al phases at 800 and 1000 °C. A sufficiently large amount of new experimental phase equilibrium data was collected for the Al-Cu-Fe system that will help improve future thermodynamic description of this ternary system within the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) framework for designing Al-Cu-Fe-based quasicrystals.},
