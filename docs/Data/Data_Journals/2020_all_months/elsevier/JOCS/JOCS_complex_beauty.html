  abstract     = {High-throughput RNA sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) have recently started being used as a tool for helping diagnose rare genetic disorders, as they can indicate abnormal gene expression counts — a telltale sign of genetic pathology. Existing solutions either require a large number of samples or do not provide proper statistical significance testing. We present a Bayesian model (OutPyR) for identifying abnormal RNA-Seq gene expression counts in datasets, particularly those with a small number of samples. The model incorporates recently introduced data-augmentation techniques to efficiently and accurately infer parameters of the underlying negative binomial process, while also assessing the uncertainty of the inference, and giving the possibility to generate simulated data. The model&#39;s software implementation is object oriented and thus easily extensible, provides parameter-trace exploration, fault-tolerance and recovery during the parameter estimation process. We also develop a p p -value based outlier score that naturally stems from our model. We apply the model to real and simulated datasets, for different organisms and tissues, and present comparisons with existing models. Our model is implemented purely in Python and its standalone source code is available at https://github.com/esalkovic/outpyr .},

  abstract     = {Agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach to model complex systems composed of agents whose behavior is described using simple rules. As a consequence of the agent interactions emerges a complex global behavioral pattern not explicitly programmed. In the last decade, an increasing number of metaheuristic techniques have been reported in the literature where authors claim their novelty and their abilities to perform as powerful optimization methods. Although these schemes emulate very different processes or systems, the rules used to model individual behavior are very similar. The idea behind the design of many metaheuristic methods is to configure a recycled set of rules that has demonstrated to be successful in previous approaches for producing new optimization schemes. Such common rules have been designed without considering the final global result obtained by the individual interactions. On the other hand, agent-based systems provide a solid theory and a set of consistent models that allow characterizing global behavioral patterns produced by the collective interaction of the individuals from a set of simple rules. Under this perspective, several agent-based concepts and models that generate very complex global search behaviors can be used to produce or improve efficient optimization algorithms. In this paper, a new metaheuristic algorithm based on agent systems principles is presented. The proposed method is based on the agent-based model known as “Heroes and Cowards”. This model involves a small set of rules to produce two emergent global patterns that can be considered in terms of the metaheuristic literature as exploration and exploitation stages. To evaluate its performance, the proposed algorithm has been tested in a set of representative benchmark functions, including multimodal, unimodal, and hybrid benchmark formulations. The competitive results demonstrate the promising association between both paradigms.},

To this end, 3D, compressible, turbulent, non-reacting (with fuel injection) and reacting flow calculations using single step and 10-step chemical kinetics in conjunction with a one equation turbulence model have been carried out. In the mixing study, predictions of the flow features with fuel injection, fuel trajectories, contours of total pressure loss along the combustor are compared between the combustor models. In the combustion study, contours of heat release are compared across the combustor models. Overall performance metrics such as mixing efficiency, total pressure loss and combustion efficiency are also compared between the combustor models. The comparison of combustor top wall static pressure and exit total pressure predictions with experimental data reported in the literature are also presented and discussed. The results clearly show that the model combustor with a shallow and inclined aft wall cavity has the highest residence time and maximum heat release. In addition, the role of a smaller L/D ratio cavity is shown to be minimal on the predictions of residence time and the heat release.},

  abstract     = {N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications are one the most frequently occurring RNA post transcriptional modifications. These modifications perform vital roles in different biological processes, including, localization and translation of proteins, X chromosome inactivation, cell stability, microRNA regulation, and reprogramming etc. Any abnormal change in m6A sites may lead to several abnormalities, including, cancer, brain-related disorders and many other life threatening diseases. Precise detection of m6A modifications is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Existing methods suffer from the problem of inefficient detection of m6A sites, especially in yeast transcriptomes (due to varied structure) and inability of the computational techniques to capture the encoded information surrounding the m6A sites. In this work, we propose a novel method (called m6A-pred predictor) that utilizes a fusion of characteristics including, statistical, and chemical properties of the nucleotides, to precisely predict the presence of m6A sites in RNA sequences. The fusion of multiple types of features results in a high dimensional vector which is further optimized using an evolutionary algorithm . Finally, the random forest classifier is used to detect m6A sites by using the most discriminative features . The results, benchmarked on yeast transcriptomes, indicate that m6A-pred predictor outperforms all the previously reported predictors, notably, with an accuracy value of 78.58\%, specificity value of 79.65\% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.5717.},

Compared to conventional ESNs, the physics-informed ESNs are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while ensuring that their predictions do not violate physical laws. This is achieved by introducing an additional loss function during the training, which is based on the system&#39;s governing equations. The additional loss function penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional training data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system and a truncation of the Charney–DeVore system. Compared to the conventional ESNs, the physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two Lyapunov times. This approach is also shown to be robust with regard to noise. The proposed framework shows the potential of using machine learning combined with prior physical knowledge to improve the time-accurate prediction of chaotic dynamical systems .},

  abstract     = {Privacy is an important issue on any open system, in particular for connected vehicles. These vehicles send continuously messages containing their locations in order to cooperate with their neighbors about what is happening on roads. Privacy protection is highly required to deploy C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems) in order to avoid tracking drivers. For this reason, vehicles change frequently their identity in order to become anonymous. We need to consider the authenticity of senders in order to drop messages coming from untrusted drivers who may send fake events. To do so, each trusted vehicle should sign its message using a certificate. This certificate is provided by an adapted PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) which generates certificates to all trusted vehicles. The eco-system is considered as a trusted domain. However, if a vehicle uses only one certificate, it could be tracked. Since a relationship between its identity and its certificate could be easily done. For this reason, it has to use a set of pseudonym certificates (PCs). Each PC is used for a limited period of time. When this period expires, the vehicle switches to another PC. When all PCs are used, the vehicle downloads another set of PCs from the PKI. This paper proposes a method which reduces the number of PCs used by vehicles. Indeed, when a certificate is used by a vehicle, in order to introduce a confusion against any tracker, this PC will be swap with another driver PC. A tracker will be confused since the former vehicle will not be the owner of the previous PC. This swap has to be recorded on the PKI with a simple process. This mechanism ensures privacy and introduces another PC change method. It also reduces the PC costs for drivers. The evaluation of the work has been done through simulations on a constrained environments (driving on highways) and has proven that tracking becomes very difficult. It has been measured through two key performance indicators: confusion rate and PC cost.},

Security in VANET is a big challenge because there are different types of attacks that endanger communications of moving vehicles. This paper proposes an applied Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to obtain a prediction model of security index in VANET. The research process starts with network simulations to obtain a database of occurrences of attacks. Then, this latter is prepared and analyzed statistically. Finally, using MATLAB toolbox, we show the proposed model of security level that allows estimating the network vulnerability in the event of an attack.},

Based on the improved model, the rules such as the speed perception of the connected vehicle, low reaction time of networked vehicle and the regional avoidance of the emergency vehicle are introduced, which constitute the emergency vehicle CA model of urban road traffic flow.

Recently, a new meta-heuristic algorithm called sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) search algorithm is proposed, which uses the characteristics of sine-cosine trigonometric function in mathematical formulas to solve the optimal solution of the problem to be optimized. This paper presents a new variant of the SCA algorithm named Bare bones Sine Cosine Algorithm (BBSCA), which improves the exploitation ability of the solution, reduces the diversity spillover in the classical SCA search equation, and keeps the diversity of the solution very well. The proposed method uses Gaussian search equations and exponential decrement strategies to generate new candidate individuals, which use the valuable information hidden in the best individuals to guide the population to move in a better direction. At the same time, the greedy selection mechanism is adopted for the newly generated solution, which makes full use of the previously searched information to improve the individual&#39;s search ability. To evaluate the effectiveness in solving the global optimization problems, BBSCA has been tested on classic set of 23 well-known benchmark functions, standard IEEE CEC2014 and CEC2017 benchmark functions, and compared with several other state-of-the-art SCA algorithm variants. At the end of the paper, the performance of design algorithm BBSCA is also tested on classical engineering optimization problems.

The Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc) together with its companion package, the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO), is an integrated numerical software library that contains an algorithmic/software stack for solving linear systems, nonlinear systems, ordinary differential equations, differential algebraic equations, and large-scale optimization problems and, as such, is an ideal tool for performing PDE-constrained optimization. This paper describes an efficient approach in which the software stack provided by PETSc/TAO can be used for large-scale nonlinear time-dependent problems. Time integration can involve a range of high-order methods, both implicit and explicit.

The paper presents an introduction to the software&#39;s architecture and existing capabilities, divided in the code in a set of modules centered around different UQ tasks such as sampling methods, generation of random processes and random fields, probabilistic inverse modeling, reliability analysis, surrogate modeling, and active learning. The paper also highlights the importance of the RunModel module, which is used to drive simulations in the uncertainty analyses performed in UQpy . This module conveniently allows the user to define computational models directly in Python, or to run simulations from a third-party software in serial or in parallel. To illustrate the various capabilities, two examples are tracked throughout the paper and analyzed repeatedly for various UQ tasks. The first is a Python model solving a nonlinear structural dynamics problem, used to illustrate UQpy &#39;s capabilities in sampling and forward propagation of high dimensional random vectors (stochastic processes), and probabilistic inference. The second model is a third-party Abaqus finite element model solving the thermomechanical response of a beam structure.

  abstract     = {A global-search method which applies the concept of genetic algorithm (GA) with gradient-based optimizer is proposed for the problem of experimental data analysis from spectroscopic ellipsometry on thin films. The method is applied to evaluate the data obtained for samples with different structure complexity, starting with transparent monolayers (SiO 2 , HfO 2 ) on a substrate, through absorbing film (diamond-like carbon) and multilayer structures. We demonstrate that by using this method we are able to find material parameters even for limited a priori knowledge about the sample properties, where classical methods fail.},

  abstract     = {This study is inspired by a challenging dynamic Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) encountered in a mobility service operated by the company Padam . 1 . Customers ask for a transportation service either in advance or in real-time and get an immediate answer about whether their requests are accepted or rejected. The main goal is to maximize the number of accepted requests during the service while respecting maximum capacity of limited number of vehicles. In this study, we propose novel methods based on reinsertion techniques to improve Padam &#39;s online system. The proposed reinsertion techniques aim to exploit the neighborhood of a solution and must be run in real-time whenever a request is rejected by an online system. Three main online reinsertion heuristics based on different neighborhoods are proposed. The first heuristic called HDR uses destruction and repair operators, the second heuristic called GH (graph heuristic) uses the ejection chain concept, and allow modeling the reinsertion problem as a constrained shortest path problem on directed graph built from a current solution, and the third heuristic called IGH (improved graph heuristic) based on GH with intensive exploration of the neighborhood. Our proposed approaches were extensively tested on real and hard instances provided by Padam . These instances contain up to 1011 requests and 14 vehicles and with very tight time windows. The obtained results revealed the performance of the proposed reinsertion methods compared to the online heuristic, where the number of served requests is increased and the number of vehicles is reduced while maintaining operating costs close to those of the online system. The results confirm the interest of using reinsertion techniques in the dynamic DARP service.},

We seek to characterize the parameters of the scheme that guarantee the preservation of the non-negativity of the particle distribution functions. In the context of the relative velocity schemes, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the non-negativity preserving property . These conditions are then expressed in a simple way when the relative velocity is reduced to zero. For the general case, we propose some simple necessary conditions on the relaxation parameters and we put in evidence numerically the non-negativity preserving regions. Numerical experiments show finally that no oscillations occur for the propagation of a non-smooth profile if the non-negativity preserving property is satisfied.},

Our approach is based on the numerical integration of fluctuating lattice Boltzmann models (LBM) for multicomponent mixtures. At changing the wettability on the particle&#39;s surface, we measure the mean square displacement (MSD) and compare with the prediction of the Stokes-Einstein theory. Two main set-ups are tested, involving periodic boundary conditions and wall boundary conditions realized on the computational box. We find that full periodic boundary conditions give rise to random advection after millions of lattice Boltzmann time steps, while this effect is mitigated in the presence of wall boundary conditions. The matching with the Stokes-Einstein relation is therefore guaranteed when we use the appropriate frictional properties measured in the presence of confinement. Our results will help the exploration of nanoscale applications with multicomponent fluids using LBM in the presence of thermal fluctuations.},

Integrated with weather data and airborne and satellite remote sensing data on wildland fuels and active fire detection, modern coupled weather-fire modeling systems are being used to solve current science problems.

  abstract     = {Cancer is still one of the major causes of death worldwide. Even if its comprehension is improving continuously, the complexity and heterogeneity of this group of diseases invariably make some cancer cases incurable and lethal. By focusing only on one or two cancerous molecular species simultaneously, traditional in vitro and in vivo approaches do not provide a global view on this disease and are sometimes unable to generate significant insights about cancer. In silico techniques are increasingly used in the oncology domain for their remarkable integration capacity. In basic cancer research, a vast number of mathematical and computational models has been implemented in the past decades, allowing for a better understanding of these complex diseases, generating new hypotheses and predictions, and guiding scientists towards the most impactful experiments. Although clinical uptake of such in silico approaches is still limited, some treatment strategies are currently under investigation in phase I or II clinical trials. Besides being responsible for new therapeutic ideas, in silico models could play a significant role in optimizing clinical trial design and patient stratification. This review provides a non-exhaustive overview of models according to their intrinsic features. In silico contributions to basic cancer science are discussed, using the hallmarks of cancer as a guidance. Subsequently, in silico cancer models, that are a part of currently ongoing clinical trials, are addressed. In a forward-looking section, issues such as the need for adequate regulatory processes related to in silico models, and advances in model technologies are discussed.},

Furthermore, networks provide a powerful model to understand and predict the properties of a diverse range of real-world complex systems. Recently, a multilayer network has been realized as a better suited framework for the representation of complex systems having multiple types of interactions among the same set of constituents. This article shows that by tuning the properties of one layer (network) of a multilayer network, one can regulate the dynamical behavior of another layer (network). By taking an example of a multiplex network comprising two different types of networked Kuramoto oscillators representing two different layers, this article attempts to provide a glimpse of opportunities and emerging phenomena multiplexing can induce which is otherwise not possible for a network in isolation. Here we consider explosive synchronization to demonstrate the potential of multilayer networks framework. To the end, we discuss several possible extensions of the model considered here by incorporating real-world properties.},

  abstract     = {Portfolio allocation and risk management make use of correlation matrices and heavily rely on the choice of a proper correlation matrix to be used. In this regard, one important question is related to the choice of the proper sample period to be used to estimate a stable correlation matrix. This paper addresses this question and proposes a new methodology to estimate the correlation matrix which does not depend on the chosen sample period. This new methodology is based on tensor factorization techniques. In particular, combining and normalizing factor components, we build a correlation matrix which shows emerging structural dependency properties not affected by the sample period. To retrieve the factor components, we propose a new tensor decomposition (which we name Slice-Diagonal Tensor (SDT) factorization) and compare it to the two most used tensor decompositions, the Tucker and the PARAFAC. We have that the new factorization is more parsimonious than the Tucker decomposition and more flexible than the PARAFAC. We apply our methodology to simulated datasets using different simulation parameters. Results are robust to different simulation settings and confirm the stability of the correlation matrix generated for two independent samples. The proposed tool applied to two independent samples of empirical data shows that the correlation matrices generated have a block structure representing stock industries. Furthermore, in accordance to two non-parametric tests, namely Kruskal–Wallis and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, the correlation matrices are statistically time invariant and hence, stable. Since the resulting correlation matrix is characterized by stability and emerging structural dependency properties, it can be used as alternative to other correlation matrices type of measures, including the Pearson correlation.},

  abstract     = {Since Shahshahani and Landgrebe published their seminal paper (Shahshahani and Landgrebe, 1994) [ 1 ] in 1994, the study on semi-supervised learning (SSL) developed fast and has already become one of the main streams of machine learning (ML) research. However, there are still some areas or problems where the capability of SSL remains seriously limited. Firstly, according to our observation, almost all SSL researches are towards classification, regression or clustering tasks. More difficult tasks such as planning, construction, summarization, argumentation, etc. are rarely seen studied with SSL methods. Secondly, most SSL researches use only simple labels (e.g. a string, an identifier, a numerical value, etc.) to mark the text data. It is difficult to use such simple labels to characterize data with delicate information. This limitation might be the reason why current SSL technique is not appropriate in processing complex tasks. Thirdly, after entering the age of big data and big knowledge, SSL, like the other branches of ML, is now facing the challenge of learning big knowledge from big data. The shortage of traditional SSL as mentioned above became even more serious and we are looking forward to new technology of SSL. In this paper, we propose and discuss a novel paradigm of SSL: the semi-supervised multiple representation behavior learning (SSMRBL). It is towards matching the challenge to SSL stated above. SSMRBL should extend current SSL techniques to support complex task learning such as planning, construction, summarization, argumentation etc. In order to meet the challenge, SSMRBL introduces compound structured labels such as trees, graphs, lattices, etc. to represent complicated information of objects and tasks to be learned. Thus, to label an unlabeled datum is to construct a compound structured label for it. As a consequence, SSMRBL needs to have multiple representations. There may be one representation for compound structured labels, one for the target model which is the unification of all local models (labels), one for representing the process (behavior) of label construction, and one for the efficient computation during the learning process. This paper introduces also a typical circumstance of SSMRBL—semi-supervised grammar learning (SSGL), which learns a grammar from a set of natural language texts and then applies this grammar to parse new texts and to summarize its content. We provide also experimental results based on a variety of algorithms to show the reasonability of our ideas.},

Brain Informatics is a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field to systematically utilize brain-related data, information and knowledge coming from the entire research process for in-depth brain investigation. In the past few years, a data-centric conceptual brain model, namely Data-Brain, has been proposed, providing the foundation for the systematic Brain Informatics methodology. The Data-Brain model constitutes a conceptual framework and detailed guideline for managing and analyzing brain big data. The development of Data-Brain model also demands the support from advanced technologies. This paper presents an extensible version of the Data-Brain with advanced computing techniques in the connected world. It provides a global understanding of how multidisciplinary techniques work together to tackle brain computing challenges. Particularly, the integrated K-I-D (Knowledge-Information-Data) loop is proposed, constructing a cycle as the thinking space to help pursue the systematic brain investigation, by which the extensible Data-Brain model continuously iterates and evolves through the never-ending learning. Such synergistic evolvement will power future progress for building intelligence systems and applications connected with the study of complex human brain.},

However, as computers are becoming ever more powerful, so does the hyperbole used to discuss their potential in modelling across a vast range of domains, from subatomic physics to chemistry, climate science, epidemiology, economics and cosmology. As we are about to enter the era of quantum and exascale computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence have entered the field in a significant way. In this article we give a brief history of simulation, discuss how machine learning can be more powerful if underpinned by deeper mechanistic understanding, outline the potential of exascale and quantum computing, highlight the limits of digital computing – classical and quantum – and distinguish rhetoric from reality in assessing the future of modelling and simulation, when we believe analogue computing will play an increasingly important role.},

While social science approaches focus on individual cases, the recent proliferation of empirical data and complex systems thinking has opened up a computational approach based on identifying common statistical patterns and building generative but minimal agent-based models. We discuss a reconciliation for various disparate claims and results in the literature that stand in the way of a unified description and understanding of human wars and conflicts. We also discuss the unified interpretation of the origin of these power-law deviations in terms of dynamical processes. These findings show that a unified computational science framework can be used to understand and quantitatively describe collective human conflict.},

In order to improve the efficiency during the nonlinear iterations, an alternating iteration strategy, FREM-ROM, is proposed, in which the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique is used to establish a sectionalized extrapolation algorithm with lower dimensions and sufficiently high accuracy. This iteration strategy reduces the computational scale by using the Reduced-Order Model (ROM) technique and can guarantee the accuracy by continually correcting the database and POD bases every few time steps during the process of iterations. It also has the potential to be applied to other numerical methods for improved the efficiency. The accuracy and efficiency are examined by two numerical examples, in which the 2D example illustrates the relationship between truncated basis and accuracy in detail, and the heat transfer performance of a large-scale 3D cross-fin heat sink(CFHS) is investigated to highlight the efficiency advantages of solving large-scaled practical problems.},

  abstract     = {Environmental disasters such as flash floods are becoming more and more prevalent and carry an increasing burden to human civilization. They are usually unpredictable, fast in development and extend across large geographical areas. The consequences of such disasters can be reduced through better monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give timely and accurate information to first responders and the public. Given the extended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying nature of the phenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of locations to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present informative mobile sensor routing algorithms are either short-sighted or computationally demanding when applied to large scale systems. In this paper, a real-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and needs of city-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in forward search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed parameter system, modeling flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the causal relation expressed by a search tree, which describes all possible sequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps in the forward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance matrix between observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a concrete example, numerical experiments in this paper indicate that this scheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning algorithms and other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper relies on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states, and experiments suggest that popular estimation techniques have very good performance when applied to precise data-driven models.

  abstract     = {Small cells is a promising technique to improve the spectral efficiency or quality-of-service (QoS) of a cellular network as it reduces the distance between the user and the base station (MBS). It has been proposed for indoor as well as outdoor users. For the outdoor scenario, the backhaul (the link from a small cell to the core network) of the small cell has always been a challenging issue. Different schemes have been proposed in the literature such as optical fiber, satellite and wirelessly through MBS. Wireless backhaul through MBS has gained a lot of attention in the literature and different resource allocation with orthogonal resources strategies have been proposed for it as well. Apart from orthogonal techniques, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a multi access technique with the basic principle of sharing the same bandwidth resource between multiple users with varying power levels. Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is implemented on the receiver side to decode the data. This overall increases the spectrally efficiency of the network and make NOMA a promising candidate to be deployed on the backhaul of the small cell network. In this paper, we investigate the problem of pairing of small cells and the allocation of resources. Small cells&#39; load information plays vital role to solve this problem. An optimization problem with an objective of maximizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of the backhaul network is formulated. The joint problem is decomposed and solved using a load-based heuristic for the backhaul of small cells. Furthermore, our performance evaluation shows that the proposed heuristic is able to achieve nearly-same spectral efficiency as that of exhaustive search with much less complexity.},

  abstract     = {The living organism maintains homeostasis despite being a thermodynamically open system in constant interaction with its environment. Only a system which implements automatic control mechanisms can meet these criteria. The negative feedback loop provides a way to implement such mechanisms. While the organism is thermodynamically open, feedback loops active on the level of cells and the organism as a whole maintain specific substrate concentrations and functions which we refer to as “normal” or “physiological”. Each automatically controlled process constitutes a distinct unit associated with a specific metabilism. This unit encompasses all components which enables a specific function – it may therefore be referred to as a “functional unit” or a “functional-structural unit”. Individual units which control specific processes may be further linked with one another, forming a complex network of dependencies. Receptors play a crucial role in feedback systems. By detecting deviations from the predefined norm – within the scope of a given process – they can trigger counterbalancing actions. They are also involved in inter-process communications. Such communications can be either cooperative – where the product of one process becomes the substrate of another – or coordinative – where the product of one process modulates the behavior of another by affecting the operation of its control function. The latter type introduces a hierarchy of processes. Proteins are the basic building blocks of biological systems. Their mutual interactions are represented in the form of proteomes, in which they represent structural components. It is, however, difficult to determine what the role a given protein plays in a metabolic process purely by analyzing its structure. Treating proteins as elements of feedback loops provides far greater insight into their functional characteristics. This is why the presented study focuses on functional units rather than on individual proteins.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, which results in serious complications such as cardiovascular disorder, neuropathy, renal failure, and retinopathy. Various anti-diabetic drugs have been developed, however, their therapeutic effect is far from satisfactory. Therefore, increasing attention has been paid to natural products, whose multi-targets characteristics might contribute to treating polygenetic disease like diabetes. Indeed, valuable implications for anti-diabetic drug discovery can be obtained through exploring the molecular mechanism of these natural products, however, it could be a formidable task with traditional experimental approaches. As such, computational approaches are applied in predicting the compound-target interactions, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and other computer aided drug design (CADD) methods. Furthermore, network pharmacology strategy is introduced for exploring natural products with anti-diabetic activities, including the general workflow of network pharmacology, its application in anti-diabetic traditional Chinese medicine formula research, and the application of natural products in diabetic complications. In particular, a promising prospective insight of combining computational methods and network pharmacology in anti-diabetic drug discovery is discussed. In summary, the combination of computational approaches and network pharmacology has already produced fruitful natural products with anti-diabetic effect, and will hopefully initiate novel anti-diabetic drug development with advanced therapeutic effect and less side effect.},

  abstract     = {Hurricane evacuation is a complex dynamic process and a better understanding of the factors which influence the evacuation behavior of the coastal residents could be helpful in planning a better evacuation policy. Traditionally, the various aspects of the household evacuation decisions have been determined by post-evacuation questionnaire surveys, however, these surveys have seen a deterioration in the quality of the data due to a gradual decrease in response rates in recent years, which may lead to non-response bias. Increased activity of users on social media, especially during emergencies, along with the geo-tagging of the posts, provides an opportunity to gain insights into user&#39;s decision-making process, as well as to gauge public opinion and activities using the social media data as a supplement to the traditional survey data. This paper leverages the geo-tagged Tweets posted in the New York City (NYC) and Jacksonville, FL in wake of Hurricane Sandy and Matthew respectively to understand the evacuation behavior of the Twitter users and compare them with that of the survey respondents. We design the Twitter user classification problem as a novel HMM modeling framework to classify them into one of the three categories: outside evacuation zone, evacuees, and non-evacuees. We compare the demographic composition (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and spatial coverage of Twitter users with that of the survey respondents to highlight the complementary nature of the two data sources, which when combined give a representative sample of the population. We analyze the GPS coordinates of the tweets by evacuees to understand evacuation and return time and evacuation location patterns and compared them with survey respondents. The techniques presented in this paper provide an alternative (fast and voluntary) source of information for modeling evacuation behavior during emergencies, which is complementary in terms of demographics and spatial distribution as compared to the traditional surveys and could be useful for authorities to plan a better evacuation campaign to minimize the risk to the life of the residents of the emergency hit areas.},

  abstract     = {The deformation and dynamics of a single droplet in isotropic turbulence is studied using a Lattice Boltzmann diffuse interface model involving exact boundary flow conditions [1] to allow for the creation of an external turbulent flow. We focus on a small, sub-Kolmogorov droplet, whose scale is much smaller than the Kolmogorov length scale of the turbulent flow. The external flow field is obtained via pseudo-spectral simulation data describing the trajectory of a passive tracer in isotropic turbulence. In this way we combine the microscopic scale of the droplet and the macroscopic scale of the turbulent flow. The results obtained from this fully resolved model are compared to previous studies on sub-Kolmogorov droplet dynamics in isotropic turbulent flows [2] , where an analytical model [3] , which assumes the droplet shape to be an ellipsoid at all times, is used to describe the droplet deformation. Our findings confirm, that the hybrid pseudo-spectral Lattice Boltzmann algorithm is able to study droplet deformation and breakup in a regime well beyond the ellipsoidal approximation .},

In this paper, we develop methods to circumvent these data races for high performance on many-core CPU architectures with wide SIMD units. The developed EBE kernel attains 16.3\% and 16.0\% of FP32 peak on Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing) based Oakforest-PACS and Intel Xeon Platinum (Cascade Lake) based Oakbridge-CX, respectively. This leads to 2.88-fold speedup over the baseline kernel and 2.03-fold speedup of the whole finite-element application on Oakforest-PACS. Examples of finite-element earthquake simulations using the developed EBE kernel algorithms are shown. These insights are expected to enable high performance on other unstructured finite-element solvers on large-scale many-core wide-SIMD CPU based systems.},

A simulation model allows researchers to evaluate the platform or interior designs without involving real-world experimentation. In this paper, we propose a passenger model to measure the effect of different public transport vehicle layouts on the required time for boarding and alighting. We first model a low level collision avoidance behavior based on an extended social force model aiming at simulating human interactions in confined spaces. The model introduces a mechanism to emulate rotation behavior while avoiding complex geometric computations and is calibrated to experimental data. The model also allows agents to perform collision prediction in low density environments. Strategical behavior of passengers is modeled according to the recognition-primed decision paradigm and combined with the collision avoidance model. We validate our model against real-world experiments from the literature, demonstrating deviations of less than 6\%. In a case study, we evaluate the boarding and alighting times required by three autonomous vehicle interior layouts proposed by industrial designers in both low-density and high-density scenarios.},

  abstract     = {We present a D3Q19 lattice scheme based in MRT with central moments (MRT-CM), where the free parameters of the model are optimized to dissipate under-resolved flow structures with high wavenumbers. In Chávez-Modena et al. in Computers &amp; Fluids 172:397-409, 2018 [1] , we compared the BGK, MRT-RM and MRT-CM for the D2Q9 lattice scheme using von Neumann analyses and quantified their numerical properties. Based on this study, we proposed an optimized 2D MRT-CM scheme with enhanced stability for under-resolved flows. Here, we extend this idea to the D3Q19 MRT-CM scheme. As before, we base our optimization for the free parameters, on the k-1\% dispersion-error rule, that states that waves with dispersive errors above 1\% should be dissipated since they pollute the solution and may cause instabilities. To this aim we increase dissipation in the scheme for waves with dispersive errors above 1\%. The resulting optimized scheme is verified through a von Newmann analysis and validated for the three-dimensional Taylor-Green isotropic turbulent flow. We show how the original D3Q19 MRT-CM (d’Humières version) leads to unrealistic kinetic energy accumulation at high wave numbers, whilst our optimized MRT-CM provides the correct energy dissipated rate, avoiding energy build up at high wavenumbers. These results suggest that our optimization strategy enhances stability and allows for accurate energy spectra in under-resolved flow simulations such as typically found in Large Eddy Simulations.},

The new hybrid approach is designed for a two-fold scope: (i) emulating hidden, possibly chaotic, dynamics and (ii) predicting their future states. The method consists in applying iteratively a data assimilation step, here an ensemble Kalman filter, and a neural network. Data assimilation is used to optimally combine a surrogate model with sparse noisy data. The output analysis is spatially complete and is used as a training set by the neural network to update the surrogate model. The two steps are then repeated iteratively. Numerical experiments have been carried out using the chaotic 40-variables Lorenz 96 model, proving both convergence and statistical skill of the proposed hybrid approach. The surrogate model shows short-term forecast skill up to two Lyapunov times, the retrieval of positive Lyapunov exponents as well as the more energetic frequencies of the power density spectrum. The sensitivity of the method to critical setup parameters is also presented: the forecast skill decreases smoothly with increased observational noise but drops abruptly if less than half of the model domain is observed. The successful synergy between data assimilation and machine learning, proven here with a low-dimensional system, encourages further investigation of such hybrids with more sophisticated dynamics.},

The tiltrotor aircraft has the characteristics of both helicopters and propeller planes with changing the flight mode by tilting the engine nacelles. However, much less work with continuously changing these modes has been done so far. In this paper, the main components such as rotors, engine nacelles, fixed wings and a fuselage are considered. In order to perform large deformations of mesh geometry such as the rotation of the rotor and nacelle as well as the change of the position and attitude of the aircraft, the computational domain is decomposed into multiple domains corresponding to each component. Independently moving these domains makes possible to perform the characteristic behavior of a tiltrotor aircraft. To deal with rotations of multiple decomposed domains, the multi-axis sliding mesh approach is applied. As the solver for simulating unsteady flow driven by complicated moving boundaries, the unstructured Moving-Grid Finite-Volume method is adopted. Based on this solver, the Moving Computational Domain method enables the aircraft to fly in any size of region without restriction of mesh size. The airframe is treated as a rigid body, and the coupled simulations considering interaction with surrounding fluid of the aircraft are demonstrated. The result shows complicated fluid phenomena around the tiltrotor aircraft that occur when it flies with mode change.},

  abstract     = {The unprecedented increase in the number of smart connected devices invoked a plethora of diverse applications with different performance requirements stipulating various network management strategies. Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), one of the promised 5G dimensions, is expected to enable mission-critical applications while adhering to the heterogeneity of their quality metrics. At its core, URLLC rests on the notion of providing stringent reliability and latency requirements, in which guaranteed network availability becomes a necessity. Network slicing (NS) is one of the key paradigms that can offer performance guarantees through customized network management of software defined networking (SDN). However, unlocking URLLC with network slicing based mechanisms requires careful demultiplexing of the network into various slices and proper assignment of traffic flows generated by ultra-reliable low latency applications over those slices. Within each slice, multiple disjoint paths may be selected to ensure the reliability requirement of the assigned application while meeting its latency constraint. Hence, we study, in this paper, the joint problem of forming end-to-end network slices, mapping URLLC applications to corresponding slices and assigning their traffic flows over multiple disjoint paths; then formulate it as a mixed integer program . Due to its complexity, we decompose the problem into two subproblems; end-to-end disjoint paths and traffic flow assignment for ultra-reliable low latency applications. Simulation results are presented for various scenarios to demonstrate the performance and scalability of the proposed decomposition approach as compared to the general formulation.},

This article addresses some diagnosis problems in industrial processes, situations such as simultaneity of events, false positives , and partial recognition of event sequences. V-nets are presented as a means to model dynamic processes without the state machine concept and, the robustness and capability to identify different sequences of discrete events. With the V-nets formalism, it is possible to identify the evolution of the discrete events, simultaneous occurrences of events, partial recognition, counting the number of times that each discrete event occurred in a temporal sequence and this formalism also has the capability to model sequences of sequences. An example of one industrial application is presented and a comparative analysis of the Time Petri Nets , Timed Automata, and Chronicles with the V-nets is exposed.},

At variance with other commonly used multigrid methods , mostly oriented to high Reynolds and turbulent flows, the present approach is designed to capture the physics at the smallest scales whenever the lattice Boltzmann alone falls short of providing the correct physical information due to a lack of resolution, as it occurs for example in thin films between interacting bubbles or droplets in microfluidic crystals. The coupling strategies employed to pass the hydrodynamic information between the LB and the MPCD are detailed and the algorithm is tested against the steady isothermal Poiseuille flow problem for different coupling configurations.},

  abstract     = {Computing grids are key enablers of computational science. Researchers from many fields (High Energy Physics, Bioinformatics, Climatology, etc.) employ grids for execution of distributed computational jobs. These computing workloads are typically data-intensive. The current state of the art approach for data access in grids is data placement: a job is scheduled to run at a specific data center, and its execution commences only once the complete input data has been transferred there. An alternative approach is remote data access: a job may stream the input data directly from arbitrary storage elements. Remote data access brings two innovative benefits: (1) the jobs can be executed asynchronously with respect to the data transfer; (2) when combined with data placement on the policy level, it can aid in the optimization of the network load, since these two data access methodologies partially exhibit nonoverlapping bottlenecks. However, in order to employ this technique systematically, the properties of its network throughput need to be studied carefully. This paper presents experimentally identified parameters of remote data access throughput, statistically tested formalization of these parameters and a derived throughput forecasting model. The model is applicable to large computing workloads, robust with respect to arbitrary dynamic changes in the grid infrastructure and exhibits a long-term prediction horizon. Its purpose is to assist various stakeholders of the grid in decision-making related to data access patterns. This work is based on measurements taken on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid at CERN.},

To this end, we profile two production scientific workflows on a distributed platform instrumented with power meters. We then conduct an analysis of power and energy consumption measurements. This analysis shows that power consumption is not linearly related to CPU utilization and that I/O operations significantly impact power, and thus energy, consumption. We then propose a power consumption model that accounts for I/O operations, including the impact of waiting for these operations to complete, and for concurrent task executions on multi-socket, multi-core compute nodes. We implement our proposed model as part of a simulator that allows us to draw direct comparisons between real-world and modeled power and energy consumption. We find that our model has high accuracy when compared to real-world executions. Furthermore, our model improves accuracy by about two orders of magnitude when compared to the traditional models used in the energy-efficient workflow scheduling literature.},

For this purpose, we use several types of synthetic populations which reflect different ways of distributing people among the workplaces and different contact patterns within the households and the workplaces. The agent-based model is implemented to perform the simulations using Python programming language . We show that in the populations where intensive mixing of people occurs, the influenza outbreaks have higher incidence peak and shorter duration, compared to the populations with less variety of contacts. Hence, the features of contact patterns may dramatically alter the course of epidemics in Russian cities and explain the differences between their outbreak dynamics in the situation when infection virulence and the average number of contacts stay the same.},

  abstract     = {In our daily life, we are always facing decision making problems with different complexities and requirements. Therefore, the need to design new theories, methods and tools to solve these kinds of problems, as efficiently as possible, becomes a real challenge. In the current research, we deal with decision problems wherein value constraints are expressed on the performance ratings of the alternatives. We focus on MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) methods to solve such problems. When value constraints are specified, traditional MCDM methods proceed upstream by removing from the research space all the non-satisfactory alternatives, while more recent approaches provide a subjective ranking of these alternatives. To overcome some of these issues, we have introduced, recently, a new MCDM method called, ISOCOV (Ideal Solution with Constraint on Values). ISOCOV aims at providing to the decision maker a more accurate solution while dealing with the given value constraints. We propose in this paper to introduce more flexibility in this method and study its accuracy by comparing its rendering with other methods through its application on a real dataset. The adaptation introduced in our study makes it possible to specify the problem by assuming the value constraints either as mandatory (hard constraints), or as non-compulsory (soft constraints). In the first case, the alternatives that are meeting all the constraints are ranked on the top, whereas the rest of the field is ranked below. However, if the constraints are soft, ISOCOV ranks the alternatives according to the combination of their performance ratings and their closeness to meet all the constraints.},

GPUs can accelerate these simulations; however, both current pre-exascale and future exascale CPU-GPU heterogeneous systems face communication challenges critical to performance and scalability. We describe, to our knowledge, the largest distributed GPU-accelerated FSI simulations of high hematocrit cell-resolved flows with over 17 million red blood cells. We compare scaling on a fat node system with six GPUs per node and on a system with a single GPU per node. Through comparison between the CPU- and GPU-based implementations, we identify the costs of data movement in multiscale multi-grid FSI simulations on heterogeneous systems and show it to be the greatest performance bottleneck on the GPU.},

This alignment is a function of the difference in velocities so there is no change in flow when the velocities are the same. The commonly employed Payne-Witham (PW) model aligns traffic with a constant speed (velocity) regardless of the transitions on a road. Thus, the distance covered during alignment and driver behavior are ignored. As a consequence, the resulting speeds can exceed the maximum or go below zero. With the proposed model, the speed during alignment is a function of the traffic density. In particular, traffic adapts quicker for a smaller forward density and vice versa. Results are presented for discontinuous traffic densities caused by a bottleneck along both straight and circular roads which show that this model provides more realistic behavior than the PW and Zhang models.},

There are two major kinds of network dismantling methods, i.e. centrality measure based methods and network decycling based methods. The former ignores the influence of the loop structure in network topology, while the latter massively deletes irrelevant nodes in the loop removal step, both resulting in poor performance. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a neighborhood link sensitive dismantling method for social networks. The proposed method contains two key steps, namely node deleting step and node re-inserting step. In node deleting step, a neighborhood link sensitive centrality measure is defined to identify the nodes that are really crucial to destroy the connectivity of network. In the following node re-inserting step, an appropriate greedy strategy is selected to refine the node set of network dismantling as much as possible to the theoretical optimal solution. Experimental results on real-world networks and synthetic networks demonstrate that the proposed method can break down networks by deleting only a smaller set of nodes, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our proposed method shows stable performance and strong adaptability on networks with different scales and structural characteristics.},

Nonetheless, these models become computationally intractable quickly when the number of stages increase. In this context, a framework to reduce the size of scenario tree and multistage stochastic optimization problems is proposed. Scenario trees are generated using the Knuth transformation for a more compact representation. Moreover, the optimization model is described by using an implicit extensive form approach. The framework is tested in an asset-liability management multistage stochastic model with joint chance constraints, making it possible to acquire the optimal solution for large instances without any relaxation or decomposition mechanism.},

One type of these networks, the cities, are complex systems that generate large quantity of information. These data are an important part of the characteristics of the urban network itself. Because of this, it is crucial to have a classification system, for the vertices of a network, considering the data we can find in the city itself. To address this question, this paper studies and compares several measures of centrality specifically applied to urban networks. These centralities are based on the calculation of the eigenvectors of a matrix and are very suitable for urban networks with data. With the aim of expanding the range covered by these measures, a new centrality measure is presented. Finally we compare three centralities by means of a real network and real data on the city of Rome (Italy).},

The signal is described using coupled dynamic linear models, with spatial effects specified by a Gaussian process. Data streams are analysed using a stochastic algorithm, known as iterated batch importance sampling (IBIS), which sequentially propagates a discrete approximation of the parameter posterior through a series of reweighting and resampling steps. To circumvent degeneracy of the parameter samples, additional Markov chain Monte Carlo steps are used, subject to some degeneracy criterion. The IBIS algorithm is modified to make it more efficient and parallisable. The model is shown to give a good description of the underlying process and provide reasonable forecast accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The gravitational force has been considered as one of the most important factors leading to composition variation of multicomponent chemical species mixture in many industrial processes and natural phenomena. This has been largely studied through experimental and numerical modeling, especially in chemical processes and petroleum reservoir engineering. The modeling and simulation of dynamical process of composition variation under gravity is fundamentally important to understand the evolutionary process of petroleum reservoir formation and initial state. This work presents the dynamical modeling of composition variation in the framework of the modified Helmholtz free energy coupling with the realistic equations of state. An efficient, easy-to-implement, thermodyanmically consistent, and robust numerical scheme is proposed for the dynamical model. This scheme is rigorously proved to be unconditionally stable. The implementation is straightforward based on the single-component system and it is not required to choose a reference species for multicomponent fluids. For the multicomponent system of huge number of species, the proposed scheme allows to numerically compute the system of partial differential equations in a random order, which is called an “unbiased scheme” in this work. The current scheme is computationally efficient and saves computer memory. Several numerical examples are designed to verify the properties of the scheme.},

In result, nonintrusive postprocessing may be performed that provides the approximation error norm estimation on the ensemble of the solutions. The ensemble of numerical results obtained by five OpenFOAM solvers (based on independent algorithms) is analyzed from this viewpoint. The numerical tests are made for the inviscid compressible flow around a cone at zero angle of attack. The norm of the approximation error and the error of the valuable functional (drag coefficient) are successfully estimated via ensemble based approach that is confirmed by the comparison with the etalon precise solution.

Dynamic optimisation problems to incorporate changes. However, these are memoryless in that the problem description changes and a new problem is solved – but with little reference to any previous information. In this paper, a temporally augmented version of a water management problem which allows farmers to plan over long time horizons is introduced. A climate change projection model is used to predict both rainfall and temperature for the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in Australia for up to 50 years into the future. Three representative decades are extracted from the climate change model to create the temporal data sets. The results confirm the utility of the temporal approach and show, for the case study area, that crops that can feasibly and sustainably be grown will be a lot fewer than the present day in the challenging water-reduced conditions of the future.},

In this paper, we extend the idea developed in our earlier work of integrating machine learning (ML) methods with HPC-accelerated MD simulations of soft materials in order to enhance their predictive power and advance their applications for research and educational activities. Parallelized MD simulations of self-assembling ions in nanoconfinement are employed to demonstrate our approach. We find that an artificial neural network-based regression model successfully learns nearly all the interesting features associated with the output ionic density profiles over a broad range of ionic system parameters. The ML model generates predictions that are in excellent agreement with the results from MD simulations. The inference time associated with the ML model is over a factor of 10,000 smaller than the corresponding parallel MD simulation time. Through this demonstration, we introduce a “machine learning surrogate” for MD simulations of soft-matter systems. We develop and deploy a web application on nanoHUB to realize the advantages associated with the ML surrogate. The results demonstrate that the performance of MD simulations can be further enhanced by using ML, enabling rapid and accurate simulation-driven exploration of the soft material design space.},

  abstract     = {Chip multicore processors (CMPs) constitute the architecture of choice for a wide spectrum of computing systems, ranging from power-efficient mobile devices to high-performance server platforms. Despite their benefits, the contention that appears when multiple applications compete for the use of shared resources among cores, such as the last-level cache (LLC), may lead to substantial performance degradation . This may have a negative impact on key system metrics such as throughput and fairness. Partitioning of the LLC (i.e., assigning a separate cache partition with a certain size to each application) has been proven effective to mitigate contention-related effects. In this article we propose a parallel simulator that makes it possible to quickly compare the effectiveness of different cache-partitioning policies with the optimal solution for different optimization objectives. The simulator can obtain the optimal solution for any point during the execution of a multi-program workload where each application goes through a certain program phase. Our proposal leverages a slowdown-prediction model that accounts for degradation due to cache sharing and memory-bandwidth contention, which constitute the major factors of shared-resource contention on current CMPs. To determine the optimal solution for two optimization objectives (throughput and fairness optimization), we leverage a novel distributed-memory parallel branch-and-bound strategy specifically designed to efficiently distribute the computation across multiple processing cores.},

In the Big Data/Text era, where the information increases exponentially, optimization becomes essential in selection of the most representative sentences for generating the best summaries. Therefore, a data-driven summarization model is proposed and optimized during a run of Differential Evolution (DE). Different DE runs are distributed to a grid in parallel as optimization tasks, seeking high processing throughput despite the demanding complexity of the linguistic model, especially on longer multi-documents where DE improves results given more iterations. Namely, parallelization and the grid enable, running several independent DE runs at same time within fixed real-time budget.

The macro probability model of node state transition is constructed from the perspective of probability, and the macro information diffusion of network system is constructed from the perspective of statistics. Secondly, the equilibrium point and stability of the proposed model are solved to ensure that the model is reasonable and meaningful. Finally, the relationship between the parameters in the model is analyzed by numerical simulation experiment, and the dynamic simulation is carried out. The process of information competition and dissemination is analyzed, and the degree of agreement between the simulation results and the real event statistics is researched through empirical comparative experiments.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of predicting the tertiary structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence, which has been reported to belong to the NP-Complete class of problems. We design an ad-hoc distributed memetic algorithm (DMA) and evaluate several algorithm configurations in terms of different distributed population structures, ad-hoc local search strategies and the combination of two energy functions. The algorithm uses an asynchronous hierarchical population of agents that exchange solutions along the execution of the algorithm. Extensive computational experiments were carried out in order to test: (1) the impact of the communication on different population structures, (2) the combination of the energy functions used for fitness calculations, (3) the scalability of the algorithm for structures with a larger number of agents, (4) the performance of the different approaches proposed for local search and diversity calculations, (5) the biological significance of the predicted structures and (6) to compare the best performing configuration of the DMA with other algorithms from the literature. The algorithm was tested on 20 sequences of different size, and the analysis was performed regarding both computational quality and biological significance of the predicted structures. Results show that the combination of energy functions and the proposed Distributed Memetic Algorithm allows the prediction of structures that are similar to the experimental ones. Performance analysis shows that increasing parallelism improves the execution times, without worsening the quality of the solutions.},

  abstract     = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a powerful nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization method that may determine optimal solutions of engineering problems in fewer evaluations compared to other optimization methods. However, the literature shows that PSO may suffer from converging prematurely to a local solution, and this occurs due to poor tuning of the control parameters in PSO. In this paper, an extensive parametric sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the impact of the individual control parameters and their respective influence on the performance of PSO. A benchmark constrained optimization problem was considered for studying PSO by modifying each parameter one-at-a-time. Therefore, initially, a constraint handling technique was formulated to allow particles to update their best historical solutions according to the feasibility. Results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that PSO was most sensitive to the inertia weight, cognitive component, and social component. The optimal parameter set, determined from the sensitivity analysis, was verified by comparison with metaheuristic methods. The verification study shows that the proposed parameter setting outperformed the other methods in all but one case, where it performed competently.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle traffic congestion is an increasing concern in metropolitan areas, with negative implications for health, environment, and economy. Researchers, city managers, and entrepreneurs have shown great interest in Smart Mobility, and several approaches have been proposed to reduce these non-desired effects. In this work, we focus on using the existing infrastructure (traffic lights) to tackle these negative issues, instead of investing in an expensive new one. The adequate planning of traffic lights (the configuration of the red-yellow-green cycles) improves vehicle flow (reducing jams, emissions, economic losses, etc.) and, at the same time, this improvement is obtained without any additional cost and without requiring the use of specialized applications by the drivers. We propose two versions of a Cellular Genetic Algorithm (cGA): synchronous and asynchronous. This method has previously shown very accurate results in real-world problems. Our approaches are evaluated with two closer-to-reality scenarios from urban areas located in the cities of Málaga (Spain) and Paris (France) using the popular micro-simulator Simulator of Urban Mobility (SUMO). A complex simulation of the city is mixed with an advanced (though light) algorithm to address a major problem in all cities. We compare our algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques for this problem, showing high accuracy of our techniques. Additionally, we present an in-depth analysis of the solutions obtained via a genotypic and phenotypic data science study, so that the whole domain gets a better understanding of what the algorithms are computing and experts can learn better strategies.},

  abstract     = {In large livestock farming it would be beneficial to be able to automatically detect behaviors in animals. In fact, this would allow to estimate the health status of individuals, providing valuable insight to stock raisers. Traditionally this process has been carried out manually, relying only on the experience of the breeders. Such an approach is effective for a small number of individuals. However, in large breeding farms this may not represent the best approach, since, in this way, not all the animals can be effectively monitored all the time. Moreover, the traditional approach heavily rely on human experience, which cannot be always taken for granted. To this aim, in this paper, we propose a new method for automatically detecting activity and inactivity time periods of animals, as a behavior indicator of livestock. In order to do this, we collected data with sensors located in the body of the animals to be analyzed. In particular, the reliability of the method was tested with data collected on Iberian pigs and calves. Results confirm that the proposed method can help breeders in detecting activity and inactivity periods for large livestock farming.},

  abstract     = {Electrophoreticdeposition (EPD) coating is one of the key processes in automotive manufacturing. Here, car bodies are moved through a tank of paint in which electrically charged paint particles lead to a successive increase of the paint film thickness on the car body. This paint film is used to protect the car body from corrosion. However, in order to properly protect the car body from corrosion, it is required that the whole surface area is covered by a certain paint film thickness. To ensure that, there is a high demand for an accurate simulation tool, which not only avoids the need for expensive prototypes but also allows to detect potential problems in early development stages. To that end, in this work, we are proposing a novel simulation tool based on the finite difference method (FDM). The proposed tool considers exact physics and employs a dedicated overset grid methodology to allow for a high resolution discretization of entire car bodies. Based on this overset grid scheme, the whole domain is modeled in a coarse resolution, whereas the space around the car body is discretized using a high resolution grid. Employing this scheme eventually allows for an accurate and efficient simulation of industrial EPD coating processes. Experimental evaluations based on an analytical analysis and an industrial scenario confirm the accuracy and scalability of the proposed methods.},

Computing this exact step size is easily done by only rooting a second-order polynomial computed from the initial log-likelihood maximization problem. Numerical results using both simulated and real dataset showed the efficiency of the proposed exact line search scheme when applied to the conventional EM algorithm as well as the anti-annealing based acceleration techniques based on either the EM or the expectation conjugate gradient algorithm.},

It is known that loss of APC gene function through mutation is followed by the expansion of a field of mutated tissue, but the mechanisms behind this expansion are poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the processes involved in field expansion using two agent-based computational models : a cell-scale model allowing mapping of Apc-mutated cell expansion in small multcrypt arrays, and a tissue-scale model allowing simulation of the entire colon over oncologically relevant timescales. The cell scale model predicts that mutated cells spread through the flat mucosa of the simulated tissue without invading neighbouring crypts - a process not previously hypothesised in the literature. The crypt-scale model’s predictions of field sizes correspond to those estimated in the literature from in vivo studies. Our dual-scale modelling approach renders the spatial and temporal scales at which field cancerisation processes occur in vivo accessible to exploration by simulation for the first time.},

  abstract     = {The CACOC (Chaotic Ant Colony Optimisation for Coverage) algorithm has been developed to manage the mobility of a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Using a specific chaotic dynamic obtained from the Rössler system, CACOC provides waypoints for UAVs that aim to optimise the coverage of an unknown area while having unpredictable trajectories. Since the chaotic dynamics are obtained from a three differential equations system with parameters, it is possible to tune one parameter to obtain another chaotic dynamic, which will result in different UAV mobility behaviours. This work aims at optimising this parameter of the Rössler chaotic system to improve the coverage performance of CACOC. Since each evaluation of a solution requires a full simulation, global optimisation techniques (e.g., population-based heuristics) would be very time-consuming. We therefore considered a surrogate-based method to efficiently explore the parameter space of the Rössler system for CACOC, i.e., Bayesian optimisation. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach permits to improve the speed of coverage of the UAV swarm. In addition an analysis of the dynamical properties of the obtained chaotic system is provided.},

This study presents a new integrated efficiency measurement model combining statistical techniques, decision making, and mathematical programming for resilient supplier analysis. Also, a new combination of two methods of first aggregation and last aggregation is developed to take advantage of both. Methodologically, this paper applies principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions and the correlation between the criteria. The PCA method is utilized to decrease the dimensions and the correlation between the criteria. Besides, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is employed to determine the weights of the criteria and ranking the suppliers. Weights of the criteria are established using the DEA method, the entropy, and judgments of decision-makers (DMs) simultaneously. A case study of resilient supplier selection problems is resolved and compared with existing methods to prove the performance of the proposed model. As a way of calculating the weight of the criteria, this study analyzes the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the first and last aggregation approaches.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the CO 2 emissions in a roundabout intersection using a cellular automata model. The roundabout system is composed of the circulating lane and entry/exit lanes, where the entry/exit lanes are controlled by a set of traffic signals ( S n ) operating in a fixed-time T . We explore numerically the dependence of the total CO 2 emission rate on the injection and extraction rates. Surprisingly, even a small number of vehicles that break the rules of entrance to the circulating lane can affect the CO 2 emissions on the roundabout system. Furthermore, we found that the variation of the number S n , as well as the cycle time play an important role in the variation of the CO 2 emissions. Macroscopic and microscopic analyses are conducted to understand the effect of the various parameters on the CO 2 emissions in the roundabout system.},

  abstract     = {Engineered and natural adsorbers, which undergo both adsorption and desorption mechanisms during operations, are dominant treatment technologies to remove difficult contaminants from influent sources to safeguard supplies of potable water to local communities. The slow net adsorption, i.e. adsorption rate greater than desorption rate, of contaminants over long periods of operational time contributes to chemical clogging inside an operating adsorber which complexity continues to be difficult for engineers to quantify, particularly on the adsorption and desorption processes coexisting during their near-equilibrium concentration state which builds towards its exhaustion stage for maintenance purpose. In this study, we leverage on the homogenization theory with the multiscale perturbation analysis to develop an engineering model which encapsulates the complex adsorption-desorption mechanics in adsorbers. The desired model contributes towards the primary objective of having the required capabilities to perform predictive maintenance of adsorbers to garner operational benefits, especially for large-scale systems. The hybrid analytical approach systematically derives a unique homogenized representation which contains an unknown reaction rate parameter responsible for the adsorption-desorption processes taking place over a significantly long period of time leading to the adsorber’s exhaustion stage. Dimensional analysis is then carried out to express the reaction rate parameter as a function of the known physical parameters to predict the transient variations in an adsorber’s effluent concentration during its gradual build-up towards exhaustion. Measured data from both the literature and our own adsorber experimental runs are then acquired to train and validate the model’s predictive capability, via supervised learning methods, which yields an average error deviation of 10\% or less for the optimal training period determined. Finally, we demonstrate quantitatively how the model can be useful to engineers to estimate: (a) the timing for an operating adsorber to reach its exhaustion stage; and (b) the associated Damköhler number, adsorption and desorption coefficients and etc., responsible for the concerned adsorber’s effluent concentration profile for the varying types of contaminants removed.},

  abstract     = {Multiple studies provide evidence on the impact of certain gene interactions in the occurrence of diseases. Due to the complexity of genotype–phenotype relationships, it is required the development of highly efficient algorithmic strategies that successfully identify high-order interactions attending to different evaluation criteria. This work investigates parallel evolutionary computation approaches for multiobjective gene interaction analysis. A multiobjective genetic algorithm , with novel optimized design features, is developed and parallelized under problem-independent and problem-dependent schemes. Experimental results show the relevant performance of the method for complex interaction orders, significantly accelerating execution time (up to 296×) with regard to other state-of-the-art multiobjective tools.},

  abstract     = {The term cancer covers a multitude of bodily diseases, broadly categorised by having cells which do not behave normally. Since cancer cells can arise from any type of cell in the body, cancers can grow in or around any tissue or organ making the disease highly complex. Our research is focused on understanding the specific mechanisms that occur in the tumour microenvironment via mathematical and computational modeling . We present a 3D individual-based model which allows one to simulate the behaviour of, and spatio-temporal interactions between, cells, extracellular matrix fibres and blood vessels. Each agent (a single cell, for example) is fully realised within the model and interactions are primarily governed by mechanical forces between elements. However, as well as the mechanical interactions we also consider chemical interactions, for example, by coupling the code to a finite element solver to model the diffusion of oxygen from blood vessels to cells. The current state of the art of the model allows us to simulate tumour growth around an arbitrary blood-vessel network or along the striations of fibrous tissue.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the amount of data that has been collected or generated in many sectors has been growing exponentially because of the rapid development of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Additionally, the nature of this data is imbalanced. The need for extracting valuable information for decision support from this data poses a challenge to the scientific community to find a solution to cope with large imbalanced data. In previous work, our cost-sensitive differential evolution classification algorithm showed efficient performance for handling highly imbalanced data sets. However, our algorithm shows inefficient performance when applied to big data sets, thus lacking to scale with data size increases. In this paper, we design and implement a parallel version of our cost-sensitive differential evolution classifier using the Apache Spark framework (SCDE). The aim is to handle large and binary imbalanced data. The main idea of the algorithm is to find the optimal centroid for each target label using differential evolution by minimizing the total misclassification cost and then assign unlabeled data points to the closest centroid. Our experiments include a real data set that is based on intrusion detection in order to evaluate our algorithm&#39;s scalability and performance. The experimental results show that SCDE efficiently handles imbalanced binary data and scales very well with data size increases. Moreover, the speedup and scaleup results that are obtained by SCDE are close to linear.},

Theoretical analysis shows that the new scheme has an accuracy order of O ( τ 2 ) + O ( h 4 ), where τ is the time step and h is the grid size. Combined with Richardson extrapolation or Runge–Kutta method, the new method can be improved to 4th-order accuracy in time, which has been implemented and verified in this paper. Four numerical experiments are conducted to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the new scheme. The stability of the new scheme has been proved by an energy method, which shows that the new scheme is conditionally stable with a Currant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number which is slightly lower than that of the Padé approximation based method.

  abstract     = {The investigation of healthy and diseased muscle behavior via in silico analysis requires the modeling of biophysical processes on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Owing to the complexity of the phenomena in question, simultaneous simulations of all the processes across different scales are extremely computationally expensive. Therefore, many multi-scale models utilize simplified phenomenological models at the micro level. However, such models may not be able to predict transient contractile behavior accurately when the deformation is unsteady or non-uniform. To overcome these deficiencies of phenomenological models, we propose a novel multi-scale muscle model in which continuum muscle mechanics are modeled utilizing the finite element method , and the material characteristics of muscle tissues at the microscopic scale are defined by Huxley’s model of muscle contraction. Owing to the specific application of the sliding-filament theory coupled with the kinetic formulation of Gordon’s length-tension relationship, the proposed model can provide more precise simulations of muscle behavior under both isotonic and transient conditions. The proposed model is verified using both benchmark data and real-world examples, and the results are compared to corresponding predictions obtained using the FE-Hill model. Specific implementations of biophysical components at the muscle fiber scale are validated by comparing them to predictions obtained using a spatially explicit molecular model implemented on the MUSICO platform. To enable the execution of two-scale simulations in a reasonable timeframe, we utilize a custom-tailored parallelization platform called Mexie. The ability of the proposed model to describe tissue-scale motor system behavior and the efficiency of its parallel execution are demonstrated through simulations of tongue movement during the propulsive phase of human swallowing. In these simulations the tissue’s complex muscular structure is represented by a 2D finite element mesh. The proposed model provides tools for the scientific investigation of musculoskeletal disorders and facilitates the prospective development of clinical applications for characterizing neuromuscular disorders and monitoring disease progression during therapy.},

  abstract     = {In social network analysis , one of the important aspects is to identify the nodes that are vital to the information diffusion process such as viral marketing, worm propagation in a computer network, disease spreading, etc. The degree centrality measures only the local influence of a node whereas, others like closeness and betweenness capture the global impact. K-shell centrality uses the position/location of a node in the network to estimate its spreading ability. Most of the above techniques except degree perform well when the network is complete. The degree centrality does not require complete network information but fails to identify many important nodes due to limited use of only local information. In this paper, we propose a new measure namely “potential edge weight based k-shell degree neighborhood” centrality to rank the node&#39;s spreading ability without depending on the degree of completeness of the network. The proposed method uses node degree and k-shell index along with a derived network parameter to assign potential edge weights to the connecting links between two nodes. Information propagation is simulated using Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model and performance comparison of the proposed method is done using Kendall&#39;s rank correlation with other ranking techniques. Experiments on real network establish the superiority of the proposed method in identifying influential spreaders in comparison to a degree, k-shell and other standard ranking techniques. Computationally the proposed method is cost-effective even with large complex networks.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled electrophysiological-mechanical model with several free parameters that are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time. While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration in a bundle.},

  abstract     = {IP video traffic is forecast to be 82\% of all IP traffic by 2022. Traditionally, content distribution networks (CDN) were used extensively to meet quality of service levels for IP video services. To handle the dramatic growth in video traffic, CDN operators are migrating their infrastructure to the cloud and fog in order to leverage its greater availability and flexibility. For hyperscale deployments, energy consumption, cache placement, and resource availability can be analyzed using simulation in order to improve resource utilization and performance. Recently, a discrete-time simulator for modelling hierarchical virtual CDNs (vCDNs) was proposed with reduced memory requirements and increased performance using multi-core systems to cater for the scale and complexity of these networks. The first iteration of this discrete-time simulator featured a number of limitations impacting accuracy and applicability: it supports only tree-based topology structures, the results are computed per level, and requests of the same content differ only in time duration. In this paper, we present an improved simulation framework that (a) supports graph-based network topologies, (b) requests have been reconstituted for differentiation of requirements, and (c) statistics are now computed per site and network metrics per link, improving granularity and parallel performance. Moreover, we also propose a two phase optimization scheme that makes use of simulation outputs to guide the search for optimal cache placements. In order to evaluate our proposal, we simulate a vCDN network based on real traces obtained from the BT vCDN infrastructure, and analyze performance and scalability aspects.},

So in this work, an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to estimate the process and measurement noise covariance matrices of the Kalman filter to improve the performance of the sub – optimal filter. A fitness function is also proposed to achieve multi – dimensional optimization. Results are validated for both linear and nonlinear quadrotor attitude dynamics. Proposed method compared with optimization algorithms such as optimal Kalman filter, covariance – matrix adaptation evolution strategy and simulated annealing. Monte Carlo analysis showed that proposed algorithm is capable of tuning the state estimator better than the other algorithms.

This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks.

The proposed parallel implementation does not require any information exchange between the threads during the run, they just get/send the required information before/after the execution. This design allows for a flexible algorithm that can perform efficiently on both shared- and distributed-memory systems. Our implementation uses both OpenMP for parallel architectures and MPI for distributed environments, which can efficiently make use of both kind of systems. The performance of VS is extensively analyzed on four different computing infrastructures, varying the number of threads used on each considered architecture. In addition, we propose a simulator to accurately predict the performance of VS on any parallel system . Experimental results show that VS is able to make an efficient use of the available computing resources, showing good scalability properties on all studied architectures.},
