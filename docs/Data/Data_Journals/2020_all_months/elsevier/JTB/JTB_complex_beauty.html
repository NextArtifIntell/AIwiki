  abstract     = {After diagnosed in Wuhan, COVID-19 spread quickly in mainland China. Though the epidemic in regions outside Hubei in mainland China has maintained a degree of control, evaluating the effectiveness and timeliness of intervention strategies, and predicting the transmission risk of work resumption as well as lifting the lockdown in Hubei province remain urgent. A patch model reflecting the mobility of population between Hubei and regions outside Hubei is formulated, and parameterized based on multiple source data for Hubei and regions outside Hubei. The effective reproduction numbers for Hubei and regions outside Hubei are estimated as 3.59 and 3.26 before Jan 23rd, 2020, but decrease quickly since then and drop below 1 after Jan 31st and Jan 28th, 2020. It is predicted that the new infections in Hubei province will decrease to very low level in mid-March, and the final size is estimated to be about 68,500 cases. The simulations reveal that contact rate after work resumption or lifting the lockdown in Hubei plays a critical role in affecting the epidemic. If the contact rate could be kept at a relatively low level, work resumption starting as early as on March 2nd in Hubei province may not induce the secondary outbreak, and the daily new infectious cases can be controlled at a low level if the lockdown in Hubei is liftted after March 9th, otherwise both work resumption and lifting the lockdown in Hubei should be postponed.},

  abstract     = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the patchwork nature of disease epidemics, with infection spread dynamics varying wildly across countries and across states within the US. To explore this issue, we study and predict the spread of COVID-19 in Washtenaw County, MI, which is home to University of Michigan and Eastern Michigan University, and in close proximity to Detroit, MI, a major epicenter of the epidemic in Michigan. We apply a discrete and stochastic network-based modeling framework allowing us to track every individual in the county. In this framework, we construct contact networks based on synthetic population datasets specific for Washtenaw County that are derived from US Census datasets. We assign individuals to households, workplaces, schools, and group quarters (such as prisons or long term care facilities). In addition, we assign casual contacts to each individual at random. Using this framework, we explicitly simulate Michigan-specific government-mandated workplace and school closures as well as social distancing measures. We perform sensitivity analyses to identify key model parameters and mechanisms contributing to the observed disease burden in the three months following the first observed cases of COVID-19 in Michigan. We then consider several scenarios for relaxing restrictions and reopening workplaces to predict what actions would be most prudent. In particular, we consider the effects of 1) different timings for reopening, and 2) different levels of workplace vs. casual contact re-engagement. We find that delaying reopening does not reduce the magnitude of the second peak of cases, but only delays it. Reducing levels of casual contact, on the other hand, both delays and lowers the second peak. Through simulations and sensitivity analyses, we explore mechanisms driving the magnitude and timing of a second wave of infections upon re-opening. We find that the most significant factors are workplace and casual contacts and protective measures taken by infected individuals who have sought care. This model can be adapted to other US counties using synthetic population databases and data specific to those regions.},

  abstract     = {The Wnt signalling pathway plays an important role in development, disease, and normal tissue function. Mathematical models for Wnt signalling have predominantly focused on quantitatively predicting changes in steady-state β β -catenin concentrations (the main downstream protein regulated by canonical Wnt signalling). One of the genes targeted for expression by Wnt/ β β -catenin signalling is the negative Wnt regulator Axin2. Recently, a number of authors have indicated a potential theoretical role of Axin2 feedback to induce oscillatory behaviour in the pathway and this has been observed in a number of detailed mathematical models. Due to the complexity of these models, the investigations to date have been limited to numerical experiments and parameter sensitivity analyses. In this manuscript, we study the fundamental structure of the dynamical system underlying the Wnt signalling mechanism with Axin2 feedback to gain some insight into why and when oscillations occur in models with this structure. We semi-rigorously analyse three simple models and, for these models, gain deep understanding of the characteristic set of conditions that are necessary and sufficient for oscillations to be induced. We discuss the possible biological consequences of these findings for Wnt signalling pathway oscillations. They include; to promote oscillations (1) Keeping all other parameters constant, the Wnt signal strength should neither be too high or too low but within a single finite window of values, (2) Wnt receptor complexes should fully deactivate Axin rather than temporarily deconstruct it from other scaffold proteins , (3) In the absence of stochastic effects or more complicated mechanisms, a critical delay in Axin2 feedback in the system is necessary, (4) Deactivation of Axin by the Wnt receptor complex needs to be critically efficient relative to β β -catenin removal by Axin, and (5) conditions necessary are less strict if Axin2 feedback occurs after a fixed time rather than a Poisson-distributed time with the same average.},

The Moon Illusion is a paradigmatic example that has yet to be accounted for. The Moon often appears larger near the perceptual horizon and smaller high in the sky, though the visual angle subtended is invariant. We show how this illusion can result from the optimization of a 3D projective geometrical frame through free energy minimization, following the principles of the Projective Consciousness Model. The model accounts for all documented modulations of the illusion without anomalies (e.g., the “size-distance paradox”), surpasses other theories in explanatory power, makes sense of inter- and intra-subjective variability vis-à-vis the illusion, and yields new quantitative and qualitative predictions. Empirical data from a virtual reality experiment support the predictions of the model. We also discuss how the model suggests explanations for other relevant illusions, concerning objects both at far and nearer distances, including the sky dome illusion, illusions of perceived size observed in the context of crowding experiments, and the Ames Room illusion.},

  abstract     = {Akt/PKB regulates numerous processes in the mammalian cell, including cell survival and proliferation, and glucose uptake in response to insulin. Abnormalities in Akt signalling are linked to the development of Type 2 diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, and cancer. In the absence of insulin, Akt is predominantly found in the inactive state in the cytosol. Following insulin stimulation, Akt translocates to the plasma membrane, docks, and is phosphorylated to take on the active conformation. In turn, the activated Akt travels to and phosphorylates its many downstream substrates. Although crucial to the activation process, the translocation of Akt from the cytosol to the plasma membrane is currently not well understood. Here we detail the parameter optimisation of a mathematical model of Akt translocation to experimental data. We have quantified the time delay between the application of insulin and the downstream Akt translocation response, indicating the constraints on the timing of the intermediate processes. A delay of approximately 0.4 0.4 min prior to the Akt response was determined for the application of 1 nM insulin to cells in the basal state, whereas it was found that a further transition from physiological insulin to higher stimuli did not incur a delay. Furthermore, our investigation indicates that the dominant processes regulating the appearance of Akt at the plasma membrane differ with the insulin level. For physiological insulin, the rate limiting step was the release of Akt to the plasma membrane in response to the insulin signal. In contrast, at high insulin levels, regulation of the recycling of Akt from the plasma membrane to the cytosol was also required.},

  abstract     = {It is becoming widely accepted that very early in life’s origin, even before the emergence of genetic encoding, reaction networks of diverse small chemicals might have manifested key properties of life, namely self-propagation and adaptive evolution. To explore this possibility, we formalize the dynamics of chemical reaction networks within the framework of chemical ecosystem ecology. To capture the idea that life-like chemical systems are maintained out of equilibrium by fluxes of energy-rich food chemicals, we model chemical ecosystems in well-mixed compartments that are subject to constant dilution by a solution with a fixed concentration of input chemicals. Modelling all chemical reactions as fully reversible, we show that seeding an autocatalytic cycle with tiny amounts of one or more of its member chemicals results in logistic growth of all member chemicals in the cycle. This finding justifies drawing an instructive analogy between an autocatalytic cycle and a biological species. We extend this finding to show that pairs of autocatalytic cycles can exhibit competitive, predator-prey, or mutualistic associations just like biological species. Furthermore, when there is stochasticity in the environment, particularly in the seeding of autocatalytic cycles, chemical ecosystems can show complex dynamics that can resemble evolution. The evolutionary character is especially clear when the network architecture results in ecological precedence, which makes a system’s trajectory historically contingent on the order in which cycles are seeded. For all its simplicity, the framework developed here helps explain the onset of adaptive evolution in prebiotic chemical reaction networks, and can shed light on the origin of key biological attributes such as thermodynamic irreversibility and genetic encoding.},

  abstract     = {We derive how directional and disruptive selection operate on scalar traits in a heterogeneous group-structured population for a general class of models. In particular, we assume that each group in the population can be in one of a finite number of states, where states can affect group size and/or other environmental variables, at a given time. Using up to second-order perturbation expansions of the invasion fitness of a mutant allele, we derive expressions for the directional and disruptive selection coefficients, which are sufficient to classify the singular strategies of adaptive dynamics. These expressions include first- and second-order perturbations of individual fitness (expected number of settled offspring produced by an individual, possibly including self through survival); the first-order perturbation of the stationary distribution of mutants (derived here explicitly for the first time); the first-order perturbation of pairwise relatedness; and reproductive values, pairwise and three-way relatedness, and stationary distribution of mutants, each evaluated under neutrality. We introduce the concept of individual k -fitness (defined as the expected number of settled offspring of an individual for which k - 1 k-1 randomly chosen neighbors are lineage members) and show its usefulness for calculating relatedness and its perturbation. We then demonstrate that the directional and disruptive selection coefficients can be expressed in terms individual k -fitnesses with k = 1 , 2 , 3 k=1,2,3 only. This representation has two important benefits. First, it allows for a significant reduction in the dimensions of the system of equations describing the mutant dynamics that needs to be solved to evaluate explicitly the two selection coefficients. Second, it leads to a biologically meaningful interpretation of their components. As an application of our methodology, we analyze directional and disruptive selection in a lottery model with either hard or soft selection and show that many previous results about selection in group-structured populations can be reproduced as special cases of our model.},

However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.},

  abstract     = {The RNA world hypothesis, although a viable one regarding the origin of life on earth, has so far failed to provide a compelling explanation for the synthesis of RNA enzymes from free nucleotides via abiotic processes. To tackle this long-standing problem, we develop a realistic model for the onset of the RNA world, using experimentally determined rates for polymerization reactions. We start with minimal assumptions about the initial state that only requires the presence of short oligomers or just free nucleotides and consider the effects of environmental cycling by dividing a day into a dry, semi-wet and wet phases that are distinguished by the nature of reactions they support. Long polymers, with maximum lengths sometimes exceeding 100 nucleotides, spontaneously emerge due to a combination of non-enzymatic, non-templated polymer extension and template-directed primer extension processes. The former helps in increasing the lengths of RNA strands, whereas the later helps in producing complementary copies of the strands. Strands also undergo hydrolysis in a structure-dependent manner that favour breaking of bonds connecting unpaired nucleotides. We identify the most favourable conditions needed for the emergence of ribozyme and tRNA-like structures and double stranded RNA molecules, classify all RNA strands on the basis of their secondary structures and determine their abundance in the population. Our results indicate that under suitable environmental conditions, non-enzymatic processes would have been sufficient to lead to the emergence of a variety of ribozyme-like molecules with complex secondary structures and potential catalytic functions.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary game theory is a powerful method for modelling animal conflicts. The original evolutionary game models were used to explain specific biological features of interest, such as the existence of ritualised contests, and were necessarily simple models that ignored many properties of real populations, including the duration of events and spatial and related structural effects. Both of these areas have subsequently received much attention. Spatial and structural effects have been considered in evolutionary graph theory, and a significant body of literature has been built up to deal with situations where the population is not homogeneous. More recently a theory of time constraints has been developed to take account of the fact that different events can take different times, and that interaction times can explicitly depend upon selected strategies, which can, in turn, influence the distribution of different opponent types within the population. Here, for the first time, we build a model of time constraint games which explicitly considers a spatial population, by considering a population evolving on an underlying graph, using two graph dynamics, birth–death and death-birth. We consider one short time scale along which frequencies of pairs and singles change as individuals interact with their neighbours, and another, evolutionary time scale, along which frequencies of strategies change in the population. We show that for graphs with large degree, both dynamics reproduce recent results from well-mixed time constraint models, including two ESSs being common in Hawk-Dove and Prisoner’s Dilemma games, but for low degree there can be marked differences. For birth–death processes the effect of the graph degree is small, whereas for death-birth dynamics there is a large effect. The general prediction for both Hawk-Dove and Prisoner’s dilemma games is that as the graph degree decreases, i.e., as the number of neighbours decreases, mixed ESS do appear. In particular, for the Prisoner’s dilemma game this means that cooperation is easier to establish in situations where individuals have low number of neighbours. We thus see that solutions depend non-trivially on the combination of graph degree, dynamics and game.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, numerous studies have investigated the modeling of efficient neural encoding processes in the retina of the eye to encode the sensory data. Retina, as the innermost coat of the eye, is the first and the most important area of the visual neural system of mammalians, which is responsible for neural processes. Retina encodes the information of light intensity into a sequence of spikes, and sends them to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) for further processing. An appropriate retinal encoding model should be adapted to the real retina as much as possible by considering the physiological constraints of the visual pathway to transfer most of the information of the input signal to the brain without too much redundancy of the channel. In this paper, inspired from the existing linear models of retinal encoding process, which have employed input noise and the spatial locality of the RGCs receptive fields (RFs) in the calculation of the encoding matrix, two extra physiological constraints, adapted from the real retina are taken into account so as to achieve a more realistic model for the mammalian retina. These new constraints that are the correlation between RGCs and the spatial locality of the photoreceptors’ projective fields (PFs), are modeled in a mathematical form and analyzed in detail. To quantify fidelity of the proposed encoding matrix and prove its superiority over existing models, various parameters of the models are calculated and presented in this paper: mean square error between the original and reconstructed image (MSE), the redundancy of the channel, the amount of information transferred through the channel, and the amount of wasted capacity for carrying input noise, to name a few. The results of these calculations show that the proposed model transfers input information with less redundancy of the channel. In other words, it reduces a portion of channel capacity which is wasted for carrying the input noise in comparison to the existing models. Also, due to considering extra physiological constraints in the proposed model, it is acceptable to have a slightly higher amount of MSE value in order to become similar to the real retina.},

  abstract     = {Riboswitches are cis-acting regulatory mRNA elements in bacteria, that modulate the expression of their associated genes in response to a cognate metabolite, operating either on the level of translation or transcription. Transcriptional riboswitches have to fold into functional structures as they are being synthesized and, only if transcription rates and ligand binding kinetics match, structured transcription intermediates are enabled to undergo ligand-dependent conformational refolding as a prerequisite for ligand-mediated gene expression. Therefore, transcription rates are of essential importance for functional riboswitch-mediated gene regulation. Here, we propose a generalized modeling framework for the kinetic mechanisms of transcriptional riboswitches. The formalism accommodates time-dependent transcription rates and changes of metabolite concentration and permits incorporation of variations in transcription rate depending on transcript length. We derive explicit analytical expressions for the fraction of transcripts that determine repression or activation of gene expression as a function of pause site location and its slowing down of transcription for the case of the (2’dG)-sensing riboswitch from Mesoplasma florum . Our modeling challenges the current view on the exclusive importance of metabolite binding to transcripts containing only the aptamer domain. Numerical simulations of transcription proceeding in a continuous manner under time-dependent changes of metabolite concentration further suggest that rapid modulations in concentration result in a reduced dynamic range for riboswitch function regardless of transcription rate, while a combination of slow modulations and small transcription rates ensures a wide range of finely tuneable regulatory outcomes.},

This treatment uses genetically engineered viruses which selectively infect, replicate in, and destroy cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Furthermore, current research and clinical trials have indicated that these viruses can be delivered as single agents or in combination with other therapies. In this paper, we propose systems of ordinary differential equations for modeling the dynamics of aggressive tumor growth under radiovirotherapy treatment. We divide the treatment period into two phases; consequently, we present two mathematical models. First, we formulate the virotherapy model as Phase I of the treatment. Then we extend the model to include radiotherapy in combination with virotherapy as Phase II of the treatment. Comprehensive qualitative analyses of both models are conducted. Furthermore, numerical experiments are performed in order to support the analytical results. An analysis of the parameters is also carried out to investigate their effects on the outcome of the treatment. Overall, the analytical results reveal that radiovirotherapy is more effective than, and a good alternative to, virotherapy, as it is capable of eradicating tumors completely.},

  abstract     = {Progress in shortening the duration of tuberculosis (TB) treatment is hampered by the lack of a predictive model that accurately reflects the diverse environment within the lung. This is important as TB has been shown to produce distinct localisations to different areas of the lung during different disease stages, with the environmental heterogeneity within the lung of factors such as air ventilation, blood perfusion and oxygen tension believed to contribute to the apical localisation witnessed during the post-primary form of the disease. Building upon our previous model of environmental lung heterogeneity, we present a networked metapopulation model that simulates TB across the whole lung, incorporating these notions of environmental heterogeneity across the whole TB life-cycle to show how different stages of the disease are influenced by different environmental and immunological factors. The alveolar tissue in the lung is divided into distinct patches, with each patch representing a portion of the total tissue and containing environmental attributes that reflect the internal conditions at that location. We include populations of bacteria and immune cells in various states, and events are included which determine how the members of the model interact with each other and the environment. By allowing some of these events to be dependent on environmental attributes, we create a set of heterogeneous dynamics, whereby the location of the tissue within the lung determines the disease pathological events that occur there. Our results show that the environmental heterogeneity within the lung is a plausible driving force behind the apical localisation during post-primary disease. After initial infection, bacterial levels will grow in the initial infection location at the base of the lung until an adaptive immune response is initiated. During this period, bacteria are able to disseminate and create new lesions throughout the lung. During the latent stage, the lesions that are situated towards the apex are the largest in size, and once a post-primary immune-suppressing event occurs, it is the uppermost lesions that reach the highest levels of bacterial proliferation. Our sensitivity analysis also shows that it is the differential in blood perfusion, causing reduced immune activity towards the apex, which has the biggest influence of disease outputs.},

  abstract     = {Infectious disease epidemics present a difficult task for policymakers, requiring the implementation of control strategies under significant time constraints and uncertainty. Mathematical models can be used to predict the outcome of control interventions, providing useful information to policymakers in the event of such an epidemic. However, these models suffer in the early stages of an outbreak from a lack of accurate, relevant information regarding the dynamics and spread of the disease and the efficacy of control. As such, recommendations provided by these models are often incorporated in an ad hoc fashion, as and when more reliable information becomes available. In this work, we show that such trial-and-error-type approaches to management, which do not formally take into account the resolution of uncertainty and how control actions affect this, can lead to sub-optimal management outcomes. We compare three approaches to managing a theoretical epidemic: a non-adaptive management (AM) approach that does not use real-time outbreak information to adapt control, a passive AM approach that incorporates real-time information if and when it becomes available, and an active AM approach that explicitly incorporates the future resolution of uncertainty through gathering real-time information into its initial recommendations. The structured framework of active AM encourages the specification of quantifiable objectives, models of system behaviour and possible control and monitoring actions, followed by an iterative learning and control phase that is able to employ complex control optimisations and resolve system uncertainty. The result is a management framework that is able to provide dynamic, long-term projections to help policymakers meet the objectives of management. We investigate in detail the effect of different methods of incorporating up-to-date outbreak information. We find that, even in a highly simplified system, the method of incorporating new data can lead to different results that may influence initial policy decisions, with an active AM approach to management providing better information that can lead to more desirable outcomes from an epidemic.},

Here, we theoretically investigate how the variance and autocorrelation length of primary production affect properties of evolved food webs consisting of one autotroph and several heterotrophs . We report the following findings. (1) Diversity increases with landscape variance and is unimodal in autocorrelation length. (2) Trophic level increases with landscape variance and is unimodal in autocorrelation length. (3) The extent to which the spatial distribution of heterotrophs differ from that of the autotroph increases with landscape variance and decreases with autocorrelation length. (4) Components of initial disruptive selection experienced by the ancestral heterotroph predict properties of the final evolved communities. Prior to our study reported here, several authors had hypothesized that diversity increases with the landscape variance of productivity. Our results support their hypothesis and contribute new facets by providing quantitative predictions that also account for autocorrelation length and additional properties of the evolved communities.},

Since recombinant ACE2 protein has been suggested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent, this study was conducted to design an ACE2 protein with more desirable properties. In this regard, the amino acids with central roles in enzymatic activity of the ACE2 were substituted. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis at the interaction interface between the ACE2 and RBD was performed to increase their interaction affinity. The best mutations to increase the structural and thermal stability of the ACE2 were also selected based on B factors and mutation effects. The obtained resulted revealed that the Arg273Gln and Thr445Gly mutation have drastically reduced the binding affinity of the angiotensin-II into the active site of ACE2. The Thr27Arg mutation was determined to be the most potent mutation to increase the binding affinity. The Asp427Arg mutation was done to decrease the flexibility of the region with high B factor. The Pro451Met mutation along with the Gly448Trp mutation was predicted to increase the thermodynamic stability and thermostability of the ACE2. The designed therapeutic ACE2 would have no enzymatic activity while it could bear stronger interaction with Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased in vivo enzymatic degradation would be anticipated due to increased thermostability. This engineered ACE2 could be exploited as a novel therapeutic agent against COVID-19 after necessary evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring global cooperation often poses governance problems shadowed by the tragedy of the commons, as wrong-doers enjoy the benefits set up by right-doers at no cost. Institutional punishment of wrong-doers is well-known to curtail their impetus as free-riders. However, institutions often have limited scope in imposing sanctions, more so when these are strict and potentially viewed as disproportionate. Inspired by the design principles proposed by the late Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom, here we study the evolution and impact of a new form of institutional sanctioning, where punishment is graduated, growing with the incidence of free-riding. We develop an analytical model capable of identifying the conditions under which this design principle is conducive to the self-organization of stable institutions and cooperation. We employ evolutionary game theory in finite populations and non-linear public goods dilemmas in the presence of risk of global losses whose solution requires the self-organization of decision makers into an overall cooperative state. We show that graduated punishment is more effective in promoting widespread cooperation than conventional forms of punishment studied to date, being also less severe and thus, presumably, easier to implement. This effect is enhanced whenever the costs of its implementation are positively correlated with the severity of punishment. We frame our model within the context of the global reduction of carbon emissions, but the results are shown to be general enough to be applicable to other collective action problems, shedding further light into the origins of Human institutions.},

In the absence of vaccination, or when vaccine efficacy is poor, social distancing may help to curb the spread of new virus strains. However, both vaccination and social distancing are associated with various costs. It is critical to consider these costs in addition to the benefits of these strategies when determining the optimal rates of application of control strategies. We developed a game-theoretic epidemiological model that considers vaccination and social distancing under the assumption that individuals pursue the maximization of payoffs. By using this model, we identified the individually optimal strategy based on the Nash strategy when both strategies are available and when only one strategy is available. Furthermore, we determined the relative costs of control strategies at which individuals preferentially adopt vaccination over social distancing (or vice versa).},

We first show that the introduction of density-dependent movement in the form of two parameters, a perception radius and a probability of directed movement, leads to the formation of clusters. We then show that the properties of the clusters and their stability over time are different between populations of Brownian and non-Brownian walkers and are also dependent on the choice of parameters. Finally, we consider the effect of the probability of directed movement on the temporal stability of clusters and show that while clusters formed by Brownian and non-Brownian walkers may have similar properties with certain parameter sets, the spatio-temporal dynamics remain different.},

Here, we develop a functional response using timescale separation. A prey-dependent catch rate represents the group defense. The resulting functional response contains a single parameter that controls whether the group defense functional response is saturating or dome-shaped. Based on that, we show that the catch rate must not increase monotonically with increasing prey density to lead to a dome-shaped functional response. We apply bifurcation analysis to show that non-monotonic group defense is usually more successful. However, we also find parameter regions in which a paradox occurs. In this case, higher group defense can give rise to a stable limit cycle, while for lower values, the predator would go extinct. The study does not only provide valuable insight on how to include functional responses representing group defense in mathematical models, but it also clarifies under which circumstances the usage of different functional responses is appropriate.},

  abstract     = {Adoptive T cell based immunotherapy is gaining significant traction in cancer treatment. Despite its limited efficacy so far in treating solid tumors compared to hematologic cancers, recent advances in T cell engineering render this treatment increasingly more successful in solid tumors, demonstrating its broader therapeutic potential. In this paper we develop a mathematical model to study the efficacy of engineered T cell receptor (TCR) T cell therapy targeting the E7 antigen in cervical cancer cell lines. We consider a dynamical system that follows the population of cancer cells, TCR T cells , and IL-2 treatment concentration. We demonstrate that there exists a TCR T cell dosage window for a successful cancer elimination that can be expressed in terms of the initial tumor size. We obtain the TCR T cell dose for two cervical cancer cell lines: 4050 and CaSki. Finally, a combination therapy of TCR T cell and IL-2 treatment is studied. We show that certain treatment protocols can improve therapy responses in the 4050 cell line, but not in the CaSki cell line.},

  abstract     = {Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) is widely distributed in the pig population in many countries, where its presence is undesirable, because as an opportunistic human pathogen, it poses a threat to human health. At present, there is a lack of knowledge regarding successful methods for eradication of LA-MRSA on a pig farm, which does not involve emptying the farm and culling all pigs. Some studies have reported an association between levels of LA-MRSA in the barn air and LA-MRSA carriage among humans entering or working in the pig barns. Therefore, interventions that are able to reduce the amount of LA-MRSA carried by the pigs and/or the concentration of LA-MRSA in the barn air, might be highly relevant if aiming for reducing the spread of LA-MRSA into the general human population. In the present study, an existing agent-based simulation model for spread of LA-MRSA within a pig herd was extended to also include LA-MRSA load and spread through air. This makes it possible to use the model for studying the air exposure to LA-MRSA for humans entering the pig barns. The model was used for simulating various types of interventions in contaminated herds. At present quantitative data for nasal carriage of LA-MRSA in pigs are sparse, and many knowledge gaps regarding spread of LA-MRSA remain. Thus, our goal of building this model was not to provide exact values for risk reduction, but to avail a model that can be used for studying the effect of various types of interventions mechanistically, once more relevant data become available. Collection of more data on the influence of load is crucial for getting a better understanding of which possible interventions strategies, that might still have some potential in countries, where LA-MRSA has already spread to the majority of the pig population.},

  abstract     = {The cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells plays several crucial roles. In terms of intracellular transport, motor proteins use the cytoskeletal filaments as a backbone along which they can actively transport biological cargos such as vesicles carrying biochemical reactants. Crossings between such filaments constitute a key element, as they may serve to alter the destination of such payload. Although motor proteins are known to display a rich behaviour at such crossings, the latter have so far only been modelled as simple branching points. Here we explore a model for a crossing between two microtubules which retains the individual tracks consisting of protofilaments, and we construct a schematic representation of the transport paths. We study collective transport exemplified by the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP), and provide a full analysis of the transport features and the associated phase diagram, by a generic mean-field approach which we confirm through particle-based stochastic simulations. In particular we show that transport through such a compound crossing cannot be approximated from a coarse-grained structure with a simple branching point. Instead, it gives rise to entirely new and counterintuitive features: the fundamental current-density relation for traffic flow is no longer a single-valued function, and it furthermore differs according to whether it is observed upstream or downstream from the crossing. We argue that these novel features may be directly relevant for interpreting experimental measurements.},

Therefore, this paper presents a new essential proteins prediction strategy, called DEP-MSB which integrates a variety of biological information including gene expression profiles, GO annotations, and Domain interaction strength. In order to evaluate the performance of DEP-MSB, we conduct a series of experiments on the yeast PPI network and the experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm DEP-MSB is more superior to the other existing traditional methods and has obviously improvement in prediction accuracy.},

We also observe heterogeneous patterns of Hes1, miR-9 and other molecular species in various two dimensional parameter spaces and found that the variability in the patterns is triggered by Hill coefficient and Hes1 stress signal.

  abstract     = {Adult humans exhibit high interindividual variation in habitual sleep durations, with short sleepers typically sleeping less than 6 h per night and long sleepers typically sleeping more than 9 h per night. Analysis of the time course of homeostatic sleep drive in habitual short and long sleepers has not identified differences between these groups, leading to the hypothesis that habitual short sleep results from increased tolerance to high levels of homeostatic sleep drive. Using a physiologically-based mathematical model of the sleep-wake regulatory network, we investigate responses to acute sleep deprivation in simulated populations of habitual long, regular and short sleepers that differ in daily levels of homeostatic sleep drive. The model predicts timing and durations of wake, rapid eye movement (REM), and non-REM (NREM) sleep episodes as modulated by the homeostatic sleep drive and the circadian rhythm, which is entrained to an external light cycle. Model parameters are fit to experimental measures of baseline sleep durations to construct simulated populations of individuals of each sleeper type. The simulated populations are validated against data for responses to specific acute sleep deprivation protocols. We use the model to predict responses to a wide range of sleep deprivation durations for each sleeper type. Model results predict that all sleeper types exhibit shorter sleep durations during recovery sleep that occurs in the morning, but, for recovery sleep times occurring later in the day, long and regular sleepers show longer and more variable sleep durations, and can suffer longer lasting disruption of daily sleep patterns compared to short sleepers. Additionally, short sleepers showed more resilience to sleep deprivation with longer durations of waking episodes following recovery sleep. These results support the hypothesis that differential responses to sleep deprivation between short and long sleepers result from differences in the tolerance for homeostatic sleep pressure.},

Lots of electrophysiological experiments have verified the correlation between absence seizures and RE, however, the dynamical mechanisms are not well understood. Based on previous Taylor model, we firstly study the effects of external input and self-inhibition of RE on epilepsy transition. We show that increasing external input and self-inhibition of RE can lead the system from epileptic state to normal state, and vice versa. Next, we explore two stimulus strategies added in RE and various transition behaviors can be induced, such as high saturated state to clonic. Meanwhile, as the intensity of stimulation increasing, they can not only suppress the SWD, but also produce tonic–clonic oscillation. Finally, the control of DBS on single neuron cluster and two neuron clusters are compared and we find stimulating RE and TC simultaneously is a superior mode to stimulate anyone of RE or TC. It is hoped that the results we obtained will have an enlightenment on clinical treatment.},

Experimental evidence in neutrophils indicates that membrane tension plays an important role in the confinement of active Rac to the front domain. We suggest a mechanochemical model for polarization, including Rho GTPase mediated actomyosin cytoskeleton dynamics and changes in membrane tension as an upstream controller of Rho GTP that reflects this observation. The model comprises the Rho GTPases Rac and RhoA which can become activated in response to external signals. The active states regulate the actomyosin mechanics. The model cell is considered as a thin, effectively two dimensional, sheet adhering to a flat substrate. Morphological changes of the actomyosin cytoskeleton induce changes in membrane tension. We numerically show that the model exhibits key features of neutrophil polarization. The model accounts for a simple mechanochemical circuit with the ability to generate robust polarity patterns, wherein cell mechanics serve as a long range signal transmitter.},

In this study we develop a two compartment model to account for the Ca 2+ dynamics in frog skeletal muscle fibers. The two compartments in the model correspond to the SR and the cytoplasm, where the myofibrils are placed. We use a detailed model for the several Ca 2+ binding proteins in the cytoplasm in line with previous models. As a new feature, Ca 2+ binding sites within the SR, attributed to calsequestrin, are modeled based on experimentally obtained properties. The intra SR Ca 2+ buffer shows cooperativity, well represented by a Hill equation with parameters that depend on the initial [Ca 2+ ] in the SR ([Ca 2+ ] SR ). The number of total sites as well as the [Ca 2+ ] SR of half saturation are reduced as the resting [Ca 2+ ] SR is reduced, on the other hand the Hill number is not changed. The buffer power remained roughly constant. The release process is activated by a voltage dependent mechanism that increases the Ca 2+ permeability of the SR. We use the permeability time course and amplitude experimentally obtained during a voltage clamp pulse to drive the simulations. This model successfully reproduces the SR and cytoplasmic transients observed. Additionally, we simulate [Ca 2+ ] SR transients in the case of high concentration of extrinsic Ca 2+ buffers added to the cytoplasm to explore what properties of the permeability are necessary to account for the experimentally observed [Ca 2+ ] SR transients. The main novelty of the model, the intra SR Ca 2+ buffer, is crucial for reproducing the experimental observations and it would be of use in future theoretical studies of excitation contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.},

We develop a simple mechanistic model of the coupled degradation of all cell mRNAs using the total quasi-steady-state approximation of the Michaelis–Menten framework. Numerical simulations of the model using carefully chosen parameters and analyses of rate sensitivity coefficients show how substrate competition alters mRNA decay. The model predictions reproduce and explain a number of experimental observations on mRNA decay following transcription arrest, such as delays before the onset of degradation, the occurrence of variable degradation profiles with increased non linearities and the negative correlation between mRNA half-life and concentration. The competition acts at different levels, through the initial concentration of cell mRNAs and by modifying the enzyme affinity for its targets. The consequence is a global slow down of mRNA decay due to enzyme titration and the amplification of its apparent affinity. Competition happens to stabilize weakly affine mRNAs and to destabilize the most affine ones. We believe that this mechanistic model is an interesting alternative to the exponential models commonly used for the determination of mRNA half-lives. It allows analysing regulatory mechanisms of mRNA degradation and its predictions are directly comparable to experimental data.},

  abstract     = {In the context of voluntary vaccination, we consider two additional provisions as well as pre-emptive vaccination for a unified model over epidemiology and evolutionary game theory to assess the extent to which advanced and late provisions restrict the spread of disease. To circumvent infection, people can be vaccinated pre-emptively before the epidemic season, but the imperfectness of vaccination or an unwillingness to be vaccinated may cause people instead to either be late-vaccinated or use self-protection. Here, self-protection corresponds to actions such as wearing a mask, washing hands, or using a mosquito net and is defined as the third strategy after pre-emptive vaccination (the first strategy) and late-vaccination (the second strategy). Our model can reproduce multiple social dilemma situations resulting from what is known as the vaccination dilemma (originating from preemptive vaccination), which works on a global time scale (i.e., repeated seasons approaching social equilibrium), and also from two other dilemmas due to late provisions, which work on a local time scale (i.e., every time step in a single season). To reproduce how an individual can acquire information for adaptation from neighbors or the society for a suitable provision, we introduce several strategy-updating rules for both global and local time scales and this behavioral feedback has a significant effect to reducing a transmissible disease. We also establish the social efficiency deficit (SED) indicator for a triple-dilemma game to quantify the existence of a social dilemma. Relying fully on a theoretical framework, our model provides a new perspective for evaluations: (i) how much more advantageous and effective pre-emptive vaccination is in eradicating a communicable disease compared with late provisions such as late vaccination and self-protection, and (ii) the extent of the social dilemma resulting from each of the three provisions, given the new idea of SED. The main effect of the triple-dilemma is that expensive provision displays no SED (no dilemma) until the efficiency or effectiveness of provisions reaches a certain level.},

The mechanisms underlying repetitive Ca 2 + oscillations and how these mechanisms regulate these oscillations is not fully understood. Recent experimental evidence has shown that both Ca 2 + regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) receptor and IP 3 metabolism generate Ca 2 + oscillations and co-exist in hepatocytes. To investigate the effects of these feedback mechanisms on the Ca 2 + response, we construct a mathematical model of the Ca 2 + signalling network in hepatocytes. The model accounts for the biphasic regulation of Ca 2 + on the IP 3 receptor ( IP 3 R ) and the positive feedback from Ca 2 + on IP 3 metabolism, via activation of phospholipase C (PLC) by agonist and Ca 2 + . Model simulations show that Ca 2 + oscillations exist for both constant [ IP 3 ] and for [ IP 3 ] changing dynamically. We show, both experimentally and in the model, that as agonist concentration increases, Ca 2 + oscillations transition between simple narrow-spike oscillations and complex broad-spike oscillations. The model predicts that narrow-spike oscillations persist when Ca 2 + transport across the plasma membrane is blocked. This prediction has been experimentally validated. In contrast, broad-spike oscillations are terminated when plasma membrane transport is blocked. We conclude that multiple feedback mechanisms participate in regulating Ca 2 + oscillations in hepatocytes.},

  abstract     = {An organism’s genomic base composition is usually summarized by its AT or GC content due to Chargaff’s parity laws. Variation in prokaryotic GC content can be substantial between taxa but is generally small within microbial genomes. This variation has been found to correlate with both phylogeny and environmental factors. Since novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genomes are at least partially linked to the environment through natural selection, SNP GC content can be considered a compound measure of an organism’s environmental influences, lifestyle, phylogeny as well as other more or less random processes. While there are several models describing genomic GC content few, if any, consider AT/GC mutation rates subjected to random perturbations. We present a mathematical model that describes how GC content in microbial genomes evolves over time as a function of the AT → GC and GC → AT mutation rates with Gaussian white noise disturbances. The model, which is suited specifically to non-recombining vertically transmitted prokaryotic symbionts , suggests that small differences in the AT/GC mutation rates can lead to profound differences in outcome due to the ensuing stochastic process. In other words, the model indicates that time to extinction could be a consequence of the mutation rate trajectory on which the symbiont embarked early on in its evolutionary history.},

We build a model of sublethal disease effects where hosts are able to choose to engage in prophylactic measures that reduce the likelihood of disease transmission. This choice is mediated by utility costs and benefits associated with prophylaxis, and the fraction of hosts engaged in prophylaxis is also affected by population dynamics. When prophylactic host behaviour occurs, we find that the level of pathogen host exploitation is reduced, by the action of selection, relative to the level that would otherwise be predicted in the absence of prophylaxis. Our work emphasizes the significance of the transmission-recovery trade-off faced by the pathogen and the ability of the pathogen to influence host prophylactic behaviour.},

  abstract     = {The cancer stem cell hypothesis claims that tumor growth and progression are driven by a (typically) small niche of the total cancer cell population called cancer stem cells (CSCs). These CSCs can go through symmetric or asymmetric divisions to differentiate into specialised, progenitor cells or reproduce new CSCs. While it was once held that this differentiation pathway was unidirectional, recent research has demonstrated that differentiated cells are more plastic than initially considered. In particular, differentiated cells can de-differentiate and recover their stem-like capacity. Two recent papers have considered how this rate of plasticity affects the evolutionary dynamic of an invasive, malignant population of stem cells and differentiated cells into existing tissue (Mahdipour-Shirayeh et al., 2017; Wodarz, 2018). These papers arrive at seemingly opposing conclusions, one claiming that increased plasticity results in increased invasive potential, and the other that increased plasticity decreases invasive potential. Here, we show that what is most important, when determining the effect on invasive potential, is how one distributes this increased plasticity between the compartments of resident and mutant-type cells. We also demonstrate how these results vary, producing non-monotone fixation probability curves, as inter-compartmental plasticity changes when differentiated cell compartments are allowed to continue proliferating, highlighting a fundamental difference between the two models. We conclude by demonstrating the stability of these qualitative results over various parameter ranges. Keywords: cancer stem cells, plasticity, de-differentiation, fixation probability.},

Strategies by which resistance can be slowed are necessary to prolong the effectiveness of the remaining modes of action. Here we use a flexible mathematical model of resistance evolution to compare four insecticide application strategies: (i) applying one insecticide until failure, then switching to a second insecticide (sequential application), (ii) mixing two insecticides at their full label doses, (iii) rotating (alternating) two insecticides at full label dose, or (iv) mixing two insecticides at a reduced dose (with each mixture component at half the full label dose). The model represents target-site resistance. Multiple simulations were run representing different insect life-histories and insecticide characteristics. The analysis shows that none of the strategies examined were optimal for all the simulations. The four strategies: reduced dose mixture, label dose mixture, sequential application and label dose rotation, were optimal in 52\%, 22\%, 20\% and 6\% of simulations respectively. The most important trait determining the optimal strategy in a single simulation was whether or not the insect pest underwent sexual reproduction. For asexual insects, sequential application was most frequently the optimal strategy, while a label-dose mixture was rarely optimal. Conversely, for sexual insects a mixture was nearly always the optimal strategy, with reduced dose mixture being optimal twice as frequently as label dose mixture. When sequential application of insecticides is not an option, reduced dose mixture is most frequently the optimal strategy whatever an insect’s reproduction.},

  abstract     = {Classic bimatrix games, that are based on pair-wise interactions between two opponents belonging to different populations, do not consider the cost of time. In this article, we build on an old idea that lost opportunity costs affect individual fitness. We calculate fitnesses of each strategy for a two-strategy bimatrix game at the equilibrium distribution of the pair formation process that includes activity times. This general approach is then applied to the Battle of the Sexes game where we analyze the evolutionary outcome by finding the Nash equilibria (NE) of this time-constrained game when courtship and child rearing costs are measured by time lost. While the classic Battle of the Sexes game has either a unique strict NE (specifically, all males exhibit Philanderer behavior and either all females are Coy or all are Fast depending on model parameters), or a unique interior NE where both sexes exhibit mixed behavior, including time costs for courtship and child rearing changes this prediction. First, (Philanderer, Coy) is never a NE. Second, if the benefit of having offspring is independent of parental strategies, (Philanderer, Fast) is the unique strict NE but a second stable interior NE emerges when courtship time is sufficiently short. In fact, as courtship time becomes shorter, this mixed NE (where most males are Faithful and the Coy female population is increasing) attracts almost all initial population configurations. Third, this latter promotion of marital bliss also occurs when parents who share in child rearing receive a higher benefit from their offspring than those that don’t. Finally, for courtship time of moderate duration, the same phenomenon occurs when the population size increases.},

  abstract     = {Records of epidemics acknowledge immunological multi-serotype illnesses as an important aspect of the occurrence and control of contagious diseases. These patterns occur due to antibody-dependent-enhancement (ADE) among serotype diseases, which leads to infection of secondary infectious classes. One example of this is dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which comprises the following four serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. The evolutionary vaccination game approach is able to shed light on this long-standing issue in a bid to evaluate the success of various control programs. Although immunization is regarded as one of the most accepted approaches for minimizing the risk of infection, cost and efficiency are important factors that must also be considered. To analyze the n n -serovar aspect alongside ADE consequence in voluntary vaccination, this study establishes a new mathematical epidemiological model that is dovetailed with evolutionary game theory, an approach through which we explored two vaccine programs: primary and secondary. Our findings illuminate that the ‘cost-efficiency’ effect for vaccination decision exhibits an impact on controlling n n -serovar infectious diseases and should be designed in such a manner as to avoid adverse effects. Furthermore, our numerical result justifies the fact that adopting ADE significantly boosted emerging disease incidence, it also suggest that the joint vaccine policy works even better when the complex cyclical epidemic outbreak takes place among multi serotypes interactions. Research also exposes that the primary vaccine is a better controlling tool than the secondary; however, introducing a highly-efficiency secondary vaccine against secondary infection plays a key role to control the disease prevalence.},

  abstract     = {Overexploitation of commercially beneficial fish is a serious ecological problem around the world. The growth profiles of most of the species are likely to follow density regulated theta-logistic model irrespective of any taxonomy group [Sibly et al., Science, 2005]. Rapid depletion of population size may cause reduced fitness, and the species is exposed to Allee phenomena. Here sustainability is addressed by modelling the herring population as a stochastic process and computing the probability of extinction and expected time to extinction. The models incorporate an Allee effect, crowding effect which reduce birth and death rates at large populations, and two possible choices of harvesting models viz. linear harvesting and nonlinear harvesting. A seminal attempt is made by Saha [Saha et al., Ecol. Model, 2013] for this economically beneficial fish, but ignored the vital phenomena of harvesting. Moreover, in this model, the demographic stochasticity is introduced through the white-noise term, which has certain limitations when harvesting is introduced into the system. White noise is appropriate for such a system where immigration and emigration are allowed, but a harvesting model is rational for a closed system. The demographic stochasticity is introduced by replacing an ordinary differential equation model with a stochastic differential equation model, where the instantaneous variance in the SDE is derived directly from the birth and death rates of a birth-death process. The modelling parameters are fit to data of the herring populations collected from Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD), and the risk of extinction of each population is computed under different harvesting protocols. A threshold for handling times is computed beneath which the risk of extinction is high. This is proposed as a recommendation to management for sustainable harvesting.},

One of these stressors is the breakdown of thermoregulation inside the hive. For pupae to develop correctly into healthy adult bees, the temperature within the hive must be regulated by the hive bees to within a narrow range that ensures optimal development. Suboptimal development in adults affects their brain and flight muscles so bees becomes inefficient foragers with shorter life spans. We model the effect of thermoregulation on hive health using a system of delay differential equations that show that thermoregulatory stress has the capacity to drive colony loss in the model via a saddle-node bifurcation with an associated Allee effect.},

  abstract     = {Integrins regulate mechanotransduction between smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and the extracellular matrix (ECM). SMCs resident in the walls of airways or blood vessels are continuously exposed to dynamic mechanical forces due to breathing or pulsatile blood flow. However, the resulting effects of these forces on integrin dynamics and associated cell–matrix adhesion are not well understood. Here we present experimental results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments, designed to study the integrin response to external oscillatory loading of varying amplitudes applied to live aortic SMCs, together with theoretical results from a mathematical model. In the AFM experiments, a fibronectin-coated probe was used cyclically to indent and retract from the surface of the cell. We observed a transition between states of firm adhesion and of complete detachment as the amplitude of oscillatory loading increased, revealed by qualitative changes in the force timecourses. Interestingly, for some of the SMCs in the experiments, switching behaviour between the two adhesion states is observed during single timecourses at intermediate amplitudes. We obtain two qualitatively similar adhesion states in the mathematical model, where we simulate the cell, integrins and ECM as an evolving system of springs, incorporating local integrin binding dynamics. In the mathematical model, we observe a region of bistability where both the firm adhesion and detachment states can occur depending on the initial adhesion state. The differences are seen to be a result of mechanical cooperativity of integrins and cell deformation. Switching behaviour is a phenomenon associated with bistability in a stochastic system, and bistability in our deterministic mathematical model provides a potential physical explanation for the experimental results. Physiologically, bistability provides a means for transient mechanical stimuli to induce long-term changes in adhesion dynamics—and thereby the cells’ ability to transmit force—and we propose further experiments for testing this hypothesis.},

To examine the implication for transmission dynamics of these correlations, we proposed a novel model, which embeds the function of individual behaviour change (media impact) into the intensity of infection. The nonlinear least squares estimation is used to identify the best-fit parameter values in the model from the observed data. To determine impact of key parameters with media impact and control measures for the later outcome of the outbreak, we also carried out the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These findings confirm the importance of the responses of individuals to the media reports, and the crucial role of experts and governments in promoting the public under self-quarantine. Therefore, for mitigating epidemic COVID-19, the media publicity should be focused on how to guide people’s behavioral changes by experts, and the management departments and designated hospitals of the COVID-19 should take effective quarantined measures, which are critical for the control of the disease.},

  abstract     = {Chronic HIV infection causes a progressive decrease in the ability to maintain homeostasis resulting, after some time, in eventual break down of immune functions. Recent clinical research has shed light on a significant contribution of the lymphatic tissues , where HIV causes accumulation of collagen, (fibrosis). Specifically, where tissue is populated by certain types of functional stromal cells designated Fibroblastic Reticular Cells (FRCs), these have been found to play a crucial role in balancing out apoptosis and regeneration of naïve T-cells through 2-way cellular signaling. Tissue fibrosis not only impedes this signaling, effectively reducing T-cell levels through increased apoptosis of cells of both T- and FRC type but has been found to be irreversible by current HIV standard treatment (cART). While the therapy aims to block the viral lifecycle, cART-associated increase of T-cell levels in blood appears to conceal existing FRC impairment through fibrosis. This hidden impairment can lead to adverse consequences if treatment is interrupted, e.g. due to poor adherence (missing doses) or through periods recovering from drug toxicities . Formal clinical studies on treatment interruption have indicated possible adverse effects, but quantification of those effects in relation to interruption protocol and patient predisposition remains unclear. Accordingly, the impact of treatment interruption on lymphatic tissue structure and T-cell levels is explored here by means of computer simulation. A novel Stochastic Cellular Automata model is proposed, which utilizes all sources of clinical detail available to us (though sparse in part) for model parametrization. Sources are explicitly referenced and conflicting evidence from previous studies explored. The main focus is on (i) spatial aspects of collagen build up, together with (ii) collagen increase after repeated treatment interruptions to explore the dynamics of HIV-induced fibrosis and T-cell loss.},

  abstract     = {Xylem conduit diameter widens from leaf tip to stem base and how this widening affects the total hydraulic resistance ( R TOT ) and the gradient of water potential ( Ψxyl ) has never been thoroughly investigated. Data of conduit diameter of Acer pseudoplatanus , Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies were used to model the axial variation of R TOT and Ψxyl . The majority of R TOT (from 79 to 98\%) was predicted to be confined within the leaf/needle. This means that the xylem conduits of stem and roots, accounting for nearly the total length of the hydraulic path, theoretically provide a nearly negligible contribution to R TOT . Consequently, a steep gradient of water potentials was predicted to develop within the leaf/needle base, whereas lower in the stem water potentials approximate those of rootlets. Our results would suggest that the strong partitioning of R TOT between leaves/needles coupled with basal conduit widening is of key importance for both hydraulic safety against drought-induced embolism formation and efficiency, as it minimizes the exposure of stem xylem to high tensions and makes the total plant’s conductance substantially independent of body size.},

We study a stochastic model developed by Baar et al. (2015) for modeling immunotherapy against melanoma skin cancer. First, we estimate the parameters of the deterministic limit of the model based on biological data of tumor growth in mice. A Nonlinear Mixed Effects Model is estimated by the Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization algorithm. With the estimated parameters, we return to the stochastic model and calculate the probability of complete T cells exhaustion. We show that for some relevant parameter values, an early relapse is due to stochastic fluctuations (complete T cells exhaustion) with a non negligible probability. Then, focusing on the relapse related to the T cell exhaustion, we propose to optimize the treatment plan (treatment doses and restimulation times) by minimizing the T cell exhaustion probability in the parameter estimation ranges.},

  abstract     = {In plant vascular tissue development, different cell wall patterns are formed, offering different mechanical properties optimised for different growth stages. Critical in these patterning processes are Rho of Plants (ROP) proteins, a class of evolutionarily conserved small GTPase proteins responsible for local membrane domain formation in many organisms. While te spotted metaxylem pattern can easily be understood as a result of a Turing-style reaction-diffusion mechanism, it remains an open question how the consistent orientation of evenly spaced bands and spirals as found in protoxylem is achieved. We hypothesise that this orientation results from an interaction between ROPs and an array of transversely oriented cortical microtubules that acts as a directional diffusion barrier. Here, we explore this hypothesis using partial differential equation models with anisotropic ROP diffusion and show that a horizontal microtubule array acting as a vertical diffusion barrier to active ROP can yield a horizontally banded ROP pattern. We then study the underlying mechanism in more detail, finding that it can only orient curved pattern features but not straight lines. This implies that, once formed, banded and spiral patterns cannot be reoriented by this mechanism. Finally, we observe that ROPs and microtubules together only form ultimately static patterns if the interaction is implemented with sufficient biological realism.},

Here we develop ecological theory using a stochastic, synthetic framework for plant community assembly that leads to predictions amenable to empirical testing. We propose two stochastic, continuous-time Markov models that incorporate competitive dominance through a hierarchy of species heights. The first model, which is spatially implicit, predicts both the expected number of species that survive and the conditions under which heights are clustered in realized model communities. The second one allows spatially-explicit interactions of individuals and alternative mechanisms that can help shorter plants overcome height-driven competition, and it demonstrates that clustering patterns remain, not only locally but also across increasing spatial scales. Moreover, although plants are actually height-clustered in the spatially-explicit model, plant species abundances are not necessarily skewed to taller plants.},

Instead, daughter cells exhibit asymmetric division times that converge to two distinct growth states. This represents a limited senescence/rejuvenation process derived from asymmetric division that is stable for hundreds of generations. It remains unclear why the bacteria do not continue the senescence beyond this asymptote. Although there are inherent fitness benefits for heterogeneity in population growth rates, the two growth equilibria are surprisingly similar, differing by a few percent. In this work we derive an explicit model for the growth of a bacterial population with two growth equilibria, based on a generalized Fibonacci recurrence, in order to quantify the fitness benefit of a limited senescence process and examine costs associated with asymmetry that could generate the observed behavior. We find that a simple saturating effect of asymmetric partitioning of subcellular components is sufficient to explain why two distinct but similar growth states may be optimal while providing evolutionarily significant growth advantages.},

However, it is not clearly known how migration pattern, in terms of the configuration of the migration network and the synchrony of migration, affects infection prevalence. We therefore applied a discrete-time SIR model, integrating environmental transmission and migration, to various migration networks, including networks with serial, parallel, or both serial and parallel stopover sites, and with various levels of migration synchrony. We applied the model to the infection of avian influenza virus in a migratory geese population. In a network with only serial stopover sites, increasing the number of stopover sites reduced infection prevalence, because with every new stopover site, the amount of virus in the environment was lower than that in the previous stopover site, thereby reducing the exposure of the migratory population. In a network with parallel stopover sites, both increasing the number and earlier appearance of the stopover sites led to an earlier peak of infection prevalence in the migratory population, because the migratory population is exposed to larger total amount of virus in the environment, speeding-up the infection accumulation. Furthermore, higher migration synchrony reduced the average number of cumulative infection, because the majority of the population can fly to a new stopover site where the amount of virus is still relatively low and has not been increased due to virus shedding of infected birds. Our simulations indicate that a migration pattern with multiple serial stopover sites and with highly synchronized migration reduces the infection prevalence.},

However, deleterious mutations might be purged from such populations as a result of selfing. I developed a simulation model assuming the presence of mutations at two sets of loci, namely, early- and late-acting loci, and the selective abortion of embryos coupled with ovule overproduction. In the model, early-acting loci are expressed during embryo initiation, and less vigorous embryos are aborted. Late-acting loci are expressed after selective abortion ends; the surviving embryos (seeds) compete, and some of them form the next generation. If mutations are allowed to occur in both early- and late-acting loci, both types increase in frequency in populations with high selfing rates. However, this phenomenon does not occur if mutations occur only in the early- or only in the late-acting loci. Consistent results are observed even if the total number of loci in which mutations are allowed to occur is the same for simulations with both early- and late-acting loci, only early-acting loci, or only late-acting loci, indicating that the presence of both types of loci is the causal factor. Thus, the two-stage effect, or occurrence of both early- and late-acting mutations, promotes the maintenance of these mutations in populations with high selfing rates.},

  abstract     = {Kleptoparasitism can be considered as a game theoretical problem and a foraging tactic at the same time, so the aim of this paper is to combine the basic ideas of two research lines: evolutionary game theory and optimal foraging theory. To unify these theories, firstly, we take into account the fact that kleptoparasitism between foragers has two consequences: the interaction takes time and affects the net energy intake of both contestants. This phenomenon is modeled by a matrix game under time constraints. Secondly, we also give freedom to each forager to avoid interactions, since in optimal foraging theory foragers can ignore each food type (we have two prey types: either a prey item in possession of another predator or a free prey individual is discovered). The main question of the present paper is whether the zero-one rule of optimal foraging theory (always or never select a prey type) is valid or not, in the case where foragers interact with each other? In our foraging game we consider predators who engage in contests (contestants) and those who never do (avoiders), and in general those who play a mixture of the two strategies. Here the classical zero-one rule does not hold. Firstly, the pure avoider phenotype is never an ESS. Secondly, the pure contestant can be a strict ESS, but we show this is not necessarily so. Thirdly, we give an example when there is mixed ESS.},

  abstract     = {Crosstalk between the circadian clock clockwork and cellular metabolic regulatory networks is crucial to ensure an adequate response of an organism to the day/night cycle. mTOR (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a master growth regulator and sensor of nutrient status, which is part of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). While the circadian clock confers rhythmicity to the mTOR protein by regulating its degradation rate, mTORC1 activity diminishes period and augments amplitude of circadian oscillations at the cellular level by a currently unknown mechanism. Here, we develop a mathematical deterministic DAE (differential–algebraic equation) model, to explore the possible interactions that allow mTORC1 to display such regulation of the core circadian clock. Our results suggest that mTORC1 is capable of regulating amplitude by exerting translational control on core the clock protein BMAL1, and that period-tuning is achieved by controlling post-translational localization of BMAL1. Since, in our model, mTORC1 control of BMAL1 localization greatly diminishes the ability of the clock to oscillate, and regulation of BMAL1 translation reduces this effect, our results also suggest that both levels of regulation must be present to ensure the robustness of oscillations. Together, the above results emphasize the importance of the influence of mTORC1 on the circadian rhythms.},

  abstract     = {Insulin is secreted by pancreatic β β -cells that are electrically coupled into micro-organs called islets of Langerhans . The secretion is due to the influx of Ca 2+ ions that accompany electrical impulses, which are clustered into bursts. So-called “medium bursting” occurs in many β β -cells in intact islets, while in other islets the β β -cells exhibit “slow bursting”, with a much longer period. Each burst brings in Ca 2+ that, through exocytosis, results in insulin secretion . When isolated from an islet, β β -cells behave very differently. The electrical activity is much noisier, and consists primarily of trains of irregularly-timed spikes, or fast or slow bursting. Medium bursting, so often seen in intact islets, is rarely if ever observed. In this study, we examine what the isolated cell behavior can tell us about the mechanism for bursting in intact islets. A previous mathematical study concluded that the slow bursting observed in isolated β β -cells, and therefore most likely in islets, must be due to intrinsic glycolytic oscillations, since this mechanism for bursting is robust to noise. It was demonstrated that an alternate mechanism, phantom bursting, was very sensitive to noise, and therefore could not account for the slow bursting in single cells. We re-examine these conclusions, motivated by recent experimental and mathematical modeling evidence that slow bursting in intact islets is, at least in many cases, driven by the phantom bursting mechanism and not endogenous glycolytic oscillations. We employ two phantom bursting models, one minimal and the other more biophysical, to determine the sensitivity of medium and slow bursting to electrical current noise. In the minimal model, both forms of bursting are highly sensitive to noise. In the biophysical model, while medium bursting is sensitive to noise, slow bursting is much less sensitive. This suggests that the slow bursting seen in isolated β β -cells may be due to a phantom bursting mechanism, and by extension, slow bursting in intact islets may also be driven by this mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Public goods dilemmas are at the heart of some of the greatest challenges of our time, including climate inaction, growing inequality, and the overuse of natural resources. The public goods game in which cooperators contribute to a common pool that is then shared equally with defectors who contribute nothing captures the gist of the problem. Cooperators therefore cannot prevail, which ultimately leads to the tragedy of the commons. Actions such as punishment, rewards, and exclusion have been shown to help, but they are costly, therefore rendering cooperators second-order free-riders due to their lack of participation in these actions. In the search for a remedy, we study the public goods game with benevolent leaders who, at a personal cost, have the ability to exclude defectors from using common pool resources. We also consider bribers who can pay the leaders to relax their exclusion efforts. In a traditional setting, this setup yields the standard second-order free-rider problem, where, ironically, the leaders are overcome by cooperators, who then themselves succumb to defectors. We show, however, that the Singaporean model – where a leader’s payoff is determined not only by the regular sharing income from the firm production but also by the success of gross firm production as an incentive – can resolve the second-order free-rider problem. We also show that the detrimental effect of bribery can always be, no matter how high the bribe, held in check as long as the number of individuals engaged in this activity is low compared to the number of benevolent leaders. Otherwise, an abrupt transition to a cooperator-less state becomes unavoidable. We discuss the implications of our research for designing successful cooperation and anti-corruption strategies in public goods dilemmas.},

  abstract     = {Theoretical models can help to overcome experimental limitations to better our understanding of lung physiology and disease. While such efforts often begin in broad terms by determining the effect of a disease process on a relevant biological output, more narrowly defined simulations may inform clinical practice. Two such examples are phenotype-specific and patient-specific models, the former being specific to a group of patients with common characteristics, and the latter to an individual patient, in view of likely differences (heterogeneity) between patients. However, in order for such models to be useful, they must be sufficiently accurate, given the available data about the specific characteristics of the patient. We show that, for asthma in particular, this approach is promising: phenotype-specific targeting may be an effective way of selecting patients for treatment based on their airway remodelling phenotype, and patient-specific targeting may be viable with the use of a clinically-plausible dataset. Specifically we consider asthma and its treatment by bronchial thermoplasty, in which the airway smooth muscle layer is directly targeted by thermal energy. Patient-specific and phenotype-specific models in this context are considered using a combination of biobank data from ex vivo tissue samples, CT imaging, and optical coherence tomography which allows more detailed resolution of the airway wall structures.},

A sequence of such configurations, termed a rearrangement evolution, results in jumbled DNA arrangements, frequently observed in cancer genomes. We introduce a method that allows us to precisely count these different evolutions for a range of processes including breakage-fusion-bridge-cycles, tandem-duplications, inverted-duplications, reversals, transpositions and deletions, showing that the space of rearrangement evolution is super-exponential in size. These counts assume the infinite sites model of unique breakpoint usage.},

  abstract     = {Species often interact with multiple mutualistic partners that provide functionally different benefits and/or that interact with different life-history stages. These functionally different partners, however, may also interact directly with one another in other ways, indirectly altering net outcomes and persistence of the mutualistic system as a whole. We present a population dynamical model of a three-species system involving antagonism between species sharing a mutualist partner species with two explicit life stages. We find that, regardless of whether the antagonism is predatory or non-consumptive, persistence of the shared mutualist is possible only under a restrictive set of conditions. As the rate of antagonism between the species sharing the mutualist increases, indirect rather than direct interactions increasingly determine species’ densities and sometimes result in complex, oscillatory dynamics for all species. Surprisingly, persistence of the mutualistic system is particularly dependent upon the degree to which each of the two mutualistic interactions is specialized. Our work investigates a novel mechanism by which changing ecological conditions can lead to extinction of mutualist partners and provides testable predictions regarding the interactive roles of mutualism and antagonism in net outcomes for species’ densities.},

  abstract     = {Many theoretical models have been formulated to better understand the coevolutionary patterns that emerge from antagonistic interactions. These models usually assume that the attacks by the exploiters are random, so the effect of victim selection by exploiters on coevolutionary patterns remains unexplored. Here we analytically studied the payoff for predators and prey under coevolution assuming that every individual predator can attack only a small number of prey any given time, considering two scenarios: (i) predation occurs at random; (ii) predators select prey according to phenotype matching. We also develop an individual based model to verify the robustness of our analytical prediction. We show that both scenarios result in well known similar coevolutionary patterns if population sizes are sufficiently high: symmetrical coevolutionary branching and symmetrical coevolutionary cycling (Red Queen dynamics). However, for small population sizes, prey selection can cause unexpected coevolutionary patterns. One is the breaking of symmetry of the coevolutionary pattern, where the phenotypes evolve towards one of two evolutionarily stable patterns. As population size increases, the phenotypes oscillate between these two values in a novel form of Red Queen dynamics, the episodic reversal between the two stable patterns. Thus, prey selection causes prey phenotypes to evolve towards more extreme values, which reduces the fitness of both predators and prey, increasing the likelihood of extinction.},

  abstract     = {Prevailing theories in biological pattern formation, such as in morphogenesis or multicellular structures development, have been based on purely chemical processes, with the Turing models as the prime example. Recent studies have challenged the approach, by underlining the role of mechanical forces. A quantitative discrimination of competing theories is difficult, however, due to the elusive character of the processes: different mechanisms may result in similar patterns, while patterns obtained with a fixed model and fixed parameter values, but with small random perturbations of initial values, will significantly differ in shape, while being of the “same” type. In this sense each model parameter value corresponds to a family of patterns, rather than a fixed solution. For this situation we create a likelihood that allows a statistically sound way to distinguish the model parameters that correspond to given patterns. The method allows us to identify model parameters of reaction-diffusion systems by using Turing patterns only, i.e., the steady-state solutions of the respective equations without the use of transient data or initial values. The method is tested with three classical models of pattern formation: the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, Gierer-Meinhardt system and Brusselator reaction-diffusion system. We quantify the accuracy achieved by different amounts of training data by Bayesian sampling methods. We demonstrate how a large enough ensemble of patterns leads to detection of very small but systematic structural changes, practically impossible to distinguish with the naked eye.},

While there exist approaches like regulatory flux balance analysis (rFBA), dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA), resource balance analysis (RBA) or dynamic enzyme-cost flux balance analysis (deFBA) extending classical flux balance analysis (FBA) in various directions, there have been no constraint-based methods so far that allow predicting the dynamics of metabolism taking into account both macromolecule production costs and regulatory events. In this paper, we introduce a new constraint-based modeling framework named regulatory dynamic enzyme-cost flux balance analysis (r-deFBA), which unifies dynamic modeling of metabolism, cellular resource allocation and transcriptional regulation in a hybrid discrete-continuous setting. With r-deFBA, we can predict discrete regulatory states together with the continuous dynamics of reaction fluxes, external substrates, enzymes, and regulatory proteins needed to achieve a cellular objective such as maximizing biomass over a time interval. The dynamic optimization problem underlying r-deFBA can be reformulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem, for which there exist efficient solvers.},

The resultant coarse-grained entropy mainly captures the information contained in the rhythm produced by a local population of the network. We first show that these information theoretical measures are well-defined and computable by proving stochastic stability and the law of large numbers. Then we use three neuronal network examples, from simple to complex, to investigate these information-theoretic measures.

(1994) to investigate the effect of nonlinear interactions between tumour and immune cells in the tumour microenvironment, whereby immune cells may induce tumour cell death, and tumour cells may inactivate immune cells. Exploiting a separation of timescales in the model, we use the method of matched asymptotics to derive a new two-dimensional, long-timescale, approximation of the full model, which differs from the quasi-steady-state approximation introduced by Kuznetsov et al. (1994), but is validated against numerical solutions of the full model. Through a phase-plane analysis, we show that our reduced model is excitable, a feature not traditionally associated with tumour-immune dynamics. Through a systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that excitability generates complex bifurcating dynamics in the model. These are consistent with a variety of clinically observed phenomena, and suggest that excitability may underpin tumour-immune interactions. The model exhibits the three stages of immunoediting – elimination, equilibrium, and escape, via stable steady states with different tumour cell concentrations. Such heterogeneity in tumour cell numbers can stem from variability in initial conditions and/or model parameters that control the properties of the immune system and its response to the tumour. We identify different biophysical parameter targets that could be manipulated with immunotherapy in order to control tumour size, and we find that preferred strategies may differ between patients depending on the strength of their immune systems, as determined by patient-specific values of associated model parameters.},

  abstract     = {In cell-intrinsic antiviral immunity, cytoplasmic receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) detect viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and trigger a signaling cascade activating the interferon (IFN) system. This leads to the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with a wide range of antiviral effects. This recognition of dsRNA not only has to be very specific to discriminate foreign from self but also highly sensitive to detect even very low numbers of pathogenic dsRNA molecules. Previous work indicated an influence of the dsRNA length on the binding behavior of RIG-I and its potential to elicit antiviral signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the binding process are still under debate. We compare two hypothesized RIG-I binding mechanisms by translating them into mathematical models and analyzing their potential to describe published experimental data. The models consider the length of the dsRNA as well as known RIG-I binding motifs and describe RIG-I pathway activation after stimulation with dsRNA. We show that internal RIG-I binding sites in addition to cooperative RIG-I oligomerization are essential to describe the experimentally observed RIG-I binding behavior and immune response activation for different dsRNA lengths and concentrations. The combination of RIG-I binding to internal sites on the dsRNA and cooperative oligomerization compensates for a lack of high-affinity binding motifs and triggers a strong antiviral response for long dsRNAs. Model analysis reveals dsRNA length-dependency as a potential mechanism to discriminate between different types of dsRNAs: It allows for sensitive detection of small numbers of long dsRNAs, a typical by-product of viral replication, while ensuring tolerance against non-harming small dsRNAs.},

  abstract     = {Network models of disease spread play an important role in elucidating the impact of long-lasting infectious contacts on the dynamics of epidemics. Moment-closure approximation is a common method of generating low-dimensional deterministic models of epidemics on networks, which has found particular success for diseases with susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics. However, the effect of network structure is arguably more important for sexually transmitted infections, where epidemiologically relevant contacts are comparatively rare and longstanding, and which are in general modelled via the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)-paradigm. In this paper, we introduce an improvement to the standard pairwise approximation for network models with SIS-dynamics for two different network structures: the isolated open triple (three connected individuals in a line) and the k k -regular network. This improvement is achieved by tracking the rate of change of errors between triple values and their standard pairwise approximation. For the isolated open triple, this improved pairwise model is exact, while for k k -regular networks a closure is made at the level of triples to obtain a closed set of equations. This improved pairwise approximation provides an insight into the errors introduced by the standard pairwise approximation, and more closely matches both higher-order moment-closure approximations and explicit stochastic simulations with only a modest increase in dimensionality to the standard pairwise approximation.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that tornadoes passing over fields can cause significant damage to crops, and tornado tracks of fallen, or lodged, crops can extend for many hundreds of metres. An examination of photographic evidence of such events suggests that, at least for low speed EF0/EF1 events, lodging occurs beneath tornadoes primarily due to a strong radial flow (rather than circumferential flow) at the canopy surface. In order to investigate this effect further, a simple model of a tornado has been developed which, whilst fully satisfying the three dimensional Euler equations, models a circumferential flow at the edge of the tornado boundary layer near the ground, which becomes a radial flow as the ground is approached. This model is then used in a generalised model of lodging to predict lodging track widths and crop fall directions. It is shown that, when expressed in a suitably normalised form, both lodging width and crop fall direction are functions of a normalised translational velocity and a normalised crop lodging velocity. The lodging patterns are of two forms – a forward convergence (FC) where the cropfall converges on the tornado track in a forward direction, and a backward convergence (BC) where the convergence is in the opposite direction to tornado translations. Regions of FC and BC in the normalised parameter plane are calculated. These patterns are very similar to those observed in the field, which gives some confidence in the nature of the model. The model is then used to investigate the sensitivity of lodging width to crop and tornado parameters, and also to carry out a risk analysis to determine the probability distributions of lodging width for specified distributions of crop and tornado parameters.},

While previous mathematical models have shown that the innate immune response is necessary for the early suppression of virus production in infected respiratory cells, the different pathways by which the innate immune response can affect cloacal viral shedding have not been studied in chickens. The present study aims to evaluate the sensitivity of H9N2 low pathogenic AIV shedding in chicken gastrointestinal cells to different type-I interferon (IFN) response pathways, and to determine the impact of a cellular eclipse phase (latent period) on the time to peak virus shedding using a mathematical model describing within host viral kinetics. Our model results demonstrate that a mechanistic model that incorporates 1) the intracellular antiviral effects of type-I IFN on virus production, 2) destruction of infected cells by type-I IFN activated Natural Killer cells, and 3) an eclipse phase is most consistent with experimental cloacal virus shedding data. These results provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the delay to peak cloacal virus shedding observed in experimental studies conducted in chickens, as well as an improved understanding of the primary type-I IFN pathways involved in the control of cloacal virus shedding, which may lead to the development of more targeted vaccine candidates.},

Regardless of age, size, or branching system (monopodial or sympodial), the woody crown shows branched leafy axes implementing an aerial network. We propose here to represent the woody crown through a network comprised of two components, the segments of woody axes named connectors (CO) delimited by nodes (NO) as the branching regions. CO may link NO of different categories (regular, initial, final, and emission) as defined by the relative position of the NO in a crown and how many CO the NO has. The woody crown network (WCN) is similar to a random network with the probability of NO having some CO following an exponential decay. The absence of loops and real hubs weakened the robustness of WCN against failure or attacks on NO. The quantities of NO and CO and the proportions between them were the features of decomposition, and the distances measured in some CO between types of NO captured the topological characteristics of WCN. By combining decomposition and topology, we disclosed some properties of WCN, such as navigability, vulnerability, symmetry, and complexity. Navigability and complexity increased, while vulnerability and symmetry decreased exponentially as the size (ΣNO) of WCN enlarged. The behavior of properties as a function of ΣNO exposed some limits to mitigate the inherent hydraulic resistance during WCN development. Decomposition, topology, and properties of WCN in trees of Cerrado vegetation were interrelated to other crown traits revealing the strategies for acquiring airspace.},

  abstract     = {One of the most striking features of a living system is the self-sustaining functional inner organization, which is only possible when a source of internal references is available from which the system is able to self-organize components and processes. Internal references are intrinsically related to biological information , which is typically understood as genetic information . However, the organization in living systems supports a diversity of intricate processes that enable life to endure, adapt and reproduce because of this organization. In a biological context, information refers to a complex relationship between internal architecture and system functionality. Nongenetic processes, such as conformational recognition, are not considered biological information, although they exert important control over cell processes. In this contribution, we discuss the informational nature in the recognition of molecular shape in living systems. Thus, we highlight supramolecular matching as having a theoretical key role in the origin of life. Based on recent data, we demonstrate that the transfer of molecular conformation is a very likely dynamic of prebiotic information, which is closely related to the origin of biological homochirality and biogenic systems. In light of the current hypothesis, we also revisit the central dogma of molecular biology to assess the consistency of the proposal presented here. We conclude that both spatial (molecular shape) and sequential (genetic) information must be represented in this biological paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the impact of eutrophication on the dynamics of aquatic food webs , remains a long-term challenge in ecology. Mathematical models generally predict the destabilisation of such webs, under increasing eutrophication levels, with large oscillations of species densities that can result in their extinction. This is at odds with a number of ecological observations that show stable dynamics even for high nutrient loads. The apparent discrepancy between theory and observations is known as the Rosenzweig’s ‘paradox of enrichment’ and various solutions to the problem have been proposed over the years. In this study, we explore the stabilisation of dynamics of a tri-trophic plankton model in a eutrophic environment which occurs as a result of interplay of space heterogeneity, ecological stoichiometry, and food taxis of predators. We build a variety of models of increasing complexity, to explore various scenarios of phytoplankton growth, zooplankton food-dependent vertical movement, and different stoichiometric limitations of zooplankton. We show that the synergy among the vertical gradient in phytoplankton growth, phytoplankton structuring in terms of their stoichiometric ratio, and food-dependent vertical movement of zooplankton, would result in a postponing of destabilisation of eutrophic systems as compared to a well-mixed system. Our approach reveals a high complexity of the bifurcation structure of the system when key model parameters, such as the degree of eutrophication and light shading, are varied. We find coexistence of limit cycles and stable equilibria and that the possibility of multiple attractors in the system can result in hysteresis phenomena when the nutrient load is manipulated. These results are relevant and should be taken into account in lake restoration programs.},

  abstract     = {Homo-oligomerisation of proteins is a ubiquitous phenomenon whose exact role remains unclear in many cases. To identify novel functions, this paper provides an exploration of general dynamical mathematical models of homo-oligomerisation. Simulation and analysis of these models show that homo-oligomerisation on its own allows for a remarkable variety of complex dynamic and steady state regulatory behaviour such as transient overshoots or homeostatic control of monomer concentration. If post-translational modifications are considered, however, conventional mass action kinetics lead to thermodynamic inconsistencies due to asymmetric combinatorial expansion of reaction routes. Introducing a conservation principle to balance rate equations re-establishes thermodynamic consistency. Using such balanced models it is shown that oligomerisation can lead to bistability by enabling pseudo-multisite modification and kinetic pseudo-cooperativity via multi-enzyme regulation, thereby constituting a novel motif for bistable modification reactions. Due to these potential signal processing capabilities, homo-oligomerisation could play far more versatile roles in signal transduction than previously appreciated.},

  abstract     = {Characterising biochemical reaction network structure in mathematical terms enables the inference of functional biochemical consequences from network structure with existing mathematical techniques and spurs the development of new mathematics that exploits the peculiarities of biochemical network structure. The structure of a biochemical network may be specified by reaction stoichiometry, that is, the relative quantities of each molecule produced and consumed in each reaction of the network. A biochemical network may also be specified at a higher level of resolution in terms of the internal structure of each molecule and how molecular structures are transformed by each reaction in a network. The stoichiometry for a set of reactions can be compiled into a stoichiometric matrix N ∈ Z m × n , N∈Zm×n, where each row corresponds to a molecule and each column corresponds to a reaction. We demonstrate that a stoichiometric matrix may be split into the sum of m − rank ( N ) m−rank(N) moiety transition matrices, each of which corresponds to a subnetwork accessible to a structurally identifiable conserved moiety. The existence of this moiety matrix splitting is a property that distinguishes a stoichiometric matrix from an arbitrary rectangular matrix.},

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis starts with transmural (transwall) pressure-driven advective transport of blood-borne low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol across rare endothelial cell (EC) monolayer leaks into the arterial subendothelial intima (SI) wall layer where they can spread, bind to extracellular matrix and seed lesions. The local SI LDL concentration, which governs LDL’s binding kinetics, depends on the overall diluting transmural liquid flow. Transmural pressures typically compress the SI at physiological pressures, which keeps this flow low. Nguyen et al. (2015) showed that aortic ECs express the water channel protein aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and the transEC ( δP ) portion of the transmural (Δ P ) pressure difference drives, in parallel, water across AQP1s and plasma across interEC junctions. Since the lumen is isotonic, selective AQP1-mediated water flow should quickly render the ECs’ lumen side hypertonic and the SI hypotonic; resulting transEC oncotic pressure differences, δπ , should oppose δP and quickly halt transEC flow. Yet Nguyen et al.’s (2015) transAQP1 flows persist for hours. To resolve this paradox, we extend our fluid filtration theory Joshi et al. (2015) to include mass transfer for oncotically active solutes like albumin. This addition nonlinearly couples mass transfer, fluid flow and wall mechanics. We simultaneously solve these problems at steady state. Surprisingly it finds that media layer filtration causes steady SI to exceed EC glycocalyx albumin concentration. Thus δπ reinforces rather than opposes δP , i.e., it sucks water from, rather than pushing water into the lumen from the SI. Endothelial AQP1s raise the overall driving force for flow across the EC above δP , most significantly at pressures too low to compress the SI, and they increase the Δ P needed for SI compression. This suggests the intriguing possibility that increasing EC AQP1 expression can raise this requisite compression pressure to physiological values. That is, increasing EC AQP1 may decompress the SI at physiological pressures, which would significantly increase SI thickness, flow and subsequently SI LDL dilution. This could retard LDL binding and delay preatherosclerotic lesion onset. The model also predicts that glycocalyx-degrading enzymes decrease overall transEC driving forces and thus lower, not raise, transmural water flux.},

Brain can adjust with the problem of hypoxic condition by causing vasodilation with the help of this mechanism. To deduce the mechanism behind vasodilation of blood vessel caused by neuronal stimulus, current study articulates a mathematical model involving neuronal system feedforward inhibition network model (FFI) with two other functional components of neurovascular coupling, i.e. astrocyte and smooth muscle cell lining blood vessel. This study includes the neural inhibition network system where glutamatergic pyramidal neuron and GABAergic interneuron act antagonistically with each other. The proposed model successfully includes the implication of the inhibition system to design mathematical model for neurovascular coupling. Result of the proposed model shows that the increase in neuronal stimulus from 20 to 60 µA/cm 2 has the ability to increase the vasodilatory activity of blood tissue vasculature. Oxygenation level and hemodynamic response due to input synaptic stimulation has been calculated by regional cerebral oxygenation level (rS0 2 ) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) imaging signal which supports vasodilation of blood vessel with increase in synaptic input stimulus.},

  abstract     = {Many incurable diseases in humans are related to autoimmunity and are initially induced by a viral infection. Presumably, the virus has antigens with epitopes similar to those found in components of the host&#39;s body, thus allowing it to evade immune surveillance. Viral infection activates the immune system, which results in viral clearance. After infection, the enhanced immune system may begin to attack the host&#39;s cells, tissues, and organs. In this study, we developed a simple mathematical model in which we identify the conditions needed to trigger an autoimmune response. This model considers the dynamics of T helper (Th) cells, viruses, self-antigens, and memory T cells. Viral infection results in a temporal increase in viral abundance, which is suppressed by an increase in the number of Th cells. For the virus to be eliminated from the body, the level of Th cells must be maintained above a certain threshold to prevent viral replication, even in the absence of virus in the body. This role is realized by memory T cells produced during temporal viral infections. Thus, we investigated the conditions needed for the immune response to be enhanced after viral infection and concluded that cross-immunity must be weak for negative selection and T-cell activation but strong for antigen-suppressing reactions. We also discuss alternative models of cross-immunity and possible extensions of the model.},

Although previous studies using in vitro cell culture systems have revealed the molecular mechanisms of the antiviral action of APOBEC3 proteins and their antagonism by Vif, it remains unclear how APOBEC3 proteins affect the kinetics of HIV-1 replication in vivo . Here we quantified the time-series of viral load datasets from humanized mice infected with HIV-1 variants in the presence of APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, or both APOBEC3F/G using a simple mathematical model that accounted for inter-individual variability. Through experimental and mathematical investigation, we formulated and calculated the total antiviral activity of APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G based on the estimated initial growth rates of viral loads in vivo . Interestingly, we quantitatively demonstrated that compared with APOBEC3G, the antiviral activity of APOBEC3F was widely distributed but skewed toward lower activity, although their mean values were similar. We concluded that APOBEC3G markedly and robustly restricted the initial stages of viral growth in vivo .

Our previous work can be treated as a special case with an infinite resistor (or open circuit). Using asymptotic analysis, we simplify our PNP system and reduce it to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based model. Unlike the case of an infinite resistor, our numerical simulations of the new model reveal several distinct features. A finite current is generated, which leads to non-constant electric potentials in the bulk of intracellular and extracellular regions. Furthermore, the current induces an additional action potential (AP) at the non-innervated membrane, contrary to the case of an open circuit where an AP is generated only at the innervated membrane. The voltage drop inside the electrocyte is caused by an internal resistance due to mobile ions. We show that our single cell model can be used as the basis for a system with stacked electrocytes and the total current during the discharge of an electric eel can be estimated by using our model.},

CFD is used to compute reactor internal hydrodynamics taking into account marine impeller rotation and sparged bubbles motion. Lagrangian approach is used to track microalgae motion inside of the culture vessel. The illumination across the reactor is obtained using the classical Beer-Lambert’s law. The combination of light field and cell motion allows to reconstruct the light history of each microalgae. These histories are then supplied to Han’s model which predicts individual growth rate and experienced photodamages. Once computed, several thousands of trajectories are agglomerated at the population level yielding the photobioreactor performances. After having ensured properties convergence, this procedure is applied to a large range of optical density (0 to 4.0), i.e. cell concentration, and incident light intensities (0 to 2000 μ μ molPhoton/m 2 /s). From this exploration, it is possible to determine the photobioreactor response surfaces in terms of growth rate and photodamages. These are latter used to propose an optimal lighting strategy for biomass production - reducing photobioreactor operation time by 16\% compared to classical two-step procedure - and assist light induced stress with the aim of triggering secondary metabolites production.},

In the detailed model, we considered additional complexities: a cow produces milk only after the first birth of a calf, old cows are culled, milking is not practiced for 10 weeks prior to expected calf-birth, and a newborn calf provides an economic benefit. By fitting the parameters to the Japanese dairy farming situation, the dynamic programming analysis reveals whether an infected cow should receive medical treatment depends on the number of breasts infected, age, and season. Cows should be culled if many breasts are infected, they are old, and it is not close to the next calf-birth.

  abstract     = {Encounter rates link movement strategies to intra- and inter-specific interactions, and therefore translate individual movement behavior into higher-level ecological processes. Indeed, a large body of interacting population theory rests on the law of mass action, which can be derived from assumptions of Brownian motion in an enclosed container with exclusively local perception. These assumptions imply completely uniform space use, individual home ranges equivalent to the population range, and encounter dependent on movement paths actually crossing. Mounting empirical evidence, however, suggests that animals use space non-uniformly, occupy home ranges substantially smaller than the population range, and are often capable of nonlocal perception. Here, we explore how these empirically supported behaviors change pairwise encounter rates. Specifically, we derive novel analytical expressions for encounter rates under Ornstein-Uhlenbeck motion, which features non-uniform space use and allows individual home ranges to differ from the population range. We compare OU-based encounter predictions to those of Reflected Brownian Motion, from which the law of mass action can be derived. For both models, we further explore how the interplay between the scale of perception and home-range size affects encounter rates. We find that neglecting realistic movement and perceptual behaviors can lead to systematic, non-negligible biases in encounter-rate predictions.},

  abstract     = {Phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in the survival of individuals. In microbial host-virus systems, previous studies have shown the stabilizing effect that host plasticity has on the coexistence of the system. By contrast, it remains uncertain how the dependence of the virus on the metabolism of the host (i.e. “viral plasticity”) shapes bacteria-phage population dynamics in general, or the stability of the system in particular. Moreover, bacteria-phage models that do not consider viral plasticity are now recognised as overly simplistic. For these reasons, here we focus on the effect of viral plasticity on the stability of the system under different environmental conditions. We compared the predictions from a standard bacteria-phage model, which neglects plasticity, with those of a modification that includes viral plasticity. We investigated under which conditions viral plasticity promotes coexistence, with or without oscillatory dynamics. Our analysis shows that including viral plasticity reveals coexistence in regions of the parameter space where models without plasticity predict a collapse of the system. We also show that viral plasticity tends to reduce population oscillations, although this stabilizing effect is not consistently observed across environmental conditions: plasticity may instead reinforce dynamic feedbacks between the host, the virus, and the environment, which leads to wider oscillations. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic control of bacteriophage on host populations observed in nature.},

Sensitivity analysis was used to quantify how variability in the model parameters influence the value of the disease threshold R 0 R0 . This shows that the two most important factors to be considered for achieving a disease-free state state in vivo , based on their influence on R 0 , R0, are the efficacy of the Chlamydia vaccine, and the rate at which the humoral immune response protects healthy epithelial cells from infection. Numerical simulations of the model show that a vaccine with a minimum efficacy of 86\% may be required for the in vivo control of Chlamydia burden.

  abstract     = {In evolutionary game theory, it is customary to be partial to the dynamical models possessing fixed points so that they may be understood as the attainment of evolutionary stability, and hence, Nash equilibrium. Any show of periodic or chaotic solution is many a time perceived as a shortcoming of the corresponding game dynamic because (Nash) equilibrium play is supposed to be robust and persistent behaviour, and any other behaviour in nature is deemed transient. Consequently, there is a lack of attempt to connect the non-fixed point solutions with the game theoretic concepts. Here we provide a way to render game theoretic meaning to periodic solutions. To this end, we consider a replicator map that models Darwinian selection mechanism in unstructured infinite-sized population whose individuals reproduce asexually forming non-overlapping generations. This is one of the simplest evolutionary game dynamic that exhibits periodic solutions giving way to chaotic solutions (as parameters related to reproductive fitness change) and also obeys the folk theorems connecting fixed point solutions with Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, we find that a modified Darwinian fitness—termed heterogeneity payoff—in the corresponding population game must be put forward as (conventional) fitness times the probability that two arbitrarily chosen individuals of the population adopt two different strategies. The evolutionary dynamics proceeds as if the individuals optimize the heterogeneity payoff to reach an evolutionarily stable orbit, should it exist. We rigorously prove that a locally asymptotically stable period orbit must be heterogeneity stable orbit—a generalization of evolutionarily stable state.},

The spread of CTV in eastern Spain was studied by Gottwald et al. with the goal of determining the spatio-temporal mechanisms of spread. Since the subjects in this study are individual trees, it is natural to think of infections as Bernoulli trials. This approach is difficult however, due to the spatial and temporal dependence of the observations. Consequently, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) was used to model the probabilities of infection as well as the spatial and temporal dependence. Given the parameters in the ODE, the probabilities of infection are treated as conditionally independent. Using the conditional independence we then specify the joint likelihood function as a Poisson binomial distribution . For the purpose of model selection and hypothesis testing we, employed accumulated prediction error (APE) which has connections to both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks. We demonstrated the robustness of our method in accounting for spatio-temporal dependencies in the data by accurately predicting the spatial distribution of the disease through Join Counts.},

In this work we use optimal control theory to calculate optimal strategies for applying combination therapies to a model of acute myeloid leukaemia. We present a versatile framework to systematically explore the trade-offs that arise in designing combination therapy protocols using optimal control. We consider various combinations of continuous and bang-bang (discrete) controls, and we investigate how the control dynamics interact and respond to changes in the weighting and form of the pay-off characterising optimality. We demonstrate that the optimal controls respond non-linearly to treatment strength and control parameters, due to the interactions between species. We discuss challenges in appropriately characterising optimality in a multiple control setting and provide practical guidance for applying multiple optimal controls.

Usually, aptamers are selected experimentally via systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an evolutionary process that consists of multiple cycles of selection and amplification. The SELEX process is expensive, time-consuming, and its success rates are relatively low. To overcome these difficulties, in recent years, several computational techniques have been developed in aptamer sciences that bring together different disciplines and branches of technologies. In this paper, a complementary review on computational predictive approaches of the aptamer has been organized. Generally, the computational prediction approaches of aptamer have been proposed to carry out in two main categories: interaction-based prediction and structure-based predictions. Furthermore, the available software packages and toolkits in this scope were reviewed. The aim of describing computational methods and tools in aptamer science is that aptamer scientists might take advantage of these computational techniques to develop more accurate and more sensitive aptamers.},

We also model age, which affects contact, vaccination and possibly waning rates. The resurgences of pertussis that have been observed wherever effective vaccination programs have reduced typical disease among young children follow from these processes. As one example, we compare simulations with the experience of Sweden following resumption of pertussis vaccination after the hiatus from 1979 to 1996, reproducing the observations leading health authorities to introduce booster doses among school-aged children and adolescents in 2007 and 2014, respectively.

  abstract     = {Reaction-diffusion systems have been widely used to study spatio-temporal phenomena in cell biology, such as cell polarization. Coupled bulk-surface models naturally include compartmentalization of cytosolic and membrane-bound polarity molecules. Here we study the distribution of the polarity protein Cdc42 in a mass-conserved membrane-bulk model, and explore the effects of diffusion and spatial dimensionality on spatio-temporal pattern formation. We first analyze a one-dimensional (1-D) model for Cdc42 oscillations in fission yeast, consisting of two diffusion equations in the bulk domain coupled to nonlinear ODEs for binding kinetics at each end of the cell. In 1-D, our analysis reveals the existence of symmetric and asymmetric steady states, as well as anti-phase relaxation oscillations typical of slow-fast systems. We then extend our analysis to a two-dimensional (2-D) model with circular bulk geometry, for which species can either diffuse inside the cell or become bound to the membrane and undergo a nonlinear reaction-diffusion process. We also consider a nonlocal system of PDEs approximating the dynamics of the 2-D membrane-bulk model in the limit of fast bulk diffusion. In all three model variants we find that mass conservation selects perturbations of spatial modes that simply redistribute mass. In 1-D, only anti-phase oscillations between the two ends of the cell can occur, and in-phase oscillations are excluded. In higher dimensions, no radially symmetric oscillations are observed. Instead, the only instabilities are symmetry-breaking, either corresponding to stationary Turing instabilities, leading to the formation of stationary patterns, or to oscillatory Turing instabilities, leading to traveling and standing waves. Codimension-two Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations occur when the two distinct instabilities coincide, causing traveling waves to slow down and to eventually become stationary patterns. Our work clarifies the effect of geometry and dimensionality on behaviors observed in mass-conserved cell polarity models.},

What processes generate new trophic levels? We consider a heuristic eco-evolutionary model based on simple Lotka-Volterra equations, where the evolution of traits is described by a generalisation of Lande’s equation. The transition from competition to predation in this simplest of models is a successful, safe strategy for a population, and suggests a propensity to develop new trophic levels may be an inherent property of ecosystems. Numerical simulations with a more complex eco-evolutionary model of interacting plant and herbivore populations display the emergence of a new trophic level as an alternative to continued competition. These simulations reveal that new trophic levels may arise naturally from ecosystems because a robust strategy for a population in the presence of a strong competitor that could dominate or potentially extinguish them, is to predate upon the competitor. The same properties that make the competitor strong make it an ideal prey, suggesting the rubric that it is better to eat a strong competitor than to continue competing.},

  abstract     = {For many stochastic models of interest in systems biology, such as those describing biochemical reaction networks, exact quantification of parameter uncertainty through statistical inference is intractable. Likelihood-free computational inference techniques enable parameter inference when the likelihood function for the model is intractable but the generation of many sample paths is feasible through stochastic simulation of the forward problem. The most common likelihood-free method in systems biology is approximate Bayesian computation that accepts parameters that result in low discrepancy between stochastic simulations and measured data. However, it can be difficult to assess how the accuracy of the resulting inferences are affected by the choice of acceptance threshold and discrepancy function. The pseudo-marginal approach is an alternative likelihood-free inference method that utilises a Monte Carlo estimate of the likelihood function. This approach has several advantages, particularly in the context of noisy, partially observed, time-course data typical in biochemical reaction network studies. Specifically, the pseudo-marginal approach facilitates exact inference and uncertainty quantification, and may be efficiently combined with particle filters for low variance, high-accuracy likelihood estimation. In this review, we provide a practical introduction to the pseudo-marginal approach using inference for biochemical reaction networks as a series of case studies. Implementations of key algorithms and examples are provided using the Julia programming language; a high performance, open source programming language for scientific computing ( https://github.com/davidwarne/Warne2019_GuideToPseudoMarginal ).},

  abstract     = {Human walking consists of two major sequential events (i.e., single- and double-support phases). Although there have been many studies relating to basic principles of the each stage, how the two distinct but continuous phases interact with each other remains to be clarified. We examined the change in walking strategy with varying walking speed on a local reference frame with telescoping and tangential axes; we expect that the telescoping directional dynamics at the end of a single-support phase change with walking speed to facilitate the modulation of the push-off work during a double-support phase. The telescoping directional force and power are calculated using two methods: model simulation and kinematic configuration. The empirical walking data for eight healthy young subjects and the corresponding model parameters obtained from a data-fit optimization were used to investigate the changing trend of each factor (i.e., force and power) with the increase in speed. The resulting force at the end of the single-support phase significantly increased with the walking speed for both methods, whereas the resulting power remained nearly unchanged and was close to zero for the entire range of walking speeds. This result implies that the positive amount of the telescoping directional force at the end of the single-support phase may be a certain type of preparation for the double-support phase, which can contribute to a larger push-off.},

  abstract     = {Cell movement is crucial for morphogenesis in multicellular organisms. Growing embryos or tissues often expand isotropically, i.e., uniformly, in all dimensions. On the surfaces of these expanding environments, which we call “fields,” cells are subjected to frictional forces and move passively in response. However, the potential roles of isotropically expanding fields in morphogenetic events have not been investigated well. Our previous mathematical simulations showed that a tissue was elongated on an isotropically expanding field ( Imuta et al., 2014 ). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclarified, and how cells behave during tissue elongation was not investigated. In this study, we mathematically analyzed the effect of isotropically expanding fields using a vertex model, a standard type of multi-cellular model. We found that cells located on fields were elongated along a similar direction each other and exhibited a columnar configuration with nearly single-cell width. Simultaneously, it was confirmed that the cell clusters were also elongated, even though field expansion was absolutely isotropic. We then investigated the mechanism underlying these counterintuitive phenomena. In particular, we asked whether the dynamics of elongation was predominantly determined by the properties of the field, the cell cluster, or both. Theoretical analyses involving simplification of the model revealed that cell clusters have an intrinsic ability to asymmetrically deform, leading to their elongation. Importantly, this ability is effective only under the non-equilibrium conditions provided by field expansion. This may explain the elongation of the notochord, located on the surface of the growing mouse embryo. We established the mechanism underlying tissue elongation induced by isotropically expanding external environments, and its involvement in collective cell alignment with cell elongation, providing key insight into morphogenesis involving multiple adjacent tissues.},

  abstract     = {The connectome is the comprehensive map of the brain represented by wiring diagram of the full set of neuro-glia and synapses within entire brain of an organism. Some recent scientific efforts have successfully been made to visualize such map at neuro-glial networking level, however, capturing it as one unit of the entire brain have never been elucidated. Moreover, in order to derive structure-function relationship of different brain regions in response to a defined stimulus, there is a need to elucidate the connectome at single neuro-glial ensemble level after brain is challenged with the known memory function. This needs developing molecular approaches to tag neuro-glial activities in response to a conditioned brain function. Such approaches of using specific molecular tags have been tried to visualize independently neuron and glial specific events in response to a memory function, however, they could not tag the connectome together at single neuro-glia ensemble level. Therefore, there is a need to develop new methods for mapping entire connectome up to a single neuro-glial precision and resolution, with a purpose of tagging specific brain region accountable to execute a special memory formation process. The present hypothetical paper aims to propose a novel molecular method to generate the structural connectome at neuro-glial level in mice brain. Herein, we propose to tag the entire connectome at neuro-glia precision by generating a transgenic mice via transposing and recombining engineered novel “Neuro-Glia specific Vectors” (NGVs: specific to excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and glial cells) vis a vis “Transcriptional/ Translational Messenger (TMs: specific to metalloproteinases, MMP-9) coupled with different color protein tags, followed by the Clarity. Herein, the NGVs will be translated via Neuro-glia specific promoters, while TMs will be translated via endogenous MMP-9 promoter in all neuro-glial cells. The viability of all constructs will be verified in cortical/ hippocampal culture by inducing them to undergo chemically induced long term potentionation (cLTP) following visualization of different colored pattern. This will be further confirmed by Immunostaning, Western Blot and RT-PCR analysis. Additionally, in this approach, one can decipher the dynamics of molecular and cellular events associated with MMP-9 seretome by monitoring the trafficking of tagged endogenous MMP-9 protein after neuronal stimulation by cLTP in vitro. However, for visualizing complete connectome, the adult transgenic mice will be challenged with fear consolidation (Fear context and contextual cue) tests followed by Clarity coupled Light Sheet Microscopy to analyze neuro-glia ensemble following whole brain imaging.},

It includes also processes that are relevant for the ”thickening” of the vessel walls, and prepares a more complete model including also the later stages of atherosclerosis. The model consists of partial differential equations: Navier-Stokes equations modeling blood flow, Biot equations modeling the fluid flow inside the poroelastic vessel wall, and convection/chemotaxis-reaction-diffusion equations modeling transport, signaling and interaction processes initiating inflammation and atherosclerosis. The main innovations of this model are: a) quantifying the endothelial permeability to low-density-lipoproteins (LDL) and to the monocytes as a function of WSS, cytokines and LDL on the endothelial surface; b) transport of monocytes on the endothelial surface, mimicking the monocytes adhesion and rolling; c) the monocytes influx in the lumen, as a function of factor increasing monocytopoiesis; d) coupling between Navier-Stokes system, Biot system and convection/chemotaxis-reaction-diffusion equations. Numerical simulations of a simplified model were performed in an idealized two-dimensional geometry in order to investigate the dynamics of endothelial permeability, and the growth and spread of immune cells populations and their dependence in particular on low-density-lipoprotein and wall-shear stress.},

  abstract     = {Cell cycle is a large biochemical network and it is crucial to simplify it to gain a clearer understanding and insights into the cell cycle. This is also true for other biochemical networks. In this study, we present a model abstraction scheme/pipeline to create a minimal abstract model of the whole mammalian cell cycle system from a large Ordinary Differential Equation model of cell cycle we published previously (Abroudi et al., 2017). The abstract model is developed in a way that it captures the main characteristics (dynamics of key controllers), responses (G1-S and G2-M transitions and DNA damage) and the signalling subsystems (Growth Factor, G1-S and G2-M checkpoints, and DNA damage) of the original model (benchmark). Further, our model exploits: (i) separation of time scales (slow and fast reactions), (ii) separation of levels of complexity (high-level and low-level interactions), (iii) cell-cycle stages (temporality), (iv) functional subsystems (as mentioned above), and (v) represents the whole cell cycle - within a Multi-Level Hybrid Petri Net (MLHPN) framework. Although hybrid Petri Nets is not new, the abstraction of interactions and timing we introduced here is new to cell cycle and Petri Nets. Importantly, our models builds on the significant elements, representing the core cell cycle system, found through a novel Global Sensitivity Analysis on the benchmark model, using Self Organising Maps and Correlation Analysis that we introduced in (Abroudi et al., 2017). Taken the two aspects together, our study proposes a 2-stage model reduction pipeline for large systems and the main focus of this paper is on stage 2, Petri Net model, put in the context of the pipeline. With the MLHPN model, the benchmark model with 61 continuous variables (ODEs) and 148 parameters were reduced to 14 variables (4 continuous (Cyc_Cdks - the main controllers of cell cycle) and 10 discrete (regulators of Cyc_Cdks)) and 31 parameters. Additional 9 discrete elements represented the temporal progression of cell cycle. Systems dynamics simulation results of the MLHPN model were in close agreement with the benchmark model with respect to the crucial metrics selected for comparison: order and pattern of Cyc_Cdk activation, timing of G1-S and G2-M transitions with or without DNA damage, efficiency of the two cell cycle checkpoints in arresting damaged cells and passing healthy cells, and response to two types of global parameter perturbations. The results show that the MLHPN provides a close approximation to the comprehensive benchmark model in robustly representing systems dynamics and emergent properties while presenting the core cell cycle controller in an intuitive, transparent and subsystems format.},

To describe the immune response induced by the two-dose heterologous vaccine regimen, we propose a mechanistic ODE based model, which takes into account the role of immunological memory. We perform identifiability and sensitivity analysis of the proposed model to establish which kind of biological data are ideally needed in order to accurately estimate parameters, and additionally, which of those are non-identifiable based on the available data. Antibody concentrations data from phase I studies have been used to calibrate the model and show its ability in reproducing the observed antibody dynamics. Together with other factors, the establishment of an effective and reactive immunological memory is of pivotal importance for several prophylactic vaccines. We show that introducing a memory compartment in our calibrated model allows to evaluate the magnitude of the immune response induced by a booster dose and its long-term persistence afterwards.},

Motility is one such behavior that has been the focus many modeling efforts in the past. Our aim is to reduce the chemotactic behavior in Escherichia coli to its molecular constituents in order to paint a comprehensive and end-to-end picture of this intricate behavior. We utilize a hierarchical approach, consisting of three layers, to achieve this goal: at the first level, chemical reactions involved in chemotaxis are simulated. In the second level, the chemical reactions give rise to the mechanical movement of six independent flagella. At the last layer, the two lower layers are combined to allow a digital bacterium to receive information from its environment and swim through it with verve. Our results are in concert with the experimental studies concerning the motility of E.coli cells. In addition, we show that our detailed model of chemotaxis is reducible to a non-homogeneous Markov process.},

The model equations are analyzed for negative, none and normal cooperativity using a specific version of bifurcation theory and they are solved numerically. Special attention is paid to the sign of so-called first Lyapunov value. Interpretations of the results are given, both according to dynamic theory and in biological terms. In terms of cell signaling, we propose the hypothesis that when the outgoing signal of a system spends a physiologically significant amount of time outside of its equilibrium state, then the value of that signal can be sampled at any point along the trajectory towards that equilibrium and indeed, at multiple points. Coupled with non-linear behavior, such as that caused by cooperativity, this feature can account for a complex and varied response, which p53 is known for. From dynamical point of view, we found that when cooperativity is negative, the system has only one stable equilibrium point. In the absence of cooperativity, there is a single unstable equilibrium point with a critical boundary of stability. In the case with normal cooperativity, the system can have one, two, or three steady states with both, bi-stability and bi-instability occurring.},

The purpose of this research was to develop a geometric-based model of the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius as distributed force systems which can predict three-dimensional forces. Measurements were taken from the triceps surae in two human cadavers (80 and 85 years old). These models predicted muscle volumes and ankle plantar flexor moments that were realistic considering the age of the cadavers. Small differences were observed in calcaneal tendon force and moment for the distributed force models compared to modelling muscle force using a lump sum idealization. The major finding of the distributed force models was that forces were present in the axes corresponding to the muscle&#39;s length, width, and depth. The forces in the width and depth axes may be relevant for evaluating how muscle shape changes during contraction, as well as to investigate stress-strain patterns along the muscle&#39;s proximal and distal aponeuroses.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of group cooperation is still an evolutionary puzzle and has been studied from the perspective of not only evolutionary ecology but also social sciences. Some socio-ecological problems are caused by collapse of group cooperation. By applying theoretical studies about the evolution of cooperation, we can elucidate what causes the problems and find solutions. One of the appropriate examples is maintaining rice paddy field landscapes, which are a grand spectacle in Asia, and some are UNESCO world heritage sites. These magnificent landscapes and the associated biodiversity are at risk of abandonment for social and financial reasons. Rice paddy fields can be preserved not only by regular cultivation, which requires farmers to invest effort in cultivation, but also by the maintenance of common facilities such as irrigation canals. To investigate how this landscape might be preserved, we developed an agent-based model in which each farmer makes two types of efforts: an effort for land cultivation and an effort for collective action such as common facility maintenance. Additionally, we consider the side effects of rice production such as field deterioration from abandonment and water use competition. These factors determine the utility of each player who imitates the level of efforts necessary to invest in land cultivation and common facility maintenance of one with higher utility. This decision-making of each player can be described by the evolutionary game theory. We find that maintenance effort promotes cultivation effort, but not vice versa, even though we usually consider that each farmer&#39;s cultivation effort makes rice field landscape sustainable. We also find that if players and their near neighbors are responsible for maintaining their common facilities together, they continue to maintain them and cultivate, but if all players are responsible for maintaining all facilities in the whole farmland, players are likely to quit facility maintenance and stop cultivation. Competition for water use among all players, however, promotes cultivation more than competition among neighbors only. Therefore, rice paddy field landscapes can be sustainable if neighbors, but not the whole players, are responsible for maintaining their common facilities and cooperate together, and if the water usage of all players, but not neighbors, influences the productivity of each rice field.},

  abstract     = {Adiponectin is often associated with obesity. The obese body displays a significant decrease in adiponectin expression and plasma levels. Higher adiponectin also results in lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α from adipose tissue. Low adiponectin levels show to exist significantly in the case of insulin resistance. Adiponectin levels are found to be significantly lower in people with type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we proposed a mathematical model of the adiponectin − − adiponectin receptors framework, based on the assumption that the secretion of adiponectin is inversely proportional to fat mass. Here, we show that an increase in obesity or adiposity results in a decrease in the adiponectin plasma level, which contributes to the development of adiponectin resistance. In this model, we have used different parameters and their default values, to perform a simulation based on the model. Further, experimentally, the plasma adiponectin concentration is ( ≈  0.015) significantly lowered in the diabetic group compared to the non-diabetic group. In this model, we have obtained the plasma adiponectin concentration level ( ≈  0.014) in the simulation process. So this model is only differing from 1 × 10 −3 significant digits. We have achieved the degree of accuracy of adiponectin resistance is 93.33\%. Therefore, these advances offer novel insights into the mathematical approach.},

  abstract     = {Lyme disease is one of the most prevalent and fastest growing vector-borne bacterial illnesses in the United States, with over 25,000 new confirmed cases every year. Humans contract the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi through the bite of the tick Ixodes scapularis . The tick can receive the bacterium from a variety of small mammal and bird species, but the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus is the primary reservoir in the northeastern United States, especially near human settlement . The tick’s life cycle and behavior depend greatly on the season, with different stages of tick biting at different times. Reducing the infection in the tick-mouse cycle may greatly lower human Lyme incidence in some areas. However, research on the effects of various mouse-targeted interventions is limited. One particularly promising method involves administering vaccine pellets to white-footed mice through special bait boxes. In this study, we develop and analyze a mathematical model consisting of a system of nonlinear difference equations to understand the complex transmission dynamics and vector demographics in both tick and mice populations. We evaluate to what extent vaccination of white-footed mice can affect Lyme incidence in I. scapularis , and under which conditions this method saves money in preventing Lyme disease. We find that, in areas with high human risk, vaccination can eliminate mouse-tick transmission of B. burgdorferi while saving money.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we investigate the question of the impact of the diel vertical migration (DVM) and the light attenuation by the cells on both spatial pattern and population dynamics of phytoflagellates. For these purposes, we performed a simulation study by using a spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM). The designed IBM includes 2 global mechanisms: cellular motion which is modelled through a stochastic differential equation and demographic process that is density and light intensity dependent. We showed that under no-DVM, for competitive environment, increasing the light absorption helps the creation of a strong oscillatory behaviour, that breeds aggregation-break up rhythm, which is beneficial. However, when we pass to DVM regime, it will be more advantageous for the cells to reduce their light absorption. In regards of DVM effect, we showed that it has other benefits, apart from the acquisition of resources, such as enhancing the attraction mechanism that promotes cooperation and also helping the creation of spatial voids that permit the penetration of the light. Also, we showed that the DVM reduces the predation rate, so we prove quantitatively that the DVM reduces, in general, the grazing losses. Also, we found that the DVM strategy depends on the impact of the competition and cooperation between the cells on the division and death rates. So, probably for the motile species, the local competition is not high in order to let the cells gain advantages from the DVM regarding their survivability that is explained by an annual cyclic behaviour under seasonal environment.},

  abstract     = {When a nurse species facilitates the density of more than one species, strong indirect interactions can occur between the facilitated, or beneficiary, species, and these could lead to cascading interactive effects on community dynamics. In this context, negative effects of beneficiaries on the growth or reproduction of nurses are much more common than positive effects. This suggests beneficiaries frequently act as parasites of their nurses, and the consequences of this are largely unexplored. Our general aim is to analyze whether competition between parasitic beneficiaries can lead to indirect facilitation to nurse species and how this influences nurse-beneficiary systems. We explored potential outcomes of such reciprocal interactions in the general case of one facilitator and two facultative parasitic beneficiary species with different strategies for competing for space, one having a high carrying capacity but low maximum intrinsic growth rate (K-species), and the other having low carrying capacity but a higher intrinsic growth rate (r-species). These are defined in terms of the logistic equation, and reflect the abundances they can reach when growing alone. By considering a set of ordinary differential equations for the abundances of the nurse and the two parasitic beneficiaries in the mean-field approximation (where spatial correlations do not play a role), we first show analytically that coexistence of the three species is only possible when the r-species beneficiary is, at the same time, more harmful than the K-species and receives more benefit from the nurse. We then show that only the K-species can indirectly facilitate the nurse in such system. These are general, analytic results, independent of particular values of the parameters. We then explore these results using a 2-D lattice model informed by cushion plants in alpine ecosystems, and their interactions with beneficiaries with r and K strategies. Interesting spatial effects emerge in this case, such as a seeding effect: facilitation by the nurse increases beneficiary abundances also outside nurse patches. These in turn generate a negative feedback to the nurse, due to local competition for space near its edge. Spatial distribution effects are also crucial for relaxing the conditions for the survival of the r-species, allowing an r-strategist with weaker parasitic effects to indirectly facilitate the nurse through suppression of a more harmful K-species. Unexpectedly, this also has an indirect positive effect on the K species because of increased abundance of nurses. In the case of the r-species representing a ruderal invader, our lattice results would suggest that invaders have the potential to benefit both nurse and native beneficiary species via indirect facilitation. More generally, our results indicate that facilitation of more than one other species varying in competitive ability and which act as parasites on a nurse, can in turn promote indirect facilitation effects. This form of indirect facilitation has not been explicitly studied before, although it may create substantial conditionality in the outcomes of interactions among multiple species and the dynamics of nurse-beneficiary systems.},

  abstract     = {There are many marine animals that employ a form of jet propulsion to move through the water, often creating the jets by expanding and collapsing internal fluid cavities. Due to the unsteady nature of this form of locomotion and complex body/nozzle geometries, standard modeling techniques prove insufficient at capturing internal pressure dynamics, and hence swimming forces. This issue has been resolved with a novel technique for predicting the pressure inside deformable jet producing cavities (M. Krieg and K. Mohseni, J. Fluid Mech. , 769, 2015), which is derived from evolution of the surrounding fluid circulation. However, this model was only validated for an engineered jet thruster with simple geometry and relatively high Reynolds number ( Re ) jets. The purpose of this manuscript is twofold: (i) to demonstrate how the circulation based pressure model can be used to analyze different animal body motions as they relate to propulsive output, for multiple species of jetting animals, (ii) and to quantitatively validate the pressure modeling for biological jetting organisms (typically characterized by complicated cavity geometry and low/intermediate Re flows). Using jellyfish ( Sarsia tubulosa ) as an example, we show that the pressure model is insensitive to complex cavity geometry, and can be applied to lower Re swimming. By breaking down the swimming behavior of the jellyfish, as well as that of squid and dragonfly larvae, according to circulation generating mechanisms, we demonstrate that the body motions of Sarsia tubulosa are optimized for acceleration at the beginning of pulsation as a survival response. Whereas towards the end of jetting, the velar morphology is adjusted to decrease the energetic cost. Similarly, we show that mantle collapse rates in squid maximize propulsive efficiency. Finally, we observe that the hindgut geometry of dragonfly larvae minimizes the work required to refill the cavity.

A single model parameter Γ was assigned that is linked to tissue-specific vascular topology through Monte-Carlo simulations. Distributions of the model parameter Γ differ significantly between glioblastoma tissue with mean 〈 Γ G 〉 = 2.1 ± 0.4 , 〈ΓG〉=2.1±0.4, as compared to healthy brain tissue with mean 〈 Γ H 〉 = 4.9 ± 0.4 , 〈ΓH〉=4.9±0.4, suggesting that the average Γ-value allows for tissue differentiation.

  abstract     = {Animals typically switch from grounded (no flight phases) to aerial running at dimensionless speeds u ^ u^ u^ = 1, which puzzles biologists because the inverted pendulum becomes airborne at this speed. Here, we combine computer experiments using the spring-mass model with locomotion data from small birds, macaques and humans to understand the relationship between leg function (stiffness, angle of attack), locomotion speed and gait. With our model, we found three-humped ground reaction force profiles for slow grounded running speeds. The minimal single-humped grounded running speed is u ^ u^ = 0.4. This speed value roughly coincides with the transition speed from vaulting to bouncing mechanics in bipeds. Maximal grounded running speed in the model is not limited. In experiments, animals changed from grounded to aerial running at dimensionless contact time around 1. Considering these real-world contact times reduces the solution space drastically, but experimental data fit well. The model still predicts maximal grounded running speed u ^ u^ &gt; 1 for low stiffness values used by birds but decreases below u ^ u^ = 1 for increasing stiffness. For stiffer legs used in human walking and running, periodic grounded running vanishes. At speeds at which birds and macaques change to aerial running, we found periodic aerial running to intersect grounded running. This could explain why animals can alternate between grounded and aerial running at the same speed and identical leg parameters. Compliant legs enable different gaits and speeds with similar leg parameters, stiff legs require parameter adaptations.},

To obtain insight into these processes under nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation, we reanalyze published data from continuous cultures of the chlorophyte Selenastrum minutum . Based on mass budgets, we argue that much of the non‐limiting N and P had passed through the organisms and was present as dissolved organic phosphorus or nitrogen (DOP or DON). We construct a model that describes the production of biomass and dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a function of the growth rate. A fit of this model against the chemostat data suggests a high turnover of the non‐limiting N and P: at the highest growth rates, N and P atoms spent on average only about 3 h inside an organism, before they were exuded as DON and DOP, respectively. This DOM exudation can explain the observed trends in the algal stoichiometric ratios as a function of the dilution rate. We discuss independent evidence from isotope experiments for this apparently wasteful behavior and we suggest experiments to quantify and characterize DON and DOP exudation further.},

We therefore caution that calculations of reactivity from nondimensionalized models may be misleading. The attempt to extend reactivity theory to stable periodic orbits is very recent. We study reactivity of periodically forced and intrinsically generated periodic orbits. For periodically forced systems, we contribute a number of observations and examples that had previously received less attention. In particular, we systematically explore how reactivity depends on the timing of the perturbation. We then suggest ways to extend the theory to intrinsically generated periodic orbits. We investigate several possible global measures of reactivity of a periodic orbit and show that there likely is no single quantity to consistently measure the transient response of a system near a periodic orbit.},

I use a standard ecological resource-consumer model to examine the dynamics of traits relevant to resource consumption, and analyze determinants of functional structure. This model demonstrates that interaction with essential resources can regulate the community-wide abundances of ecologically relevant traits, keeping them at consistent levels despite large changes in the abundances of the species housing those traits in response to changes in the environment, and across variation between communities in species composition. Functional structure is shown to be able to track differences in environmental conditions faithfully across differences in species composition. Mathematical conditions on consumers’ vital rates and functional responses necessary and sufficient to produce conservation of functional community structure across differences in species composition in these models are presented. These conditions imply a nongeneric relation between biochemical rates, and avenues for further research are discussed.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of next-generation sequencing technology, more and more rare variants are available in the human genome. In recent years, the point of study has already changed direction to rare variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although a variety of approaches have been proposed to test associations between rare variants and phenotypes of interest, it is far from the end of this problem, and it is worth exploring new statistical methods based on special features of rare variants. As we all know, the most direct way is to evaluate the association in a two-way contingency table if the phenotype is a discrete variable. The numbers of observations are very close or equal to 0s for most of cells in the contingency table due to the extremely low mutation rates of rare variants. In this paper, we propose a novel association test for rare variants based on a generalization of Fisher’s exact test, and the p -value of this exact test can be computed under the multivariate hypergeometric distribution in the framework of algebraic statistics. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods, despite there is heterogeneity among causal variants. We also successfully apply our method into the genetic association study of coronary artery disease and hypertension from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium.},

Such models require the development of simplified representations of specific processes which capture essential biophysical features but without unnecessarily complexity. Recently there has been renewed interest in thermodynamically-based modelling of cellular processes. Here we present an approach to developing of simplified yet thermodynamically consistent (hence physically plausible) models which can readily be incorporated into large scale biochemical descriptions but which do not require full mechanistic detail of the underlying processes. We illustrate the approach through development of a simplified, physically plausible model of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and show that the simplified model behaves like the full system.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of iron-dependent regulated cell death (RCD) that occurs via peroxidation of phospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) moieties. Activating this form of cell death is an emerging strategy in cancer treatment. Because multiple pathways and molecular species contribute to the ferroptotic process, predicting which tumors will be sensitive to ferroptosis is a challenge. We thus develop a mathematical model of several critical pathways to ferroptosis in order to perform a systems-level analysis of the process. We show that sensitivity to ferroptosis depends on the activity of multiple upstream cascades, including PUFA incorporation into the phospholipid membrane, and the balance between levels of pro-oxidant factors (reactive oxygen species, lipoxogynases) and antioxidant factors (GPX4). We perform a systems-level analysis of ferroptosis sensitivity as an outcome of five input variables (ACSL4, SCD1, ferroportin , transferrin receptor, and p53) and organize the resulting simulations into ‘high’ and ‘low’ ferroptosis sensitivity groups. We make a novel prediction corresponding to the combinatorial requirements of ferroptosis sensitivity to SCD1 and ACSL4 activity. To validate our prediction, we model the ferroptotic response of an ovarian cancer stem cell line following single- and double-knockdown of SCD1 and ACSL4. We find that the experimental outcomes are consistent with our simulated predictions. This work suggests that a systems-level approach is beneficial for understanding the complex combined effects of ferroptotic input, and in predicting cancer susceptibility to ferroptosis.},

  abstract     = {We present a mathematical model of the energy-driven metabolic switch for glucagon and insulin secretion from pancreatic alpha and beta cells, respectively. The energy status related to hormone secretion is studied for various glucose concentrations. Additionally, the physiological response is studied with regards to the presence of other metabolites, particularly the free-fatty acids. At low glucose, the ATP production in alpha cells is high due to free-fatty acids oxidation in mitochondria, which enables glucagon secretion. When the glucose concentration is elevated above the threshold value, the glucagon secretion is switched off due to the contribution of glycolytic ATP production, representing an “anaerobic switch”. On the other hand, during hypoglycemia, the ATP production in beta cells is low, reflecting a “waiting state” for glucose as the main metabolite. When glucose is elevated above the threshold value, the oxidative fate of glucose in mitochondria is the main source of energy required for effective insulin secretion, i.e. the “aerobic switch”. Our results show the importance of well-regulated and fine-tuned energetic processes in pancreatic alpha and beta cells required for efficient hormone secretion and hence effective blood glucose regulation. These energetic processes have to be appropriately switched on and off based on the sensing of different metabolites by alpha and beta cells. Our computational results indicate that disturbances in cell energetics (e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction), and dysfunctional metabolite sensing and distribution throughout the cell might be related to pathologies such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes.},

We describe a modelling tool (OSIRIS) for integrating the effects of multiple simultaneous stressors. The model is relatively computationally light, and demonstrated using a coarse-grained, non-spatial and simplified representation of a temperate marine ecosystem. This version is capable of reproducing a wide range of dynamic responses. Results indicate the degree to which interactions are synergistic is crucial in determining sensitivity to forcing, particularly for the higher trophic levels, which can respond non-linearly to stronger forcing. Stronger synergistic interactions sensitize the system to variability in forcing, and combinations of stronger forcing, noise and synergies between effects are particularly potent. This work also underlines the significant potential risk incurred in treating stressors on ecosystems as individual and additive.},

Our model supports the phenomenon of forward bifurcation where the stability between disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium exchanges. Moreover, our model captures well the incidence curves from surveillance data. In particular, our model is able to reconstruct the periodic rodent and human forces of infection. Furthermore, we suggest that the three major epidemics from 2016-19 can be modelled by properly characterizing the rodent (or human) force of infection while the estimated human force of infection also present similar patterns across outbreaks. Our results suggest that the initial susceptibility likely increased across the three outbreaks from 2016-19.

  abstract     = {Animals use a wide variety of strategies to reduce or avoid aggression in conflicts over resources. These strategies range from sharing resources without outward signs of conflict to the development of dominance hierarchies, in which initial fighting is followed by the submission of subordinates. Although models have been developed to analyse specific strategies for resolving conflicts over resources, little work has focused on trying to understand why particular strategies are more likely to arise in certain situations. In this paper, we use a model based on an iterated Hawk–Dove game to analyse how resource holding potentials (RHPs) and other factors affect whether sharing, dominance relationships, or other behaviours are evolutionarily stable. We find through extensive numerical simulations that sharing is stable only when the cost of fighting is low and the animals in a contest have similar RHPs, whereas dominance relationships are stable in most other situations. We also explore what happens when animals are unable to assess each other’s RHPs without fighting, and we compare a range of strategies for contestants using simulations. We find (1) that the most successful strategies involve a limited period of assessment followed by a stable relationship in which fights are avoided and (2) that the duration of assessment depends both on the costliness of fighting and on the difference between the animals’ RHPs. Along with our direct work on modelling and simulations, we develop extensive software to facilitate further testing.

Although morphogens have long been known to direct the formation of many gross structures in early embryonic development, they do not have the necessary precision to define a structure down to the individual cellular level. Using the distinction between procedural and declarative knowledge in information processing as an analogy, it is hypothesized that DNA encodes fine structure in a manner that is different from the genetic code for proteins. The hypothesis states that repeated or near–repeated sequences that are in transposons and non–coding RNA define body part structures. As the cells in a body part go through the epigenetic process of differentiation, the action of methylation serves to inactivate all but the relevant structure definitions and some associated cell type genes. The transposons left active will then physically modify the DNA sequence in the heterochromatin to establish the local context in the three–dimensional body part structure. This brings the encoded definition of the cell type to the histone . The histone code for that cell type starts the regulatory cascade that turns on the genes associated with that particular type of cell, transforming it from a multipotent cell to a fully differentiated cell. This mechanism creates structures in the musculoskeletal system , the organs of the body, the major parts of the brain , and other systems.},

In a simple evolutionary game-theoretic model, uncertainty about agents’ incentives to stay in a relationship can cause the relationship to collapse, because of a vicious circle where being skeptical about one’s partner’s commitment makes one even more likely to leave the relationship. When agents have the possibility to send costly gifts to each other, analytical modeling and agent-based simulations show that gift-giving can evolve as a credible signal of commitment, which decreases the likelihood of relationship dissolution. Interestingly, different conventions can determine the meaning of the signal conveyed by the gift. Exactly two kinds of conventions are evolutionarily stable: according to the first convention, an agent who sends a gift signals that he intends to stay in the relationship if and only if he also receives a gift; according to the second convention, a gift signals unconditional commitment.},

A similar, but highly deranged process might also occur during the aberrant growth of cancers, which frequently display a loss of the orderly structures of the tissue of origin, but retain a multicellular organization in the form of spheroids, strands, and buds. The latter structures are often seen when tumors masses switch to an invasive behavior into surrounding tissues. However, the general physical principles governing the self-organized architectures of tumor cell populations remain by and large unclear. In this work, we perform in-vitro experiments to characterize the growth properties of glioblastoma budding emerging from monolayers. We further propose a theoretical model and its finite element implementation to characterize such a topological transition, that is modelled as a self-organised, non-equilibrium phenomenon driven by the trade–off of mechanical forces and physical interactions exerted at cell-cell and cell–substrate adhesions. Notably, the unstable disorder states of uncontrolled cellular proliferation macroscopically emerge as complex spatio–temporal patterns that evolve statistically correlated by a universal law.},

In the model, the kinetic rates of cell behaviors, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, are dependent on their epigenetic states, and the random transitions of epigenetic states between cell cycles are represented by an inheritance probability function that describes the conditional probability of cell state changes. Moreover, the model can be extended to include genotypic changes and describe the process of gene mutation-induced tumor development.

  abstract     = {In this study, the pine nut peptides, Lys-Asp-His-Cyc-His (KDHCH), was used as the molecule dynamics (MD) simulations subject, which has been proved that the antioxidant activity was improved after pulse electric field (PEF) treatment and the secondary structure was changed as the circular dichroism (CD) results showed. In the present study, we applied the MD simulation to discover the mechanism of the antioxidant activity improvement. The MD results showed that with the PEF treatment of 15 kV/cm, the oxygen atoms of KDHCH changed a lot, especially the atoms No.32 and No.63, of which the distance difference value was −3.02 nm, compared with the 0 kV/cm PEF treatment. The result showed an approach trend between residues Lys-and His-and the α-C atom of Lys, Cys-and His-all got closer after the PEF treatment, which means the structure became tight after the PEF treatment. However, the results of 45 kV/cm PEF treatment presented more effects on the change of KDHCH. The calculations of oxygen atoms show an approach trend between residues Lys, Asp-and His. The α-C atom of Lys, Cys-and His-all got closer after the PEF treatment, which means the structure became tight after the PEF treatment and proved the results of the calculations of the oxygen atoms. The structures of PEF treated and untreated peptide samples were measured by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in order to verify the results of the molecular dynamics simulations. The 8.37–8.40 ppm (—NH- in chain) and 8.84–8.88 ppm (—NH- in chain) appeared left shift, while at the 8.45–8.47 ppm (-NH- in chain) occurred a right shift. The 7.82 ppm (—NH- in imidazole ring) on His-shifted left after PEF treatment, which reached 7.84 ppm by the 1D- 1 H NMR spectroscopy . Moreover, the long-range connectivity between —NH α (8.78 ppm) on 2H-ASP and —CH α (2.72 ppm) on 1H-LYS; —SH (2.50 ppm) on 4H-CYS and —OH (3.53 ppm) on 5H-HIS all appeared in spectra of the PEF treatment sample. This study will also be helpful to further mechanism exploration.},

  abstract     = {How eukaryotes were generated is an enigma of evolutionary biology. Widely accepted archaeal-origin eukaryogenesis scenarios, based on similarities of genes and related characteristics between archaea and eukaryotes, cannot explain several eukaryote-specific features of the last eukaryotic common ancestor, such as glycerol-3-phosphate-type membrane lipids, large cells and genomes, and endomembrane formation. Thermotogales spheroids, having multicopy-integrated large nucleoids and producing progeny in periplasm, may explain all of these features as well as endoplasmic reticulum-type signal cleavage sites, although they cannot divide. We hypothesize that the progeny chromosome is formed by random joining small DNAs in immature progeny, followed by reorganization by mechanisms including homologous recombination enabled with multicopy-integrated large genome (MILG). We propose that Thermotogales ancestor spheroids came to divide owing to the archaeal cell division genes horizontally transferred via virus-related particles, forming the first eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA). Referring to the hypothesis, the archaeal information-processing system would have been established in FECA by random joining DNAs excised from the MILG, which contained horizontally transferred archaeal and bacterial DNAs, followed by reorganization by the MILG-enabled homologous recombination. Thus, the large genome may have been a prerequisite, but not a consequence, of eukaryogenesis. The random joining of DNAs likely provided the basic mechanisms for eukaryotic evolution: producing the diversity by the formations of supergroups, novel genes, and introns that are involved in exon shuffling.},

  abstract     = {The relationship between division of labor and individuals’ spatial behavior in social insect colonies provides a useful context to study how social interactions influence the spreading of elements (which could be information, virus or food) across distributed agent systems. In social insect colonies, spatial heterogeneity associated with variations of individual task roles, affects social contacts, and thus the way in which agent moves through social contact networks. We used an Agent Based Model (ABM) to mimic three realistic scenarios of elements’ transmission, such as information, food or pathogens, via physical contact in social insect colonies. Our model suggests that individuals within a specific task interact more with consequences that elements could potentially spread rapidly within that group, while elements spread slower between task groups. Our simulations show a strong linear relationship between the degree of spatial heterogeneity and social contact rates, and that the spreading dynamics of elements follow a modified nonlinear logistic growth model with varied transmission rates for different scenarios. Our work provides important insights on the dual-functionality of physical contacts. This dual-functionality is often driven via variations of individual spatial behavior, and can have both inhibiting and facilitating effects on elements’ transmission rates depending on environment. The results from our proposed model not only provide important insights on mechanisms that generate spatial heterogeneity, but also deepen our understanding of how social insect colonies balance the benefit and cost of physical contacts on the elements’ transmission under varied environmental conditions.},

To model the dynamics of the cell wall, including its growth by new material, we use the approach of Campàs and Mahadevan, which assumes that the cell wall is a thin viscous sheet sustained by a pressure difference.

Although decentralized control is well known to be a product of local interactions among agents, without the need for a bird’s-eye view, indirect knowledge of properties that indicate the current states of the entire system also helps each agent to respond to changes, thereby leading to a more adaptive system. In this study, we analyze the rules that govern workers’ behavioral responses to colony-level properties and assess whether they contribute to adaptive flexibility in social insect colonies . We focus on task allocation among red harvester ants ( Pogonomyrmex barbatus ) as a model system and develop an ordinary differential equation model to describe the system of task allocation among workers. We simulate 12 scenarios specifying how workers respond to changes in the colony-level properties of colony size and nutritional state. We found that when workers decrease their contact rates in response to increasing colony size, they enable achievement of a larger colony size, similar to that of P. barbatus colonies in nature, and when workers increase their foraging levels in response to decreasing colony-wide nutritional levels, they increase resilience to environmental disturbances. These negative feedback rules governing the response to colony-level properties are consistent with previous reports on ants and honeybees.},

  abstract     = {Cancer immunotherapies rely on how interactions between cancer and immune system cells are constituted. The more essential to the emergence of the dynamical behavior of cancer growth these interactions are, the more effectively they may be used as mechanisms for interventions. Mathematical modeling can help unearth such connections, and help explain how they shape the dynamics of cancer growth. Here, we explored whether there exist simple, consistent properties of cancer-immune system interaction (CISI) models that might be harnessed to devise effective immunotherapy approaches. We did this for a family of three related models of increasing complexity. To this end, we developed a base model of CISI, which captures some essential features of the more complex models built on it. We find that the base model and its derivates can plausibly reproduce biological behavior that is consistent with the notion of an immunological barrier . This behavior is also in accord with situations in which the suppressive effects exerted by cancer cells on immune cells dominate their proliferative effects. Under these circumstances, the model family may display a pattern of bistability , where two distinct, stable states (a cancer-free, and a full-grown cancer state) are possible. Increasing the effectiveness of immune-caused cancer cell killing may remove the basis for bistability, and abruptly tip the dynamics of the system into a cancer-free state. Additionally, in combination with the administration of immune effector cells, modifications in cancer cell killing may be harnessed for immunotherapy without the need for resolving the bistability. We use these ideas to test immunotherapeutic interventions in silico in a stochastic version of the base model. This bistability-reliant approach to cancer interventions might offer advantages over those that comprise gradual declines in cancer cell numbers.},

  abstract     = {Many coastal invertebrate species are broadcast spawners. These species have a highly sedentary adult stage and disperse by oceanic transport of planktonic larvae. One commercially important group of broadcast spawners is abalones , which live in suitable habitat patches of rock reefs that are discretely distributed. Because of these life-history and habitat characteristics, abalones tend to exhibit a metapopulation structure. Despite fisheries management and the release of juveniles, wild populations of broadcast spawners have undergone dramatic reductions in density due to overexploitation, which has been partly attributed to a failure to account for spatial structure. To clarify the relationship between the persistence of a metapopulation and the bottleneck that occurs during reproduction and dispersal processes caused by spatial structure, we developed a spatially explicit metapopulation model accounting for the effects of both life history and fishery pressure. By analyzing the model, we derived a metric to evaluate metapopulation quality as the leading eigenvalue of a non-negative matrix (the landscape matrix). Using this measure, we clarified that the effect of spatial structure on metapopulation stability is explained well by the mean and variance of parameter values across patches under the condition in which the heterogeneity of the metapopulation network is weak. In particular, the presence of both a higher average and higher variance of quality in the landscape could indicate stable fishery stocks under certain conditions. For example, when the decline in the mean longevity of local patch due to the fishery pressures gradually diminishes, the rescue effects by good patches would work more effectively than the negative effect of bad patches and then the stabilizing effect of spatial heterogeneity could be observed in a metapopulation. Furthermore, optimal patch characteristics for the improvement of quality strongly depend on specific parameter values. For example, when adult fertility is improved, a patch with higher “source” ability is more suitable. In contrast, when the settlement success of planktonic larvae is improved or fishery pressure is reduced, a patch with higher “buffer” ability is more suitable for the improvement of fishery management.},

In particular, they are parameterizable from quantities we can estimate such as the force of infection (FOI), the rate of natural recovery from a single infection, the treatment rate, and the rate of demographic turnover. However, malaria parasites can superinfect their host which has the effect of increasing the duration of infection before total recovery. Queueing theory has been applied to capture this behavior, but a problem with current queueing models is the exclusion of factors such as demographic turnover and treatment. These factors in particular can affect the entire shape of the distribution of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) generated by the superinfection process, its transient dynamics, and the population mean recovery rate. Here we show the distribution of MOI can be described by an alternative hyper-Poisson distribution. We then couple our resulting equations to a simple vector transmission model, extending previous Ross-Macdonald theory.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical role of smooth muscle tissue in many physiological processes is vital to their healthy function. In this work, we provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the smooth muscle tissue response. Specifically, we model and investigate the distribution and the transmission of passive and active forces throughout the microstructure. Broadly, smooth muscle cells contain a structural network with two types of load carrying structures: (1) contractile units made of actin and myosin filaments, which are capable of generating force, and (2) intermediate filaments. The extracellular matrix comprises elastin and collagen fibers that can sustain stress. We argue that all of the load carrying constituents in the tissue participate in the generation and the transmission of passive and active forces. We begin by modeling the response of the elements in the smooth muscle cell and defining a network of contractile units and intermediate filaments through which forces are transferred. This allows to derive an expression for the stress that develops in the cell. Next, we assume a hyperelastic behavior for the extracellular matrix and determine the stress in the tissue. With appropriate kinematic constraints and equilibrium considerations, we relate the macroscopic deformation to the stretch of the individual load carrying structures. Consequently, the stress on each element in the tissue can be computed. To validate the framework, we consider a simple microstructure of a smooth muscle tissue and fit the model parameters to experimental findings. The framework is also used to delineate experimental evidence which suggests that the suppression of intermediate filaments reduces the active and passive forces in a tissue. We show that the degradation and the reduction of the number of intermediate filaments in the cell fully explains this observation.},

In this paper, we develop and analyze a tritrophic food chain model that captures the phenomenon known as the “stoichiometric knife-edge”, where consumer growth is limited under conditions of excess nutrients. The model tracks two essential elements, carbon and phosphorus, in each species. The dynamics of the system such as boundedness and positivity of the solutions, existence and stability conditions of boundary and internal equilibria are analyzed. Through numerical simulations and bifurcation analyses, we observe the dynamics of the system switching between periodic oscillations and chaos.

  abstract     = {Coupled dynamical systems in ecology are known to respond to the seasonal forcing of their parameters with multiple dynamical behaviours, ranging from seasonal cycles to chaos. Seasonal forcing is predominantly modelled as a sine wave. However, the transition between seasons is often more sudden as illustrated by the effect of snow cover on predation success. A handful of studies have mentioned the robustness of their results to the shape of the forcing signal but did not report any detailed analyses. Therefore, whether and how the shape of seasonal forcing could affect the dynamics of coupled dynamical systems remains unclear, while abrupt seasonal transitions are widespread in ecological systems. To provide some answers, we conduct a numerical analysis of the dynamical response of predator–prey communities to the shape of the forcing signal by exploring the joint effect of two features of seasonal forcing: the magnitude of the signal, which is classically the only one studied, and the shape of the signal, abrupt or sinusoidal. We consider both linear and saturating functional responses, and focus on seasonal forcing of the predator’s discovery rate, which fluctuates with changing environmental conditions and prey’s ability to escape predation. Our numerical results highlight that a more abrupt seasonal forcing mostly alters the magnitude of population fluctuations and triggers period–doubling bifurcations, as well as the emergence of chaos, at lower forcing strength than for sine waves. Controlling the variance of the forcing signal mitigates this trend but does not fully suppress it, which suggests that the variance is not the only feature of the shape of seasonal forcing that acts on community dynamics. Although theoretical studies may predict correctly the sequence of bifurcations using sine waves as a representation of seasonality, there is a rationale for applied studies to implement as realistic seasonal forcing as possible to make precise predictions of community dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Population density affects fitness through various processes, such as mate finding and competition. The fitness of individuals in a population can in turn affect its density, making population density a key quantity linking ecological and evolutionary processes. Density effects are, however, rarely homogeneous. Different life-history processes can be affected by density over different spatial scales. In birds, for example, competition for food may depend on the number of birds nesting in the direct vicinity, while competition for nesting sites may occur over larger areas. Here we investigate how the effects of local density and of density in a nearby patch can jointly affect the emergence of spatial variation in abundance as well as phenotypic diversification. We study a two-patch model that is described by coupled ordinary differential equations. The patches have no intrinsic differences: they both have the same fitness function that describes how an individual’s fitness depends on density in its own patch as well as the density in the other patch. We use a phase-space analysis, combined with a mathematical stability analysis to study the long-term behaviour of the system. Our results reveal that the mutual effect that the patches have on each other can lead to the emergence and long-term maintenance of a low and a high density patch. We then add traits and mutations to the model and show that different selection pressures in the high and low density patch can lead to diversification between these patches. Via eco-evolutionary feedbacks, this diversification can in turn lead to changes in the long-term population densities: under some parameter settings, both patches reach the same equilibrium density when mutations are absent, but different equilibrium densities when mutations are allowed. We thus show how, even in the absence of differences between patches, interactions between them can lead to differences in long-term population density, and potentially to trait diversification.},

  abstract     = {Rock-paper-scissors games metaphorically model cyclic dominance in ecology and microbiology. In a static environment, these models are characterized by fixation probabilities obeying two different “laws” in large and small well-mixed populations. Here, we investigate the evolution of these three-species models subject to a randomly switching carrying capacity modeling the endless change between states of resources scarcity and abundance. Focusing mainly on the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors game, equivalent to the cyclic Lotka–Volterra model, we study how the coupling of demographic and environmental noise influences the fixation properties. More specifically, we investigate which species is the most likely to prevail in a population of fluctuating size and how the outcome depends on the environmental variability. We show that demographic noise coupled with environmental randomness “levels the field” of cyclic competition by balancing the effect of selection. In particular, we show that fast switching effectively reduces the selection intensity proportionally to the variance of the carrying capacity. We determine the conditions under which new fixation scenarios arise, where the most likely species to prevail changes with the rate of switching and the variance of the carrying capacity. Random switching has a limited effect on the mean fixation time that scales linearly with the average population size. Hence, environmental randomness makes the cyclic competition more egalitarian, but does not prolong the species coexistence. We also show how the fixation probabilities of close-to-zero-sum rock-paper-scissors games can be obtained from those of the zero-sum model by rescaling the selection intensity.},

  abstract     = {Broad evidence has shown that host diversity can impede disease invasion and reduce the eventual prevalence, but little is known on how species interactions play in shaping this host diversity-disease relationship. Previous work has illustrated that intraguild predation (IGP), combined with parasite-mediated indirect effects, can have strong influences on parasitic infection. Following this line of thinking, we here examine the role of predatory interactions in the disease transmission within a multihost community. Through varying fractions of IGP in a competitive community, we show that, dependent on the fraction of predatory interactions, species richness can switch from enhancing to inhibiting disease establishment/prevalence. Without IGP interactions, high host species richness can likely weaken the ‘dilution effect’ and in some cases even enhance the disease establishment (and/or prevalence) due to the existence of alternative sources for infection, whereas IGP can generally heighten the negative diversity-disease relationship due to the reduction of encounter rate between prospective hosts and parasites. Although trait-mediated interactions (captured as the infection-induced changes in predation rate) only weakly affect disease prevalence, density-mediated interactions (captured as the additional infection-induced mortality) can pose a relatively strong influence on disease transmission. Our results thus underline the importance of considering species interactions when investigating the host diversity-disease relationship.},

An important issue is whether a molecular motor exhibits tight or non-tight chemomechanical (CM) coupling. The tight CM coupling refers to that each ATPase activity is coupled with a mechanical step, while the non-tight CM coupling refers to that an ATPase activity is not necessarily coupled with a mechanical step. Here, we take kinesin , monomeric DNA helicase, ring-shaped hexameric DNA helicase and ribosome as examples to study this issue. Our studies indicate that some motors such as kinesin, monomeric helicase and ribosome exhibit non-tight CM coupling under hindering forces, while others such as the ring-shaped hexameric helicase exhibit tight or nearly tight CM coupling under any force. For the former, the reduction of the velocity caused by the hindering force arises mainly from the reduction of the CM coupling efficiency, while the ATPase rate is independent or nearly independent of the force. For the latter, the reduction of the velocity caused by the hindering force arises mainly from the reduction of the ATPase rate, while the CM coupling efficiency is independent or nearly independent of the force.},

Our study utilizes codon biasing, a tool to identify the essential genes, in N. gonorrhoeae that could be utilized as novel therapeutic targets for drug or vaccine development. Through the screening of 2350 total genes, we present a list of 29 such drug candidate genes based on codon adaptation. Through the data-mining with BLAST2GO and InterProScan databases, we could predict the function of these 29 genes. These genes are involved in pivotal cellular functions like DNA replication, energy synthesis and metabolites production. This study also shortlists the essential genes of N. gonorrhoeae that could be used to target Neisseria.

I use agent-based models, grounded in killer whale biology, to investigate the potential consequences of cultural specialization for genetic diversity. In these models, cultural specialization typically reduces the number of mitochondrial haplotypes, mitochondrial haplotype diversity, mitochondrial nucleotide diversity, and heterozygosity at nuclear loci. The causal route of this decline is mostly indirect, being ascribed to a reduction in absolute population size resulting from cultural specialization. However, small group size exacerbates the decline in genetic diversity, presumably because of increased founder effects at the initiation of each cultural ecotype. These results are concordant with measures of low genetic diversity in the killer whale, although culturally-transmitted ecological specialization alone might not be sufficient to fully account for the species’ very low mitochondrial diversity. The process may also operate in other species.},

The model is structured in size and space, and it takes into account the migration of the tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic effector cells towards the tumor micro-environment by a chemotactic mechanism. We investigate on numerical grounds the role of the key parameters of the model such as the division and growth rates of the tumor cells, and the conversion and death rates of the immune cells. Our main findings are two-fold. Firstly, the model exhibits a possible control of the tumor growth by the immune response; nevertheless, the control is not complete in the sense that the asymptotic equilibrium states keep residual tumors and activated immune cells. Secondly, space heterogeneities of the source of immune cells can significantly reduce the efficiency of the control dynamics, making patterns of remission-recurrence appear.},

  abstract     = {The emergence of acquired drug resistance in cancer represents a major barrier to treatment success. While research has traditionally focused on genetic sources of resistance, recent findings suggest that cancer cells can acquire transient resistant phenotypes via epigenetic modifications and other non-genetic mechanisms. Although these resistant phenotypes are eventually relinquished by individual cells, they can temporarily ’save’ the tumor from extinction and enable the emergence of more permanent resistance mechanisms. These observations have generated interest in the potential of epigenetic therapies for long-term tumor control or eradication. In this work, we develop a mathematical model to study how phenotypic switching at the single-cell level affects resistance evolution in cancer. We highlight unique features of non-genetic resistance, probe the evolutionary consequences of epigenetic drugs and explore potential therapeutic strategies. We find that even short-term epigenetic modifications and stochastic fluctuations in gene expression can drive long-term drug resistance in the absence of any bona fide resistance mechanisms. We also find that an epigenetic drug that slightly perturbs the average retention of the resistant phenotype can turn guaranteed treatment failure into guaranteed success. Lastly, we find that combining an epigenetic drug with an anti-cancer agent can significantly outperform monotherapy, and that treatment outcome is heavily affected by drug sequencing.},

We consider how these dynamics might impact the spread of a vector-borne disease. We tailor and parameterize our model for direct application to Zika virus as spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, though the framework itself has broad applicability to any arboviral infection. We demonstrate how public risk perception of both disease and pesticides may drastically impact the spread of a mosquito-borne disease in a susceptible population.

Conditions for stable synchronization in a system of linearly coupled predator-prey oscillators have been considered in the past. However, the spatial dispersal coupling may be relatively weak and may not necessarily lead to a stable, complete synchrony. If the coupling between oscillators is too weak to induce a stable synchrony, oscillators may be engaged into intermittent synchrony, when episodes of synchronized dynamics are interspersed with the episodes of desynchronized dynamics. In the present study we consider the temporal patterning of this kind of intermittent synchronized dynamics in a system of two dispersal-coupled Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey oscillators. We consider the properties of the distributions of durations of desynchronized intervals and their dependence on the model parameters. We show that the temporal patterning of synchronous dynamics (an ecological network phenomenon) may depend on the properties of individual predator-prey patch (individual oscillator) and may vary independently of the strength of dispersal. We also show that if the dynamics of predator is slow relative to the dynamics of the prey (a situation that may promote brief but large outbreaks), dispersal-coupled predator-prey oscillating populations exhibit numerous short desynchronizations (as opposed to few long desynchronizations) and may require weaker dispersal in order to reach strong synchrony.},

While positive association among species has been studied in ecological literature, how such interactions will impact the ecological dynamics when they occur within antagonist communities is not understood. Motivated by this, we studied a community module consisting of two prey species and a predator population where the prey species are in mutualistic relationship while the predators exhibit hunting cooperation. Our result reconfirms that both mutualism and hunting cooperation destabilizes the system. Predator cooperation may result in extinction of the relatively more attacked prey and a minimal mutualism strength is required in order to retain the coexistence equilibrium. A higher degree of cooperation among predators can lead to bistable dynamics which increases the survival chance of the otherwise extinct prey. Mutualistic association further enhances this effect thereby increasing the chance of coexistence. Generally, cooperative hunting is known to produce bistability but this system also demonstrated tristable dynamics. Moreover, the wide range of multi-stability exhibited by our model indicate the high sensitivity of the system to small perturbations. Overall, our study suggests that the interplay between the prey mutualism and predator cooperation may result in unintuitive dynamics which might be important in the context of community ecology .},

  abstract     = {Messenger RNAs are often destabilized by methylation, suggesting that mRNA methylation alters mRNA and protein dynamics. This may indicate that the gene regulatory system is reflected by the metabolic system through mRNA methylation because methylation substrates are components of the metabolic system. Elucidating the mechanisms by which mRNA methylation regulates gene regulatory systems has posed considerable challenges due to the numerous targets of mRNA methylation. Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibition of mRNA N6-methyladenosine methylation elongates circadian periods. The aim of this study was to understand the mechanisms by which mRNA methylation regulates circadian rhythms. Using a detailed realistic model and a simple model, we demonstrated that period elongation of circadian rhythms by decreasing mRNA methylation can be achieved by two possibilities, i.e., decreasing mRNA methylation stabilizes nonoscillatory mRNAs such as Ck1δ and/or stabilizes oscillatory mRNAs of clock genes such as Per and Cry . In addition, we predicted that period elongation by stabilizing nonoscillatory mRNA ( Ck1δ ) should always be accompanied by the distortion of the circadian waveform. Finally, we discuss the validity of the two possible mechanisms on the regulation of circadian rhythms by mRNA methylation by quantifying waveform distortion of circadian gene activity data with or without mRNA methylation inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {Among newly notified tuberculosis cases in Japan, both the number and the proportion of foreign-born cases have steadily increased over time. As Japan prepares to introduce pre-entry tuberculosis screening for foreign-born persons entering Japan, various epidemiological evidence is needed to evaluate its effectiveness, including the prevalence of tuberculosis among current foreign residents in Japan, by country of birth. Yet as of today, even the underlying population dynamics has yet to be quantified. The present study therefore aimed to firstly reconstruct the demographic prevalence of foreign residents by the length of stay in Japan and by country of birth, and secondly, to estimate the prevalence of infection from notification data among foreign residents in Japan. We employed the McKendrick partial differential equation model to reconstruct the dynamics among six Asian countries which account for 80\% of foreign-born tuberculosis patients notified in Japan i.e. China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia, and Myanmar. Compared with China and the Philippines, the recent remarkable increase in the number of residents who had arrived within 5 years from Myanmar and Vietnam was identified. Assuming that the risk of primary tuberculosis given infection is 5\%, the estimated prevalence of infection ranged from 3.5\% to 21.3\%, and all the estimates were more than three times greater than the crude estimate that ignored the time since immigration. The proposed method may be used to further estimate the prevalence by age, sex and residential status, which could potentially provide critical evidence towards establishing policies to control tuberculosis among foreign-born persons in Japan, and also possibly among migrants globally.},

  abstract     = {Many host–pathogen systems are characterized by a temporal order of disease transmission and host reproduction. For example, this can be due to pathogens infecting certain life cycle stages of insect hosts; transmission occurring during the aggregation of migratory birds; or plant diseases spreading between planting seasons. We develop a simple discrete-time epidemic model with density-dependent transmission and disease affecting host fecundity and survival. The model shows sustained multi-annual cycles in host population abundance and disease prevalence, both in the presence and absence of density dependence in host reproduction, for large horizontal transmissibility, imperfect vertical transmission, high virulence, and high reproductive capability. The multi-annual cycles emerge as invariant curves in a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. They are caused by a carry-over effect, because the reproductive fitness of an individual can be reduced by virulent effects due to infection in an earlier season. As the infection process is density-dependent but shows an effect only in a later season, this produces delayed density dependence typical for second-order oscillations. The temporal separation between the infection and reproduction season is crucial in driving the cycles; if these processes occur simultaneously as in differential equation models, there are no sustained oscillations. Our model highlights the destabilizing effects of inter-seasonal feedbacks and is one of the simplest epidemic models that can generate population cycles.},

Higher order epistasis refers to unexpected effects of multiple mutations even if both single mutations and pairwise effects have been accounted for. Recent studies show that higher order epistasis is abundant in nature, for bacteria as well as higher organisms. However, the importance of higher order effects has been debated. It has been suggested that such effects cannot be interpreted, and should not be considered. Here, we show conclusively that higher order epistasis changes the adaptive prospects for a population. The conclusion is based on an exhaustive search of 193,270,310 hyper-cube graphs and applications of graph theory. Our results are more precise, yet more universal, than related research since they depend on mathematical theory, rather than sampling or simulations. Moreover, the uncertainty we establish for microbial evolution, due to higher order epistasis is not sensitive for detailed model assumptions, such as the baseline being additive or log-additive fitness.},

Such a distortion may affect diversifying evolution as well as directional evolution. In adaptive dynamics theory, diversifying evolution through ecological interaction is called evolutionary branching. This study analytically develops conditions for evolutionary branching in distorted trait spaces of arbitrary dimensions, by a local nonlinear coordinate transformation so that the mutational covariance matrix becomes locally constant in the neighborhood of a focal point. The developed evolutionary branching conditions can be affected by the distortion when mutational step sizes have significant magnitude difference among directions, i.e., the eigenvalues of the mutational covariance matrix have significant magnitude difference.},

  abstract     = {Phylogenetics is a field that studies and models the evolutionary history of currently living species. The rooted phylogenetic network is an important approach that models non-tree-like events between currently living species. Rooted triplets are one type of inputs in constructing rooted phylogenetic networks. Constructing an optimal rooted phylogenetic network that contains all given rooted triplets is a NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge efficiently, a novel heuristic method called NCHB is introduced in this paper. NCHB produces an optimal rooted phylogenetic network that covers all given rooted triplets. The NCHB optimality criterions in building a rooted phylogenetic network are minimizing the number of reticulation nodes, and minimizing the level of the final network. In NCHB, the two concepts: the height function and the binarization of a network are considered innovatively. In order to study the performance of NCHB, our proposed method is compared with the three state of the art algorithms that are LEV1ATHAN, SIMPLISTIC and TripNet in two scenarios. In the first scenario, triplet sets are generated under biological presumptions and our proposed method is compared with SIMPLISTIC and TripNet. The results show that NCHB outperforms TripNet and SIMPLISTIC according to the optimality criterions. In the second scenario, we designed a software for generating level-k networks. Then all triplets consistent with each network are obtained and are used as input for NCHB, LEV1THAN, SIMPLISTIC, and TripNet. LEV1ATHEN is just applicable for level-1 networks while the other algorithms can be performed to obtain higher level networks. The results show that the NCHB and LEV1ATHAN outputs are almost the same when we are restricted to level-1 networks. Also the results show that NCHB outperforms TripNet and SIMPLISTIC. Moreover NCHB outputs are very close to the generated networks (that are optimal) with respect to the criterions.},

  abstract     = {Due to the variability of protein expression, cells of the same population can exhibit different responses to stimuli. It is important to understand this heterogeneity at the individual level, as population averages mask these underlying differences. Using computational modeling, we can interrogate a system much more precisely than by using experiments alone, in order to learn how the expression of each protein affects a biological system. Here, we examine a mechanistic model of CAR T cell signaling, which connects receptor-antigen binding to MAPK activation, to determine intracellular modulations that can increase cellular response. CAR T cell cancer therapy involves removing a patient&#39;s T cells, modifying them to express engineered receptors that can bind to tumor-associated antigens to promote tumor cell killing, and then injecting the cells back into the patient. This population of cells, like all cell populations, would have heterogeneous protein expression, which could affect the efficacy of treatment. Thus, it is important to examine the effects of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. We first generated a dataset of simulated cell responses via Monte Carlo simulations of the mechanistic model, where the initial protein concentrations were randomly sampled. We analyzed the dataset using partial least-squares modeling to determine the relationships between protein expression and ERK phosphorylation, the output of the mechanistic model. Using this data-driven analysis, we found that only the expressions of proteins relating directly to the receptor and the MAPK cascade, the beginning and end of the network, respectively, are relevant to the cells’ response. We also found, surprisingly, that increasing the amount of receptor present can actually inhibit the cell&#39;s ability to respond due to increasing the strength of negative feedback from phosphatases. Overall, we have combined data-driven and mechanistic modeling to generate detailed insight into CAR T cell signaling.},

A model of biological invasion is employed to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics of invasive species and generate a variety of spatial patterns including so called ‘no front’ patchy spatial distributions. We introduce several topological indices to understand whether various spatial distributions of invasive species can be compared to each other based on information about their topology. We also investigate how topological indices used to make conclusions about the spatial pattern are related to controlling parameters in the underlying process of biological invasion. Our analysis reveals that a small increment in the model parameters results in a small increment in topological indices when the topology of continuous front spatial pattern with no patches behind the front is considered. Meanwhile, ‘no front’ patchy spatial distributions present a different case where a small change in the model parameters results in random fluctuations of topological indices. The ‘random’ behaviour of patchy patterns is further studied to understand whether a patchy spatial structure can transform itself into a continuous front spatial distribution over time. In the paper it will be argued that apart from the topological quantities used to classify spatial distributions, the transition time required to establish topological properties of the spatial pattern must be taken into account in pattern recognition and analysis. Furthermore, it will be demonstrated that for some parameter values it is impossible to conclude about the topological type of spatial pattern, i.e. continuous front spatial distributions cannot be distinguished from ‘no front’ patchy distributions of invasive species, no matter what their topological indices are.},

However, there remain critical open questions, such as timing and duration of immunotherapy and its added benefits when combined with other types of treatments. We introduce a model for the dynamics of active killer T-cells and cancer cell subpopulations. Rather than defining the cancer cell populations based on their genetic makeup alone, we consider also other, non-genetic differences that make the cell populations either sensitive or resistant to a therapy. Using the model, we make predictions of possible outcomes of the various treatment strategies in virtual melanoma patients, providing hypotheses regarding therapeutic efficacy and side-effects. It is shown, for instance, that starting immunotherapy with a denser treatment schedule may enable changing to a sparser schedule later during the treatment. Furthermore, combination of targeted and immunotherapy results in a better treatment effect, compared to mono-immunotherapy, and a stable disease can be reached with a patient-tailored combination. These results offer better understanding of the competition between T-cells and cancer cells, toward personalized immunotherapy regimens.},

Accordingly, in this paper, first, the drug transport equation in tumor is determined. Then, the sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the appropriate area for selecting the drug concentration to estimate the drug and tumor parameters. Finally, the parameters estimated by meta-heuristic and hybrid meta-heuristic methods are compared. To enhance the validity of the methods, two different drug transport models are examined. The results indicate that the hybrid methods gave rise to more precise estimations, especially the hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with whale optimization algorithm (WOA) which offer more appropriate responses in the parameters estimation of two models.},

The global existence and uniqueness of a positive solution, stochastic boundedness, and stochastically asymptotic stability are well explored. A stochastic ecological reproductive index R 0 s R0s is formulated to characterize the global dynamics. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that, if R 0 s R0s&amp;lt;1, then phytoplankton dies out with probability one; if R 0 s &gt; 1 R0s&amp;gt;1 and some other conditions hold, then there exists an invariant and asymptotically stable density of the system and the approach involves integral Markov semigroups theory. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the analytical findings and to investigate the long-time effect of water temperature, light, nutrients, and environmental noise on the dynamic evolution of phytoplankton.},

To understand these processes, multiple classes of mathematical models have been introduced. The hierarchical population model builds a novel class which allows for the mechanistic description of heterogeneity and explicitly takes into account subpopulation structures. However, this model requires a parametric distribution assumption for the cell population and, so far, only the normal distribution has been employed. Here, we incorporate alternative distribution assumptions into the model, assess their robustness against outliers and evaluate their influence on the performance of model calibration in a simulation study and a real-world application example. We found that alternative distributions provide reliable parameter estimates even in the presence of outliers, and can in fact increase the convergence of model calibration.},

  abstract     = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes. WNV can also infect horses and humans, where it may cause serious illness and can be fatal. Birds are the natural reservoir, and humans, equines and probably other mammals are dead-end hosts. In 2018, WNV occurred for the first time in Germany, affecting birds and horses. Seroconversion of an exposed veterinarian has also been reported. It is therefore of importance to evaluate the circumstances, under which WNV may establish in Germany as a whole or in particular favourable regions. In our current work, we formulate a dynamic model to describe the spreading process of West Nile virus in the presence of migratory birds. To investigate the possible role of migratory birds in the dissemination of WNV in Germany, we include the recurring presence of migratory birds through a mechanistic ordinary differential equations (ODE) model system. We also perform a sensitivity analysis of the infection curves. Seasonal impacts are also taken into consideration. As result, we present an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 . We find that after introducing WNV into Germany, R 0 will be above the critical value in many regions of the country. Furthermore, we observe that in the south of Germany, the disease reoccurs in the following season after the introduction. We include a potential distribution map associated with WNV cases in Germany to illustrate our findings in a spatial scale.},

  abstract     = {We study the problem of computing the probability distribution of phylogenetic trees that commonly arise in areas ranging from epidemiology to macroevolution. We focus on homogeneous birth death trees with incomplete sampling and consider observations from three distinct sampling schemes. First, individuals can be sampled and removed, through time, and included in the tree. Second, they can be occurrences which are sampled and removed through time and not included in the tree. Third, extant individuals can be sampled and included in the tree. The outcome of the process is thus composed of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree spanning all individuals sampled and included in the tree, and a timeline of occurrence events which are not placed along the tree. We derive a formula for computing the joint probability density of this outcome, which can readily be used to perform maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the model. In the context of epidemiology, our probability density enables the estimation of transmission rates through a joint analysis of epidemiological case count data and phylogenetic trees reconstructed from pathogen sequences. Within macroevolution, our equations form the basis for incorporating fossil occurrences from paleontological databases together with extant species phylogenies for estimating speciation and extinction rates. This work provides the theoretical framework for bridging not only the gap between phylogenetics and epidemiology, but also that between phylogenetics and paleontology .},

  abstract     = {PIN7 is a protein-protein interaction network of seven pleiotropic proteins (TPPII, CDK2, MYBBP1A, p53, SIRT6, SIRT7, and CD147) with proposed multiple functions in the aging and age-related diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration. Since the animal and cellular models with downregulated or knockout TPPII, p53, SIRT6, SIRT7, and MYBBP1A expression levels demonstrate similar age-related phenotype features, the interaction network was subjected to further investigation. For the identification of the main molecular mechanisms enabling the functions of the interaction network, PIN7 was subjected to the pathway enrichment, protein function prediction, and the protein node prioritization analysis using Cytoscape software and its applications GeneMania, ClusterOne, and Cyto-hubba. The study identified the p53 signaling pathway as the most dominant mediator of PIN7 effect. The top-ranked protein nodes of PIN7 extended by GeneMania application belong to the group of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. These enzymes are involved in the reverse epigenetic regulation mechanisms linked to the regulation of PTK2, NFκB, and p53 signaling interaction subnetworks of the extended PIN7. The analysis emphasized the role of PTK2 signaling, which functions upstream of the p53 signaling pathway, and its interaction network includes all top rank protein nodes of the extended PIN7 and all members of the sirtuin family (SIRT1-SIRT7). Further, the analysis suggests the involvement of molecular mechanisms related to metastatic cancer (prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer), hemostasis, the regulation of the thyroid hormones, and the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint. The additional data-mining analysis shows that the protein interaction network MYBBP1A-p53-TPPII-SIRT6-CD147 controls the Warburg effect, and MYBBP1A-p53-TPPII-SIRT7-CD147 influences mTOR signaling and autophagy. The proposed insights into the molecular mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases could be valuable for the discovery of new controlling interaction clusters, which could contribute to the development of the multitarget therapeutical strategies.},

  abstract     = {With a computational model of energy metabolism in an astrocyte, we show how a system of enzymes in a cascade can act as a functional unit of interdependent reactions, rather than merely a series of independent reactions. These systems may exist in multiple states, depending on the level of stimulation, and the effects of substrates at any point will depend on those states. Response trajectories of metabolites downstream from cAMP-stimulated glycogenolysis exhibit a host of non-linear dynamical response characteristics including hysteresis and response envelopes. Dose-dependent phase transitions predict a novel intracellular signalling mechanism and suggest a theoretical framework that could be relevant to single cell information processing, drug discovery or synthetic biology. Ligands may produce unique dose-response fingerprints depending on the state of the system, allowing selective output tuning. We conclude with the observation that state- and dose-dependent phase transitions, what we dub “ligand pulses” (LPs), may carry information and resemble action potentials (APs) generated from excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In our model, the relevant information from a cAMP-dependent glycolytic cascade in astrocytes could reflect the level of neuromodulatory input that signals an energy demand threshold. We propose that both APs and LPs represent specialized cases of molecular phase signalling with a common evolutionary root.},

  abstract     = {The savanna biome is characterised by a continuous vegetation cover, comprised of herbaceous and woody plants . The coexistence of species in arid savannas, where water availability is the main limiting resource for plant growth, provides an apparent contradiction to the classical principle of competitive exclusion. Previous theoretical work using nonspatial models has focussed on the development of an understanding of coexistence mechanisms through the consideration of resource niche separation and ecosystem disturbances. In this paper, we propose that a spatial self-organisation principle, caused by a positive feedback between local vegetation growth and water redistribution, is sufficient for species coexistence in savanna ecosystems. We propose a spatiotemporal ecohydrological model of partial differential equations, based on the Klausmeier reaction-advection-diffusion model for vegetation patterns, to investigate the effects of spatial interactions on species coexistence on sloped terrain. Our results suggest that species coexistence is a possible model outcome, if a balance is kept between the species’ average fitness (a measure of a species’ competitive abilities in a spatially uniform setting) and their colonisation abilities. Spatial heterogeneities in resource availability are utilised by the superior coloniser (grasses), before it is outcompeted by the species of higher average fitness (trees). A stability analysis of the spatially nonuniform coexistence solutions further suggests that grasses act as ecosystem engineers and facilitate the formation of a continuous tree cover for precipitation levels unable to support a uniform tree density in the absence of a grass species.},

  abstract     = {In bacterial chemotaxis, chemoattractant molecules may bind either directly or indirectly with receptors within the cell periplasmic space. The indirect binding mechanism, which involves an intermediate periplasmic binding protein , has been reported to increase sensitivity to dilute attractant concentrations as well as range of response. Current mathematical models for bacterial chemotaxis at the population scale do not appear to take the periplasmic binding protein (BP) concentration or the indirect binding mechanics into account. We formulate an indirect binding extension to the existing Rivero equation for chemotactic velocity based on fundamental reversible enzyme kinetics. The formulated indirect binding expression accounts for the periplasmic BP concentration and the dissociation constants for binding between attractant and periplasmic BP, as well as between BP and chemoreceptor. We validate the indirect-binding model using capillary assay simulations of the chemotactic responses of E. coli to the indirectly-binding attractants maltose and AI-2. The predicted response agrees well with experimental data from a number of maltose capillary assay studies conducted in previous literature. The model is also able to achieve good agreement with AI-2 capillary assay data of one study out of two tested. The chemotactic response of E. coli towards AI-2 appears to be of higher complexity due to reports of variable periplasmic BP concentration as well as the low concentration of periplasmic BP relative to the total receptor concentration. Our current model is thus suitable for indirect binding chemotactic response systems with constant periplasmic BP concentration that is significantly larger than the total receptor concentration, such as the response of E. coli towards maltose. Further considerations may be taken into account to model the chemotactic response towards AI-2 with greater accuracy.},

Finally, in the third layer, a pyramidal neuron produces the output of the model by integrating the output of two neurons from the middle layer resulting from inhibitory and excitatory connections among neurons, interneurons and the astrocyte.

  abstract     = {IL-1 system is involved in the induction and maintenance of chronic inflammation associated with several autoimmune diseases and cancer, mainly due to its capacity to promote the secretion of inflammatory mediators. For this reason, several intracellular and extracellular mechanisms for this system have been fixed during the evolution. In spite of the large description of molecular interactions between IL-1 ligands and receptors, little is known about the relevance and limits of the extracellular regulatory mechanims in different scenarios. To tackle this problem, we developed and calibrated a mathematical model including all the known interactions between IL-1 ligands and IL-1Rs and calibrate it with experimental data of IL-1 binding to different cells. The model predicts that, independently on the IL-1Rs expression, IL-1α has more ability than IL-1β to induce IL-1 signaling, which suggests that both ligands can be equally relevant for the IL-1 related inflammation. On the other hand, at the cell level, IL-1 signaling is mainly controlled by IL-1R1 and IL-1R3 and not by IL-1R2. Moreover, the soluble form of IL-1R1 and IL-1RA have the highest capacity to prevent IL-1α while IL-1R2 and IL-1R1 and IL-1RA have a similar capacity to prevent IL-1β signaling. The soluble IL-1R3 has the lowest capacity to prevent IL-1 signaling and preferentially inhibits cells with low number of IL-1R3. In general, model predictions suggest several ways in which IL-1 controlling system may fail, developing IL-1 related inflammation.},

  abstract     = {Differential migration by sex, where one sex migrates further than the other, occurs in many bird species. How this pattern evolves is however little understood. The first aim of this study was to investigate the extent of differential migration in the common ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula , breeding in southeast Sweden, and test three main hypotheses (the social dominance, body size and arrival time hypothesis ) regarding the evolution of differential migration. Geolocators were used to derive spatiotemporal data and morphometrics were collected from the studied population. Males migrated 800 km farther compared to females, were marginally larger and there was no statistical difference in spring arrival between the sexes. In contrast to other studies none of the previously proposed hypotheses could account for the observed pattern. An additional finding was that both sexes arrive up to 1.5 months before egg laying, but males initiate territorial behavior upon arrival. Based on these observations we suggest that males have a higher energetic demand, and challenges to meet those, early in the breeding season. Therefore we hypothesize that males arrive to the breeding site with residual fuel reserves accumulated at the wintering site to cover at least parts of these demands. Based on this hypothesis we present a simple model to explain the longer migration by males. The model is contingent on a trade-off between site specific fueling rates (which we assume to increase with decreasing latitude), cost of the extra migration distance and predation risk during fueling. This framework may be applicable to other cases of differential migration, especially in temperate breeding species which exhibit long pre-egg laying periods.},

  abstract     = {Can prelife proceed without cell division? A recently proposed mechanism suggests that transient compartmentalization could have preceded cell division in prebiotic scenarios. Here, we study transient compartmentalization dynamics in the presence of mutations and noise in replication, as both can be detrimental the survival of compartments. Our study comprises situations where compartments contain uncoupled autocatalytic reactions feeding on a common resource, and systems based on RNA molecules copied by replicases, following a recent experimental study. Using the theory of branching processes, we show analytically that two regimes are possible. In the diffusion-limited regime, replication is asynchronous which leads to a large variability in the composition of compartments. In contrast, in a replication-limited regime, the growth is synchronous and thus the compositional variability is low. Typically, simple autocatalysts are in the former regime, while polymeric replicators can access the latter. For deterministic growth dynamics, we introduce mutations that turn functional replicators into parasites. We derive the phase boundary separating coexistence or parasite dominance as a function of relative growth, inoculation size and mutation rate. We show that transient compartmentalization allows coexistence beyond the classical error threshold, above which the parasite dominates. Our findings invite to revisit major prebiotic transitions, notably the transitions towards cooperation, complex polymers and cell division.},

  abstract     = {Pathogen evolution is an imminent threat to global health that has warranted, and duly received, considerable attention within the medical, microbiological and modelling communities. Outbreaks of new pathogens are often ignited by the emergence and transmission of mutant variants descended from wild-type strains circulating in the community. In this work we investigate the stochastic dynamics of the emergence of a novel disease strain, introduced into a population in which it must compete with an existing endemic strain. In analogy with past work on single-strain epidemic outbreaks, we apply a branching process approximation to calculate the probability that the new strain becomes established. As expected, a critical determinant of the survival prospects of any invading strain is the magnitude of its reproduction number relative to that of the background endemic strain. Whilst in most circumstances this ratio must exceed unity in order for invasion to be viable, we show that differential control scenarios can lead to less-fit novel strains invading populations hosting a fitter endemic one. This analysis and the accompanying findings will inform our understanding of the mechanisms that have led to past instances of successful strain invasion, and provide valuable lessons for thwarting future drug-resistant strain incursions.},

  abstract     = {In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common technique in assisted reproductive technology and in most cases the last resort for infertility treatment. It has four basic stages: superovulation , egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer . Superovulation is a drug-induced method to enable multiple ovulation per menstrual cycle and key component towards a successful IVF cycle. Although there are the general guidelines for dosage, the dose is not optimized for each patient, and complications, such as overstimulation, can occur. To overcome the shortcomings of this general system, a mathematical procedure is developed which can provide a customized model of this stage regarding the size distribution of eggs (follicles/ oocytes) obtained per cycle as a function of the chemical interactions of the drugs used and the conditions imposed on the patient during the cycle, which provide a basis for predicting the possible outcome. Uncertainty and risk are modeled and included in optimal drug dosage decisions. This paper describes the theory, model, and the optimal control procedure for improving outcomes of IVF treatment for one of the four protocols used in real practice. The validation of the procedure is performed using clinical data from the patients previously undergone IVF cycles. Customized patient-specific model parameters are obtained by using initial two-day data for each patient. Subsequently, this model is used to predict the FSD for the remaining days of the cycle. This procedure was conducted for 49 patients. The results of the customized models are found to be closely matching with the observed FSD. These results thus validate the modeling approach and consequently its use for predicting the customized optimal drug dosage for each patient. Using the customized model and the optimized dosage, the FSD at the end of the cycle was determined. A small double-blind clinical trial was also conducted in India. The results from the trial show that the dosage predicted by using the model is 40\% less than the suggestion made by the IVF clinicians. The testing and monitoring requirements for patients using optimized drug dosage is reduced by 72\%. Work on the other three protocols and for patients in the USA is started and is showing promising results.},

We then use these building blocks to compute geodesics, i.e., optimal deformations under the metric between root structures, and to perform statistical analysis on root populations. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework through an application to a dataset of wheat roots grown in different environmental conditions. We also show that the framework can be used in various applications including classification and regression.},

  abstract     = {Ball-rolling dung beetles show a remarkable ability to maintain a straight path while rolling dung balls away from a dung pile. Rolling in a straight line is beneficial, as it enables beetles to efficiently escape competition near the dung pile. Research has shown that beetles use the sky to choose and maintain an initial rolling direction, and to reorient (correct their direction) when pushed off their intended course by obstacles or uneven ground. While beetles’ mechanisms for navigation are well understood, it remains unclear how beetles regulate the timing of reorientation and under what circumstances reorientation is beneficial. Previous studies have focused only on the observable data from the movement of real dung beetles, in the field and simulated environments. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model based on a persistent random walk to simulate a dung beetle’s movement in a circular arena. We simulate two possible reorientation strategies and analyze the impact when reorientation is not perfect. We show that our model provides an approximation of actual dung ball rolling paths, analyze the benefits of each reorientation technique under varying conditions, and show that when the sky is obscured, rolling without reorientation can be a beetle’s optimal strategy.},

We adapt methods from work on these classical models to investigate the effects of the magnitude and frequency of environmental fluctuations on two important population statistics: the probability of fixation and the mean time to fixation. In particular, we find that for small frequencies, the system behaves similar to a system with a constant fitness difference between the two species, and for large frequencies, the system behaves similar to a neutrally competitive model. Most interestingly, the system exhibits nontrivial behavior for intermediate frequencies. We conclude by showing that our results agree quite well with recent theoretical work on competitive models with a stochastically changing environment, and discuss how the methods we develop ease the mathematical analysis required to study such models.},

In present work, probabilistic punishment and reward are introduced to PGG. Probabilistic punishment and reward mean that punishment and reward are executed with a certain probability. Although that will reduce unnecessary costs, occasional absence of execution can lead to distrust. Thus we focus on how to implement punishment and reward efficiently within the structured populations. Numerical simulations are performed and prove that probabilistic punishment and reward can promote the evolution of cooperation more effectively. Further researches indicate that there is an optimal executing probability to promote cooperation and maximize reduction of cost. In addition, when the unit cost is high, the PGG with probabilistic punishment and reward still helps the evolution of altruistic punishers and rewarders, thereby avoiding collapse of cooperation.},

Some disease-specific misfolded proteins can interact with healthy proteins to form long chains that are transported through the brain along axonal pathways. Since aggregates of different sizes have different transport properties and toxicity, it is important to follow independently their evolution in space and time. Here, we model the spreading and propagation of aggregates of misfolded proteins in the brain using the general Smoluchowski theory of nucleation, aggregation, and fragmentation. The transport processes considered here are either anisotropic diffusion along axonal bundles or discrete Laplacian transport along a network. In particular, we model the spreading and aggregation of both amyloid- β and τ molecules in the brain connectome. We show that these two models lead to different size distributions and different propagation along the network.

However, fractionation regimes routinely used in clinical practice typically ignore the synergy between radiation and the immune system, and instead attempt to completely eradicate tumors by the direct lethal effect of radiation on cancer cells. This paradigm is expected to change in the near future due to the potential benefits of considering radiation-induced antitumor immunity during treatment planning. Towards this goal, we propose a minimal modeling framework based on key aspects of the tumor-immune system interplay to simulate the effects of radiation on tumors and the immunological consequences of radiotherapy. The impacts of tumor-associated vasculature and intratumoral oxygen-mediated heterogeneity on treatment outcomes are ininvestigated. The model provides estimates of the minimum radiation doses required for tumor eradication given a certain number of treatment fractions. Moreover, estimates of treatment duration for disease control given predetermined fractional radiation doses can be also obtained. Although theoretical in nature, this study motivates the development and establishment of immune-based decision-support tools in radiotherapy planning.},

In particular, the sparse characteristics of gene expression data within and between groups. Therefore, this paper focuses on the study of tumor classification based on the sparsity characteristics of genes. On this basis, we propose a new method of tumor classification—Sparse Group Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and Support Vector Machine (SGL-SVM). Firstly, the primary selection of feature genes is performed on the normalized tumor datasets using the Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test. Secondly, using a sparse group Lasso for further selection, and finally, the support vector machine serves as a classifier for classification. We validate proposed method on microarray and NGS datasets respectively. Formerly, on three two-class and five multi-class microarray datasets it is tested by 10-fold cross-validation and compared with other three classifiers. SGL-SVM is then applied on BRCA and GBM datasets and tested by 5-fold cross-validation. Satisfactory accuracy is obtained by above experiments and compared with other proposed methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a higher classification accuracy and selects fewer feature genes, which can be widely applied in classification for high-dimensional and small-sample tumor datasets.

We present a theory for the evolution of molecule masses and show that small molecules grow by random diffusion and large molecules by a preferential attachment process leading eventually to life’s molecules. It reproduces correctly the distribution of molecules found via mass spectroscopy for the Murchison meteorite and estimates the start of chemical evolution back to 12.8 billion years following the birth of stars and supernovae. From the Frontier mass between the random and preferential attachment dynamics the birth time of molecule families can be estimated. Amino acids emerge about 165 million years after chemical elements emerge in stars. Using the scaling of reaction rates with the distance of the molecules in space we recover correctly the few days emergence time of amino acids in the Miller–Urey experiment. The distribution of interstellar and extragalactic molecules are both consistent with the evolutionary mass distribution, and their age is estimated to 108 and 65 million years after the start of evolution. From the model, we can determine the number of different molecule compositions at the time of the emergence of Earth to be 1.6 million and the number of molecule compositions in interstellar space to a mere 719 species.},

  abstract     = {Pirate phages use the structural proteins encoded by unrelated helper phages to propagate. The best-studied example is the pirate P4 and helper P2 of coliphages , and it has been known that the Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) that can encode virulence factors act as pirate phages, too. When alone in the host, the pirate phages act as a prophage, but when the helper phage gene is also in the same host cell, the pirate phage has ability to exploit the helper phages structural proteins to produce pirate phage particles and spread, interfering with the helper phage production. The known helper phages in these systems are temperate phages. Interestingly, the interference of the pirate phage to the helper phage occurs in a different manner between the SaPI-helper system and the P4-P2 system. SaPIs cannot lyse a helper lysogen upon infection, while when a helper phage lyse a SaPI lysogen, most of the phage particles produced are the SaPI particles. On the contrary, in the P4-P2 system, a pirate phage P4 can lyse a helper P2 lysogen to produce mostly the P4 particles, while when P2 phage lyses a P4 lysogen, most of the produced phages are the P2 particles. Here, the consequences of these different strategies in the pirate and helper phage spreading among uninfected host is analyzed by using mathematical models. It is found that SaPI’s strategy interferes with the helper phage spreading significantly more than the P4’s strategy, because SaPI interferes with the helper phage’s main reproduction step, while P4 interferes only by forcing the helper lysogens to lyse. However, the interference is found to be weaker in the spatially structured environment than in the well-mixed environment. This is because, in the spatial setting, the system tends to self-organize so that the helper phages take over the front of propagation due to the need of helper phage for the pirate phage spreading.},

  abstract     = {Predator-prey relationships belong to the most important and well-studied ecological interactions in nature. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is important to predict community dynamics and to estimate coexistence probability. Historically, evolution has been considered to be too slow to affect such ecological interactions. However, evolution can occur within ecological time scales, potentially affecting predator-prey communities. In an antagonistic pair-wise relationship the prey might evolve to minimize the effect caused by the predator (e.g. mortality), while the predator might evolve to maximize the effect (e.g. food intake). Evolution of one of the species or even co-evolution of both species in predator-prey relationships is often difficult to estimate from population dynamics without measuring of trait changes in predator and/or prey population. Particularly in microbial systems, where microorganisms evolve quickly, determining whether co-evolution occurs in predator-prey systems is challenging. We simulate observational data using quantitative trait evolution models and show that the interaction between bacteria and ciliates can be best explained as a co-evolutionary process, where both the prey and predator evolve. Evolution by prey alone explains the data less well, whereas the models with predator evolution alone or no evolution are both failing. We conclude that that ecology and evolution both interact in shaping community dynamics in microcosms. Ignoring the contribution of evolution might lead to incorrect conclusions.},

The major challenge in the commercialization of stevioside as a natural sweetener is its bitter-off taste. In this study, we prepared molecular models of potential taste receptors of stevioside, both sweet and bitter. With appropriate modifications on the stevioside backbone, we performed molecular docking of prepared ligands with both sweet and bitter taste receptors. Based on binding energy, we found that one of the potential substituents, Kamiya-8, shows a good affinity towards sweet taste and a weak affinity for bitter receptors. Further, we selected Kamiya-8 for molecular dynamics simulations to improve the prediction of binding energy and to check the binding strength of Kamiya-8 with taste receptors. Moreover, we also performed MM-PBSA calculation for calculating the end state free energies of molecules in solvent and found that Kamiya-8 gives a 2-fold effect as it interacts with sweet receptors (T1R2, T1R3) with lowest binding energy conformation (−285.265 kcal/mol, −571.481 kcal/mol). Secondly, it gives high binding energy (–273.319 kcal/mol, −355.500 kcal/mol) with bitter taste receptors (T2R4, T2R14) as compared to stevioside. Based on this study, we found that Kamiya-8 can be the potential substituent that can improve the palatability of stevioside.},

  abstract     = {The slow propagating waves of strong depolarization of neural cells characterizing cortical spreading depression, or depolarization, (SD) are known to break cerebral homeostasis and induce significant hemodynamic and electro-metabolic alterations. Mathematical models of cortical spreading depression found in the literature tend to focus on the changes occurring at the electrophysiological level rather than on the ensuing metabolic changes. In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical model which is able to simulate the coupled electrophysiology and metabolism dynamics of SD events, including the swelling of neurons and astrocytes and the concomitant shrinkage of extracellular space . The simulations show that the metabolic coupling leads to spontaneous repetitions of the SD events, which the electrophysiological model alone is not capable to produce. The model predictions, which corroborate experimental findings from the literature, show a strong disruption in metabolism accompanying each wave of spreading depression in the form of a sharp decrease of glucose and oxygen concentrations, with a simultaneous increase in lactate concentration which, in turn, delays the clearing of excess potassium in extracellular space. Our model suggests that the depletion of glucose and oxygen concentration is more pronounced in astrocyte than neuron, in line with the partitioning of the energetic cost of potassium clearing. The model suggests that the repeated SD events are electro-metabolic oscillations that cannot be explained by the electrophysiology alone. The model highlights the crucial role of astrocytes in cleaning the excess potassium flooding extracellular space during a spreading depression event: further, if the ratio of glial/neuron density increases, the frequency of cortical SD events decreases, and the peak potassium concentration in extracellular space is lower than with equal volume fractions.},

It is shown that the spatio-temporal growth noise has two opposing effect: the temporal noise promotes the reproducibility of the organ shape, whereas the spatial noise disturbs it, leading to the organ undergoing an abnormal shape deformation. To understand how such abnormality can emerge, we study the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix of the growth velocity. It is revealed that the anomalous shape deformations can be created by two independent factors: (1) excited modes where the orientations of the eigenvectors with m ≥ 2 are spatially correlated, and/or (2) soft spots where spot structures with high fluctuations in the magnitudes of the eigenvectors appear non-uniformly.},

  abstract     = {Gene regulatory networks are a popular tool for modelling important biological phenomena, such as cell differentiation or oncogenesis. Efficient identification of the causal connections between genes, their products and regulating transcription factors, is key to understanding how defects in their function may trigger diseases. Modelling approaches should keep up with the ever more detailed descriptions of the biological phenomena at play, as provided by new experimental findings and technical improvements. In recent years, we have seen great improvements in mapping of specific binding sites of many transcription factors to distinct regulatory regions. Recent gene regulatory network models use binding measurements; but usually only to define gene-to-gene interactions, ignoring regulatory module structure. Moreover, current huge amount of transcriptomic data, and exploration of all possible cis-regulatory arrangements which can lead to the same transcriptomic response, makes manual model building both tedious and time-consuming. In our paper, we propose a method to specify possible regulatory connections in a given Boolean network, based on transcription factor binding evidence. This is implemented by an algorithm which expands a regular Boolean network model into a “cis-regulatory” Boolean network model. This expanded model explicitly defines regulatory regions as additional nodes in the network, and adds new, valuable biological insights to the system dynamics. The expanded model can automatically be compared with expression data. And, for each node, a regulatory function, consistent with the experimental data, can be found. The resulting models are usually more constrained (by biologically-motivated metadata), and can then be inspected in in silico simulations. The fully automated method for model identification has been implemented in Python, and the expansion algorithm in R. The method resorts to the Z3 Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver, and is similar to the RE:IN application (Yordanov et al., 2016). It is available on https://github.com/regulomics/expansion-network .},

  abstract     = {During an outbreak, the perceived infection risk of an individual affects his/her behavior during an epidemic to lower the risk. We incorporate the awareness of infection risk into the Volz-Miller SIR epidemic model, to study the effect of awareness on disease dynamics. We consider two levels of awareness, the local one represented by the prevalence among the contacts of an individual, and the global one represented by the prevalence in the population. We also consider two possible effects of awareness: reducing infection rate or breaking infectious edges. We use the next generation matrix method to obtain the basic reproduction number of our models, and show that awareness acquired during an epidemic does not affect the basic reproduction number. However, awareness acquired from outbreaks in other regions before the start of the local epidemic reduces the basic reproduction number. Awareness always reduces the final size of an epidemic. Breaking infectious edges causes a larger reduction than reducing the infection rate. If awareness reduces the infection rate, the reduction increases with both local and global awareness. However, if it breaks infectious edges, the reduction may not be monotonic. For the same awareness, the reduction may reach a maximum on some intermediate infection rates. Whether local or global awareness has a larger effect on reducing the final size depends on the network degree distribution and the infection rate.},

This process can occur at nested spatial scales: from the microscopic (e.g., the emergence of cells) to the macroscopic (e.g. the emergence of organisms). In this paper, we pursue the idea that Markov blankets – that separate the internal states of a structure from external states – can self-assemble at successively higher levels of organisation. Using simulations, based on the principle of variational free energy minimisation, we show that hierarchical self-organisation emerges when the microscopic elements of an ensemble have prior (e.g., genetic) beliefs that they participate in a macroscopic Markov blanket: i.e., they can only influence – or be influenced by – a subset of other elements. Furthermore, the emergent structures look very much like those found in nature (e.g., cells or organelles), when influences are mediated by short range signalling. These simulations are offered as a proof of concept that hierarchical self-organisation of Markov blankets (into Markov blankets) can explain the self-evidencing, autopoietic behaviour of biological systems.},

  abstract     = {Understanding macroevolutionary patterns is central to evolutionary biology. This involves the process of divergence within a species, which starts at the microevolutionary level, for instance, when two subpopulations evolve towards different phenotypic optima. The speed at which these optima are reached is controlled by the degree of stabilising selection, which pushes the mean trait towards different optima in the different subpopulations, and ongoing migration that pulls the mean phenotype away from that optimum. Traditionally, macro phenotypic evolution is modelled by directional selection processes, but these models usually ignore the role of migration within species. Here, our goal is to reconcile the processes of micro and macroevolution by modelling migration as part of the speciation process. More precisely, we introduce an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model where migration happens between two subpopulations within a branch of a phylogeny and this migration decreases over time as it happens during speciation. We then use this model to study the evolution of trait means along a phylogeny, as well as the way phenotypic disparity between species changes with successive epochs. We show that ignoring the effect of migration in sampled time-series data biases significantly the estimation of the selective forces acting upon it. We also show that migration decreases the expected phenotypic disparity between species and we analyse the effect of migration in the particular case of niche filling. We further introduce a method to jointly estimate selection and migration from time-series data. Our model extends traditional quantitative genetics results of selection and migration from a microevolutionary time frame to multiple speciation events at a macroevolutionary scale. Our results further support that not accounting for gene flow has important consequences in inferences at both the micro and macroevolutionary scale.},

  abstract     = {The elasticity-directed differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells has been widely studied since mid 2000s. Over nearly linear-elastic materials the differentiation of the stem cells are shown to be related to the Young&#39;s modulus of the substrate. While it is found that constraining the stem cells to some pre-patterned shape and size affects their differentiation, it has been also well recognized that the cell morphology intimately relates to its type and functionality such that the cell morphology has been accepted as an indicator for the differentiation path. This paper conjectures the importance of geometry in differentiation and claims that the elasticity indicator for differentiation is indeed &quot;the stiffness&quot; which contains not only the elasticity coefficient but also the geometrical information. An elasticity model is derived for a singular cell with different shapes over a thick substrate, which almost resembles the condition for most of the tests with sparse distribution of the cells. Analysis of principle shapes such as square, rectangle, and hexagon (with and without dendrites) suggest that the larger the aspect ratio i.e. the further the shape to the roundness, the larger the substrate stiffness experienced by the cells. By moving towards a more round shape such as a hexagon with or without dendrites the substrate stiffness falls off rapidly. Then by including the stiffness of the cell body itself we arrive at a more important finding; the cells at free culture condition prefer the shape which best equalizes their experienced stiffness of the substrate and that of their own body. The body-to-substrate stiffness ratio, hence, explains why a slender rectangle is the preferred shape at myogenic differentiation range and a hexagon with dendrites is the preferred one at neurogenic range.},

The fractional dose vaccination strategy as one of feasible strategies was proposed in response to global shortages of vaccine stockpiles. Although a variety of epidemic models have been developed under the circumstances of limited resources in treatment, few models particularly investigated vaccination strategies in resource-limited settings. In this paper, we develop a two-group SIR model with incorporation of proportionate mixing patterns and n -fold fractional dose vaccination related parameters to evaluate the efficiency of fractional dose vaccination on disease control at the population level. The existence and uniqueness of the final size of the two-group SIR epidemic model, the formulation of the basic reproduction number and the relationship between them are established. Moreover, numerical simulations are performed based on this two-group vector-free model to investigate the effectiveness of n -fold fractional dose vaccination by using the emergency outbreaks of yellow fever in Angola in 2016. By employing linear and nonlinear dose-response relationships, we compare the resulting fluctuations of four characteristics of the epidemics, which are the outbreak size, the peak time of the outbreak, the basic reproduction number and the infection attack rate (IAR). For both types of dose-response relationships, dose-fractionation takes positive effects in lowering the outbreak size, delay the peak time of the outbreak, reducing the basic reproduction number and the IAR of yellow fever only when the vaccine efficacy is high enough. Moreover, five-fold fractional dose vaccination strategy may not be the optimal vaccination strategy as proposed by the World Health Organization if the dose-response relationship is nonlinear.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic dominance between species may yield spiral waves that are known to provide a mechanism enabling persistent species coexistence. This observation holds true even in presence of spatial heterogeneity in the form of quenched disorder. In this work we study the effects on spatio-temporal patterns and species coexistence of structured spatial heterogeneity in the form of habitats that locally provide one of the species with an advantage. Performing extensive numerical simulations of systems with three and six species we show that these structured habitats destabilize spiral waves. Analyzing extinction events , we find that species extinction probabilities display a succession of maxima as function of time, that indicate a periodically enhanced probability for species extinction. Analysis of the mean extinction time reveals that as a function of the parameter governing the advantage of one of the species a transition between stable coexistence and unstable coexistence takes place. We also investigate how efficiency as a predator or a prey affects species coexistence.},

In particular, it has been suggested that Asgardarchaeota would be part of the same clade of eukaryotes. If so - and being the difference between Asgardarchaeota and eukaryotes very large - then all this would imply that their common ancestor was a progenote, i.e. a protocell in which the relationship between genotype and phenotype was still evolving. This, in turn, would imply that true cells would appear on the tree of life only later, that is to say, only when the ancestor of Asgardarchaeota and the one of eukaryotes appeared. However, this way of seeing would define these ancestors as primary fundamental cells, namely, as cellular domains of life because it would be in this evolutionary stage that true cells would appear for the first time. Finally, the Asgardarchaeota-eukaryote transition is discussed, that is, some aspects of eukaryogenesis and the taxonomic rank of eukaryotes are analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Most animals are at risk from multiple predators and can vary anti-predator behaviour based on the level of threat posed by each predator. Animals use sensory systems to detect predator cues, but the relationship between the tuning of sensory systems and the sensory cues related to predator threat are not well-studied at the community level. Noctuid moths have ultrasound-sensitive ears to detect the echolocation calls of predatory bats. Here, combining empirical data and mathematical modelling, we show that moth hearing is adapted to provide information about the threat posed by different sympatric bat species. First, we found that multiple characteristics related to the threat posed by bats to moths correlate with bat echolocation call frequency. Second, the frequency tuning of the most sensitive auditory receptor in noctuid moth ears provides information allowing moths to escape detection by all sympatric bats with similar safety margin distances. Third, the least sensitive auditory receptor usually responds to bat echolocation calls at a similar distance across all moth species for a given bat species. If this neuron triggers last-ditch evasive flight, it suggests that there is an ideal reaction distance for each bat species, regardless of moth size. This study shows that even a very simple sensory system can adapt to deliver information suitable for triggering appropriate defensive reactions to each predator in a multiple predator community.},

Tuberculosis bacteria can stay latent and reactivate after passing appropriate conditions. For this reason, control of this disease and treatment of infected people has a significant importance, and observing health issues can prevent the spread of it. In this paper, a nonlinear adaptive control method is proposed for the first time in order to control and treat tuberculosis outbreak subjected to the modeling uncertainty. To design a control system being robust against uncertainties, an adaptation law is defined to update values of estimated parameters and ensures the whole system stability. The treatment achievement and stability of the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov theorem and confirmed by some simulations. The proposed strategy has the capability to control the tuberculosis outbreak by reducing the numbers of active infectious and persistent latent individuals based on their desired values in the society.},

Further, this can be achieved with observations taken on only a few specific days, chosen optimally, within each household. The information provided by this method may inform decision making processes for outbreak response.

For example, in response to the nutritional environment of their soil, plants regulate resource allocation in their roots in order to plastically change their root system architecture (RSA) for efficiently absorbing nutrients. However, it is still not understood why and how RSA is adaptively controlled. Therefore, we modeled and investigated the spatial regulation of resource allocation, focusing on RSA in response to nutrient availability, and provided analytical solutions to the optimal strategy in the case of simple fitness functions. We first showed that our model could explain the experimental evidence where root growth is maximized at the optimal nutrient concentration under the homogeneous condition. Next, we extended our model to incorporate the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient availability. This extended model revealed that growth suppression by systemic control is required for adapting to high nutrient conditions, whereas growth promotion by local control is sufficient for adaptation to low-nutrient environments. This evidence predicts that systemic control can be evolved in the presence of excessive amounts of nutrition, consistent with the ‘N-supply’ systemic signal that is observed experimentally. Furthermore, our model can also explain various experimental results using nitrogen nutrition. Our model provides a theoretical basis for understanding the spatial regulation of adaptive resource allocation in response to nutritional environment.},

  abstract     = {Combating the evolution of widespread antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing challenges facing modern medicine. Recent research has demonstrated that the evolution of pathogens with high levels of resistance can be accelerated by spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in antibiotic concentration, which frequently arise in patients and the environment. Strategies to predict and counteract the effects of such inhomogeneities will be critical in the fight against resistance. In this paper we develop a mechanistic framework for modelling the adaptive evolution of resistance in the presence of spatiotemporal antibiotic concentrations, which treats the adaptive process as an interaction between two mutually orthogonal forces; the first returns cells to their wild-type state in the absence of antibiotic selection, and the second selects for increased coping ability in the presence of an antibiotic. We apply our model to investigate laboratory adaptation experiments, and then extend it to consider the case in which multiple strategies for resistance undergo competitive evolution.},

This perturbation provides a model for the effect of infected human movement between villages with differing degrees of parasite control induced by mass drug administration (MDA). Analysing the dynamical behaviour around the unstable equilibrium, known as the transmission ‘breakpoint’, we illustrate how slowly-varying the dynamics are and develop an understanding of how discrete ‘pulses’ in the release of transmission stages (eggs or larvae, depending on the species of STH), due to infected human migration between villages, can lead to perturbations in the deterministic transmission dynamics. Such perturbations are found to have the potential to undermine targets for parasite elimination as a result of MDA and/or improvements in water and sanitation provision. We extend our analysis by developing a simple stochastic model and analytically investigate the uncertainty this induces in the dynamics. Where appropriate, all analytical results are supported by numerical analyses.},

We will also discuss the efficacy of these practices in the population dynamics of three species (a fast life-cycle mayfly, a slow life-cycle dragonfly and an ostracod) when their habitat suffers from periodic controlled flooding. One of the main messages of this paper is that the interplay between the inherited parameters of the population and disturbance events is a source of rich and unexpected behaviours.

By doing so, PoMo accounts for ancestral and current intra-population variation, while also accommodating population-level processes ruling the substitution process (e.g. genetic drift, mutations, allelic selection). PoMo has shown to be a valuable tool in several phylogenetic applications but a proof of statistical consistency (and identifiability, a necessary condition for consistency) is lacking. Here, we prove that PoMo is identifiable and, using this result, we further show that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) tree estimator of PoMo is a consistent estimator of the species tree. We complement our theoretical results with a simulated data set mimicking the diversity observed in natural populations exhibiting incomplete lineage sorting. We implemented PoMo in a Bayesian framework and show that the MAP tree easily recovers the true tree for typical numbers of sites that are sampled in genome-wide analyses.},

Here, I used the architecture of 45 real-world weighted bipartite networks to assess whether network size, connectance, and nestedness are related to the effects of pulse disturbances in antagonistic communities. Networks were simulated under five scenarios with different combinations of frequency and intensity of perturbations. The dynamics of resource-consumer interactions followed the adaptive interaction switching behavior, which is the key topological process underlying most of the architectures of antagonistic webs. As opposed to most studies considering the effects of disturbances as species extinctions explicitly, the effects of disturbances here were modeled as changes in the abundance of consumers following immediate reductions in the abundance of resources. Simulations revealed that community robustness to pulse disturbances increased with both connectance and nestedness overall, with no effect of network size. Community networks with highly connected and nested topologies were more robust to disturbances, particularly under high frequency and intensity perturbations. By considering disturbances that are not directly related to species’ extinctions, this study provides valuable insights that connectance and nestedness have an important stabilizing role in ecological networks.},

  abstract     = {The geographic niches of many species are dramatically changing as a result of environmental and anthropogenic impacts such as global climate change and the introduction of invasive species . In particular, genetically compatible subspecies that were once geographically separated are being reintroduced to one another. This is of concern for conservation, where rare or threatened subspecies could be bred out by hybridising with their more common relatives, and for commercial interests, where the stock or quality of desirable harvested species could be compromised. It is also relevant to disease ecology, where disease transmission is heterogeneous among subspecies and hybridisation may affect the rate and spatial spread of disease. We develop and investigate a mathematical model to combine competitive effects via the Lotka-Volterra model with hybridisation effects via mate choice. The species complex is structured into two classes: a subspecies of interest (named x ), and other subspecies including any hybrids produced (named y ). We show that in the absence of limit cycles the model has four possible equilibrium outcomes, representing every combination: total extinction, x -dominance ( y extinct), y -dominance ( x extinct), and at most a single coexistence equilibrium. We give conditions for which limit cycles cannot exist, then further show that the “total extinction” equilibrium is always unstable, that y -dominance is always stable, and that the other equilibria have stability depending on the model parameters. We demonstrate that both x -dominance and coexistence are achievable under a wide range of parameter values and initial conditions, which corresponds with empirical evidence of known competing-hybridising systems. We then briefly examine bifurcation behaviour. In particular, we note that a subcritical bifurcation is possible in which a “catastrophic” transition from x -dominance to y -dominance can occur, representing an invasion event. Finally, we briefly examine the common complication of time-varying carrying capacity, showing that such a case can make coexistence more likely.},

The mechanisms shaping multiple-wave influenza outbreaks are diverse but are yet to be summarized in a systematic fashion. For this purpose, we described 12 distinct mechanistic models, among which five models were proposed for the first time, that support two waves of infection in a single influenza season, and classified them into five categories according to heterogeneities in host, pathogen, space, time and their combinations, respectively. To quantify the number of infection waves, we proposed three metrics that provide robust and intuitive results for real epidemics. Further, we performed sensitivity analyses on key parameters in each model and found that reducing the basic reproduction number or the transmission rate, limiting the addition of susceptible people who are to get the primary infection to infected areas, and limiting the probability of replenishment of people who are to be reinfected in the short term, could decrease the number of infection waves and clinical attack rate. Finally, we introduced a modelling framework to infer the mechanisms driving two-wave outbreaks. A better understanding of two-wave mechanisms could guide public health authorities to develop and implement preparedness plans and deploy control strategies.},

  abstract     = {Therapeutic cancer vaccines often do not substantially reduce tumour burden, despite stimulating anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Recent experiments have shown that the majority of vaccine-elicited CTLs may be of low-avidity. Moreover, low-avidity CTLs, which are abundant, do not kill cancer cells and potentially inhibit the ability of high-avidity T cells to kill cancer cells. By modelling CTL selection using a system of ordinary differential equations, we show that the efficacy of the peptide vaccine may be improved by controlling its delivery and dosage to preferentially elicit high-avidity CTLs. Our simulations predict that weekly, reduced doses of a vaccine may result in a greater than 90\% reduction in cancer concentration. By contrast, a standard vaccine protocol such as a high-dose injection given every 2 weeks induces only a 65\% reduction. Our model demonstrates a proof-of-concept approach to targeting immune responses for CTL selection, thereby offering a technique to potentially improve existing therapies.},

  abstract     = {Ecosystems often contain multiple species across two or more trophic levels , with a variety of interactions possible. In this paper we study two classes of models for generalist predators that utilize more than one food source. These models fall into two categories: predator - two prey and predator - prey - subsidy models. For the former, we consider a generalist predator which utilizes two distinct prey species, modelled via a Kolmogorov system of equations with Type II response functions. For the latter, we consider a generalist predator which exploits both a prey population and an allochthonous resource which is provided as a subsidy to the system exogenously, again with Type II response functions. This latter class of model is no longer Kolmogorov in form, due to an exogenous forcing term modelling the input of the allochthonous resource into the system. We non-dimensionalize both models, so that their respective parameter spaces may be more easily compared, and study the dynamics possible from each type of model, which will then indicate - for specific parameter regimes - which generalist predator’s preferences are more favorable to survival, including the prevalence of coexistence states. We also consider the various non-equilibrium dynamics emergent from such models, and show that the non-Kolmogorov predator - prey - subsidy model of 10 admits more regular dynamics (including steady states and one type of limit cycle), whereas the predator - two prey Kolmogorov model can feature multiple types of limit cycles, as well as multistability resulting in strong sensitivity to initial conditions (with stable limit cycles and steady states both coexisting for the same model parameters). Our results highlight several interesting differences and similarities between Kolmogorov and non-Kolmogorov models for generalist predators.},

Individual subsidies for vaccinations can be directed to hub agents with priority, to efficiently suppress the overall social cost of a vaccination program. These hub agents are more likely to spread both knowledge about vaccination and the disease in question. Our comprehensive simulations showed that this intuitively appealing strategy cannot be effective if the vaccination cost is low and the vaccination budget is small.

Despite the widespread acceptance of synthetic materials as tissue scaffolds for pelvic floor disorders, mechanical property mismatch between mesh and adjacent native tissue drives fibrosis and erosion, leading the FDA to remove several surgical meshes from the market. However, autologous tissue does not induce either fibrosis or adjacent tissue erosion, suggesting the potential for biomimetic surgical mesh. In this study, we determined the design rules for mesh that mimics native fascia by mathematically modeling multi-component polymer networks, composed of elastin-like and collagen-like fibers, using a spring-network model. To validate the model, we measured the stress-strain curves of native bovine and nonhuman primate ( Macaca mulatta ) abdominal fascia in both toe and linear regions. We find that the stiffer collagen-like fibers must remain limp until the elastin-like fibers extend to the initial length of spanning collagen-like fibers under uniaxial tension. Comparing model results to experiment determines the product of fiber volume fraction and elastic modulus, a critical design parameter. Dual fiber mesh with mechanical properties that mimic fascia are feasible. These results have broad application to a wide range of soft tissue replacements including ~200,000 surgeries/year for pelvic floor disorders, because standard-of-care mesh contain only stiffer polymers that behave more like collagen than native tissue.},

  abstract     = {High risk forms of human papillomaviruses ( HPVs ) promote cancerous lesions and are implicated in almost all cervical cancer. Of particular relevance to cancer progression is regulation of the early promoter that controls gene expression in the initial phases of infection and can eventually lead to pre-cancer progression. Our goal was to develop a stochastic model to investigate the control mechanisms that regulate gene expression from the HPV early promoter. Our model integrates modules that account for transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation of E1 and E2 early genes to form a functioning gene regulatory network. Each module consists of a set of biochemical steps whose stochastic evolution is governed by a chemical Master Equation and can be simulated using the Gillespie algorithm. To investigate the role of noise in gene expression, we compared our stochastic simulations with solutions to ordinary differential equations for the mean behavior of the system that are valid under the conditions of large molecular abundances and quasi-equilibrium for fast reactions. The model produced results consistent with known HPV biology. Our simulation results suggest that stochasticity plays a pivotal role in determining the dynamics of HPV gene expression. In particular, the combination of positive and negative feedback regulation generates stochastic bursts of gene expression. Analysis of the model reveals that regulation at the promoter affects burst amplitude and frequency, whereas splicing is more specialized to regulate burst frequency. Our results also suggest that splicing enhancers are a significant source of stochasticity in pre-mRNA abundance and that the number of viruses infecting the host cell represents a third important source of stochasticity in gene expression.},

An example is given by scale-free networks where the degree distribution follows a power law. In these type of networks there is not a typical degree. Some nodes may have low representation in the population but are key to drive disease transmission. Coarse graining may be used to simplify these complex networks. In this work we present a simple model consisting in of a network where nodes have only two possible degrees, a low degree close to the mean degree and a high degree about ten times the mean degree.

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs are a class of short, noncoding RNAs which are essential for the coordination and timing of cell differentiation and embryonic development. However, despite their guiding role in development, microRNAs are dysregulated in many pathologies, including nearly all cases of cancer. While both development and oncogenesis can be thought of as extremes of phenotypic plasticity , they characteristically manifest on much different time scales: one taking place over a matter of weeks, the other typically requiring decades. Because microRNAs are believed to support this plasticity, a critically important question is how microRNAs affect phenotypic stability on different time scales, and what dynamical characteristics shift the balance between these two roles. To address this question, we extend a well-established mathematical model of transcriptional gene regulation to include translational regulation by microRNAs, and examine their effects on both short- and long-term gene expression predictability. Our findings show that microRNAs greatly improve short-term predictability for earlier, developmental phenotypes while causing a small decrease in long-term predictability, and that these effects are difficult to separate. In addition to providing a theoretical explanation for this seemingly duplicitous behavior, we describe some of the properties which determine the cost-benefit balance between short-term stabilization and long-term destabilization.},

  abstract     = {Local cancer cell invasion is a complex process involving many cellular and tissue interactions and is an important prerequisite for metastatic spread, the main cause of cancer related deaths. As a tumour increases in malignancy, the cancer cells adopt the ability to mutate into secondary cell subpopulations giving rise to a heterogeneous tumour. This new cell subpopulation often carries higher invasive abilities and permits a quicker spread of the tumour. Building upon the recent multiscale modelling framework for cancer invasion within a fibrous ECM introduced in Shuttleworth and Trucu, (2019), in this paper we consider the process of local invasion by a heterotypic tumour consisting of two cancer cell populations mixed with a two-phase ECM. To that end, we address the double feedback link between the tissue-scale cancer dynamics and the cell-scale molecular processes through the development of a two-part modelling framework that crucially incorporates the multiscale dynamic redistribution of oriented fibres occurring within a two-phase extra-cellular matrix and combines this with the multiscale leading edge dynamics exploring key matrix-degrading enzymes molecular processes along the tumour interface that drive the movement of the cancer boundary. The modelling framework will be accompanied by computational results that explore the effects of the underlying fibre network on the overall pattern of cancer invasion.},

The variables (biomarkers) are concentrations of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, glucagon , non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDLTG), as well as muscle lipids, hepatic lipids, pancreatic lipids, fat mass and mass of β -cells. The model predicts isocaloric high carbohydrate low fat (HCLF) diet and low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diet trajectories to health which vary in fat mass by at most a few kilograms at steady state. The LCHF trajectories to health are faster than isocaloric HCLF trajectories with respect to fat mass loss, although these trajectories may be slower initially if parameters are adjusting from HCLF values. On LC diets, leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance are thought to increase. Increasing leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance is predicted to lower lipids including fat mass and VLDLTG. The model predicts that changes in VLDLTG due to a change in diet happen rapidly, approaching steady state values after a few weeks, reflecting leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance which are much harder to measure. The model predicts that if only insulin sensitivity increases on a LC diet, steady state fat mass would increase slightly. If leptin and insulin sensitivities increase concurrently, the combined effect could be a decrease in fat mass, consistent with the fact that increasing insulin sensitivity is often associated with fat mass loss in trials. The model predicts trajectories to fat type II diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia due to high carbohydrate moderate fat diets, on which insulin rises before falling, as ectopic fat deposits increase; made fatter and more diabetic by higher lipid consumption. It predicts trajectories to non-diabetic states with raised fat mass, VLDLTG and muscle, hepatic and pancreatic lipids due to moderate carbohydrate high fat diets. The model predicts paths to lean type II diabetes, on a diet of moderate energy but low β -cell replication rate or high death rate.},

In-silico experiments could significantly contribute to zebrafish research and welfare, by offering new means to support the 3Rs principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement. Here, we propose a data-driven modeling framework to predict the anxiety-related behavioral response of zebrafish to acute caffeine administration. The modeling framework unfolds along a two-time-scale dichotomy to capture freezing behavior along a slow temporal scale and burst-and-coast locomotion at a fast time-scale. Anchored in the theory of Markov chains and stochastic differential equations, we demonstrate a parsimonious, yet robust, modeling framework to accurately simulate experimental observations of zebrafish treated at different caffeine concentrations.

Here, we present a mathematical model of biofilm response to NO ·, as a stressor. The model is comprised of a PDE system of highly nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations that we study in computer simulations to determine the positive and negative effects of key parameters on bacterial defenses against NO ·. From the reported results, we conjecture that the oscillatory behavior of NO · under a microaerobic regime is a temporal phenomenon and does not give rise to a spatial pattern. It is also shown computationally that decreasing the initial size of the biofilm colony negatively impacts the functionality of reducing agents that deactivate NO ·. Whereas nutrient deprivation results in the development of biofilms with heterogeneous structure, its effect on the activity of NO · reductants depends on the oxygen availability, biofilm size, and the amount of NO ·.},

Unfortunately, virus particles rapidly decay inside the body, significantly hindering their efficacy. In this article, treatment perturbations that could overcome obstacles to oncolytic virotherapy are investigated through the development of a Voronoi Cell-Based model (VCBM). The VCBM derived captures the interaction between an oncolytic virus and cancer cells in a 2-dimensional setting by using an agent-based model, where cell edges are designated by a Voronoi tessellation. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of treatment efficacy to the configuration of the treatment injections for different tumour shapes: circular, rectangular and irregular. The model predicts that multiple off-centre injections improve treatment efficacy irrespective of tumour shape. Additionally, we investigate delaying the infection of cancer cells by modifying viral particles with a substance such as alginate (a hydrogel polymer used in a range of cancer treatments). Simulations of the VCBM show that delaying the infection of cancer cells, and thus allowing more time for virus dissemination, can improve the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy. The simulated treatment noticeably decreases the tumour size with no increase in toxicity. Improving oncolytic virotherapy in this way allows for a more effective treatment without changing its fundamental essence.},

Such patterns include the expected total number of species and species-abundance distributions describing the expected number of species in different abundance classes. However, the expected patterns represent only the central tendencies of the full distributions of possible outcomes. Thus, ecological inferences and conclusions based only on expected patterns are incomplete, and may be misleading. Here, we address this issue for the spatially implicit neutral model, by using classic results from birth–death processes to derive (1) the probability distribution of extinction time of a species with given abundance for the metacommunity; (2) the probability distributions of total species richness and number of species with given abundance for both the metacommunity and local community; and (3) the probability distributions of the average immigration and extinction rates in the local community, across different values of total species richness. We illustrate the utility of these probability distributions in providing greater ecological insight via statistical inference. Firstly, we show that under the neutral metacommunity model, there is only 2.65 × 10 − 9 2.65×10−9 probability that the age of a common tree species in the Amazon is  ≤ 3  × 10 8 yr, which is approximately the oldest estimated age of the first angiosperm . Thus, species ages from the model are unrealistically high. Secondly, for a tree community in a 50 ha plot at Barro Colorado Island in Panama, we show that the spatially implicit model can be fitted to observed species richness and an independent estimate of the immigration parameter, with the fitted model predicting a species-abundance distribution close to the observed distribution. Our results complement those using sampling formulae that specify the multivariate probability distribution of species abundances from neutral models.},

  abstract     = {Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric protein of blood plasma that mediates platelet adhesion to injury under strong hemodynamic flows in arterias and microvasvulature. We present a 3D coarse-grained computer model of VWF multimers in flowing viscous fluid that explicitely grasps the dynamics, the conformational changes and the hydrodynamics-induced activation of adhesivity of these protein concatamers to GPIb receptor of blood platelets . The model is based on the fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann method for modelling the hydrodynamics in the simulation box and the Lagrangian particle dynamics coupled to the fluid by a viscous drag force. The model has been validated by the comparison with the experimental data found in literature. We studied the effect of hydrophobic interactions on the conformational dynamics of VWF multimers. The simulations suggest that the contour length is an important parameter that controls the functionality of VWF multimers in blood. We also demonstrate that tethering to the surface of a vessel wall promoted the flow-induced activation of VWF, while those multimers that remain untethered and move freely in the blood plasma require a stronger shearing to get activated.},

  abstract     = {Planarian worms reproduce asexually by fission, resulting in two separated pieces each repatterning and regenerating a complete animal. The induction of this process is known to be dependent on the size of the worm as well as on environmental factors such as population density, temperature, and light intensity. However, despite much progress in understanding the signaling mechanisms of planarian regeneration and the biomechanics of fissioning, no induction mechanism has been proposed for the signaling of fission. Here, we propose and analyze a cross-inhibited Turing system in a growing domain for the signaling of fission in planaria and the regeneration of the anterior-posterior opposite head and tail gene expression gradient patterns. This self-regulated mechanism explains when and where growing planaria fission, and its dependence on the worm length. Furthermore, we show how a delayed control mechanism of the cross-inhibited Turing system explains the asymmetry of the resulting fragments, the induction of fission with an anterior amputation even in a short worm, the consecutive multiple fissions called fragmentation, and the effects of environmental factors in the signaling of fission. We discuss the possible molecular and biophysical implementations of the proposed model and suggest specific experiments to elucidate them. In summary, the proposed controlled cross-inhibited Turing system represents a completely self-regulated model of the fission and regeneration signaling in planaria.},

  abstract     = {Resource sharing outside the kinship bonds is rare. Besides humans, it occurs in chimpanzee, wild dogs and hyenas, as well as in vampire bats. Resource sharing is an instance of animal cooperation, where an animal gives away part of the resources that it owns for the benefit of a recipient. Taking inspiration from blood-sharing in vampire bats, here we show the emergence of generosity in a Markov game, which couples the resource sharing between two players with the gathering task of that resource. At variance with the classical evolutionary models for cooperation, the optimal strategies of this game can be potentially learned by animals during their life-time. The players act greedily, that is, they try to individually maximize only their personal income. Nonetheless, the analytical solution of the model shows that three non trivial optimal behaviours emerge depending on conditions. Besides the obvious case when players are selfish in their choice of resource division, there are conditions under which both players are generous. Moreover, we also found a range of situations in which one selfish player exploits another generous individual, for the satisfaction of both players. Our results show that resource sharing is favoured by three factors: a long time horizon over which the players try to optimize their own game, the similarity among players in their ability of performing the resource-gathering task, as well as by the availability of resources in the environment. These concurrent requirements lead to identify necessary conditions for the emergence of generosity.},

The latter employs the k th 2-tuple (dis) similarity matrix to codify information related to covalent and non-covalent interactions in these biopolymers . The calculation of the inter-amino acid distances is generalized by using several dis-similarity coefficients, where normalization procedures based on the simple stochastic and mutual probability schemes are applied. A new local-fragment approach based on amino acid- types and amino acid- groups is proposed to characterize regions of interest in proteins. Topological and geometric macromolecular cutoffs are defined using local and total indices to highlight non-covalent interactions existing between the side-chains of each amino acid. Moreover, local and total indices calculations are generalized considering a LEGO approach, by using several aggregation operators. Collinearity and variability analyses are performed to evaluate every generalizing component applied to the definition of these novel indices. These experiments are oriented to reduce the number of MDs obtained for performing prediction models. The predictive power of the proposed indices was evaluated using two benchmark datasets, folding rate and secondary structural classification of proteins. The proposed MDs are modeled using the following strategies: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), respectively. The best regression model developed for the folding rate of proteins yields a cross-validation coefficient of 0.875 (Test Set) and the best model developed for secondary structural classification obtained 98\% of instances correctly classified (Test Set). These statistical parameters are superior to the ones obtained with existing MDs reported in the literature. Overall, the new theoretical generalization enhanced the information extraction into the MDs, allowing a better correlation between these two evaluated benchmark datasets and the proposed indices. The optimal theoretical configurations defined for the calculation of these MDs consider low collinearity and less information redundancy among them. These theoretical configurations and the software are available at http://tomocomd.com/mulims-mcompas .},

We hypothesize that instead of its ongoing supervised adaptation, the therapy may be constructed as a self-sustaining evolutionary process in a dynamic fitness landscape established implicitly by evolving cancer cells, microenvironment and the therapy itself. For these purposes, we replace a unified therapy with the ‘therapy species’, which is a population of heterogeneous elementary therapies, and propose a way how to turn the toxicity of the elementary therapy into its fitness in a way conforming to evolutionary causation. As a result, not only the therapies govern the evolution of different cell phenotypes, but the cells’ resistances govern the evolution of the therapies as well. We illustrate the approach by the minimalistic ad hoc evolutionary model. Its results indicate that the resistant cells could bias the evolution towards more toxic elementary therapies by inhibiting the less toxic ones. As the evolutionary causation of cancer drug resistance has been intensively studied for a few decades, we refer to cancer as a special case to illustrate purely theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Glucagon release from the pancreatic alpha-cells is regulated by glucose, but the underlying mechanisms are far from understood. It is known that the alpha-cell population is very heterogeneous, but – compared to the insulin-secreting beta-cells – the consequences of this cell-to-cell variation are much less studied. Since the alpha-cells are not electrically coupled, large differences in the single cell responses are to be expected, and this variation may contribute to the confusion regarding the mechanisms of glucose-induced suppression of glucagon release. Using mathematical modeling of alpha-cells with realistic cell-to-cell parameter variation based on recent experimental results, we show that the simulated alpha-cells exhibit great diversity in their electrophysiological behavior. To robustly reproduce experimental recordings from alpha-cell exposed to a rise in glucose levels, we must assume that both intrinsic mechanisms and paracrine signals contribute to glucose-induced changes in electrical activity. Our simulations suggest that the sum of different electrophysiological responses due to alpha-cell heterogeneity is involved in glucose-suppressed glucagon secretion, and that more than one mechanism contribute to control the alpha-cell populations’ behavior. Finally, we apply regression analysis to our synthetic alpha-cell population to infer which membrane currents influence electrical activity in alpha-cells at different glucose levels. The results from such statistical modeling suggest possible disturbances underlying defect regulation of alpha-cell electrical behavior in diabetics. Thus, although alpha-cells appear to be inherently complex and heterogeneous as reflected in published data, realistic modeling of the alpha-cells at the population level provides insight into the mechanisms of glucagon release.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are becoming widely used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, the ability to predict the patient&#39;s benefit from these therapeutics remains an unmet clinical need. Mathematical models that predict melanoma patients’ response to ICI can contribute to better informed clinical decisions. Here, we developed a simple mathematical population model for pembrolizumab-treated advanced melanoma patients, and analyzed the local and global dynamics of the system. Our results show that zero, one, or two steady states of the mathematical system exist in the phase plane, depending on the parameter values of individual patients. Without treatment, the simulated tumors grew uncontrollably. At increased efficacy of the immune system, e.g., due to immunotherapy, two steady states were found, one leading to uncontrollable tumor growth, and the other resulting in tumor size stabilization. Model analysis indicates that a sufficient increase in the activation of CD8+ T cells results in stable disease, whereas a significant reduction in T-cell exhaustion, another process contributing CD8+ T cell activity, temporarily reduces the tumor mass, but fails to control disease progression in the long run. Importantly, the initial tumor burden influences the response to treatment: small tumors respond better to treatment than larger tumors. In conclusion, our model suggests that disease progression and response to ICI depend on the ratio between activation and exhaustion rates of CD8+ T cells. The analysis of the model provides a foundation for the use of computational methods to personalize immunotherapy.},

The two models continue to inform hypotheses and computational studies of differentiation of lineage-adjacent cell types. However, their shared notion (based on bacterial regulatory systems) of gene switches and networks built from them have constrained progress in understanding the dynamics and evolution of differentiation. Recent work has described unique write-read-rewrite chromatin-based expression encoding in eukaryotes, as well metazoan-specific processes of gene activation and silencing in condensed-phase, enhancer-recruiting regulatory hubs, employing disordered proteins, including transcription factors, with context-dependent identities. These findings suggest an evolutionary scenario in which the origination of differentiation in animals, rather than depending exclusively on adaptive natural selection, emerged as a consequence of a type of multicellularity in which the novel metazoan gene regulatory apparatus was readily mobilized to amplify and exaggerate inherent cell functions of unicellular ancestors. The plausibility of this hypothesis is illustrated by the evolution of the developmental role of Grainyhead-like in the formation of epithelium.},

Our framework is a SIR compartmental model with fully rational forward looking agents who can therefore anticipate on the effects of the mandatory vaccination policy. Before vaccination becomes mandatory, parents decide altruistically and freely whether to vaccinate their children. We model eager and reluctant vaccinationist parents. We provide numerical evidence suggesting that individual anticipatory behavior may lead to a transient increase in measles prevalence before steady state eradication.

In particular, under exponential and sub-exponential growth scenarios, we evaluate, via simulations, the error rate of making an incorrect characterization of early outbreak growth patterns. Simulation results show that the ability to correctly identify early outbreak growth patterns can be affected by overdispersion even when accounted for using the Negative binomial model.

In particular, enterovirus 71 (EV-A71), coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) dominated the prevalence of HFMD infections alternatively in recent years with various outbreak sizes in Baoji, a city of Shaanxi Province in Northwest China. Estimating the reproduction number for various enteroviruses serotypes in northwest China (north temperate zone) and identification of cyclicity of HFMD infections are therefore an issue of great importance for future epidemics prediction and control. The basic/effective reproduction numbers for EV-A71, CV-A16 and CV-A6 were estimated based on daily new cases in 2010, 2011 and 2018, respectively, in which the corresponding pathogen dominated the epidemic. Two different methods based on serial interval were adopted and the basic reproduction number were estimated to be in the range of (1.33, 1.46) for CV-A16, (1.20, 1.29) for EV-A71, and (1.38, 1.59) for CV-A6, respectively. The estimated daily effective reproduction numbers significantly fluctuated before June or after July but varied mildly in (0.5,2) in around June to July for three serotypes. The weekly effective reproduction number for HFMD was estimated based on weekly new cases from year 2010 to 2018, and in most years it peaked in the range of (1.6,2.0) in February to March as well as in the range of (1.0,1.2) in September to October. The wavelet analysis based on the time series of HFMD cases from 2008 to 2018 showed obvious annual and semi-annual cyclicity, while the inter-annual cycles are infeasible. In this study we found that CV-A6 shows the greatest transmission ability among these three pathogens while EV-A71 exhibits the weakest ability of transmission, and moreover, the estimated values of basic reproduction number in northwest China are lower than those in Singapore, Hongkong and Guangdong, which may be due to different climatic circumstances.},

  abstract     = {We present results of a study of the early-time response of the innate immune system to influenza virus infection in an agent-based model (ABM) of epithelial cell layers. We find that the competition between the anti-viral immune response and viral antagonism can lead to viral titers non-monotonic in the initial infection fraction as found in experiments. Our model includes a coarse-grained version of intra-cellular processes and inter-cellular communication via cytokine and virion diffusion. We use ABM to follow the propagation of viral infection in the layer and the increase of the viral load as a function of time for different values of the multiplicity of infection (MOI), the initial number of viruses added per cell. We find that for moderately strong host immune response, the number of infected cells and viral load for a smaller MOI exceeds that for larger MOI, as seen in experiments. We elucidate the mechanism underlying this result as the synergistic action of cytokines secreted by infected cells in controlling viral amplification for larger MOI. We investigate the length and time scales that determine this non-monotonic behavior within the ABM. We study the diffusive spread of virions and cytokines from a single infected cell in an absorbing medium analytically and numerically and deduce the length scale that yields a good estimate of the MOI at which we find non-monotonicity. Detailed computations of the temporal behavior of averaged quantities and spatial measures provide further insights into host-viral interactions and connections to experimental observations.},

  abstract     = {Previous experimental results show that planting spacing has significant effects on root distribution and soil suction (negative pore water pressure) due to inter-plant competition. However, there is a lack of theoretical study on this aspect. This study proposes a new physically based mathematical model to capture planting spacing effects on root growth and soil suction considering three key factors, namely hydrotropism , soil mechanical impedance and inter-plant competition. The model is mainly composed of four parts: (i) extension of root zone front; (ii) increase in root density; (iii) root water uptake and (iv) water flow in soil matrix. Root growth and root water uptake are fully coupled. In order to validate the model, laboratory and field tests were conducted on one tree ( Schefflera heptaphylla ) and one shrub species ( Schefflera arboricola ), respectively, with different planting spacings. Even though the investigated tree and shrub species had different values of leaf area index and root length density, consistent conclusions on planting spacing effects can be drawn. When planting spacing became smaller, the size of root system decreased while root density increased, hence causing higher soil suction. The model can capture the root distributions as well as induced soil suction during both evapotranspiration and rainfall events quite well for both tree and shrub species.},

In this paper, the effect of a colored noise, which is associated with the inductive stimulus, on the saddle-node landscape of cell-fate induction is investigated, especially, the effect of the change of correlation time of colored noise on cell-fate induction. The main results show clearly that the change of correlation time of colored noise could induce the transitions of the system. This implies that the colored noise associated with inductive stimulus may have a profound effect on the saddle-node bifurcation landscape of cell-fate induction.

  abstract     = {Bees (Apidae) are flower-visiting insects that possess highly efficient mouthparts for the ingestion of nectar and other sucrose fluids. Their mouthparts are composed of mandibles and a tube-like proboscis. The proboscis forms a food canal, which encompasses a protrusible and hairy tongue to load and imbibe nectar, representing a fluid-feeding technique with a low Reynolds number. The western honey bee, Apis mellifera ligustica , can rhythmically erect the tongue microtrichia to regulate the glossal shape, achieving a tradeoff between nectar intake rate and viscous drag. Neotropical orchid bees ( Euglossa imperialis ) possess a proboscis longer than the body and combines this lapping-sucking mode of fluid-feeding with suction feeding. This additional technique of nectar uptake may have different biophysics. In order to reveal the effect of special structures of mouthparts in terms of feeding efficiency, we build a temporal model for orchid bees considering fluid transport in multi-states including active suction, tongue protraction and viscous dipping. Our model indicates that the dipping technique employed by honey bees can contribute to more than seven times the volumetric and energetic intake rate at a certain nectar concentration compared with the combined mode used by orchid bees. The high capability of the honey bee&#39;s proboscis to ingest nectar may inspire micropumps for transporting viscous liquid with higher efficiency.},

  abstract     = {The molecular oscillator of the mammalian circadian clock consists in a dynamical network of genes and proteins whose main regulatory mechanisms occur at the transcriptional level. From a dynamical point of view, the mechanisms leading to an oscillatory solution with an orderly protein peak expression and a clear day/night phase distinction remain unclear. Our goal is to identify the essential interactions needed to generate phase opposition between the activating CLOCK:BMAL1 and the repressing PER:CRY complexes and to better distinguish these two main clock molecular phases relating to rest/activity and fast/feeding cycles. To do this, we develop a transcription-based mathematical model centered on linear combinations of the clock controlled elements (CCEs): E-box, R-box and D-box. Each CCE is responsive to activators and repressors. After model calibration with single-cell data, we explore entrainment and period tuning via interplay with metabolism. Variation of the PER degradation rate γ p , relating to the tau mutation, results in asymmetric changes in the duration of the different clock molecular phases. Time spent at the state of high PER/PER:CRY decreases with γ p , while time spent at the state of high BMAL1 and CRY1, both proteins with activity in promoting insulin sensitivity, remains constant. This result suggests a possible mechanism behind the altered metabolism of tau mutation animals. Furthermore, we expose the clock system to two regulatory inputs, one relating to the fast/feeding cycle and the other to the light-dependent synchronization signaling. We observe the phase difference between these signals to also affect the relative duration of molecular clock states. Simulated circadian misalignment, known to correlate with insulin resistance, leads to decreased duration of BMAL1 expression. Our results reveal a possible mechanism for clock-controlled metabolic homeostasis , whereby the circadian clock controls the relative duration of different molecular (and metabolic) states in response to signaling inputs.},

We construct a novel vector-host mathematical model for two pathogens that exhibit superinfection exclusion and simultaneously account for vaccination strategies against them. We then derive the conditions under which an endemic disease will prevent the establishment of another through the action of superinfection exclusion and show that vaccination against the endemic strain can enable the previously suppressed strain to invade the population. Through appropriate parameterisation of the model for dengue and yellow fever we find that superinfection exclusion alone is unlikely to explain the absence of yellow fever in many regions where dengue is endemic, and that the rollout of the recently licensed dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, is unlikely to enable the establishment of Yellow Fever in regions where it has previously been absent.},

In this paper we consider a range of models of non-independent movement. We include established models, such as the ideal free distribution, but also develop novel models, such as the wheel. We also develop several ways to combine different models to create a flexible model of addressing a variety of dispersal mechanisms. We further devise novel measures of movement coordination and show how to generate a population movement that achieves appropriate values of the measure specified. We find the value of these measures for each of the core models described, as well as discuss their use, and potential limitations, in discerning the underlying movement mechanisms. The movement framework that we develop is both of interest as a stand-alone process to explore movement, but also able to generate a variety of movement patterns that can be embedded into wider evolutionary models where movement is not the only consideration.},

  abstract     = {Gastric cancer (GC) incidence and mortality in China remained high due to delayed diagnosis and accounted for about half of the world&#39;s GC cases and deaths. Early detection with endoscopic screening and consequent timely treatment can significantly improve survival. This study aimed to explore the long-term population impact of endoscopic screening on national GC disease burdens in China. Most of previous studies investigated the disease burdens of cancer using Markov model or age-period-cohort (APC) model, which are difficult to estimate the population size of undiagnosed cases. In this paper, we proposed a new dynamic compartmental model based on GC natural history and calibrated model outputs to diagnosed GC cases and GC-related death counts using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods . We investigated the impact of screening strategies with various coverage (10\%, 40\%, 70\%) and frequency (every 1, 3, 5 years) on disease burdens. We estimated that 2.22 (95\%CI: 1.97–2.47) million Chinese are living with GC in 2019, among which, 42.7\% (40.3–45.0\%) remained undiagnosed. Without systematic screening, we projected 10.46 (9.07–11.86) million incident cases and 7.35 (6.59–8.11) million GC-related deaths over the next 30 years (2019–2049). Screening with coverage rate at 10\%, 40\%, 70\% every 3 years could prevent 0.85 (0.63–1.06), 2.32 (1.79–2.86), and 3.04 (2.38–3.70) million incident cases, and prevent 1.17 (1.01–1.32), 3.08 (2.70–3.46), and 3.93 (3.46–4.40) million deaths respectively, compared with ‘no screening’ scenario. Screening would substantially increase the number of diagnosed GC cases within the first three years of program initiation, but this number would quickly reduce below ‘no screening’ scenario. Three-yearly screening at the above coverage rates would reduce the proportion of undiagnosed GC cases to 38.8\% (36.9–40.7\%), 25.5\% (23.4–27.6\%), and 17.8\% (16.0–19.6\%) by 2049, respectively. Delaying implementation of the screening program would substantially reduce its effectiveness. Initiating national endoscopic screening programmes would likely have a major effect on reducing GC incidence and mortality in China. Health resources should be substantially increased and directed to treatment of GC to cope with the initial rise in diagnosed GC cases.},

Accordingly, in recent years, the search for an understanding of how cooperation can be stimulated, even when it conflicts with individual interest, has intensified. We investigate the emergence of cooperation in an age-structured evolutionary spatial game. In it, players age with time and the payoff that they receive after each round depends on their age. We find that the outcome of the game is strongly influenced by the type of distribution used to modify the payoffs according to the age of each player.
