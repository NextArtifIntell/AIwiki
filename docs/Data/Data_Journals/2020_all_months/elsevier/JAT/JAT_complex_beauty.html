  abstract     = {The main aim of this paper is to prove novel results on stability of the semi-Fredholm property of operators on interpolation spaces generated by interpolation functors . The methods are based on some general ideas we develop in the paper. This allows us to extend some previous work in literature to the abstract setting. We show an application to interpolation methods introduced by Cwikel–Kalton–Milman–Rochberg which includes, as special cases, the real and complex methods up to equivalence of norms and also some other well known methods of interpolation. A by-product of these results get the stability of isomorphisms on Calderón products of Banach function lattices . We also study the important characteristics in operator Banach space theory, the so-called modules of injection and surjection , and we prove interpolation estimates of these modules of operators on scales of the Calderón complex interpolation spaces .},

We consider two types of consecutive projections of an element x 0 ∈ H x0∈H : alternating projections T n x 0 Tnx0 , where T = P K ∘ ⋯ ∘ P 1 T=PK∘⋯∘P1 , and remotest projections x n xn defined recursively, x n + 1 xn+1 being the remotest point for x n xn among P 1 x n , … , P K x n P1xn,…,PKxn . These x n xn can be interpreted as residuals in greedy approximation with respect to a special dictionary associated with L 1 , L 2 , … , L K L1,L2,…,LK . We establish parallels between convergence properties separately known for alternating projections , remotest projections, and greedy approximation in H H . Here are some results. If L 1 ⊥ + ⋯ + L K ⊥ = H L1⊥+⋯+LK⊥=H , then x n → 0 xn→0 exponentially fast. In case L 1 ⊥ + ⋯ + L K ⊥ ≠ H L1⊥+⋯+LK⊥≠H , the convergence x n → 0 xn→0 can be arbitrarily slow for certain x 0 x0 . Such a dichotomy, exponential rate of convergence everywhere on H H , or arbitrarily slow convergence for certain starting elements, is valid for greedy approximation with respect to general dictionaries. The dichotomy was known for alternating projections. Using the methods developed for greedy approximation we prove that | T n x 0 | ≤ C ( x 0 ) n − α ( K ) |Tnx0|≤C(x0)n−α(K) for certain positive α ( K ) α(K) and all starting points x 0 ∈ L 1 ⊥ + ⋯ + L K ⊥ x0∈L1⊥+⋯+LK⊥ .},

  abstract     = {We introduce and analyse a new family of multiple orthogonal polynomials of hypergeometric type with respect to two measures supported on the positive real line which can be described in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions of the second kind. These two measures form a Nikishin system. Our focus is on the multiple orthogonal polynomials for indices on the step line. The sequences of the derivatives of both type I and type II polynomials with respect to these indices are again multiple orthogonal and they correspond to the original sequences with shifted parameters. For the type I polynomials, we provide a Rodrigues-type formula. We characterise the type II polynomials on the step line, also known as d d -orthogonal polynomials (where d d is the number of measures involved so that here d = 2 d=2 ), via their explicit expression as a terminating generalised hypergeometric series , as solutions to a third-order differential equation and via their recurrence relation . The latter involves recurrence coefficients which are unbounded and asymptotically periodic. Based on this information we deduce the asymptotic behaviour of the largest zeros of the type II polynomials. We also discuss limiting relations between these polynomials and the multiple orthogonal polynomials with respect to the modified Bessel weights. Particular choices on the parameters for the 2-orthogonal polynomials under discussion correspond to the cubic components of the already known threefold symmetric Hahn-classical multiple orthogonal polynomials on star-like sets.},

We also study pull-back measures under polynomial pre-images introduced in (Geronimo and Van Assche,1988), (Peherstorfer and Steinbauer, 2001) and obtain invariance of the Widom factors for such measures.

  abstract     = {Learning non-linear systems from noisy, limited, and/or dependent data is an important task across various scientific fields including statistics , engineering, computer science, mathematics, and many more. In general, this learning task is ill-posed; however, additional information about the data’s structure or on the behavior of the unknown function can make the task well-posed. In this work, we study the problem of learning nonlinear functions from corrupted and weakly dependent data. The learning problem is recast as a sparse robust linear regression problem where we incorporate both the unknown coefficients and the corruptions in a basis pursuit framework. The main contribution of our paper is to provide a reconstruction guarantee for the associated ℓ 1 ℓ1 -optimization problem where the sampling matrix is formed from weakly dependent data. Specifically, we prove that the sampling matrix satisfies the null space property and the stable null space property, provided that the data is compact and satisfies a suitable concentration inequality. We show that our recovery results are applicable to various types of weakly dependent data such as exponentially strongly α α -mixing data, geometrically C C -mixing data, and uniformly ergodic Markov chain . Our theoretical results are verified via several numerical simulations.},

Second, we discuss sparse approximation by greedy type algorithms. We show that for any individual function from a given class we can improve the upper bound on the rate of convergence of the error of approximation by a greedy algorithm if we use some information from the previous iterations of the algorithm.

  abstract     = {We consider UL and LU stochastic factorizations of the transition probability matrix of a random walk on the integers, which is a doubly infinite tridiagonal stochastic Jacobi matrix . We give conditions on the free parameter of both factorizations in terms of certain continued fractions such that this stochastic factorization is always possible. By inverting the order of the factors (also known as a Darboux transformation) we get new families of random walks on the integers. We identify the spectral matrices associated with these Darboux transformations (in both cases) which are basically conjugations by a matrix polynomial of degree one of a Geronimus transformation of the original spectral matrix. Finally, we apply our results to the random walk with constant transition probabilities with or without an attractive or repulsive force.},

In this manuscript we use the theory of logarithmic potentials in external fields to determine the precise limiting constant and thus the exact asymptotic volume of B p n ( R ) Bpn(R) . The corresponding result for complex Schatten balls is also obtained. As an application we compute the precise asymptotic volume ratio of the Schatten p p -balls, as n → ∞ n→∞ , thereby extending Saint Raymond’s estimate in the case of the nuclear norm ( p = 1 p=1 ) to the full regime 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ with exact limiting behavior.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the problem of approximating the spectral factor of continuous spectral densities with finite Dirichlet energy based on finitely many samples of these spectral densities . Although there exists a closed form expression for the spectral factor, this formula shows a very complicated behavior because of the non-linear dependency of the spectral factor from spectral density and because of a singular integral in this expression. Therefore approximation methods are usually applied to calculate the spectral factor. It is shown that there exists no sampling-based method which depends continuously on the samples and which is able to approximate the spectral factor for all densities in this set. Instead, to any sampling-based approximation method there exists a large set of spectral densities so that the approximation method does not converge to the spectral factor for every spectral density in this set as the number of available sampling points is increased. The paper will also show that the same results hold for sampling-based algorithms for the calculation of the outer function in the theory of Hardy spaces .},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the question of constructing a higher order Faber spline basis for the sampling discretization of functions with higher regularity than Lipschitz. The basis constructed in this paper has similar properties as the piecewise linear classical Faber–Schauder basis (Faber, 1908) except for the compactness of the support. Although the new basis functions are supported on the real line they are very well localized (exponentially decaying) and the main parts are concentrated on a segment. This construction gives a complete answer to Problem 3.13 in Triebel’s monograph (Triebel, 2012) by extending the classical Faber basis to higher orders. Roughly, the crucial idea to obtain a higher order Faber spline basis is to apply Taylor’s remainder formula to the dual Chui–Wang wavelets. As a first step we explicitly determine these dual wavelets which may be of independent interest. Using this new basis we provide sampling characterizations for Besov and Triebel–Lizorkin spaces and overcome the smoothness restriction coming from the classical piecewise linear Faber–Schauder system. This basis is unconditional and coefficient functionals are computed from discrete function values similar as for the Faber–Schauder situation.},

  abstract     = {It is known that for a ϱ -weighted Lq approximation of single variable functions defined on a finite or infinite interval, whose r th derivatives are in a ψ -weighted Lp space, the minimal error of approximations that use n samples of f is proportional to ‖ω1∕α‖L1α‖f(r)ψ‖Lpn−r+(1∕p−1∕q)+, where ω=ϱ∕ψ and α=r−1∕p+1∕q, provided that ‖ω1∕α‖L1&amp;lt;+∞. Moreover, the optimal sample points are determined by quantiles of ω1∕α. In this paper, we show how the error of the best approximation changes when the sample points are determined by a quantizer κ other than ω. Our results can be applied in situations when an alternative quantizer has to be used because ω is not known exactly or is too complicated to handle computationally. The results for q=1 are also applicable to ϱ -weighted integration over finite and infinite intervals.},

  abstract     = {We study bracketing covering numbers for spaces of bounded convex functions in the L p Lp norms. Bracketing numbers are crucial quantities for understanding asymptotic behavior for many statistical nonparametric estimators. Bracketing number upper bounds in the supremum distance are known for bounded classes that also have a fixed Lipschitz constraint. However, in most settings of interest, the classes that arise do not include Lipschitz constraints, and so standard techniques based on known bracketing numbers cannot be used. In this paper, we find upper bounds for bracketing numbers of classes of convex functions without Lipschitz constraints on arbitrary polytopes . Our results are of particular interest in many multidimensional estimation problems based on convexity shape constraints. Additionally, we show other applications of our proof methods; in particular we define a new class of multivariate functions , the so-called m m -monotone functions. Such functions have been considered mathematically and statistically in the univariate case but never in the multivariate case . We show how our proof for convex bracketing upper bounds also applies to the m m -monotone case.},

This family of polynomials has appeared in the literature recently in connection with complex quadrature rules, and their asymptotics have been previously studied when λ λ is smaller than a certain critical value, λ c λc . Our main goal is to compute their asymptotics when λ &gt; λ c λ&amp;gt;λc . We first provide a geometric description, based on the theory of quadratic differentials, of the curves in the complex plane which will eventually support the asymptotic zero distribution of these polynomials. Next, using the powerful Riemann–Hilbert formulation of the orthogonal polynomials due to Fokas, Its, and Kitaev, along with its method of asymptotic solution via Deift–Zhou nonlinear steepest descent , we provide uniform asymptotics of the polynomials throughout the complex plane. Although much of this asymptotic analysis follows along the lines of previous works in the literature, the main obstacle appears in the construction of the so-called global parametrix. This construction is carried out in an explicit way with the help of certain integrals of elliptic type . In stark contrast to the situation one typically encounters in the presence of real orthogonality , an interesting byproduct of this construction is that there is a discrete set of values of λ λ for which one cannot solve the model Riemann–Hilbert problem, and as such the corresponding polynomials fail to exist.},

The interpolation of a function f f by H n Hn is due to properly chosen μ μ and { λ k } k = 1 n {λk}k=1n , which depend on f f , h h and n n . The sums H n Hn are related to the h h -sums and amplitude and frequency sums (also known as generalized exponential sums ), i.e. correspondingly to ≔ ≔ H n ∗ ( z ; h ) ≔ ∑ k = 1 n λ k h ( λ k z ) and H n ( z ; h ) ≔ ∑ k = 1 n μ k h ( λ k z ) , where μ k , λ k ∈ ℂ , Hn∗(z;h)≔∑k=1nλkh(λkz)andHn(z;h)≔∑k=1nμkh(λkz),whereμk,λk∈ℂ, which generalize many classical approximants and whose properties are actively studied. As for the Padé problem, we show that H n Hn and H n ∗ Hn∗ have similar constructions and rates of interpolation, whereas calculating H n Hn requires less arithmetic operations . Although the Padé problem for H n Hn is known to have a doubled interpolation rate with respect to H n ∗ Hn∗ and thus to H n Hn , it can be however unsolvable in quite simple and useful cases and this may entirely eliminate the advantage of H n Hn . We show that, in contrast to H n Hn , the Padé problem for H n Hn always has a unique solution . What is even more important, we also obtain several efficient estimates for μ μ and λ k λk , valuable by themselves, and use them in further evaluating interpolation quality and in numerical applications . The above-mentioned Padé problem and estimates provide a basis for managing the more interesting Prony problem for exponential sums with equal weights H n ( z ; exp ) Hn(z;exp) , i.e. when h ( z ) = exp ( z ) h(z)=exp(z) . We show that it is uniquely solvable and surprisingly μ μ and λ k λk can be efficiently estimated. This is in sharp contrast to the case of well-known exponential sums H n ( z ; exp ) Hn(z;exp) .},

For instance, the main result implies the existence of a residual subset of H ( D ) H(D) every element f f of which satisfies the property that, given any compact subset K K of T T , different from T T , any continuous function φ φ on K K , and any compact set L L of D D , there exists an increasing sequence ( r n ) n ⊂ [ 0 , 1 ) (rn)n⊂[0,1) converging to 1, such that f r n ( ζ − z ) + z frn(ζ−z)+z converges to φ ( ζ ) φ(ζ) , uniformly for ( ζ , z ) ∈ K × L (ζ,z)∈K×L , as n n goes to ∞ ∞ . Among other things, radial growth of such functions and connections with universal Taylor series are investigated. Functions in the disc algebra whose derivatives disjointly satisfy a somewhat similar universal property, are also exhibited. In some sense, the results are sharp.},

Remarkably, the GGF-Fs become indispensable for optimal error estimates of polynomial approximation to singular functions , and have intimate relations with several families of nonstandard basis functions recently introduced for solving fractional differential equations . However, some properties of GGF-Fs, which are important pieces for the analysis and applications, are unknown or under explored. The purposes of this paper are twofold. The first is to show that for λ &gt; − 1 ∕ 2 λ&amp;gt;−1∕2 and x = cos θ x=cosθ with θ ∈ ( 0 , π ) , θ∈(0,π), ( sin θ ) λ r G ν ( λ ) ( cos θ ) = 2 λ Γ ( λ + 1 ∕ 2 ) π ( ν + λ ) λ cos ( ( ν + λ ) θ − λ π ∕ 2 ) + R ν ( λ ) ( θ ) , (sinθ)λrGν(λ)(cosθ)=2λΓ(λ+1∕2)π(ν+λ)λcos((ν+λ)θ−λπ∕2)+Rν(λ)(θ), and derive the precise expression of the “residual” term R ν ( λ ) ( θ ) Rν(λ)(θ) for all real ν ≥ ν 0 ν≥ν0 (with some ν 0 &gt; 0 ν0&amp;gt;0 ). With this at our disposal, we obtain the bounds of GGF-Fs uniform in ν . ν. Under an appropriate weight function, the bounds are uniform for θ ∈ [ 0 , π ] θ∈[0,π] as well. Moreover, we can study the asymptotics of GGF-Fs with large fractional degree ν . ν. The second is to present miscellaneous properties of GGF-Fs for better understanding of this family of useful special functions.},

There are two explicit families of polynomials that turn out to be extremal in terms of this problem. The first family has a particularly simple expression as a linear combination of d d th powers of two linear functions. Moreover, if the value of the discriminant is not too small, then the roots of the extremal polynomial and the smallest absolute value in question can be found explicitly. The second family is related to generalized Jacobi (or Gegenbauer) polynomials, which helps us to find the associated discriminants. We also investigate the dual problem of maximizing the value of discriminant, while keeping the absolute value of polynomials at a point away from the real line fixed. Our results are then applied to problems on the largest disks contained in lemniscates, and to the minimum energy problems for discrete charges on the real line.},

  abstract     = {We introduce and study spaces of multivariate functions of bounded variation generalizing the classical Jordan and Wiener spaces. Multivariate generalizations of the Jordan space were given by several prominent researchers. However, each of the proposed concepts preserves only few properties of Jordan variation which are designed to a selected application. In contrast, the multivariate generalization of the Jordan space presented in this paper preserves all known and reveals some previously unknown properties of the space. These, in turn, are special cases of the basic properties of the introduced spaces proved in the paper. Specifically, the first part of the paper describes structure properties of functions of bounded ( k , p ) (k,p) -variation ( V p k Vpk functions). It includes assertions on discontinuity sets and pointwise differentiability of V p k Vpk functions and their Luzin type and C ∞ C∞ approximations. The second part presents results on Banach structure of V p k Vpk spaces, namely, atomic decomposition and constructive characterization of their predual spaces. As a result, we obtain the so-called two-stars theorems describing V p k Vpk spaces as second duals of their separable subspaces consisting of functions of “vanishing variation”.},

We consider a greedy algorithm for finding n n -dimensional subspace V n ⊂ X Vn⊂X which can be used to approximate the elements of K K . We are interested in how well the space V n Vn approximates the elements of K K . For this purpose we compare the performance of greedy algorithm measured by σ n ( K ) X ≔ dist ( K , V n ) X σn(K)X≔dist(K,Vn)X with the Kolmogorov width d n ( K ) X dn(K)X which is the best possible error one can achieve when approximating K K by n n -dimensional subspaces. Various results in this direction have been given, e.g., in Binev et al. (2011), DeVore et al. (2013) and Wojtaszczyk (2015). The purpose of the present paper is to continue this line. We shall show that there exists a constant C &gt; 0 C&amp;gt;0 such that σ n ( K ) X ≤ C n − s + μ ( log ( n + 1 ) ) min ( s , 1 ∕ 2 ) , n ≥ 1 , σn(K)X≤Cn−s+μ(log(n+1))min(s,1∕2),n≥1, if Kolmogorov widths d n ( K ) X dn(K)X decay as n − s n−s and the Banach–Mazur distance between an arbitrary n n -dimensional subspace V n ⊂ X Vn⊂X and ℓ 2 n ℓ2n satisfies d ( V n , ℓ 2 n ) ≤ C 1 n μ d(Vn,ℓ2n)≤C1nμ .

  abstract     = {Smolyak’s method, also known as sparse grid method, is a powerful tool to tackle multivariate tensor product problems solely with the help of efficient algorithms for the corresponding univariate problem. In this paper we study the randomized setting, i.e., we randomize Smolyak’s method. We provide upper and lower error bounds for randomized Smolyak algorithms with explicitly given dependence on the number of variables and the number of information evaluations used. The error criteria we consider are the worst case root mean square error (the typical error criterion for randomized algorithms, sometimes referred to as “randomized error”, ) and the root mean square worst case error (sometimes referred to as “worst-case error”). Randomized Smolyak algorithms can be used as building blocks for efficient methods such as multilevel algorithms, multivariate decomposition methods or dimension-wise quadrature methods to tackle successfully high-dimensional or even infinite-dimensional problems. As an example, we provide a very general and sharp result on the convergence rate of N N th minimal errors of infinite-dimensional integration on weighted reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces . Moreover, we are able to characterize the spaces for which randomized algorithms for infinite-dimensional integration are superior to deterministic ones. We illustrate our findings for the special instance of weighted Korobov spaces. We indicate how these results can be extended, e.g., to spaces of functions whose smooth dependence on successive variables increases (“spaces of increasing smoothness”) and to the problem of L 2 L2 -approximation (function recovery).},

  abstract     = {The regularity of refinable functions has been investigated deeply in the past 25 years using Fourier analysis , wavelet analysis , restricted and joint spectral radii techniques. However the shift-invariance of the underlying regular setting is crucial for these approaches. We propose an efficient method based on wavelet tight frame decomposition techniques for estimating Hölder-Zygmund regularity of univariate semi-regular refinable functions generated, e.g., by subdivision schemes defined on semi-regular meshes t = − h ℓ N ∪ { 0 } ∪ h r N t=−hℓN∪{0}∪hrN , h ℓ , h r ∈ ( 0 , ∞ ) hℓ,hr∈(0,∞) . To ensure the optimality of this method, we provide a new characterization of Hölder-Zygmund spaces based on suitable irregular wavelet tight frames. Furthermore, we present proper tools for computing the corresponding frame coefficients in the semi-regular setting. We also propose a new numerical approach for estimating the optimal Hölder-Zygmund exponent of refinable functions which is more efficient than the linear regression method. We illustrate our results with several examples of known and new semi-regular subdivision schemes with a potential use in blending curve design.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a way to construct classical type Sobolev orthogonal polynomials . We consider two families of hypergeometric polynomials: 2 F 2 ( − n , 1 ; α + 1 , κ + 1 ; x ) 2F2(−n,1;α+1,κ+1;x) and 3 F 2 ( − n , n + α + β + 1 , 1 ; α + 1 , κ + 1 ; x ) 3F2(−n,n+α+β+1,1;α+1,κ+1;x) ( α , β , κ &gt; − 1 α,β,κ&amp;gt;−1 , n = 0 , 1 , … n=0,1,… ), which generalize Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials, respectively. These polynomials satisfy higher-order differential equations of the following form: L y + λ n D y = 0 Ly+λnDy=0 , where L , D L,D are linear differential operators with polynomial coefficients not depending on n n . For nonnegative integer values of the parameter κ κ these polynomials are Sobolev orthogonal polynomials with some explicitly given measures. Some basic properties of these polynomials, including recurrence relations , are obtained. Some generalizations of these polynomials are discussed as well.},

We study the limiting behavior of the sampling series ∑ n c n Φ α ( x − n ) ∑ncnΦα(x−n) when the data sequence { c n } {cn} remains fixed. In the case when the sampling kernels are damped cardinal sines, appropriate conditions on the damping functions allow us to characterize the limiting behavior of the corresponding sampling series for a wide class of data sequences { c n } {cn} . These results lead to conclusions regarding the limiting behavior of classical piecewise polynomial cardinal splines when the fixed data sequence { c n } {cn} is of polynomial growth and the order tends to ∞ ∞ . One application of this development shows that the classical spline summability method is regular. Another consequence, perhaps more interesting and unexpected, is a resolution of I. J. Schoenberg’s conjecture concerning the recovery, in terms of their samples { f ( n ) } {f(n)} , of members f ( x ) f(x) of the Bernstein class via the spline summability procedure.},
