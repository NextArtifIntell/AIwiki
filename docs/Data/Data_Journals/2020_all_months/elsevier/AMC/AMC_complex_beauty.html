  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an iterative splitting method to solve the partial differential equation (PDE) in option pricing problems. We focus on the Heston stochastic volatility model and the derived two-dimensional PDE. We take the European option as an example and conduct numerical experiments using different boundary conditions. The iterative splitting method transforms the two-dimensional equation into two quasi one-dimensional equations with the variable on the other dimension fixed, which helps to lower the computational cost. Numerical results show that the iterative splitting method together with an artificial boundary condition (ABC) based on the method by Li and Huang (2019) gives the most accurate option price and Greeks compared to the classic finite difference method with the commonly-used boundary conditions in Heston (1993).},

When the forcing function ( f ≠ 0) is in L ∞ ( L 2 ), new a priori bounds are derived, which are valid uniformly in time as t ↦∞ and with respect to the dispersion coefficient μ as μ ↦0. It is further shown that the solution of the Sobolev equation converges to the solution of the 2D-Burgers’ equation with order O ( μ ). A finite element method is applied to approximate the solution in the spatial direction and the existence of a global attractor is derived for the semidiscrete scheme. Further, using a priori bounds and an integral operator, optimal error estimates are derived in L ∞ ( L 2 )-norm, which hold uniformly with respect to μ as μ → 0. Since the constants in the error estimates have exponential growth in time, therefore, under a certain uniqueness condition, the error bounds are derived which are uniformly in time. More importantly, all the above results remain valid as μ tends to zero. Finally, this paper concludes with some numerical examples .},

The two distinct formulations we consider, correspond to either using a fixed basis for the elastic stress or one that uses the flow directions or streamlines . The former is the traditional Cartesian stress formulation, whilst the later may be referred to as the natural stress formulation of the equations. We choose the Oldroyd-B fluid and three benchmarks in computational rheology: the 4:1 contraction flow, the stick-slip and cross-slot problems. In the context of the contraction flow, fixing the kinematics as Newtonian, actually gives a larger stress singularity at the re-entrant corner, the matched asymptotics of which are presented here. Numerical results for temporal and spatial convergence of the two formulations are compared first in this decoupled velocity and elastic stress situation, to assess the performance of the two approaches. This may be regarded as an intermediate test case before proceeding to the far more difficult fully coupled velocity and stress situation. We also present comparison results between numerics and asymptotics for the stick-slip problem. Finally, the natural stress formulation is used to investigate the cross-slot problem, again in a Newtonian velocity field.},

First, we developed an ε -accurate inner polyhedral approximation method for the nonlinear relation between the travel time and travel speed. The approximation error was controlled within the limit of a given parameter ε , which could be as low as 0.01% in our experiments. Second, we developed two ε -accurate methods for the nonlinear fuel consumption rate (FCR) function of a fossil fuel-powered vehicle while ensuring the approximation error to be within the same parameter ε . Based on these linearization methods , we proposed an ε -accurate mathematical linear programming model for the continuous PRP (ε-CPRP for short), in which decision variables such as driving speeds, travel times, arrival/departure/waiting times, vehicle loads, and FCRs were all optimized concurrently on their continuous domains. A theoretical analysis is provided to confirm that the solutions of ε-CPRP are feasible and controlled within the predefined limit. The proposed ε-CPRP model is rigorously tested on well-known benchmark PRP instances in the literature, and has solved PRP instances optimally with up to 25 customers within reasonable CPU times. New optimal solutions of many PRP instances were reported for the first time in the experiments.},

In the solution of multiphase flow problems approximated by an operator splitting method one has to solve an elliptic equation every time step of a simulation, that would require that all multiscale basis functions be recomputed. In this work, we focus on the development of a novel method that replaces a full update of local solutions by reusing multiscale basis functions that are computed at an earlier time of a simulation. The procedure is based on classical perturbation theory . It can take advantage of both an offline stage (where multiscale basis functions are computed at the initial time of a simulation) as well as of a good initial guess for velocity and pressure. The formulation of the method is carefully explained and several numerical studies are presented and discussed. They provide an indication that the proposed procedure can be of value in speeding-up the solution of multiphase flow problems by multiscale methods.},

We use a Karhunen–Loève expansion for the permeability field in conjunction with GPU computing within a two–stage Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Further reduction in computing costs is addressed by running several MCMC chains. We compare convergence criteria to quantify the uncertainty of predictions. Our contributions are two-fold: we first propose a fitting procedure for the Multivariate Potential Scale Reduction Factor (MPSRF) data that allows us to estimate the number of iterations for convergence. Then we present a careful analysis of ensembles of fractional flow curves suggesting that, for the problem at hand, the number of iterations required for convergence through the MPSRF analysis is excessive. Thus, for practical applications, our results provide an indication that an analysis of the posterior distributions of quantities of interest provides a reliable criterion to terminate MCMC simulations for quantifying uncertainty.},

The three structures taken together, represent the main dominant balances that occur for the UCM equations near solid boundaries. For each structure, the leading order equations are derived in each region together with particular exact solutions when available. Importantly, the matching conditions between respective regions for each structure are also derived and explained. These stress boundary layers can arise in order one Reynolds number flows and are independent of the velocity boundary layers that can arise in high Reynolds number flows.},

  abstract     = {Optimization applied to radiotherapy planning is a complex scientific issue seeking to deliver both possible highest dose into tumor tissue and lowest one into adjacent tissues. It is composed of one or more of the following main problems: beam choice, dose intensity and blades opening. In this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear optimization model is developed for radiation treatment planned by intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment involving both dose intensity and beam choice optimization problems. Moreover, metaheuristics proposed to solve the beam optimization problem are coupled with exact methods, which in turn solve the dose intensity problem. The proposed model is applied to two real computerized tomography images of prostate cases, where it has been shown to be highly efficient.},

Therefore, by collocating the associated system of integro-PDEs in both of the space and time variables together with approximating the existing integral in the equation using the Jacobi-Gauss-Type quadrature formula, then the problem is reduced to a set of nonlinear algebraic equations. We can consider solving the system by some robust iterative solvers.

Firstly, the phase field method is presented to capture the growth interface of polymer crystals, including the common morphologies of spherulite and shish-kebab crystallites . Then the lattice Boltzmann method is introduced to solve the viscous non-Newtonian flows of the polymer melt , where the half-way bounce back boundary condition is imposed with the aid of shape level-set (LS) function which is used to represent the crystal interface at each time. At last, the crystal growth for spherulites and shish-kebab crystallites under flow field is simulated by using the coupled PF–LB method, where the cross-WLF model is chosen to describe the melt viscosity . The effects of the flow velocity on the crystal morphologies , including single and multiple spherulite and shish-kebab crystallites , are analyzed in detail. The numerical results show that the flow velocity has an important impact on the crystal morphologies , and the crystals grow more faster towards the upstream direction, especially in the single and multi spherulites growth process.},

In equilibrium, the firm would choose one strategy from the following four: simultaneous markdown and downgrade, markdown only, simultaneous markup and upgrade, and simultaneous markdown and upgrade. Such a policy structure holds irrespective of whether the firm is patient. However, the policy set shrinks when the marginal cost changes from quadratic to linear in quality and expands when customer types are uncertain in the sense that the firm is not certain about the upper bound of the support of the customer type. In the latter, the equilibrium policy is same when the uncertainty is the highest as when uncertainty is absent.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to propose a flexible flow shop scheduling problem (FFSP) with machine-dependent processing stages. The parallel machines in the first stage are considered unrelated with different technology levels and some of them are multifunctional that can do several processes on jobs. Therefore, the jobs that are assigned to these machines don&#39;t require to be processed in some next stages. We conduct the problem considering production costs and energy consumption as two conflict objective functions. Furthermore, setup times are assumed as sequence-dependent and are need when a machine starts to process a new job. This problem is described with a numeric example, and its parameters and decision variables are defined. Then a linear mathematical model based on MIP is developed to solve the problem in small-sized scales. Since the problem is discussed in an NP-hard environment, a new approach based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is introduced to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. Some numerical examples in different conditions are tuned as test problems and different metrics that are popular in multi-objective optimization environment such as ER, GD, and ONVG are used to demonstrate performance of the proposed algorithm. The computational result indicates appropriate performance of the algorithm in solving this bi-objective problem. Moreover, the comparison result shows superiority of this algorithm over SPEA 2 as another multi-optimization method in solving the problem. Finally, supplementary analysis is presented by adjusting different amount of the makespan as the pre-known index for controlling completion time. The result indicates that the solution approach can provide proper alternatives for managers in different various situations.},

By constructing the proper parameter updated laws with a positive continuous integrable function of augmented dimension vectors, unknown upper bound and compound disturbance, an improved adaptive backstepping control scheme is developed to substantially deal with the effect of unknown parameter vectors and dead-zone nonlinearities. Accordingly, an associated event-triggered mechanism including the decreasing function of tracking errors is designed to obtain the desired tracking performance and thus the computation burden of the transmissions procedure can be significantly alleviated. It is further shown that all the closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and that the asymptotic tracking can be achieved based on Lyapunov function method. Finally, the validity of the presented approach is demonstrated by two simulation examples.},

In this case, the asymptotic consensus of agents is achieved and the Zeno behavior is also excluded. The updates of controllers and the exchange of information between agents at the current moment depend on the proposed double ETMs, where there are two types of ETMs use different trigger functions and work independently. As a consequence, both the communication burdens are greatly lighten and the control signal updates are reduced. Then, by using the novel methods, the resultant triggering function is less conservative than existing methods. In addition, a new dynamic ETM method is presented which covers the traditional dynamic ETM and the static ETM by tuning some parameters. It is proven that the augmented dynamic ETM can further extend the event-triggered interval. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the problem of parameter uncertainty, specifying the location of the tangency portfolio (TP) on the set of feasible portfolios becomes a challenging task. The set of feasible portfolios is a parabola in the mean-variance space with optimal portfolios lying on its upper part. Using statistical test theory, we want to decide if the tangency portfolio is mean-variance efficient, i.e. if it belongs to the upper limb of the efficient frontier. In the opposite case, the investor would prefer to invest into the risk-free asset or into the global minimum variance portfolio which lies in the vertex of the set of feasible portfolios. Assuming that the portfolio asset returns are independent and multivariate normally distributed, we suggest a test on the location of the tangency portfolio on the set of feasible portfolios. The distribution of the test statistic is derived under both hypotheses, which we use to assess the power of the test and construct a confidence interval. Moreover, out-of-sample performance of the test is evaluated based on real data. The robustness to the assumption of normality is investigated via an extensive simulation study where we show that the new test is robust to the violation of the normality assumption and can also be used for heavy-tailed stochastic models . Moreover, in an empirical study we apply the developed theory to real data. We find that when the sample size is relatively large and a stable period is present on the market, then the mean-variance efficiency of the tangency portfolio can be statistically justified.},

The study is accomplished with respect to an ecological parameter that quantifies the reproductive gain of predator and two epidemiological parameters which measure the force of infection and virulence of the disease. We show analytically that the interior equilibrium loses its stability through Hopf bifurcation in the absence of diffusion if the reproductive gain of predator crosses some threshold value. In case of diffusive system, it is shown that the interior equilibrium, which is otherwise stable, may lose its stability due to diffusion. Criteria for the occurrence of various types of instability, like Turing, Hopf-Turing and pure Hopf, associated with the PPP model are presented with illustrations. Our simulation results reveal that this diffusion-driven instability creates various spatio-temporal patterns, like spot, stripe, mixture of spots &amp; stripes and spiral patterns, depending upon the values of ecological and diffusion parameters. Turing instability and the corresponding patterns are also observed with the variation of two epidemiological parameters. Interestingly, the epidemiological parameters that measure the infection rate and virulence of the disease show opposite patterns with their increasing values.},

The infectious diseases can spread in two cities at the same time, and be taken from one city to the other through intercity commuters. Firstly, we take use of the spectral analysis method to obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 of the model. Then, the equilibria including the endemic equilibrium and disease-free one of the proposed model are analyzed and calculated, and the results indicate that they are globally asymptotic stable. Moreover, the degree distribution of the population changes over time, forming a complex dynamical networks before the system reaches a steady state . Finally, through a large number of numerical simulations, we show that demographics, intercity commuting rates and exposed individuals during commuting have great effects on the epidemic spreading behavior between two cities. The analysis of the proposed model can further help to understand the transmission behavior of epidemics in reality, and it is also of great practical significance to predict the epidemic trends among cities and design effective measures to curb the infectious diseases.},

Given a plane topological graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) and a set C G of parity constraints, in which every vertex has assigned a parity constraint on its degree, either even or odd, we say that G is topologically augmentable to meet C G if there exists a set E ′ of new edges, disjoint with E , such that G ′ = ( V , E ∪ E ′ ) G′=(V,E∪E′) is noncrossing and meets all parity constraints. In this paper, we prove that the problem of deciding if a plane topological graph is topologically augmentable to meet parity constraints is NP NP -complete, even if the set of vertices that must change their parities is V or the set of vertices with odd degree. In particular, deciding if a plane topological graph can be augmented to a Eulerian plane topological graph is NP NP -complete. Analogous complexity results are obtained, when the augmentation must be done by a plane topological perfect matching between the vertices not meeting their parities. We extend these hardness results to planar graphs, when the augmented graph must be planar, and to plane geometric graphs (plane topological graphs whose edges are straight-line segments). In addition, when it is required that the augmentation is made by a plane geometric perfect matching between the vertices not meeting their parities, we also prove that this augmentation problem is NP NP -complete for plane geometric paths. For the particular family of maximal outerplane graphs, we characterize maximal outerplane graphs that are topological augmentable to satisfy a set of parity constraints. We also provide a polynomial time algorithm that decides if a maximal outerplane graph is topologically augmentable to meet parity constraints, and if so, produces a set of edges with minimum cardinality .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller is proposed for a general class of uncertain nonlinear systems in the presence of mismatched terms. The proposed SOSM controller is based on a hybrid scheme which switches between two different controllers. The former fixed-time attractive controller can drive the sliding variables into a closed compact set of the origin in a time that do not depend on system initial values . The latter finite-time controller can drive the sliding variables to zero. Strict Lyapunov analysis show that the controlled system under the proposed hybrid controller can guarantee the globally fixed-time stability of the closed-loop system. A simulation example under different initial values is given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

Discrete Math. 27:827–854, 2013) we present efficient numerical algorithms for the Coxeter spectral study of finite posets I = ( { 1 , … , n } , ⪯ I ) I=({1,…,n},⪯I) that are positive in the sense that the symmetric Gram matrix G I : = 1 2 ( C I + C I t r ) ∈ M n ( Q ) GI:=12(CI+CItr)∈Mn(Q) is positive definite, where C I ∈ M n ( Z ) CI∈Mn(Z) is the incidence matrix of I encoding the relation ⪯ I . In the framework of scientific computing we present a complete Coxeter spectral classification of finite positive posets I of size n = | I | &lt; 20 n=|I|&amp;lt;20 . It extends one of the main results obtained in Ga̧siorek et al. (Eur. J. Comb. 48:127–142, 2015) for posets of size n ≤ 10. We also show that the connectivity of such posets I is determined by the complex Coxeter spectrum specc I ⊆ C speccI⊆C ; equivalently, by the Coxeter polynomial cox I ( t ) ∈ Z [ t ] coxI(t)∈Z[t] od I . One of the main results of the paper is a new technique to compute in a polynomial time a Z Z -invertible matrix B I ∈ M n ( Z ) BI∈Mn(Z) such that B I t r · C I · B I = G ˇ D I , BItr·CI·BI=GˇDI, where G ˇ D I ∈ M n ( Z ) GˇDI∈Mn(Z) is a non-symmetric Gram matrix of a simply-laced Dynkin diagram D I ∈ { A n , D n , E 6 , E 7 , E 8 } DI∈{An,Dn,E6,E7,E8} associated with a finite positive poset I .},

The full state constraints, output dead zone and input saturation are fully considered in the controlled system. Invariant sets are used for a continuous and semi-bounded condition of non-affine functions. The “complexity explosion” issue caused by backstepping procedure is avoided via the dynamic surface control method. A Nussbaum function is used to handle the unknown control coefficient derived from the output dead zone, and barrier Lyapunov functions are employed to handle full state constraints. To counteract the effects of disturbance and uncertainty, the robust compensator is constructed. In addition, it is proved that all signals in the system are bounded and all states satisfy their constraints. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To describe this phenomenon, a widely used method is to assign a distinct adoption threshold for each individual, which so far has eluded theoretical analysis. In this paper, we propose a behavior spreading model to describe the heterogeneity of individuals in adopting the behavior, in which the adoption threshold follows the Gaussian distribution . Based on the edge-based compartmental theory, the theoretical solutions of the behavior spreading size and the threshold are given for discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. Through theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, the impact of the heterogeneity of adoption thresholds on behavior spreading is demonstrated, and we find that the phase transition depends on the mean and standard deviation of the adoption thresholds. For small values of the mean adoption threshold, the system exhibits a continuous phase transition. For large values of the mean adoption threshold, the phase transition is discontinuous (continuous) for the small (large) standard deviation of the adoption thresholds. There is a remarkable agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations.},

The space domain of a computation is the pristine marble object. In order to accurately discretize it while maintaining the simplicity of finite difference discretizations , the domain is described using a level-set technique. A uniform Cartesian grid is laid over a box containing the domain, but the solution is defined and updated only in the grid nodes that lie inside the domain, the level-set being employed to select them and to impose accurately the boundary conditions. We use a Crank-Nicolson scheme in time, while for the space variables the discretization is performed by a standard Finite-Difference scheme for grid points inside the domain and by a ghost-cell technique on the ghost points (by using boundary conditions). The solution of the large nonlinear system is obtained by a Newton-Raphson procedure and a tailored multigrid technique is developed for the inner linear solvers. The numerical results, which are very satisfactory in terms of reconstruction quality and of computational efficiency, are presented and discussed at the end of the paper.},

  abstract     = {With the dramatic development of data collection and storage techniques, we often encounter massive high-dimensional data sets which contain outliers and heavy-tailed errors. Recently, the regularized Huber regression has been extensively developed to deal with such complex data sets. Although there are dozens of papers devoted to developing efficient solvers for the regularized Huber regression, it remains challenging when the number of features is extremely large. In this paper, we propose safe feature screening rules for the regularized Huber regression based on duality theory. These rules can remarkably accelerate the existing solvers for the regularized Huber regression by quickly reducing the number of features. To be specific, the proposed safe feature screening rules enable to identify and eliminate inactive features before starting the solver, then the computational effort can be saved significantly. Moreover, the proposed screening rules are safe in theory and practice. Finally, the experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets illustrate that the proposed screening rules can accelerate the speed of solving the regularized Huber regression and maintain its accuracy. In particular, when the number of features is large, the speedup obtained by our rules can be orders of magnitude.},

Traditional DEA models assume that the inputs and outputs are given as non-ratio characteristics. In cases where only a ratio of inputs to outputs (or vice versa) is available for our DMUs, the decision maker is forced to make use of ratio data envelopment analysis (DEA-R) models for efficiency and performance evaluation. This paper deals with identification of efficient surfaces in DEA-R models. The axioms for specifying the production possibility set in constant returns to scale technology for DEA-R are discussed, and, finally an original algorithm for identification of efficient surfaces in this class of models is proposed. In the following, we will find the efficient hyper planes for the 10 bank branches under study. To expand the present study, a comparison was made between the BCC models in DEA and DEA-R, and DEA-R-efficient surfaces were calculated under CRS and VRS assumptions in a simple numerical example.},

  abstract     = {A platypus graph is a non-hamiltonian graph for which every vertex-deleted subgraph is traceable. They are closely related to families of graphs satisfying interesting conditions regarding longest paths and longest cycles, for instance hypohamiltonian, leaf-stable, and maximally non-hamiltonian graphs. In this paper, we first investigate cubic platypus graphs, covering all orders for which such graphs exist: in the general and polyhedral case as well as for snarks. We then present (not necessarily cubic) platypus graphs of girth up to 16—whereas no hypohamiltonian graphs of girth greater than 7 are known—and study their maximum degree , generalising two theorems of Chartrand, Gould, and Kapoor. Using computational methods, we determine the complete list of all non-isomorphic platypus graphs for various orders and girths. Finally, we address two questions raised by the third author in [ J. Graph Theory 86 (2017) 223–243].},

The considered composite structure comprises of water layer of finite width lying between isotropic and ice substrate has been considered. The mathematical analysis pertaining to this problem has been addressed analytically. The closed form expressions for reflection and refraction coefficients of different reflected and refracted waves are derived. Mathematical expressions for the energy share associated with the various waves are also enlisted in a very concise form in connection with the reflection and refraction coefficients. The effects of various polar and azimuthal angles have been exhibited on the reflection and refraction coefficients. The energy conservation law is established to validate this model. Numerical examples and computations have been performed to illustrate the results of this model graphically. Further, as a particular case of the present problem, the deduced results are compared and validated with the pre-established classical results.},

Since the coastal data exhibit large spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, the global sea-level rate is estimated as an appropriate average of the rates observed at available locations and computed with sliding windows. We claim that under such heterogeneity the median serves as a better representative of an adequate average than the mean. With this approach, the sea-level rate in 60 to 70 yr windows over the past century is found to be smaller than 1.7-1.9 mm/yr. These upper estimates are in line with those obtained with a scarce list of available long quasi-gapless series.},

Comput., vol. 314, pp. 31-43 ]. However, recently, Liao et al. illustrates that the HKWWC-protocol is completely insecure under their suggested attack (LLON-attack) since CSP can return a forged proof that is able to pass the verification of the verifier, which shows that the HKWWC-protocol will become completely useless. In this paper, we revisit the original HKWWC-protocol and try to rescue it. After our modification, the twisted new protocol can be immune to the LLON-attack. More importantly, we find that the original He et al.’s security model cannot depict the practical scene at all because they viewed CSP and KGC (key generation center) as one entity in their system. Hence, we redefine a new security model and prove the twisted HKWWC-protocol is secure under our new security model. Performance analysis shows that our proposed protocol is still efficient and practical.},

Scholars have devoted their efforts to this topic; nevertheless, the impact of diverse interactions on cooperation still needs to be further explored. In this manuscript, we propose a mechanism aiming to investigate the co-evolution of personal reputation and strategy under a general framework of interactive diversity (being referred to as edge-strategy for simplicity). Numerous simulations are conducted with sufficient analyses of the obtained results being provided. As illustrated by the evolutionary dynamics, we find that there exists an optimal reputation value which can promote the frequency of cooperation by a large extent. Furthermore, we can clearly conclude that the consideration of interaction diversity is able to ensure the maintenance of cooperation even if the temptation to adopt antisocial behavior is relatively large. Aiming to understand the phenomenon better, we also quantitatively analyze the results by investigating the statistics of interaction chain, cluster size and other microscopic information. Overall, we hope the findings here can provide some interesting insights in solving social dilemmas.},

This paper develops a general methodology for modeling and pricing financial derivatives which depend on systems of stochastic diffusion processes. This is accomplished with a general decorrelation procedure, which reduces the system of correlated diffusions to an uncorrelated system. This enables simple and efficient approximation of the driving processes by univariate CTMC approximations. Weak convergence of the approximation is demonstrated, with second order convergence in space.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the problems of stochastic stability and control design for singular Markovian jump systems (SMJSs) with time varying delay. The derivative coefficient is considered to be mode dependent. A parameter-dependent reciprocally convex matrix inequality (PDRCMI) is constructed, which covers some existing ones as its special cases. Different from some existing ones, the introduced parameters are completely known, which can be optimized by an iteration algorithm . To decrease the redundant decision variables, a mild assumption is given for the case of mode-dependent coefficient such that the considered system is decomposed into differential equations and algebraic ones. In this case, the components of state vectors of the subsystem are applied to construct a new augmented Lyapunov-Krasovkii functional (LKF). Based on the PDRCI and the new augmented LKF, a novel stochastic stability condition with both less computational demands and less conservativeness is derived. Based on the decomposed subsystems and the stability condition, a set of state feedback controller is designed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Some numerical examples are introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.},

  abstract     = {The efficient solution of PDE-constrained optimization problems is of great significance in many scientific and engineering applications. The key point of achieving this goal is to solve the linear systems arising from such problems more efficiently by preconditioning. In this paper, we consider preconditioning the linear systems arising from PDE-constrained optimization problems with total variation (TV) regularization. Based on the block structure of the coefficient matrix or its row and column transformed forms, we propose three kinds of new preconditioners by approximating the Schur complements in different ways. We analyze the eigenvalue properties of the preconditioned coefficient matrices and provide the eigenvalue bounds independent of mesh size. We also show the relations of eigenvalue bounds corresponding to different preconditioners. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners by comparison with other existing methods.},

Common treatments of the topic tend to focus on either the mechanical origins of the stress, or methods of stress measurement at certain locations. Here we take the stress field as given and consider the problem of approximating any such stress field, in a given body, as a linear combination of predetermined fields which can serve as a basis. We consider planar stress states in detail, and introduce an extremization problem that leads to a linear eigenvalue problem . Eigenfunctions of that problem form an orthonormal basis for all possible residual stress states of sufficient smoothness. In numerical examples , convergence of the approximating stress fields is demonstrated in the L 2 norm for continuous stress fields as well as for a stress field with a simple discontinuity. Finally, we outline the extension of our theory to three dimensional bodies and states of stress. Our approach can be used to describe arbitrary preexisting residual stress states in arbitrarily shaped bodies using basis functions that are determined by the body geometry alone.},

In this paper, we study the spatial evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma game with the introduction of the strategy-updating cost for players, where each player is able to update its strategy if its payoffs is greater than a critical threshold. We show that there exist sudden increases of cooperation level as the temptation to defect increases for a fixed strategy-updating cost, which means a larger temptation to defect cannot always inveigle players into defection, but sometimes promote players to cooperate. This striking phenomenon is in contradiction with the previous wide cognition that a larger temptation to defect always gives rise to a lower cooperation level. This abnormal phenomenon can be explained by a systematic analysis of the payoffs earned by cooperators and defectors and the strategy-transition probabilities between cooperation and defection, respectively. In some cases, the strategy-updating cost can prevent some defectors from becoming cooperators and the increase of temptation to defect enable their payoffs to exceed the threshold of strategy-updating cost. Our results prove that the temptation to defect may have facilitation to the emergence of cooperation in the existence of strategy-updating cost, and thus provide a new understanding of the previously hidden roles of the temptation to defect for the social cooperation.},

A suitable dynamic event-triggered rule is offered to further mitigate the transmission burden of communication network. Since the mode information of Markov chain is extremely difficult to get, an asynchronous controller is well constructed. Hence, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is chosen to describe the non-synchronous facts between states of the original Markov chain and the constructed non-synchronous controller. Resorting to the Lyapunov functional concerning the internal dynamic variable, sufficient conditions of stochastically stable with a certain mixed H ∞ and dissipative performance for the resulting closed-loop MJSPSs are offered. Based on the LMI technique, the design framework of asynchronous controller and the dynamic event-triggered rule are given in a unified way. Lastly, a modified DC motor model is offered to demonstrate the superiority of the proffered method.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a study on the drafting, kissing, tumbling (DKT) phenomenon between two circular and impermeable interacting particles of different sizes and densities in a confined medium in 2D using Immersed Boundary (IB) method. There are two different cases considered in this study. The first case, Case 1, deals with the scenario when the trailing particle was larger in size than the leading particle and in the second case, it was the other way round (Case 2). In both cases, apart from the size difference, the particles were assumed to have different densities. The paper investigated the effect of diameter ratio, as well as the effect of density differential on the dynamics of the settling particles. The obtained results clearly indicated that the size and the density of particles play an important role in the dynamics of the two interacting particles. The results suggested when the larger particle in both the cases was chosen to have higher density than the smaller particles, irrespective of diameter ratio and density difference, the particles went through one complete cycle of DKT. On the other hand, when the larger particle, irrespective of its initial position- leading or trailing, was having less density than the smaller particles, the results obtained was specific to diameter ratio as well as density difference.},

Recently, however, more attentions have been paid to nonconvex l q regularization methods (i.e., 0 &lt; q &lt; 1, in particular, q = 1 / 2 q=1/2 ) for recovering a sparse signal. In this paper, we use proximal methods to study both convex and nonconvex reweighted l Q regularization for recovering a sparse signal. Convex l Q regularization is introduced by S. Voronin and I. Daubechies [19]. We extend it to the nonconvex case and our results therefore supplement those of Voronin and Daubechies [19] . We also study Nesterov’s acceleration method for the nonconvex case. Our numerical experiments show that nonconvex l Q regularization can more effectively recover sparse signals.},

Firstly, the T-S fuzzy model is employed to approximate the discrete networked control system and the ℓth-order Rice fading channels model is introduced in the system model. Secondly, the T-S fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller with ℓth-order Rice fading channels output is designed for the T-S fuzzy discrete networked control system. Thirdly, the discrete delay-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, stochastic system theory and Bernoulli probability distribution are employed to derive the stability conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Compared with previous works, the fading channels in the signal transmission are described clearly by setting the different channels coefficients of the ℓth-order Rice fading channels model. The closed-loop system is exponentially mean-square stable and prescribed H-infinity performance is guaranteed by designing the T-S fuzzy dynamic output feedback controller. The factorizations in the polynomial and the congruence transformation matrices are introduced to solve the LMIs, such that the controller gain matrices are determined. Finally, simulation examples are presented to show the effectiveness of proposed methods.},

Pros and cons of such a kind of filtered interpolation are analyzed in comparison with the Lagrange polynomials interpolating at the same Chebyshev grid or at the equal number of Padua nodes.

  abstract     = {Portfolio insurance is a hedging strategy which is used to limit portfolio losses without having to sell off stock when stocks decline in value. Consequently, the minimization of the costs related to portfolio insurance is a very important investment strategy. On the one hand, a popular option to solve the static minimum-cost portfolio insurance problem is based on the use of linear programming (LP) methods. On the other hand, the static portfolio selection under transaction costs (PSTC) problem is usually approached by nonlinear programming (NLP) methods. In this article, we define and study the time-varying minimum-cost portfolio insurance under transaction costs (TV-MCPITC) problem in the form of a time-varying nonlinear programming (TV-NLP) problem. Using the Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm, we also provide an online solution to the static NLP problem. The online solution to a time-varying financial problem is a great technical analysis tool and along with fundamental analysis will enable the investors to make better decisions. To the best of our knowledge, an approach that incorporates modern meta-heuristic optimization techniques to provide a more realistic online solution to the TV-MCPITC problem is original. In this way, by presenting an online solution to a time-varying financial problem we highlight the limitations of static methods. Our approach is also verified by numerical experiments and computer simulations as an excellent alternative to conventional MATLAB methods.},

  abstract     = {In 2016, Bonato, Janssen, and Roshanbin introduced graph burning as a discrete process that models the spread of social contagion. Although the burning process is a simple algorithm, the problem of determining the least number of rounds needed to completely burn a graph, called the burning number of the graph, is NP -complete even for elementary graph structures like spiders. An early conjecture that every connected graph of order m 2 can be burned in at most m rounds is the main motivator of this study. Attempts to prove the conjecture have resulted in various upper bounds for the burning number and validation of the conjecture for certain elementary classes of graphs. In this work, we find a tight upper bound for the order of a spider for it to be burned within a given number of rounds. Our result shows that the tight bound depends on the structure of the spider under consideration, namely the number of arms. This strengthens the previously known results on spiders in relation to the conjecture. More importantly, this opens up potential enquiry into the connection between burning numbers and certain characteristics of graphs. Finally, a tight upper bound for the order of a path forest for it to be burned within a given number of rounds is obtained, thus completing previously known partial corresponding results.},

Firstly, we perform the time series visualization according to the vision graph method. Subsequently, the correlation among these 50 states is calculated regarding the related indicators, and henceforth the relationship network between them is constructed. Finally, the community detection is used to cluster the specific policies carried out at various states. After the detailed analyses, it is indicated that all these 50 states can be divided into four categories as far as the policy of electric reform and power market is concerned. The current results provide some clues to deeply understand the electricity marketing reform in the U.S., and also offer some valuable hints for other countries to optimize the operation or reform of power systems.},

Then, by applying some valid integral inequalities, some new criteria are established. Furthermore, based on the above methods, the desired randomly occurring asynchronous or synchronized state feedback controllers are designed to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop TSFSs.

In this work, we relax this assumption by allowing cooperators to decide which neighboring group to prefer instead of supporting them uniformly. In particular, we assume that they select their most successful neighbor and focus external investments exclusively into the related group. We show that this very simple alteration of the dynamical rule results in a surprisingly positive evolutionary outcome – cooperators prevail even in harsh environment represented by small values of the synergy factor in the game. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported success of the cooperator strategy can be explained by a blocking mechanism which affects the propagations of competing strategies in a biased way. Our results, which remain intact by using different interaction topologies, reveal that it could be beneficial to concentrate individual efforts to reach a higher global wellbeing.},

The occurrence of controller gain perturbations is assumed to be random, which is described by a stochastic variable with the Bernoulli distribution . An extended two-sided looped Lyapunov functional is constructed, which efficiently utilizes available state information of the sampled instants. By using the two-sided looped Lyapunov functional and introducing suitable free weighting matrices, a sufficient condition is derived under which the resulting synchronization-error system is exponentially stable. Then, a design scheme of the non-fragile sampled-data controller is proposed with the aid of some decoupling techniques.

  abstract     = {Recent studies have demonstrated that the allocation of individual resources has a significant influence on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. In the real scenario, individuals have a different level of awareness for self-protection when facing the outbreak of an epidemic. To investigate the effects of the heterogeneous self-awareness distribution on the epidemic dynamics, we propose a resource-epidemic coevolution model in this paper. We first study the effects of the heterogeneous distributions of node degree and self-awareness on the epidemic dynamics on artificial networks. Through extensive simulations, we find that the heterogeneity of self-awareness distribution suppresses the outbreak of an epidemic, and the heterogeneity of degree distribution enhances the epidemic spreading. Next, we study how the correlation between node degree and self-awareness affects the epidemic dynamics. The results reveal that when the correlation is positive, the heterogeneity of self-awareness restrains the epidemic spreading. While, when there is a significant negative correlation, strong heterogeneous or strong homogeneous distribution of the self-awareness is not conducive for disease suppression. We find an optimal heterogeneity of self-awareness, at which the disease can be suppressed to the most extent. Further research shows that the epidemic threshold increases monotonously when the correlation changes from most negative to most positive, and a critical value of the correlation coefficient is found. When the coefficient is below the critical value, an optimal heterogeneity of self-awareness exists; otherwise, the epidemic threshold decreases monotonously with the decline of the self-awareness heterogeneity. At last, we verify the results on four typical real-world networks and find that the results on the real-world networks are consistent with those on the artificial network.},

  abstract     = {Temperature has distinct impact on the activation of neural activities by adjusting the excitability and channel conductance. Some biological neurons can percept slight changes of temperature and then appropriate firing modes are induced under different temperatures. Indeed, the temperature-dependent property can be described by using thermistors, which can be included to build functional neural circuits. Therefore, any changes in the resistance of the thermistor can regulate the branch current and also the output voltage completely. In the paper, thermistors are connected to the FitzHugh-Nagumo neural circuit driven by a voltage source, and a thermosensitive neuron oscillator is obtained by applying scale transformation for the physical variables and parameters in the neural circuit. The thermistor is connected to different branch circuits to enhance the sensitivity to changes of temperature. It is confirmed that the neural activities can present distinct mode transition from spiking to bursting and chaotic states. In particular, the external stimulus becomes dependent on temperature when the thermistor is connected to the external voltage source. Stochastic resonance and multiple modes are detected when additive Gaussian white noise is applied on an isolated neuron controlled by temperature. Therefore, a sensitive sensor of temperature is obtained, and this feasible neuron model can be effective to investigate the collective behaviors of neural networks in the presence of time-varying temperature. Also, the Hamilton energy is estimated to predict the mode selection and effect of noise.},

In the present study, we investigate the effect of topography from the approach to topographic Rossby waves, not to the geostrophic viewpoint. It is the first time that a new evolution equation, called Gardner equation, is derived to simulate the propagation of nonlinear Rossby waves amplitude by using the methods of multiple scales and weak nonlinearity. In order to investigate the physical mechanisms of topographic Rossby wave, the shooting method is adopted to solve the Sturm-Liouville model equation with fixed boundary conditions and the Fourier spectral method is used to solve the nonlinear Gardner equation. Numerical results reveal that the magnitude of the meridional topography is more important compared to its meridional frequency on the evolution of nonlinear Rossby solitary waves, also, the variation of planetary vorticity is essential for the propagation of Rossby solitary waves.},

An FTS criterion is also obtained for this case. Theoretical results show that the case of completely known TRs is the special case of partially unknown TRs.

The sampled-data fuzzy filter, which take into account both the measurement output and the fuzzy consequent parameter as the sampled signal, is expressed as a fuzzy system with a time-varying delay including the event-triggering variable. Under these considerations, a novel proportional-plus-integral (PI) event triggering condition is proposed to alleviate network allocation. Based time-delay approach, the stability of the filtering error systems is guaranteed by a new Lyapunov Kravoskii functional and by employing generalized free-weighting matrix integral inequality. Furthermore, an affine matched membership based distributed-filter (AMDF) is designed to improve the H ∞ performance, utilizing affine transformed membership function as a membership function of fuzzy filter. The affine matched membership function relaxes the parameterized stability condition due to the deviation bounds of sampled fuzzy membership function between consecutive sampling times. To show the effectiveness of proposed method, the results are compared with the unused ones.},

Specifically, we study a model in which an economic agent has a retirement option and does not tolerate a decline in consumption post retirement. The agent receives a constant labor income but suffers utility loss from the labor before retirement. By considering variational inequality arising from the optimal stopping problem, we derive a closed-form solution for the optimal policies and retirement wealth threshold. We show that this post-retirement spending power raises the optimal retirement wealth threshold, forcing the agent to retire later. By endogenously deriving the initial consumption process at the moment of retirement time, we show that the agent’s consumption flow jumps down at the moment of retirement, which is related to the ``retirement-consumption puzzle&#39;&#39;.

  abstract     = {Manifestation of Küppers–Lortz secondary instability in rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection in a Newtonian liquid (water) and in homogeneous and heterogeneous nanoliquids is reported for rigid-isothermal and free-isothermal boundaries. Water–alumina and water–alumina–copper are used as representative homogeneous and heterogeneous nanoliquids. Experimental data on thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity are used and empirical models which represent experimental data faithfully are obtained. In order to study Küppers–Lortz secondary instability an energy-conserving, ninth-order Lorenz model is derived using the minimal mode truncated Fourier–Galerkin expansion. It is shown that the critical Rayleigh number obtained in the case of rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection in water–alumina–copper and water–alumina nanoliquids is smaller than the value obtained in the case of water, whereas the critical Taylor number obtained in the case of water–alumina–copper and water–alumina nanoliquids is larger than the value obtained in the case of water. Thus, the individual effect of suspending dilute concentrations of homogeneous and heterogeneous nanoparticles in water is to promote formation of the steady, primary instability (longitudinal rolls) and impede the appearance of the Küppers–Lortz instability (intersecting rolls). It is also shown that compared to a homogeneous nanoliquid, a heterogeneous nanoliquid is more pro-primary-instability as well as anti-secondary-instability. Further, it is found that by slightly increasing the volume fraction of alumina nanoparticles in water one can achieve the same effect as that of alumina and copper in water. In order to validate the results on Küppers–Lortz instability, we considered the results on Küppers–Lortz instability in the absence of nanoparticles obtained in the two cases of rigid and free boundaries and compared them with those of previous investigations, and reasonably good agreement is found.},

Second, the delay-dependent and -independent criteria under which the zero equilibrium is globally exponentially stable are derived, respectively. Last, the validity of these criteria are illustrated by a pair of numerical examples . Compared with the previous results, the merits of the proposed method are: (i) no Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional or auxiliary function is required; (ii) less computational complexity is verified; and (iii) the obtained stability criteria can easily be realized, since they are to test whether a matrix is nonsingular M-matrix.},

Different from the related literatures, nonlinear functions in the diffusion terms are allowed to be unknown in this paper. The parametric uncertainties and unknown covariance noise are compensated with the aid of adaptive control design. By combining the backstepping technique with barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) in a unified framework, the full-state constraints can be dealt. Then, an adaptive state-feedback controller is constructed, which guarantees all the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded, the system states remain in the defined compact sets and the output tracks the reference signal well. Finally, stochastic noise is introduced to establish a stochastic simple pendulum system to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

The species is supposed to undergo kinetic reversible phase exchange and irreversible absorptive reactions at the outer wall material whereas in the bulk of the flow, the species participates in a first-order reaction with the solvent. The velocity distribution has a complex interaction with the reaction parameters and in order to track that, three different kinds of oscillatory flows are considered. For the purpose of estimation of dispersion coefficient, the method of moments Aris (1956)[3] is employed. The unsteady convective-diffusion equation gives rise to integral moment equations and are solved numerically by FDM . The cross-sectional concentration distribution is determined from the relationship between central moments and Hermite polynomials for the unsteady components of the flows. The study reveals the coupled effects of reversible phase exchange, irreversible absorption and bulk flow reaction on the transport of species in a variety of flow situations.},

The theoretical analyses of convergence, error and stability indicate that the accuracy and stability of GIMDC are close to implicit method if ARFs are utilized to guarantee convergence. A strict condition for ARFs is derived. GIMDC is compared with PEM (pure explicit method), NIM (Newton iterative method for implicit solution) and FEM (finite element method) which shows that GIMDC is of acceptable numerical accuracy (similar to NIM and 19.28% and 12.89% higher than PEM and FEM respectively in average) and higher efficiency.

Previous studies mainly viewed the issue of ISS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and therefore used MCDM methods to investigate it. However, many important aspects, for example, the dynamic process of ISS, the impact of different kinds of factors on ISS, and the stability of the solution of ISS, have not attracted enough attention and are still lacked of deep investigation. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is proposed to study this issue from theoretical perspective. That is to say, an ISS game is developed to formalize the interaction relationship between information sources, and replicator equation about population dynamics is used to mimick the dynamically evolutionary process in ISS. Within the proposed model, two kinds of factors, subjective factors and objective factors, have been separately considered and their respective influence on ISS has been distinguished. Furthermore, the dynamic process of ISS is presented clearly, and the stability of the solution is also investigated mathematically. Illustrative examples show that the proposed model sheds new light into the issue of ISS.},

A necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal control policy minimizing the quadratic cost index is established. Then, a hybrid system that consisting all the potential attack modes is constructed and the corresponding optimal control policy for each attack mode is also obtained. Furthermore, an online switching method is proposed to pick up a proper control policy from the set of controllers. It is proved that the proposed online switching method guarantees the asymptotic stability of the system. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Different Listeria monocytogenes strains produce biofilms with different structures, namely flat, honeycomb and clustered. Previous works showed that glucose impaired uptake and the appearance of damaged or dead cells are critical mechanisms underlying Listeria monocytogenes biofilm dynamics. Here we explicitly propose an extension of the two-dimensional multi-species model proposed by Alpkist and Klapper to account for those mechanisms. The result is a continuous two-dimensional multi-species model with non-linear detachment and mass action nutrient consumption. Moreover, we also propose a set of efficient numerical methods to solve the coupled model and we have developed their computer implementation from scratch in C/C++. Mainly based on finite differences schemes, these numerical techniques include Crank-Nicolson schemes for time discretization, Gibou’s ghost node techniques and level set methods to cope with the free boundary associated to the determination of the time-dependent biofilm domain. To finish with, we compare our simulation results with the dynamics of real biofilms as observed in the laboratory. More precisely, by using model parameters calibrated to experiments, the numerical results clearly illustrate the performance of the proposed model and the numerical methods to reproduce the real dynamics of flat, clustered and honeycomb structures shown by different Listeria monocytogenes strains.},

  abstract     = {A two-level stabilized quadratic equal-order variational multiscale method based on the finite element discretization is proposed for numerically solving the steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds numbers . In this method, a stabilized solution is first obtained by solving a fully stabilized nonlinear system on a coarse grid, and then the solution is corrected by solving a stabilized linear problem on a fine grid. Under the condition of N ∥ f ∥ H − 1 ( Ω ) ν ( ν + α ) &lt; 1 , N∥f∥H−1(Ω)ν(ν+α)&amp;lt;1, the stability of the present method is analyzed, and error estimates of the approximate solutions from the proposed method are deduced.

  abstract     = {We propose a cooperative evolution model in which successive behaviors influence reputation. There are two mechanisms to form reputation. One is enhancing the reputation of players who cooperate insistently, and reducing it when they defect continuously. The other is increasing reputation when defection is transformed into cooperation, and decreasing when cooperation is turned into defection. These two reputation formation mechanisms are simulated on the weak prisoner&#39;s dilemma game. We use a weighted average Fermi equation to describe the probability of players learning the strategy of a randomly selected neighbor. The results show that, under these two mechanisms, both the reward for reputation and emphasis on it have an impact on the cooperation. We find that encouraging “C after C” is better for cooperation than encouraging “C after D”, when people attach importance to reputation to a certain extent. Before reaching that threshold, however, encouraging “C after D” is better when reputation reward is large.},

The fractures can store and transport fluid and they are modelled as lower-dimensional entities in the surrounding porous medium. The flow system of interest in this work is single-phase, isothermal and non-compositional. The model consists of the full-dimensional Darcy’s law in the rock matrix coupled to the Stokes equations of co-dimension one in the fracture. The well-posedness of the reduced coupled problem is proved and the reduced model is validated against the full-dimensional model numerically. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is indeed a cost effective alternative to full-dimensional models.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns with the almost sure exponential synchronization for some general classes of drive-response stochastic memristive neural networks (SMNNs) with nonidentical nodes under state feedback controllers. The SMNNs considered may include networks which are asymmetrically nondelayed and delayed coupled simultaneously, and state-dependent or even those that are subject to exogenous stochastic perturbations representatively. The main results of this paper are a collection of generic sufficient conditions for guaranteed almost sure exponential synchronization of these SMNNs, which performs great advantages compared with mean-square synchronization. Furthermore, some practical corollaries are also obtained from the main results that may be directly applied to some smaller subclasses of these networks. In particular, a simpler and more effective way of almost surely exponentially synchronizing SMNNs without delays follows by considering them as a special case of SMNNs with delays. Some numerical simulations are given to illustrate our main theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the problem of derivative-based event-triggered control for linear networked systems with quantization. A novel type of event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is presented via involving a derivative term related with the Lyapunov functional. Inspired by this introduced derivative term, we call the proposed ETM as derivative-based event-triggered mechanism (DETM). In the conventional ETM, the triggering condition is always needed to be less than zero to ensure the system stability, while it is not required under the proposed DETM. Then, with the help of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, sufficient conditions for co-designing the triggering matrix and an event-triggered controller are derived. The corresponding results are also applied to event-triggered control systems with time-varying transmission delay. The validity of the developed approach is illustrated by some simulation examples.},

Then, using the sliding mode concept, a robust adaptive control scheme is designed to synchronize the proposed system. The adaptation mechanism is implemented to estimate the unknown parameters of the slave system. Then, the output of the proposed adaptation mechanism is used for the control scheme. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven via a fractional version of the Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat&#39;s lemma. Numerical simulations of synchronization are shown to investigate the performance of the developed control technique on the uncertain fractional-order hyperchaotic memristor oscillator. Finally, as an engineering application, the proposed fractional-order system is implemented for voice encryption. In this regard, to show the appropriate performance of the proposed system for voice encryption, statistical characteristic of the encryption and decryption processes are performed through different methods including correlation, entropy, root mean square, and root sum of squares.},

However, it often fails to extract meaningful features in high-dimensional settings. This motivates the sparse CCA problem, in which ℓ 1 constraints are applied to the canonical vectors. Although some sparse CCA solvers exist in the literature, we found that none of them is efficient. We propose a fast two-stage semi-smooth Newton augmented Lagrangian method ( tSSNALM ) to solve sparse CCA problems, and we provide convergence analysis. Numerical comparisons between our approach and a number of state-of-the-art solvers, on simulated data sets, are presented to demonstrate its efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that duality has been integrated with a semi-smooth Newton method for solving sparse CCA.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a hunting game in the “playing the field” model, in which an individual within a group has to choose from two survival strategies: the group hunting strategy or the individual hunting strategy. The group hunting strategy aims at hunting more dangerous, larger prey, that are far beyond a single individual’s capture ability, where the return is greater but the risk is higher. While the individual hunting strategy aims at hunting small prey that can be easily captured by an independent individual, where the return is less but the risk is lower. Evolutionary game theory is used to investigate the selection dynamics of a two-strategy game with a finite population. This reveals the existences of the stable/unstable equilibrium points and evolutionarily stable strategies when there is the frequency-dependent strategy selection in the hunting game. The evolutionarily stable state is found to be not always unique because the system of the hunting game can have multiple equilibrium points. It is shown that a stable equilibrium point will always act as an evolutionarily stable strategy, while an unstable equilibrium point cannot resist invasion from a mutation. The population fitness cannot always reach the optimum level when applying the evolutionary process with the fitness difference function.},

Basically, the refinement algorithm is firstly characterized by the use of an adaptive superimposition scheme, in which an error estimate compares two approximate solutions computed on a coarser and a finer set of collocation points, and then on a modified adaptive residual subsampling scheme. Blending these computational techniques we detect the areas that need to be refined, also having the chance to further add and/or remove adaptively collocation points.

The presented methodology applies in the same manner regardless of the used model, and the computational performance is invariant under a considerable change in the dimension of the selected model.

This work is based on the relation between the solution of the equivalent model of stochastic delay differential system without impulses corresponding to the solution of the system with impulses. Then the conditions of the exponential stability of the proposed impulsive system are obtained by deriving stability criteria of the corresponding system without impulses.

The nonlinear terms f and h may be singular on the time variable and space variables. The uniqueness result is obtained, by the theory of mixed monotone operators.

  abstract     = {For a fixed p ∈ N , p∈N, sequences of polynomials { P n }, n ∈ N , n∈N, defined by a ( p + 2 ) (p+2) -term recurrence relation are related to several topics in Approximation Theory. A ( p + 2 ) (p+2) -banded matrix J determines the coefficients of the recurrence relation of any of such sequences of polynomials. The connection between these polynomials and the concept of orthogonality has already been established through a p -dimension vector of functionals. This work goes further on this topic by analyzing the relation between such vectors for the set of sequences { P n ( j ) } , {Pn(j)}, n ∈ N , associated with the Darboux transformations J ( j ) , j = 1 , … , p , j=1,…,p, of a given ( p + 2 ) (p+2) -banded matrix J . This is synthesized in Theorem 1, where, under certain conditions, these relationships are established. Besides, some relationships between the sequences of polynomials { P n ( j ) } {Pn(j)} are determined in Theorem 2, which will be of interest for future research on p -orthogonal polynomials. We also provide an example to illustrate the effect of the Darboux transformations of a Hessenberg banded matrix, showing the sequences of p -orthogonal polynomials and the corresponding vectors of functionals. For the sake of clarity, in this example we have considered the case p = 2 , p=2, since the procedure is similar for p &gt; 2.},

  abstract     = {The Lambert W function is defined by W ( a ) e W ( a ) − a = 0 W(a)eW(a)−a=0 . One of the many applications of the Lambert W function is in solving delay differential equations (DDEs). In 2003, Asl and Ulsoy provided a solution of some DDEs in terms of the Lambert W functions Asl et al. (2003)[1]. However, the solutions are limited to differential equations with delay in the state variable. Scott et al. (2006)[2] introduced a generalized Lambert function which was further studied by Mező and Baricz (2017)[3]. In our work, we show that this generalization of the Lambert W function provides an analytical solution to neutral delay differential equations (NDDEs). NDDEs are DDEs with time delay not only in the state variables but also in the derivative terms. This analytical solution is advantageous such that it is similar to the general solutions of linear ODEs. Also, one can identify how the parameters affect the solution of the equation since our proposed solution is written in terms of these parameters. We then propose a new numerical method to solve linear NDDEs using the generalized Lambert W function. We test our method to examples with known solutions. We also provide a real-world application by solving an NDDE model of the population growth of an E. coli culture using our proposed approach.},

We reduce the direct problem on determination of the radial and longitudinal displacement components to the numerical solution of a number of canonical systems of differential equations with variable coefficients.

  abstract     = {The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is a simple and efficient numerical technique for solving certain homogenous partial differential equations (PDEs) which can be extended to solving inhomogeneous equations through the method of particular solutions (MPS). In this paper, radial basis functions (RBFs) are considered as the basis functions for the construction of a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation. A hybrid method coupling these two methods using both fundamental solutions and RBFs as basis functions has been effective for solving a large class of PDEs. In this paper, we propose an improved fictitious points method in which the centres of the RBFs are distributed inside and outside the physical domain of the problem and which considerably improves the performance of the MPS–MFS. We also describe various techniques to deal with the several parameters present in the proposed method, such as the location of the fictitious points, the source location in the MFS, and the estimation of a good value of the RBF shape parameter. Five numerical examples in 2D/3D and for second/fourth–order PDEs are presented and the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the traditional MPS–MFS.},

  abstract     = {Many real networks in social sciences, biological and biomedical sciences or computer science have an inherent structure of simplicial complexes reflecting many-body interactions. Therefore, to analyse topological and dynamical properties of simplicial complex networks centrality measures for simplices need to be proposed. Many of the classical complex networks centralities are based on the degree of a node, so in order to define degree centrality measures for simplices (which would characterise the relevance of a simplicial community in a simplicial network), a different definition of adjacency between simplices is required, since, contrarily to what happens in the vertex case (where there is only upper adjacency), simplices might also have other types of adjacency. The aim of these notes is threefold: first we will use the recently introduced notions of higher order simplicial degrees to propose new degree based centrality measures in simplicial complexes. These theoretical centrality measures, such as the simplicial degree centrality or the eigenvector centrality would allow not only to study the relevance of a simplicial community and the quality of its higher-order connections in a simplicial network, but also they might help to elucidate topological and dynamical properties of simplicial networks; sencond, we define notions of walks and distances in simplicial complexes in order to study connectivity of simplicial networks and to generalise, to the simplicial case, the well known closeness and betweenness centralities (needed for instance to study the relevance of a simplicial community in terms of its ability of transmitting information); third, we propose a new clustering coefficient for simplices in a simplicial network, different from the one knows so far and which generalises the standard graph clustering of a vertex. This measure should be essential to know the density of a simplicial network in terms of its simplicial communities.},

  abstract     = {The goal of clustering is to partition a set of data points into groups of similar data points, called clusters. Clustering algorithms can be classified into two categories: hard and soft clustering. Hard clustering assigns each data point to one cluster exclusively. On the other hand, soft clustering allows probabilistic assignments to clusters. In this paper, we propose a new model which combines the benefits of these two models: clarity of hard clustering and probabilistic assignments of soft clustering. Since the majority of data usually have a clear association, only a few points may require a probabilistic interpretation. Thus, we apply the ℓ 1 norm constraint to impose sparsity on probabilistic assignments. Moreover, we also incorporate outlier detection in our clustering model to simultaneously detect outliers which can cause serious problems in statistical analyses. To optimize the model, we introduce an alternating minimization method and prove its convergence. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing models show the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The mechanical properties of the material of viscoelastic functionally graded layer vary with respect to a certain depth as a hyperbolic function, while it varies as a quadratic function for the viscoelastic functionally graded half-space. The complex wave velocity of SH-wave has been achieved by the method of Green’s function and Fourier transformation under the appropriate boundary conditions of the adopted model. The derived wave velocity of SH-waves has been reduced to the classical equation of Love wave when both the viscoelastic orthotropic FGM layer and half-space are considered to be homogeneous isotropic elastic, as depicted in the section of particular cases and validation. Moreover, numerical computation of the obtained velocity equation has been performed and the substantial effects of viscoelasticity and heterogeneity on phase velocity as well as attenuation coefficient for both the cases of absence and presence of initial stress in the media have been perceived by the means of graphs. The final results of this work may be relevant to understand the useful information of SH-wave propagation in the considered layered structure.},

The introduction of the RL approach is to learn the feedback gain matrix to fulfill the construction of the control algorithm to guarantee the reach of consensus only on the basis of the available information. For the state feedback control , the RL algorithm relates only to the state and the input of an arbitrary agent, while for the output feedback control, the RL algorithm depends only on the input and output information of an arbitrary agent, irrelevant any model information. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the main results.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript exploited a bottom to up modelling nano-mechanics theory to investigate the nonlinear stability and dynamic behaviors of perfect and imperfect carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in pre-buckling and post-buckling domains, for the first time. The Doublet Mechanics (DM) theory is exploited to induce the length scale of CNTs, micro-strain, and micro-stress effects, which are negligible in classical continuum theory. The Euler-Bernoulli kinematic and nonlinear mid-plane stretching effect are considered through analysis. The imperfection of CNTs is described by a harmonic function through spatial direction. The nonclassical sixth order nonlinear integro-partial-differential equation of CNTs is derived in detail. Based on the static equilibrium equation, analytical solutions for smallest buckling loads, as well as, nonlinear static response of perfect and imperfect CNTs in pre-buckling and post-buckling regimes are deduced. The equation of motion of linear vibration problem is solved analytically to get natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Numerical studies investigate the impact of length scale parameter, imperfection amplitude and shear foundation constant on static and dynamic stabilities of CNTs with both fully clamped and simply supported conditions. The current model is effective in designing of NEMS, nano-sensor and nano-actuator manufactured by CNTs.},

  abstract     = {The environmental investment, protecting and improving environmental quality and preventing deterioration of the ecological environment, can reduce costs of the environmentalist and even bring some benefits. It is an inevitable phenomenon that the efficiency of environmental investment is related to the social attention, driven by the rapid development of the Internet. And the public response to the ecological status with various patterns can affect the social attention, further change the compensation to cooperators from environmental investment. In the public goods game considering environmental investment, we model a society in which attitudes and behaviors co-evolve and classify the entire population into four categories to establish a differential equation system into the interplay of social attention and ecological situation using the mean field approximation. The response mechanism can disturb the fluctuation of various groups, so the level of cooperation moves and the level of social attention does not. Among three different response mechanisms, the precautionary mechanism is the most beneficial to cooperation. The more timely the response, the higher the cooperation rate. We also can conclude that the cooperation emerges when the sensitivity is relatively greater than the forgetfulness to a certain extent. There is an interval of stable level of the attention, within which the sensitivity and the forgetfulness have no impact on it. Only when the budget is greater than a threshold can cooperation emerge and be pushed in this way – the more budget, the slower promotion. Not surprisingly, researches on the interplay between social attention and individual behavior are instructive, which help us to better coordinate the actions of all parties and solve ecological problem effectively.},

Our main intension is to locate the ideal application of this type of systems. In later part of this paper, the novel mathematical model which describes the life stages of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes is proposed. In that model, the life shorting bacteria called Wolbachia is used as a biological control. By moderately thinking about the uncertain conditions in the biological control we implemented the non-fragile control.

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with a numerical method for a class of one-dimensional multi-term time-fractional convection-reaction-diffusion problems, where the differential equation contains a sum of the Caputo time-fractional derivatives of different orders between 0 and 1. In general the solutions of such problems typically exhibit a weak singularity at the initial time. A compact exponential finite difference method, using the well-known L 1 formula for each time-fractional derivative and a fourth-order compact exponential difference approximation for the spatial discretization, is proposed on a mesh that is generally nonuniform in time and uniform in space. Taking into account the initial weak singularity of the solution, the stability and convergence of the method is proved and the optimal error estimate in the discrete L 2 -norm is obtained by developing a discrete energy analysis technique which enables us to overcome the difficulties caused by the nonsymmetric discretization matrices. The error estimate shows that the method has the spatial fourth-order convergence, and reveals how to select an appropriate mesh parameter to obtain the temporal optimal convergence. The extension of the method to two-dimensional problems is also discussed. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence result, and show the applicability of the method to convection dominated problems.},

Later the penalty method was used for spectral methods to be implemented in irregular domains in multiple dimensions. It has been also shown that there are close relations between discontinuous Galerkin methods and spectral penalty methods in multi-domain and element setting. In addition to stability, the penalty method provides a better accuracy because of its asymptotic behavior in the neighborhood of boundaries. The optimal value of the penalty parameter for accuracy has not been studied thoroughly for the exact form. In this short note, we consider a simple differential equation and study the optimal value of the penalty parameter by minimizing the error in maximum norm. We focus on the optimization for the case of Chebyshev spectral collocation method. We provide its exact form and verify it numerically.},

By using the Gershgorin circle theorem, we investigate the relationship between degree and eigenvalue of the network matrix, and obtain the approximate range of eigenvalue of the network matrix. Also, We derive the instability condition about diffusion and the connection probability in the network-organized system. And then we obtain the estimated range of connection probability.

The H -structure connectivity κ ( G; H ) of G is the minimal cardinality of a set of subgraphs F = { J 1 , J 2 , … , J m } F={J1,J2,…,Jm} in G , where J i ≅ H (1 ≤ i ≤ m ), and the deletion of F disconnects G . Similarly, the H -substructure connectivity κ s ( G; H ) of G is the minimal cardinality of a set of subgraphs F = { J 1 , … , J m } F={J1,…,Jm} in G , where J i (1 ≤ i ≤ m ) is isomorphic to a connected subgraph of H , and the deletion of F disconnects G .

In this paper, the resistance distance between any two arbitrary vertices of a chain silicate network and a cyclic silicate network was procured by utilizing techniques from the theory of electrical networks, i.e., the series and parallel principles, the principle of elimination, the star-triangle transformation and the delta-wye transformation. Two closed formulae for the Kirchhoff index of the chain silicate network and the cyclic silicate network were obtained respectively.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, because it is able to combine multiple base clusterings (ensemble members) into a more robust clustering. It mainly consists of two parts, generating multiple ensemble members and finding a final partition. The construction of the information matrix plays an important role for finding a final partition. In general categorical data ensemble clustering framework, most existing information matrices are constructed only relying on label information of ensemble members without considering original information of data sets. To solve this problem, a new ensemble clustering framework for categorical data is proposed, in which the information matrix considers label information and original data information together, and is instantiated into the ALM matrix in this paper. The ALM matrix takes account of not only the distribution of attribute content in each ensemble member, but also the relationship among ensemble members based on the distribution. To simplicity, the k -means technique is used to cluster the ALM matrix and form a new ensemble clustering algorithm. The experimental results have shown the benefits of the ALM matrix by comparing the proposed algorithm with other ensemble clustering algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel, linear superposition method (LSM) to compute the stress tensor field and displacement vector field in a homogeneous elastic medium with an unlimited (but finite) number of circular cylindrical holes. The displacement field and the associated stress concentrations are due to a far-field stress. The method allows for the hole-centers to occur in arbitrary locations, and the hole-radii may vary over a wide range (but holes may not overlap). The holes may also induce additional elastic displacement due to internal pressure loading that will affect the local stress field, which is fully accounted for in the method. Each hole may be loaded by either equal or individual pressure loads. The underlying algorithms and solution methodology are explained and examples are given for a variety of cases. Selected case study examples show excellent matches with results obtained via independent methods (photo-elastics, complex analysis, and discrete volume solution methods). The LSM provides several advantages over alternative methods: (1) Being closed-form solutions, infinite resolution is preserved throughout, (2) Being grid-less, no time is lost on gridding, and (3) fast computation times. The specific examples of LSM applications to the multi-hole problem developed here, allow for an unlimited number of holes, with either equal or varying radii, in arbitrary constellations. The solutions further account for variable combinations of far-field stress and pressure loads on individual holes. The method can be applied for either plane strain or plane stress boundary conditions. A constitutive equation for linear elasticity controls the stress field solutions, which can be scaled for the full range of Poisson&#39;s ratios and Young moduli possible in linear elastic materials.},

Instead of investigating case by case as in previous papers for the collinear 3-body or 4-body problems, we first prove some properties of necessary conditions for super central conditions that exclude impossible cases. After excluding those impossible cases from total 120 permutations of the collinear 5-body problem, there are only 18 pairs of derangements which are possible for super central configurations. We further prove that a super central configuration has at most one different arrangement in the collinear 5-body problem. We provide numerical examples for such possible arrangements.},

First the existence conditions of the Turing instability and the Turing-Hopf bifurcation are established from the theoretical analysis, respectively. Then by employing the technique of weakly nonlinear analysis, amplitude equations generated near the Turing instability critical value are derived. Various spatiotemporal patterns, such as homogeneous stationary state patterns, hexagonal patterns, coexisting patterns, stripe patterns, and their stability are determined via analyzing the obtained amplitude equations. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical analysis. Especially, the analogous-spiral and symmetrical wave patterns can be found near the codimension-two Turing-Hopf bifurcation point. A security center of the prey species can be found as well. These spatiotemporal patterns are explained from the perspective of the predators and prey species.},

In case of α ≥ 1, the obtained criterion is sharp in the sense that the oscillation constant is optimal for the corresponding half-linear Euler type equation with delay, while the result for α &lt; 1 is slightly worse. Our methodology differs from the previous ones, since it is only based on sequentially improved monotonicities of the nonoscillatory solution.},

  abstract     = {There is currently growing interest in modeling the information diffusion on social networks across multi-disciplines, including the prediction of the news popularity, the detection of the rumors and the influence of the epidemiological studies. Following the framework of the epidemic spreading, the information spreading models assume that information can be transmitted from the known individuals (infected) to the un-known individuals (susceptible) through the network interactions. During this process, individuals also always change their interactions which in turn will greatly influence the information spreading. In this work, we propose a mechanism considering the co-evolution between information states and network topology simultaneously, in which the information diffusion was executed as an SIS process and network topology evolved based on the adaptive assumption. The theoretical analyses based on the Markov approach were very consistent with simulation. Both simulation results and theoretical analyses indicated that the adaptive process, in which informed individuals would rewire the links between the informed neighbors to a random non-neighbor node, can enhance information diffusion (leading to much broader spreading). In addition, we obtained that two threshold values exist for the information diffusion on adaptive networks, i.e., if the information propagation probability is less than the first threshold, information cannot diffuse and dies out immediately; if the propagation probability is between the first and second threshold, information will spread to a finite range and die out gradually; and if the propagation probability is larger than the second threshold, information will diffuse to a certain size of population in the network. These results may shed some light on understanding the co-evolution between information diffusion and network topology.},

It is known that among graphs on n vertices that have just one block, the n -cycle has the biggest Wiener index. In a previous work of the same authors, it was shown that among all graphs on n vertices which have p ≥ 2 blocks, the maximum Wiener index is attained by a graph composed of two cycles C a and C b joined by a path of length p − 2 (possibly a and b are of size 2). In this paper we elaborate further this result and determine the sizes of a and b in the extremal graphs for each n and p . We distinguish six cases with crucial values being 5 p − 7 and 5 p − 8 . Roughly speaking, if n bigger than 5 p − 7 , then the extremal graphs is obtained for a = 2 . i.e. the graph is a path glued to a cycle. For values n = 5 p − 8 and 5 p − 7 , we have more than one extremal graph. And, when n &lt; 5 p − 8 , the extremal graphs is again unique with a and b being equal or almost equal depending of the congruence of n − p modulo 4. We also showed unimodal property of a behaviour of Wiener index.},

The linearization method , developed by the authors in the framework of the analytic hierarchy process, is a pull-towards-consistency mechanism that shows the path from an inconsistent body of judgment elicited from an expert towards consistency, by suggesting optimal changes to the expert opinions. However, experts may be reluctant to alter some of their issued opinions, and may wish to impose constraints on the adjustments suggested by the consistency-enforcement mechanism.

  abstract     = {The Poisson Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a well-established implicit solvent continuum model for the electrostatic analysis of solvated biomolecules . The numerical solution of the nonlinear PBE is still a challenge due to its exponential nonlinear term , strong singularity by the source terms, and distinct dielectric regions. In this paper, a new pseudo-transient approach is proposed, which combines an analytical treatment of singular charges in a two-component regularization , with an analytical integration of nonlinear term in pseudo-time solution. To ensure efficiency, both fully implicit alternating direction implicit (ADI) and unconditionally stable locally one-dimensional (LOD) methods have been constructed to decompose three-dimensional linear systems into one-dimensional (1D) ones in each pseudo-time step. Moreover, to accommodate the nonzero function and flux jumps across the dielectric interface, a modified ghost fluid method (GFM) has been introduced as a first order accurate sharp interface method in 1D style, which minimizes the information needed for the molecular surface . The 1D finite-difference matrix generated by the GFM is symmetric and diagonally dominant, so that the stability of ADI and LOD methods is boosted. The proposed pseudo-transient GFM schemes have been numerically validated by calculating solvation free energy , binding energy, and salt effect of various proteins. It has been found that with the augmentation of regularization and GFM interface treatment, the ADI method not only enhances the accuracy dramatically, but also improves the stability significantly. By using a large time increment, an efficient protein simulation can be realized in steady-state solutions. Therefore, the proposed GFM-ADI and GFM-LOD methods provide accurate, stable, and efficient tools for biomolecular simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the issue of neural-network-approximation-based adaptive reliable event-triggered tracking for a class of strict-feedback systems with abrupt non-affine fault is investigated. The mean-value theorem is first used to decouple non-affine fault into affine form and then the Nussbaum function is introduced to overcome the difficulty of unknown control gains encountered in controller design process. Under the framework of adaptive backstepping technique, a novel event-triggered fault-tolerant control scheme is proposed, which ensures the stability of the system and reduces the waste of transmission resources. It should be mentioned that abrupt actuator fault and the discontinuous control signals under the event-triggered mechanism may lead to poor transient performance. Therefore, the prescribed performance bounds (PPB) method is used to constrain the tracking error within the desired specified range, which successfully improves the transient performance of the system. Finally, it is proved that all closed-loop signals under the proposed control method are semi-globally bounded and the Zeno behavior is avoided. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Then, by introducing two novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals catering for two cases of time-varying delay, two sufficient conditions on stability, respectively, for the system under two cases of time-varying delay are derived using the improved triple-integral inequality and a necessary and sufficient condition on quadratic matrix inequalities reported recently.

  abstract     = {Recent collapses of many fisheries across the globe have challenged the mathematical approach to these systems through classic bioeconomic models. Decimated populations did not recover as fast as predicted by these models and depensatory effects were introduced to better fit the dynamics at low population abundances. Alternative to depensation, modeling captures by non-linear harvesting functions produces equivalent outcomes at small abundances, and the dynamics undergoes a bifurcation leading to population collapse and recovery once catching efforts are above or below certain thresholds, respectively. The time that a population takes to undergo these transitions has been mostly overlooked in bioeconomic contexts, though. In this work we quantify analytically and numerically the times associated to these collapse and recovery transitions in a model incorporating non-linear harvesting and immigration in the presence and absence of demographic stochasticity. Counterintuitively, although species at low abundances are prone to extinction due to demographic stochasticity, our results show that stochastic collapse and recovery times are upper bounded by their deterministic estimates. This occurs over the full range of immigration rates. Our work may have relevant quantitative implications in the context of fishery management and rebuilding.},

Given an initial population, the problem arises as to determine which of the many equilibrium populations, i.e. extinction, only one species or coexistence of two species, will be reached as a function of the species characteristics, specifically their capacity to modify the environment and the optimal growth rate.

In this work we verify computationally Bondy and Jackson’s conjecture for graphs with up to 25 vertices. Using a reduction we search for graphs that contain a stable fixed-edge cycle or equivalently a stable cycle with one vertex of degree two. For generating candidate graphs we use plantri and for checking if they contain a stable fixed-edge cycle we propose three approaches. Two of them are based on integer linear programming (ILP) and the other is a cycle enumeration algorithm. To reduce the search space we prove several properties a minimum planar graph with minimum degree at least three containing a stable fixed-edge cycle must satisfy, the most significant being triangle freeness. Comparing the three algorithms shows that the enumeration is more effective on small graphs while for larger graphs the ILP-based approaches perform better. Finally, we use the enumeration approach together with plantri to check that there does not exist a planar graph with minimum degree at least three which contains a stable fixed-edge cycle with 24 or fewer vertices.},

In this paper, by establishing a two-layered multiplex network model which combines SIR epidemic process, vaccination decision-making and imitating human nature , we discover that imitating behavior would restrain the increase of herd immunity , which is verified by Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field equations, respectively. Interestingly, a suitable quantity of conformity motivated individual, counter-intuitively, could be beneficial to save the social costs. At the same time, we analytically determine the precise conditions for the minimum total social costs. The current results can help to understand the behavior of social group in depth and then explore public attitudes concerning the vaccine, which usually has a tremendous impact on social vaccine take-up within the population.},

The static AW strategy is designed such that the resulting closed-loop system with OSL nonlinearity, actuator saturation, and exogenous disturbance is stable and the region of attraction can be maximized. Inequalities based conditions are formulated for the static AW gain design by using Lyapunov stability theory , sector condition, L 2 gain reduction, OSL inequality, and quadratic inner-bounded (QIB) condition. The proposed AW technique is simpler to design, straightforward to implement and deals with a broader class of systems in contrast to conventional methods. An application example demonstrates that the proposed static AW can successfully mitigate the saturation consequences in OSL nonlinear systems .},

Furthermore, it can be proved that all the closed-loop signals are bounded in probability, and the consensus error of the stochastic multi-agent systems can converge to a small region of origin under the Lyapunov stability theory .

  abstract     = {The master-slave synchronization of a type of the complex-valued chaotic Lur’e systems (CVCLSs) with time delay is addressed for the first time, with decomposing complex-valued dynamic systems into two real-valued systems. The complex-valued state variables are introduced in the chaotic Lur’e systems, which expand the application in image processing and remote operation control, and improve the confidentiality in secure communication. Firstly, on the basis of the Lyapunov principle, a Lyapunov-Krasovkii functional (LKF) is established by using certain novel augmented terms, which can take full advantage of the usable information on the sampled-data and the characteristics of the system. Secondly, in the case of a complex-valued delayed chaotic Lur’e system, a more general synchronization criterion is constructed to expand certain current conclusions in the real domain. What’s more, the required gain matrices can be designed according to the solution of the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In contrast, the conclusions of this paper are more extensive than some existing studies. At last, the validity of the conclusions of this paper is proved by numerical simulations.},

Here we investigate the propagation of cooperation in a conformity-driven dynamic social network where an agent adjusts a social tie sometimes in accordance with a rival’s strategy popularity. To this end, redirecting a link mostly depends on the local popularity of the strategy rather than the strategy itself, constituting the most significant difference from the previous work. The results show that conformity-driven linking dynamics can not only directly cut off the channel by which defection always takes a free ride, yet also dramatically foster the formation as well as the stabilization of the pure strategy group whose members are carrying the same strategy. In this regard, the coevolutionary dynamics often enhances the reciprocity between cooperation and concurrently aggravates the inhibition between defection, whereby the social dilemma can be remarkably alleviated. Our observations will enrich research efforts aimed at exploring cooperation dynamics by means of strategy-neutral linking dynamics and relax the conditions for dynamic networks to uphold cooperation.},

The aim of this paper it to show that for some standard methods the stability behaviour of their exponentially fitted versions may change strongly. Furthermore, this stability depends on the choice of the fitting space, that must be carefully selected in order to assess the quality of the integrators for the IVPs under consideration. In particular, we will show that for the usual fitting space 〈 exp ( ω x ) , exp ( − ω x ) 〉 〈exp(ωx),exp(−ωx)〉 with ω ∈ R ω∈R the size of the stability domain of the EF method can be much smaller than the one for the original method.},

Here we introduce the framework of evolutionary game theory to explore the issue of privacy protection in social networks. Since reciprocity is widely present in social activities, we introduce the heterogeneous interaction mode, in which players can adopt different strategies for different opponents. In addition, the parameter u is introduced to measure the player&#39;s dependence on the opponent who interacts directly with the central individual during the update strategy phase. Here, we explore the impact of heterogeneous interaction dependency strength on privacy protection. A series of computer simulation results suggest that heterogeneous decision behavior can promote privacy protection, and there exists an optimal dependence strength interval for the group to achieve a higher level of privacy protection. Certainly, larger reciprocity strength and smaller cost can significantly increase the privacy protection behavior. Our research work is of great significance in solving the long-term safe and effective development of social networks.},

For the Caputo differential operator with fractional order 0 &lt; ν &lt; 1, we rewrite the FDE as an equivalent integral form circumventing the derivative of the solution by the integral by parts. We obtain a discrete formulation directly from the integral form using the Lagrange interpolate polynomials. We provide truncation errors depending on the fractional order ν for linear and quadratic interpolations, which are O ( h 2 − ν ) O(h2−ν) and O ( h 3 − ν ) O(h3−ν) respectively. In order to overcome a strong singular issue as ν ≈ 0 we propose the explicit predictor-corrector scheme with perturbation technique. In case of ν ≈ 1, the truncation errors are reduced by O ( h ) O(h) and O ( h 2 ) O(h2) . In order to accelerate the convergence rate, we decompose ν = ν / 2 + ν / 2 , ν=ν/2+ν/2, convert the FDE into the system of FDEs, and apply the predictor-corrector scheme. Numerical tests for linear, nonlinear, variable order and time-fractional sub-diffusion problems demonstrate that the proposed methods give a prominent performance. We also compare the numerical results with other high-order explicit and implicit schema.},

To this end, identical network contains 100 nodes with three different topologies (regular, small-world and random) are considered.

However, because of the influence of various uncertain factors of the environment, the individual&#39;s payoff is not an accurate number but needs to be expressed by a fuzzy number. In this paper, 2 × 2 symmetric games in which the game payoff matrix is represented by fuzzy numbers were studied. Firstly, we introduce the fuzzy dilemma strength to classify fuzzy games. Then, the evolution dynamics of a fuzzy Moran process of a finite population are analyzed by using the operation of a fuzzy number. Under the condition of weak selection, the fuzzy fixation probability of the strategy is calculated when the game payoff matrix is represented by the normal fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, the conditions under which natural selection favors one strategy to be fixed in population and a strategy to become a fuzzy evolutionary stability strategy are analyzed. Lastly, the proposed fuzzy Moran model was applied to solve the problem of strategy selection in the interaction between pollution-producing enterprises. By numerical analysis, the effect of fuzzy dilemma strength on the fuzzy fixation probability was illustrated and then the feasibility and effectiveness of the method were verified. The extension of classical game dynamics to a fuzzy environment enriches the theory of evolutionary games and is more realistic.},

Meanwhile, some properties of SG-Bézier surfaces and the influence rules of shape parameters, as well as the constructions of special triangular and biangular SG-Bézier surfaces, are investigated. Furthermore, based on the terminal properties and linear independence of SG-Bernstein basis functions, the conditions for G 1 and G 2 continuity between two adjacent SG-Bézier surfaces are derived, and then simplified them by choosing appropriate shape parameters. Finally, the specific steps and applications of the smooth continuity for SG-Bézier surfaces are discussed.

An uncertain sustainable supply chain involving the factors of cost, environmental impact and social benefits is considered. Some factors (e.g., demand, cost and capacity) are recognized as uncertain variables. In the present study, a multi-objective chance-constrained model in the uncertain scenario is developed to delve into the impact of uncertainties on decision variables. In accordance with the uncertainty theory, this study elucidates the deterministic equivalence of the model. To solve this model effectively, a hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed based on variable length chromosome coding. Lastly, numerical experiments are performed to verify the feasibility of the model and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The monodomain model is a common description for explaining the electrical activity of the heart. The model is nonlinear and consists of an ODE system that describes electrochemical reactions in the cardiac cells and a parabolic PDE that express the diffusion of the electrical signal. FEM approaches for the numerical solution of the monodomain equations can be classified into those that simultaneously update the state variables with respect to time by solving a coupled system and those that perform the temporal update in a decoupled manner. While coupled strategies are known to yield more accurate results, they so far have not been applied to physiological cell models due to their enormous memory requirements and computational times. In this paper, we tackle these challenges and suggest a novel computational strategy, that exploits the sparsity of local matrices in the assembly of global FEM matrices and hence features optimal usage of memory. We demonstrate the practicability of our coupled approach by employing three popular physiological cell models (Luo-Rudy phase-I, Ten Tusscher 2006 and O’Hara-Rudy 2011) and compare it with a commonly used decoupled strategy. Qualitatively different results obtained for the simulation of cardiac reentry underline the potential relevance of our work for future studies of cardiac pathology.},

Remarkably, growth rate, capture rate, handling time, death rate and Holling parameter are considered to be temperature dependent, which makes the model different from those in the existing related literatures. First, the relationships between model parameters and water temperature are presented. Then we give the positivity and boundedness of the solutions. And parameters dependent equilibrium analysis and stability analysis are obtained, respectively. It shows that when the water temperature is lower or higher than the optimal temperature, the equilibrium density of phytoplankton increases with decreasing capture rate and increasing handling time. Meanwhile, we show that the decrease of capture rate and increase of handing time cause the density of zooplankton also increases without the optimal temperature, while the population of zooplankton tends to decrease with decrease of growth rate. In addition, sensitivity of coexisting equilibrium to the parameters of the phytoplankton–zooplankton model is analyzed. Finally, one parameter bifurcation analysis is done.},

The derivation of the model equation describing the secondary structures , which bifurcate from the ground state in a small neighborhood of the instability threshold in the case of a quasi-stationary approach to the description of the diffusion process , is presented. The resulting equation is reduced to the equation in the form of Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskounov. The obtained approximate equation predicts the existence of stationary solutions in the full problem. To verify the obtained results, the numerical solution of the problem of the motion of the phase transition interface is performed using the original program code developed by the authors. The results of numerical simulation are used to verify the possibility of using stationary solutions obtained in the weakly nonlinear approximation to determine the scenario for the development of the initial localized finite amplitude perturbation. It is shown that the obtained approximate stationary solutions accurately predict the behavior of the perturbation in the vicinity of the turning point of the bifurcation diagram . A modification of the formulas describing an approximate stationary soliton-like solution is proposed in the case when the perturbation amplitude is comparable with the height of a low-permeable layer of a porous medium in which the phase transition interface is located. By numerical simulation it is shown that this modified approximate solution is in good agreement with the results of numerical calculation for the full problem.},

The weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) schemes are among the most commonly used numerical schemes for solving the hyperbolic conservation laws due to their nonoscillatory property and high order good shock capturing abilities. The upwinding principle requires the splitting of the flux into its positive and negative parts. WENO schemes have so far been widely implemented using the Lax Friedrich flux vector splitting technique for splitting purpose. In this article, we have implemented them with the kinetic flux vector splitting (KFVS) technique. The comparison has been made with both flux vector splitting techniques for one dimensional Euler equations . The results obtained are as expected, considerable improvement has been seen in the solution obtained by the scheme which has been implemented with the kinetic flux vector splitting. The reason being KFVS is based on the sign of the intermolecular particle velocity , which is a physical quantity .},

The discretization is derived by approximating the lower order derivative terms using the governing differential equation with the imbedding technique and is fourth order accurate in space and second order accurate in time. The current approach is advantageous since the boundary conditions are completely satisfied and no further approximations are required to be carried out at the boundaries. The ability of the proposed scheme in handling linear singular problems is examined. The value of first order space derivative is computed alongwith the solution so it does not have to be estimated using the calculated value of the solution. The method successfully works for the highly nonlinear good Boussinesq equation for which more accurate solutions are obtained for the single and the double-soliton solutions in comparison with the existing numerical methods .},

Under the assumption that the unique positive equilibrium of the model is locally asymptotically stable in the absence of the delay, the effect of the increase of delay on the stability of the unique positive equilibrium is analyzed in detail. It is found that under suitable conditions on the other parameters, the delay doesn’t affect the stability of the equilibrium, namely, the equilibrium is absolutely stable while under the other conditions on the other parameters, the equilibrium will become ultimately unstable after passing through multiple stability switches and Hopf bifurcations at some certain critical values of delay. Particularly, by means of the normal form method and the center manifold reduction for retarded functional differential equations, the explicit formulae determining the direction of Hopf bifurcations and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions are obtained. To verify our theoretical conclusions, some numerical simulations for specific examples are also included at the end of this article.},

In fact, our presented results are extensions of recent theorems due to Lakzian-Rhoades [2019. Appl. Math. Comput.] and other existing classical results of fixed point theory . Furthermore, we provide examples to show the validity of our new investigations. As an application we apply our new findings to obtain solution of a matrix equation .

Convergence properties of the proposed method are discussed and numerical experiments are presented to illustrate its computational efficiency and the effectiveness of some preconditioned variants.

When players participate in a network game, they gain payoffs by playing games with their neighbors according to their different choices. Besides the network game itself, we focus on two interesting human behaviors: transcendental behavior and disturbance behavior. The former means some players choose a different strategy if they recognize global information and not just local information , and the latter describes the benchmark effect from all populations. To explore our proposed mechanisms, we introduce new transfer rules: the amendatory Fermi rule and transcendental probability , in the framework of memory-based donor and recipient game and observe their final cooperation rates and payoff distribution. The results from human experiments and simulations show that the introduction of new mechanisms will lead higher cooperation rates, which in turn will lead to a balanced payoff distribution. Finally, we observe that a fair society dominated by cooperative behavior will undoubtedly promote the development of human society.},

  abstract     = {The loyalty program (LP) is a marketing campaign designed to encourage customer loyalty by rewarding them. Motivated by extensively applied LP in real society, we propose a public loyalty program (PLP) in the public goods game (PGG). In the PLP, players are rewarded differentially depending on whether their cumulative contribution exceeds the reward threshold. The progressive accumulation rate scheme (PAR) rewards player for increasing accumulation rate (points obtained per unit contribution), while the progressive redemption rate scheme (PRR) increases the redemption rate (subsidy obtained per unit point). By means of theoretical and numerical analyses, we find that PAR can promote cooperation, but the effect is not significant. In the PRR, the combination of a small base redemption rate and a large progressive redemption rate achieves the highest level of cooperation at the medium reward threshold. The introduction of PLP in the PGG fosters and rewards the behavior and attitude loyalty of participants. While reducing cost pressure, it has reshaped the long-term bilateral relationship between the government and the public.},

To prove this result we do not assume that the number of vertices increases exponentially over time (linear rates).

The signs of the second-order derivatives to the Helmholtz, enthalpy and Gibbs functions are also analysed. We show the immediate consequences on the stability of physical systems due to the signs or curvatures of the second-order derivatives of these thermodynamic functions. The thermodynamic potentials are presented and constructed pedagogically as well as demonstrated the main mathematical aspects of these surfaces. We demonstrate the power of superposition of mathematical and physical aspects to understand the stability of thermodynamic systems . Besides, we provide a consistent mathematical demonstration of the minimum, maximum, and saddle conditions of the potentials. We present here a detailed approach on aspects related to the curvature of the thermodynamic functions of physical interest with consequences on stability.

Both cooperative interaction and antagonistic interaction between neighbor agents are considered. A novel distributed bipartite compensator with intermittent communication mechanism is first proposed to estimate the leader’s states in finite time. Different from the existing schemes, the proposed compensator is able to achieve intermittent communication between neighbors, is capable of estimating the leader’s states within finite time, and is applicable for the directed signed communication topology. Based on the developed compensator, the distributed state feedback control protocol is designed such that the bipartite output consensus problem can be achieved within finite time. Moreover, the observer-based output feedback control protocol is put forward to address the case that the system states are not available for measurement. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior can be excluded by choosing the appropriate parameters. Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the feasibility of the theoretical results.},

Firstly, by utilizing fractional-order differential inequalities, some innovative sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee complete synchronization for fractional-order multiplex networks in a finite time. The settling time obtained in most articles is independent of the order of fractional-order, however, this paper shows an explicit expression for the settling time in the multiplex networks, which can reveal the relationship between the settling time and the order of fractional-order. Moreover, the issue of finite-time complete synchronization for fractional-order multiplex networks when there are no inter-layer couplings or intra-layer couplings are considered, and it is found that the intra-layer couplings and the inter-layer couplings have great influence on the network synchronization region. Finally, the theoretical results which we derived are attested to be indeed feasible through numerical simulations.},

However, ELM faces a great challenge in the presence of outliers, which can result in the sensitivity and poor robustness. To overcome this dilemma, a non-convex 2-norm loss function is developed to reduce these negative influences by setting a fixed penalty on any potential outliers. A novel robust ELM is proposed in this paper, and the resultant optimization can be implemented by an iterative reweighted algorithm, called IRRELM. In each iteration, IRRELM solves a weighted ELM. Several artificial datasets, real-world datasets and financial time series datasets are employed in numerical experiments, which demonstrate that IRRELM has superior generalization performance and robustness for modeling datasets in the presence of outliers, especially at the higher outlier levels.},

Tikhonov regularization , i.e., replacement of the available ill-conditioned problem by a nearby better conditioned one with a fidelity term and a penalty term, can reduce this sensitivity and is a popular approach to determine meaningful approximate solutions of such problems. The penalty term is determined by a regularization matrix. The choice of this matrix may significantly affect the quality of the computed approximate solution. In order to get an appropriate solution with improved accuracy, the paper constructs a special modified Tikhonov regularization (SMTR) matrix so as to include more useful information. The parameters involved in the presented regularization matrix are discussed. Besides, the corresponding preconditioner PSMTR is designed to accelerate the convergence rate of the CGLS method for solving Tikhonov regularization least-squares system. Furthermore, numerical experiments illustrate that the SMTR method and PSMTR preconditioner significantly outperform the related methods in terms of solution accuracy.},

Moreover, we use the multi-scale analysis to derive the amplitude equation, and obtain rich pattern structures by controlling the variation of the delay parameter. As the increase of delay parameter, the degree of pattern isolation increase as well as the density of the infected population decrease which prohibits the propagation of the disease in space.

Making a sequential monotonization, we give recursively defined functions to estimate solutions of the inequality piecewise. In order to use the estimate to study boundedness and asymptotics of solutions for differential equations, we regard the estimating function as a solution of a nonautonomous difference equation, simplify the equation with composition of operators, and reduce our discussion to qualitative analysis of the difference equation so that we give results on monotonicity, boundedness and α -weighted boundedness for solutions of the inequality. As applications, we study boundedness and asymptotics of solutions for two impulsive differential equations.},

However, it is almost impossible to adequately study this problem experimentally and, despite intense efforts in the field, no mathematical description has been obtained so far. Here, we present a mathematical framework based on a graph-theoretical approach that, starting from experimental data obtained from a few small subsets of neurons, can quantitatively explain and predict the corresponding full network properties. This model also changes the paradigm with which large-scale model networks can be built, from using probabilistic/empiric connections or limited data, to a process that can algorithmically generate neuronal networks connected as in the real system .},

Set ρ ( G ) ≔ min { ρ G ( x ): x ∈ A 1 ∪ A 2 } and call it the minimum edge prorating number of G . We call G path two bipancyclic if for every path P of length two in G , and for every integer k ∈ [2, m ], G has a 2 k -cycle passing through P . In this article, it is shown that the minimum edge prorating number condition ρ ( G ) ≥ 1/2 implies that a bipartite graph G is either path two bipancyclic or isomorphic to G 2 n ,4 , where n ≥ 3 and G 2 n ,4 is a 2 n by 4 bipartite graph. As an application, we proved that the minimum edge prorating number condition ρ ( G ) ≥ 1/2 also implies the bipanconnectivity of a bipartite graph G : for every pair u, v of distinct vertices, and for every appropriate integer ℓ ∈ [2, 2 m ], G has a u, v -path of length ℓ. This unifies the known results in Tian and Zang (1989) and Du et al. (2018). Examples show that the minimum edge prorating number condition ρ ( G ) ≥ 1/2 in both of our results are sharp.},

The numerical method consists of a finite element method together with a mass lumping technique and an extra stabilizing term plus a semi–implicit Euler time integration. Then we carry out a rigorous passage to the limit as the spatial and temporal discretization parameters tend to zero, and show that the sequence of finite element approximations converges toward the unique weak solution of the model at hands. In doing so, nonnegativity is attained due to the stabilizing term and the acuteness on partitions of the computational domain, and hence a priori energy estimates of finite element approximations are established. As we deal with a nonlinear problem, some form of strong convergence is required. The key compactness result is obtained via an adaptation of a Riesz–Fréchet–Kolmogorov criterion by perturbation.

Second, a linearized backward Euler scheme is established and a time-discrete system is introduced to split the error into two parts, the temporal error and the spatial error. By using a rigorous analysis for the regularity of the time-discrete system and the proved characters of E Q 1 r o t EQ1rot element, the optimal L 2 -error estimate is obtained without any time-step restrictions, which leads to the numerical solution can be bounded in L ∞ -norm by an inverse inequality unconditionally. Then, the supercloseness estimate is arrived at with the above achievements. Third, global superconvergence results are deduced through interpolated postprocessing technique. At last, numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis. Here, h is the subdivision parameter, and τ is the time step.},

Firstly, a distributed fixed-time observer (DFTO) for the directed graph is introduced, such that the leader’s information can be accurately obtained by each agent within a bounded time. Secondly, by using fixed-time technique, a Lyapunov-function-based design process has been schemed to avoid the singularity problem. The developed TVFTC protocols can ensure all the followers achieve the desired time-varying formation and track the leader simultaneously. Furthermore, according to practical requirements, the configuration of formation can be chosen as arbitrary shape and the corresponding convergence time is allowed to be pre-estimated or preset. Stability analysis and some simulation examples for the control strategy are given, which further verify the validity.},

External disturbances are also considered. First, a novel descriptor sliding mode observer (SMO) is investigated to establish the error dynamics. Compared with the existing results, the proposed observer could be utilized to more cases and applied to a wider scope. Next, in light of the online FE information, a fault tolerant controller is suggested to make the closed-loop system mean-square exponentially stable. Furthermore, a novel piecewise fuzzy Lyapunov function is depicted and then the delay dependent sufficient conditions can be got by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The designed SMO has less conservatism than the existing ones. The reachability of the sliding mode surface in the estimation error space is assured under the adopted method.

  abstract     = {We study the impact of climate change induced migration on the evolution of cooperation using an N -player social dilemma game. Players in the population are divided into non-overlapped groups, and they can choose to either cooperate or defect within their group. At the same time, the players are mapped to the nodes of a scale-free network, enabling them to learn from the actions of players from other groups. Every player is allowed to migrate between groups, and their migration decisions are governed by the risk from climate change at the current group, as well as their ability to adapt. We introduce a cooperation threshold to ensure that a minimum percentage of players cooperate before any benefit can be achieved within a group. Comprehensive simulation experiments show that migration has a positive impact on the level of cooperation, and the cooperative behaviour observed is proportional to the threshold level. This study contributes by being one of the first to study climate change induced migration using evolutionary game theory. Our findings also contribute to the understanding of the impact of cooperation thresholds in promoting cooperative behaviour in multi-player social dilemma games, where players are allowed to migrate.},

Since it is difficult to estimate the settling-time due to the uncertain intermittent intervals, a novel lemma is established. Then, two quantized intermittent controllers without chattering are designed, which can reduce the control cost and save channel resources. T-S fuzzy method is utilized to deal with the nonlinear coupling strength. By using Lyapunov direct method, sufficient conditions formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived to ensure that the considered system can realize finite-time synchronization. Moreover, the control gains are designed. Two numerical simulations are given to show the merits of theoretical analysis.},

In contrast to a single sequence generated by DSBM, the MDSBM generates three related iteration sequences. One is used to build the cutting-planes model of the objective function, another is served as the stability centers, and the third is the sequence of solutions to our new doubly stabilized subproblems. In addition, we present a new descent test criterion, aiming to take advantage of the multi-step scheme. We establish global convergence of the proposed method, and finally present some promising numerical results.},

In order to design a strong S-Box construction algorithm, and eliminate fixed point and reverse fixed point intelligently, we first designed an improved coupling quadratic map (ICQM), which is surjective and has good ergodicity and randomness, verified by bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponent and strict randomness testing tool of TestU01. Then we reconstructed a keyed strong S-Box scheme without weakness based on ICQM and backtracking. Experiments results indicated the effectiveness of the proposed S-Box construction scheme.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the number of deaths and injuries due to drunk driving (also referred to as drink driving, driving while intoxicated, and driving under the influence of alcohol in the literature), many countries have deployed public safety resources to inspect traffic network. However, challenges remain in allocating limited public safety resources to the significantly large traffic networks. In this paper, we propose an optimal public safety resource allocation scheme to inspect drunk driving. To highlight the utilization of limited public safety resources, first, we model the issue of drunk driving as a defender-attacker Stackelberg game. In the game, the law enforcement agency (the defender) allocates public safety resources in a traffic network to arrest drunk drivers (the attackers), and the attacker seeks to choose a feasible route given the defender&#39;s strategy to maximize the escape probability. Second, we develop an effective approach to compute the optimal defender strategy based on a double oracle framework. Third, we analyze the complexity of the defender oracle problem. Then, we conduct simulations on directed graphs, which are abstracted from the city traffic network in Dalian, China, to demonstrate that our scheme achieves a robust solution and higher utility, and is capable of scaling up to handle realistic-sized drunk-driving problems.},

It automatically represents the ordinary integral over an arbitrary polyhedron as the algebraic sum of integrals over the oriented simplexes. An existing recursive formula for the integration of monomials over simplex, which was deduced based on special operations of matrices and was presented by the first author of this paper, has significant advantages: not only the computation amount is small, but also the integrals of all the lower order monomials are obtained while computing the integral of the highest order monomial. The extension to a polynomial can be obtained by the linearity of integrals. In this paper, the derivation of the existing recursive formula is detailed. A new recursive formula is emphatically proposed to simplify the existing recursive formula and further increase the speed of computation. The code for computer implementation is also presented. Examples show that the accuracy and efficiency of the recursive formula are higher than numerical integration.},

The new preconditioner is established by adopting matrix preconditioning strategy and relaxation technique for the PSS one derived by Pan et al. (2006). Compared with the PSS one, the PVPSS preconditioner is much closer to the coefficient matrix and easier to be implemented if proper preconditioning matrices are adopted. We prove the convergence of the PVPSS iteration method under some restrictions and discuss the spectral properties of the PVPSS preconditioned matrix. Meanwhile, the implementation and a practical way to choose the parameter of the PVPSS preconditioner are discussed. Comparisons between the PVPSS preconditioner and some existing ones are also given. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate that the proposed preconditioner is effective for the generalized saddle point problems and outperforms several other commonly used ones.},

In this paper, a new mixture model based on the novel class of generalized Birnbaum–Saunders distributions is proposed to enhance strength and flexibility in modeling heterogeneous lifetime data. Some characteristics and properties of this mixture model are outlined. By presenting a convenient hierarchical representation, a mathematically elegant and computationally tractable EM-type algorithm is adopted for computing maximum likelihood estimates . Theoretical formulae of well-known risk measures referring to the class of generalized Birnbaum–Saunders distributions are derived. Finally, the utility of the postulated methodology is illustrated with some real-world data examples.},

The dispersal of pathogen spores was modelled using a non-local diffusion equation which took into account variations in wind velocity components and contained a threshold in the convolution kernel defining the non-local diffusion term. The model was analyzed and the epidemic levels and patterns of the plant disease were derived, based upon defined assumptions of the time and space variables (i.e., represented by continuous parameters), and the host population (i.e., fixed population size). Numerical applications were then performed using reported characteristic values for wheat leaf rust, stripe rust and stem rust.},

The scheme is shown to be ε-uniformly convergent of order one in time direction and order two in spatial direction upto a logarithmic factor. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results.

Compatibility of the differential system with thermodynamics is proved. The same model is used to understand the origins of tornadoes and their behavior; and also the birth of the vortices resulting from the fall of water in a vertical tube. Finally, we demonstrate how the weak Coriolis force is able to change the rotation direction of the vortices by modifying the minima of the Ginzburg–Landau equation.

The advantage with these local smoothness indicators is that, each derivative involved in these are of higher order accurate as compared to the smoothness indicators developed by Liu et al. [SIAM, J.

Experiment results show that the ODE models obtain similar prediction results as the typical statistical model, and the prediction results from this method are relatively good.

  abstract     = {Shallow water equations are a nonlinear system of hyperbolic conservation laws. This system admits discontinuous solutions . In addition, a discontinuous bathymetry can lead to the discontinuous solutions. The accuracy of numerical methods depends on the accuracy of the numerical solutions around these discontinuities. In order to increase the accuracy, the adaptive mesh methods are more cost-effective than the methods based on the global refinement, In terms of computational cost. Moving mesh method is an adaptive mesh method. In this method, an increase of the number of mesh points is not needed for increasing the accuracy and efficiency of numerical solutions. Highly accurate solutions only can be obtained by concentrating points in areas where more accuracy is needed and decreasing the number of points in smooth areas. In this paper, LeVeque wave propagation algorithm is improved by the moving mesh method, for shallow water equations with variable bathymetry. Moreover, augmented Riemann solver is used for solving Riemann problems in each time step. Finally, moving mesh version of wave propagation algorithm based on augmented Riemann solver is proposed. The numerical solutions based on the moving mesh method and fixed mesh method have a significant difference and application of a moving mesh method yields highly accurate solutions around shocks and discontinuities.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a convex model for single image dehazing via a sparse dark channel prior. Our work is based on an observation that the number of bright pixels is very small in the dark channel of a haze-free image, but significantly increases in that of a hazy image due to the existence of bright atmosphere light. Since the dehazing problem is inherently ambiguous, we first reformulate the degradation model of hazy images into an equivalent form where the transmission and the image variable are decoupled. With the above formulation and observation, we propose the convex model to recover the haze-free image whose dark channel is assumed to be sparse. The proposed objective function consists of four terms: a data-fitting term, an l 1 regularization term for the dark channel of the haze-free image, and two total variation regularization terms for both the haze-free image and the transmission map. We develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to tackle the proposed convex model. Extensive experiments on real hazy images illustrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

The main purpose of this paper is to consider Riemannian cubics in quadratic matrix Lie groups with left-invariant metrics. Results for Riemannian cubics in quadratic matrix Lie groups extend those in SO ( n ) since the group SO ( n ) with bi-invariant metric is a very special case. By examining Riemannian cubics in SO (2, 1) and SO (3, 1), we find that the so-called null Lie quadratics in so ( p , q ) so(p,q) ( p &gt; 0, q &gt; 0), and even more generally for any quadratic matrix Lie group, can be given in closed forms in terms of Lie quadratics in so ( p ) so(p) and so ( q ) so(q) .

  abstract     = {How cooperation arouses and maintains in social dilemmas has long been the core problem in evolutionary biology. Assortative interaction has been identified as a fundamental mechanism for cooperation in the social dilemma games. Many studies have shown that spatial limitation can lead to cooperation evolution, but how spatial pattern shape the cooperation is studied rarely. In this paper, using a spatial model of eco-evolutionary prisoner&#39;s dilemma game, where the player&#39;s diffusion is incorporated definitely, we show that the diffusion can trigger out rich spatial patterns. These self-organized spatial patterns could profoundly affect the cooperation level and system stability. Totally, six types of patterns can be identified according to their influences on cooperation evolution. Cooperation is affected by the spatial configuration of population distributions: spot- or stripe- type pattern promotes the cooperation, but mixed form of them or spatial synchrony suppresses cooperation. In contrast, uniform pattern has no effect on cooperation. Meanwhile, the analysis of spatial autocorrelation about population distributions via local Moran index reveals that the difference of spatial correlations among adjacent sites may be responsible for the functional differentiation of such self-organized structures. Spatial diffusion arouses vastly different spatial patterns, which renders the spatial extension system greatly expands the survival region of cooperators, i.e., the game dynamics continues after the homogeneous system has collapsed. Those results are helpful to understand the function of spatial patterns in supporting cooperation and fostering behavioral diversity.},

  abstract     = {The disk packing problem (DPP) is to find an arrangement of circular disks within the smallest possible container without any overlap. We discuss a DPP for polysized disks in a circular container. DPP is known NP-hard and reported algorithms are slow for finding good solutions even with the problem instances of small to moderate sizes. Here we introduce a heuristic algorithm which finds sufficiently good solutions in realtime for small to moderate-sized problem instances and in pseudo-realtime for large problem instances. The proposed algorithm, VOROPACK-D, takes advantage of the spatial reasoning property of Voronoi diagram and finds an approximate solution of DPP in O ( n log n ) time with O ( n ) memory by making incremental placement of n disks in the order of non-increasing disk size, thus called a big-disk-first method. The location of a placement is determined using the Voronoi diagram of already-placed disks. If needed, we further enhance a big-disk-first realtime packing solution using the Shrink-and-Shake algorithm by taking an additional O ( Mn 2 ) time for each shrinkage where M ≪ n is the number of protruding disks for each shrinkage. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is faster than other reported ones by several orders of magnitude, particularly for large problem instances. Theoretical observations are verified and validated by a thorough experiment. This study suggests that Voronoi diagram might be useful for solving other hard optimization problems related with empty spaces.

Then, finite-time boundedness (FTBs) is well implemented by partitioning strategy and sufficient conditions are given to realize FTBs for the augment system with H ∞ performance.

This class is composed of a master system of ordinary differential equations coupled with a slave system of diffusion equations. It can model two populations, the second one being diffusive contrary to the first one. The identifiability method is based on an elimination procedure providing relations called input-output polynomials and linking the unknown parameters, the inputs and the outputs of the model. These polynomials can also be used to estimate the parameters as shown in this article. To our best knowledge, such an identifiability method and a parameter estimation procedure have not yet been explored for such a system in the L 2 framework.

The multi-agent systems discussed in this paper are essentially heterogeneous, and each follower is modeled by a integrator with the external disturbance . A containment error also has been expressed to ensure all the outputs of followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the outputs of the leaders. For the case that the undirected communication graph among followers is connected, a distributed containment compensator is designed based on the local state information of neighboring agents. Furthermore, a distributed output feedback controller is designed to solve the event-triggered containment control problem of the continuous-time multi-agent systems. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the main results.},

The analysis shows that potential optima may be found at the end of a sequence of easily-initialized separate stages of continuation, without the need to seed the first stage of continuation with nonzero values for the corresponding Lagrange multipliers . A key enabler of the proposed generalization is the use of complementarity functions to define relaxed complementary conditions, followed by the use of continuation to arrive at the limit required by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory. As a result, a successful search for optima is found to be possible also from an infeasible initial solution guess. The discussion shows that the proposed paradigm is compatible with the staged construction approach of the coco software package. This is evidenced by a modified form of the coco core used to produce the numerical results reported here. These illustrate the efficacy of the continuation approach in locating optimal solutions of an objective function along families of two-point boundary value problems and in optimal control problems .},

Our modelling framework is informed by recent studies which have demonstrated that tryptophan and some of its biosynthetic analogues are able to both reverse and inhibit IFN- γ -induced chlamydial persistence. Our aim is to find the optimal combination of treatments/drugs that will minimise the systemic cost of two controls/treatments, the concentration of extracellular Chlamydia , infected epithelial host cells, and importantly the development of chlamydial persistence. Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is used to characterise the optimal controls and the resulting optimal control system is numerically solved. Optimal control solutions that eradicate the pathogen and its persistence are demonstrated. Our numerical results indicate that the optimal way to clear and truncate the progression of a chronic Chlamydia infection may be the administration of a combination therapy that is bacteriostatic to chlamydial particles and that concurrently inhibits and reverses chlamydial persistence, using a cocktail of tryptophan supplementation and levo-1-methyl tryptophan. Our approach provides a framework for the design of new therapeutic regimens and guidelines for the treatment of chronic chlamydial infections.},

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {Determining the Turán density of a hypergraph is a central and challenging question in extremal combinatorics. We know very few about the Turán densities of hypergraphs. Even the conjecture given by Turán on the Turán density of K 4 3 , K43, the smallest complete hypergraph remains open. It turns out that the hypergraph Lagrangian method, a continuous optimization method has been helpful in hypergraph extremal problems. In this paper, we intend to explore this method further, and try to understand the Turán densities of hypergraphs via Lagrangian densities . Given an integer n and an r -uniform graph H , the Turán number of H , denoted by ex ( n, H ), is the maximum number of edges in an n -vertex r -uniform graph without containing a copy of H . The Turán density of H , denoted by π ( H ), is the limit of the function e x ( n , H ) ( n r ) ex(n,H)(nr) as n → ∞. The Lagrangian density of H is π λ ( H ) = sup { r ! λ ( F ) : H i s n o t c o n t a i n e d i n F } , πλ(H)=sup{r!λ(F):HisnotcontainedinF}, where λ ( F ) is the Lagrangian of F . For any r -uniform graph H , Sidorenko showed that π λ ( H ) equals the Turán density of the extension of H . So researching on Lagrangian densities of hypergraphs is helpful to better understand the behavior of the Turán densities of hypergraphs. For a t -vertex r -uniform graph H , π λ ( H ) ≥ r ! λ ( K t − 1 r ) πλ(H)≥r!λ(Kt−1r) since K t − 1 r Kt−1r doesn’t contain H , where K t − 1 r Kt−1r is the ( t − 1 ) (t−1) -vertex complete r -uniform graph. We say that H is λ -perfect if the equality holds, i.e., π λ ( H ) = r ! λ ( K t − 1 r ) πλ(H)=r!λ(Kt−1r) . A result given by Motzkin and Straus shows that every graph is λ -perfect. It is natural and fundamental to explore which hypergraphs are λ -perfect. Sidorenko (1989) showed that the ( r − 2 ) (r−2) -fold enlargement of a tree satisfying the Erdős-Sós conjecture with order at least A r is λ -perfect, where A r is the last maximum of the function g r ( x ) = ( r + x − 3 ) − r ∏ i = 1 r − 1 ( i + x − 2 ) gr(x)=(r+x−3)−r∏i=1r−1(i+x−2) as x ≥ 2. By using the so-called generalised Lagrangian of hypergraphs, Jenssen (2017) showed that the ( r − 2 ) (r−2) -fold enlargement of M 2 2 M22 for r = 5 , 6 r=5,6 or 7 is λ -perfect, where M s r Msr is the r -uniform matching of size s . The result given by Sidorenko (1989) implies that the ( r − 2 ) (r−2) -fold enlargement of M t 2 Mt2 for r = 5 r=5 and t ≥ 4, or r = 6 r=6 and t ≥ 6, or r = 7 r=7 and t ≥ 8 is λ -perfect. So there are still some gaps between the results of Jenssen and Sidorenko. In this paper we fill the gaps for r = 5 r=5 or 6. We also determine the Lagrangian densities for the ( r − 3 ) (r−3) -fold enlargement of M t 3 Mt3 for r = 5 r=5 or 6.},

By using of coupled lattices , the effect of the cooperative behaviors of the system is comprehensively studies. Besides, in real life, resources are always related to the outcome of game. The results in game generally determine the allocation of limited resources, which in turn affects the choice of strategy. Hence, limited resources as a co-evolutionary factor are also introduced into the game model, which mutual interacts with individual&#39;s strategy and influence. Based on multi-game model, the evolutionary dynamics of the model in detail is discussed. We find that the preferential selection mechanism based on influence can effectively improve the cooperative behaviors of the system, where the influence growth factor increases and the cooperation evolution also monotonously increases. Furthermore, the interdependent strength, sucker&#39;s payoff and the distribution of limited resources would have different effects on the dynamics of the system.},

The threshold values for the stability of the equilibrium point belonging to non-infected case are calculated for both models with and without treatment. For the numerical solutions of the studied model, we construct trapezoidal approximation schemes having second order accuracy for the approximation of fractional operators with singular and non-singular kernel. The stability and convergence of the proposed schemes are analyzed analytically. To illustrate the dynamics given by these two fractional operators, we perform numerical simulations of the HIV model for different biological scenarios with and without drug concentration. The studied biological cases are identified by considering different values of the parameters such as infection rate, growth rate of CD4 + + T cells, clearance rate of virus particles and also the order of the fractional derivative.},

It is called as the double cosine similarity consistency index (DCSCI) since the row and column vectors are all considered. Some interesting properties of DCSCI are investigated and the thresholds for inconsistency tolerance level are discussed in detail. Then following the idea of DCSCI, we provide a new method for obtaining the priority vector from a PCM. Through maximizing the sum of the cosine similarity measures between the priority vector and the row/column vectors, the priority vector is derived by solving the constructed optimization problem. By analyzing the proposed double cosine similarity maximization (DCSM) method, it is found that the existing cosine maximization (CM) method can be retrieved.

  abstract     = {With the intensification of time-based competition, the importance of reducing lead-time by rapidly delivering multi-orders has been underscored in the process of replenishment-storage-transportation. This perception has prompted enterprises to increase expenditure on purchasing modern time-tracing technologies (e.g. RFID), and equipping facilities for item fast movement (e.g. high-rack automatic shelves) to retain customers. In this study, we explore a novel extension of the multi-item joint replenishment problem ( JRP ) with lead-time compressing initiatives. By assuming controllable lead-time, we construct a stochastic periodic-review joint replenishment and delivery ( JRD ) model to investigate impacts of capital investment in lead-time reduction to the decisions of multi-item joint replenishment and delivery. To solve the proposed JRD , two heuristics and a differential evolutionary algorithm are presented based on the model property analyses. The experimental results reveal the performance differences (e.g., searching speed, robustness and searching effectiveness) of three algorithms. Furthermore, our findings have managerial implications that proper investment in lead-time reduction not only helps shorten replenishment time and cut major ordering cost, but can also reduce the system cost.},

The S-K algorithm has been implemented with three different families of kernels: central B-splines, Jackson type and Bochner–Riesz. The above method is compared, in term of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and CPU time, with the bilinear and bicubic interpolation, the quasi FIR (Finite Impulse Response) and quasi IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) approximation. Experimental results show better performance of S-K algorithm than the considered other ones.},

Motivated by the limited transmission resources and feasibility of engineering realization, we consider the situation where the outputs of sensor and controller are transmitted asynchronously based on two independent dynamic event-triggering strategies, which can generate fewer numbers of triggering compared with the static one and make more sense for engineering implementation in the asynchronous form. Zeno phenomenon can be efficiently eliminated due to the compulsive dwell time under our proposed triggering conditions. Moreover, the emulation-based approach and co-design approach for the controller and triggering condition are separately presented, both of which can achieve local L 2 L2 stability and asymptotic stability for sensor saturated systems with/without external disturbance. Finally, an example of F-8 aircraft is employed to testify the validity of the proposed method.},

By employing a two-sided looped-functional approach, some improved conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the system under consideration.

From the illustrative example being solved by the proposed approach, it is observed that the results obtained are significantly better than those obtained by existing methods. More importantly, from the simulation being carried out, it is discovered that, contrary to the findings in previous studies, time-delays in a system may enlarge the interval of sampled-data periods and accelerate the rate of convergence of the system states, rather than deteriorate the system performance.},

Next, a set of co-design methods are presented, namely, the construction of switching laws, event-triggered scheme and the choice of controller parameters are jointly discussed. Furthermore, the stability conditions are achieved in terms of global E-uniform boundedness providing that the average dwell time is satisfied for considered systems.

For generating interpolating basis functions (IBF), we used Lagrangian interpolating polynomial and for orthonormal Lagrangian basis functions (OLBF), we used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm, respectively. Firstly, we introduced the function approximation by using generated IBF and OLBF, then established the error bounds of these approximations. The constructed approximations by both the schemes convert the AIEs and SIDEs into the system of algebraic equations . We have also established error bounds, stability and convergence analysis of the proposed schemes by considering several mild mathematical conditions. Moreover, the stability of schemes is also established numerically. Finally, the test functions with the support of graphs clearly show the reliability and computational efficiency of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {A variety of nonlinear electric devices are suitable for building chaotic circuits by setting appropriate values for parameters in the linear and nonlinear electronic components. The capacitor and induction coil can contain time-varying physical field energy when the time-varying current passed across these devices. When the outputs end of two chaotic circuits are connected via certain coupling devices, energy flow can be propagated bidirectionally and complete synchronization is reached when the energy pumping from the outputs end is balanced. In this paper, a nonreversing diode is connected into the coupling channel to adjust the energy flow via the coupling components (resistor, capacitor, induction coil), which connects the outputs end of two Chua circuits (in chaotic or periodical states). According to Helmholtz’ theorem, the Hamilton energy of the dimensionless chaotic systems under unidirectional coupling is calculated. When the two coupled Chua systems are selected with different initial values , they contain different initial field energies because the Hamilton energy is dependent on the variables of this system completely. When energy flow is propagated and pumped along the coupling channel, synchronization can be realized. Otherwise, synchronization approach is blocked even the coupling intensity is increased greatly. In this work, a single coupling channel connecting a nonreversing diode and resistor (capacitor, induction coil, respectively) in series is built to explore synchronization approach. The results show that the synchronization realization is dependent on the coupling devices and circuit verification is also supplied. It gives important clues to understand the synchronization mechanism in a forward neural network .},

  abstract     = {Recurrent malaria constitutes one of the greatest setbacks to the realization of malaria disease elimination from the population. In this paper, a deterministic model governed by a system of nonlinear differential equations is developed to assess the effects of recurrent malaria – reinfection and relapse on the transmission dynamics of the disease. The model is distributed into autonomous and non-autonomous systems. Analysis of the autonomous model shows that reinfection, which is the recurrence of malaria symptoms due to new parasites infection , has the potential to trigger the existence of two endemic equilibrium points when the basic reproduction number is below unity. Consequently without reinfection, global asymptotic dynamics of the autonomous model is established in the presence of relapse with the aid of carefully constructed Lyapunov functions for both the disease-free and endemic equilibria. The non-autonomous model with time-dependent control strategies is analyzed using Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle to find the optimal solutions to the malaria control problem. Cost-effectiveness analysis is conducted to buttress the results of the optimal control problem by using the average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) methods. Finally, numerical simulations are demonstrated to enhance the theoretical results.},

As far as we know, this is the first time in the literature that this theoretical result is achieved for these global connections. The existence and uniqueness of the perturbed solution obtained are proved. To illustrate the effectiveness of the method we study cuspidal loops in two normal forms of degenerate Takens–Bogdanov bifurcations.

The first one is a new Transition Probability Density Function (TPDF) approximation which considers the randomness of the impulse happening time during each time intervals . The second one is a transformation of Chapman–Kolmogorov (CK) equation by a variable substitution instead of directly using it, whose numerical calculation is based on the back stepping Runge–Kutta scheme and the triangulation-based interpolation. Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) are utilized to measure the accuracy of the improved algorithm with three illustrative nonlinear systems . The results show that compared with the traditional PI method, the improved PI method can give a more accurate description of the TPDF values, and provide more precise stationary Probability Density Function (PDF) results whenever the mean arrival rate is large or small. The improved algorithm has a wider range of choices in time interval values to maintain the accuracy of stationary PDF results. Besides, it is discovered that cubic interpolation deserves to be applied in the improved PI method more than linear and natural interpolations.},

In this paper, we illustrate the difference between the theoretical and simulation results obtained from a gambling situation involving a finite number of bidding steps T ( = W + L ), where W and L respectively denote the numbers of wins and losses. The optimal bidding fraction based on the Kelly criterion should employ the win\loss proportion W/T rather than the win rate p ; however, it is not possible to obtain the value of a priori. W . Thus, profits under the Kelly formula are calculated by applying win rate p and the win\lose proportion W/T . In this paper, we denote p t as the current win\lose proportion before time step t as an alternative to win rate p . The proposed approach does away with the need to apply win rate p and produces profits that are nearly optimal under Kelly betting.},

A nine degree of freedom (DOF) type polynomial based higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) is considered for the finite element discretization of the plate. The application of non-uniform harmonic in-plane edge load causes the in-plane stress variation to be non-uniform. Hence, the in-plane stresses need to be evaluated, prior to the instability analysis, for the evaluation of critical buckling load . These in-plane stresses are computed using in-plane stress analysis approach using finite element method. The differential equations of motion of the system are turned into a set of ordinary differential equations (Mathieu type equations) and solved as a general eigenvalue problem as per the procedure suggested by Bolotin. The accuracy and flexibility of the present model are validated by contrasting the present outcomes and the available solution.

A reliable information system helps people smoothly and efficiently deal with their daily-life affairs. An information system usually consists of connected software and hardware components, and can be modeled by connected graphs. In network theory, such graphs are called multistate information networks. Therefore, the reliability of an information system can be evaluated by network theory, namely network reliability. The most popular approach to evaluate network reliability is the three-stage-approach (TSA), which involves (a) finding all minimal paths (MPs), (b) finding all d -system vectors ( d -SVs), and (c) calculating the union probability of d -SVs for reliability. Approaches for creating all MPs has been reported. There is a need for a more efficient approach to generate all d -SVs for such calculation. In this article, an approach based on permutation-and-backtrack facility is proposed to generate all such d -SVs. The efficiency of this approach is generally accepted to be superior to the existing approaches. The proposed approach provides us an efficient, and simple way to speed up TSA as a more powerful tool for evaluating the reliability of multistate information networks.},

First, a new lemma is established to estimate the Caputo fractional derivative for quaternion self-conjugate quadratic Lyapunov function, and a novel quaternion-valued linear feedback controller is designed. Then by utilizing quaternion matrix theory and our proposed lemma, some succinct GMLS criteria are derived respectively in quaternion-valued linear matrix inequality (LMI) form and complex-valued LMI form, which simplify and extend some previous work on the synchronization control for quaternion-value neural networks. Finally, a numerical example is given to validate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this work we derive an exact formula to calculate the Expected Shortfall (ES) value for the one-factor delta-gamma approach which, to the best of our knowledge, was still missing in the literature. We then use the one-factor delta-gamma as a control variate to estimate the ES of the multi-factor delta-gamma approach. A one-factor delta-gamma approximation is used for each risk factor appearing in the problem. Since the expected values of control variates are computed by means of an exact formula, the additional effort of computation with respect to the naive estimator of the multi-factor delta-gamma can be neglected. With this method, we achieve a considerable reduction of the variance. We have established a theorem to prove that the variance is further reduced when we use all the risk factors instead of just some of them. We show that one of the main potential applications takes place in the insurance industry regulation within the Swiss solvency test framework. We perform a model risk analysis and illustrate these results with numerical experiments.},

The randomly occurring uncertainties are assumed to satisfy Bernoulli distribution and the considered stochastic variables are mutually independent. Multiple communication channel scenario is taken into account to enhance the data transmission performance and the channel switching phenomena is governed by a Markov chain . The intention here is to design a dissipative-based non-fragile filter for the filtering error system such that it is stochastically finite-time bounded and attains a prescribed dissipative performance attenuation level. Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality approach are exploited to develop a set of sufficient criterion for the existence of the desired filter.

At the porous-fluid interface, the conservation equations of mass, energy, turbulent kinetic energy , specific dissipation rate and isentropic condition are solved to balance the flux through the interface. The stress jump condition and turbulence wall function are also employed for the treatment of the permeable wall. For the Beavers and Joseph’s problem, the current results show good agreement with previous Direct Numerical Simulation results for a Reynolds number of 5500.

Therefore, we introduce a real monodromy structure which need not be a group but contains tiered characteristics about the real solutions over the parameter space. An algorithm is provided to compute the real monodromy structure.

  abstract     = {The uncertain coalition structure game with payoff of belief structure ( UCS game) is studied based on belief structures of D–S theory. This type of UCS games gives us the uncertainty by assigning the probability to the set composed of multiple risk situations. For the solution of UCS game, this UCS game is transferred into an interval-valued coalition structure game by the two-step method. As the value for the interval-valued UCS game, the uncertain Owen value is axiomatically characterized by Hukuhara difference. Because the uncertain Owen value does not exist, the α-risk Owen value is proposed for the general UCS games. The α -risk Owen value adopts a risk coefficient α to represent the risk tolerance of players, which is more realistic than the uncertain Owen value. Also, the payoff value of UCS game is decreasing with the increasing of risk coefficient α , and the allocation value for the UCS game is also decreasing with the increasing of risk coefficient α . The players can choose their allocation scheme according to their risk tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Obstetric fistula is among the most severe maternal morbidities . It is caused directly by obstructed labour, and indirectly by social, political, and economic factors. Effects of obstetric fistula include chronic urinary incontinence . Urinary incontinence often leads to isolation and death if left untreated. Death of women during childbirth is detrimental to both social economic transformation and shift of poor economies to middle income status. In this study, we estimate the burden of obstetric fistula on Ugandan women, and the effect of educating these women on its causes. We hypothesise that symptomatic women seek treatment after interactions with a treated woman. We consider one cycle of fistula and seek to determine how many women will eventually seek treatment, when one woman is treated in a population. We further assume that each treated woman becomes the educational resource for more symptomatic women. We then invest in getting women into treatment, providing treatment, or educating them about prevention and treatment of obstetric fistula. Results show that for each investment strategy, there exists a unique maximal solution that remains bounded. It is also shown from the model that high investment rates leads to high treatments rates. However, the highest treatment output is obtained when the level of investment is 44.9%. We also see from the results that for every one woman treated, 17 more seek treatment. However, as investment increases, the number of women that are eventually treated reduces due to lack of further investment into treatment and therefore no more women to treat. Results also show that educating women reduced fistula prevalence although the magnitude of reduction depended on the level of education coverage. These results show that an optimal strategy to reduce fistula prevalence would require achieving a balance between the two desirable but incompatible health outcomes. This will help maximise the total return or effectiveness under given circumstances such as continued women that develop fistula due to lack of skilled healthcare or lifetime incontinence due to lack of treatment. From this study we conclude that improving access to quality health education will contribute to the elimination of obstetric fistula in Uganda .},

  abstract     = {Synchronization in complex networks is an evergreen subject with numerous applications in biological, social, and technological systems. We here study whether a transition from a single variable to multivariable coupling facilitates the emergence of synchronization in a network of circulant oscillators. We show that the network indeed has much better synchronizability when individual dynamical units are coupled through multiple variables rather than through just one. In particular, we consider in detail four different coupling scenarios for a simple three-dimensional chaotic circulant system, and we determine the smallest coupling strength needed for complete synchronization. We find that the smallest coupling strength is needed when the coupling is through all three variables, and that for the same level of synchronization through a single variable a much stronger coupling strength is needed. Our results thus show that multivariable coupling provides a significantly more efficient synchronization profile in complex networks.},

Under the feedback controllers, synchronization conditions of FDTNNs without time delays and with time delays are derived by means of different techniques. Based on the inequality and the comparison principle of linear fractional difference system, the synchronization condition of FDTNNs without time delays is obtained. Further more, the synchronization condition of FDTNNs with time delays is derived through Lyapunov direct method with a suitable Lyapunov function involving discrete fractional sum term, which depends on the definition of Riemann-Liouville fractional difference.

  abstract     = {Social exclusion, as a special form of punishment, can effectively promote cooperation in spatial public goods game (SPGG). Previous research usually assumes that the unit cost of exclusion and the probability of exclusion success are statically fixed. As such, the total cost of an excluder can only be described as a linear function of the number of defectors. However, the scale return effect generally results in nonlinear characteristics of costs. In this study, we have thus relaxed the linear assumption and introduced a state-dependent kind of social exclusion with dynamic costs. Specifically, we describe the unit cost of exclusion as a function of the state of the group in which individuals are located. Due to the scale effect of punishment, an increase in the number of defectors in the group will result in a decrease in the unit cost of exclusion. We explore the impacts of this exclusion-type strategy in the SPGG with nonlinear exclusion cost on the evolution of cooperation. We further investigate parameters such as the cost parameter, the probability of exclusion success and the dilemma strength of the PGG on the evolution of cooperation. Simulations are performed on a square lattice with the traditional neighborhood structure and the Moore neighborhood structure, respectively. The results show that social exclusion with state-dependent costs can promote cooperation within a wide range of parameters in both cases. Especially, when the probability of exclusion success is high, a very strong dilemma strength can lead the system to form huge cooperative clusters to beat defectors. We further confirm that the Moore neighborhood case is more conducive to the evolution of cooperation in our social exclusion mechanism with dynamic cost compared with the traditional neighborhood case. These results allow us to better understand the role of the dynamic cost of punishment in the emergence of prosocial behavior.},

We propose a novel discretization of the source term based on new hydrostatic reconstruction to ensure the well-balanced property on the staggered cell. To evolve the numerical solutions on a single grid and satisfy the well-balanced property, we construct a map between the water surface level and its cell average on the staggered cell.

By utilizing Lagrange’s equations, a rigid-body model of helicopter slung-load system is established. To eliminate the swing and transport the load to target position, a desired trajectory of helicopter is proposed. Thereby, suppress swing and position control problems are transformed to a trajectory tracking control problem. Based on the energy technique, a trajectory tracking control scheme is proposed. Under the constructed control laws, the closed-loop system states can asymptotically converge to system equilibrium points in the presence of external disturbances, meanwhile, input constraints will not be violated. Finally, simulation results illustrate that the developed controllers work well in suppressing swing and positioning control for a rigid-body model of helicopter slung-load system.},

This paper witnesses that an efficient fully spectral operational matrices-based scheme is developed and successfully applied for stable solutions of time-fractional delay differential equations (DDEs). Monomials are introduced in order to proposed the novel operational matrices for fractional-order integration I ν and derivative D ν by means of shifted Gegenbauer polynomials . Some ordinary and partial delay differential equations of fractional-order are considered to show reliability, efficiency and appropriateness of the proposed method. In order to approximate the delay term in DDEs a novel delay operational matrix Θ b a Θba is introduced with the help of shifted Gegenbauer polynomials. The proposed algorithm transform the problem understudy into a system of algebraic equations which are easier to tackle. Analytical solutions of the mentioned problem are effectively obtained, and an inclusive comparative study is reported which reveals that the proposed computational scheme is effective, accurate and well-matched to investigate the solutions of aforementioned problems. Error bound analysis is enclosed in our investigation to reveal the consistency and support the mathematical formulation of the algorithm.

The first systematic study of the avoidance of mesh patterns was conducted by Hilmarsson et al., while the first systematic study of the distribution of mesh patterns was conducted by the first two authors. In this paper, we provide far-reaching generalizations for 8 known distribution results and 5 known avoidance results related to mesh patterns by giving distribution or avoidance formulas for certain infinite families of mesh patterns in terms of distribution or avoidance formulas for smaller patterns. Moreover, as a corollary to a general result, we find the distribution of one more mesh pattern of length 2.},

For the system, a sufficient and necessary positivity condition is firstly developed by using the singular value decomposition technique. Then, a sufficient condition of exponential stability, which makes the considered system exponentially stable, is proposed on the basis of co-positive Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and average dwell time techniques, and the obtained exponential decay rate can be adjusted in the light of various actual situations. Furthermore, the article analyzes the disturbance attenuation performance referring to both L 1 -gain and L ∞ -gain, and through the convex optimization approach, the optimal L 1 -gain and L ∞ -gain performance level could be established, respectively. Three examples are finally presented to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the obtained results.},

By exploiting the nonlocal self-similarity of natural images, we consider a group of similar patches as an approximate low-rank matrix, and formulate the denoising of each group as a low-rank matrix recovery problem. Meanwhile, we develop the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm to solve the proposed nonconvex model with guaranteed convergence. Experiments illustrate that our method has superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both visual and quantitative measures.},

Based on the estimation of marginal profit, we construct a competitive model of two enterprises with adjustment mechanism, in order to describe the evolution of production. Furthermore, we discuss the competitive outcome under two different circumstances. When these two companies co-exist in a same industry market, the adjustment mechanism is conductive to reducing the gap between them both in output and profit. As a result, that difference can be eliminated in a specific condition, which means that two firms reach the state of Nash equilibrium . However, when one enterprise is dislodged from the market and the other takes full control, the bankrupt one can either pile into the market or lose it all the same in terms of the adjustment mechanism. Numerical simulations are also presented to verify our results.},

First, to explore the impact of uncertain probability intensities, a mathematical analysis is accomplished, from which some useful inequality conditions on the sum of transition rates (TRs) are obtained. Further, to come up with more accurate bounds of TRs, the mode-transition-dependent probability distribution of sojourn time is imposed on the mechanism of forming TRs. Lastly, by devising a compatible relaxation process that can embrace all the conditions found in our derivation, the resultant observer-based stabilization conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities.},

This paper studies the impact of heterogeneous investments on cooperative behavior in public goods game, where players adopting exclusion strategy can exclude defectors from the group. Our research shows that the heterogeneous investment mechanism can significantly promote cooperation. When the cost of exclusion is low, the excluders can obtain higher payoff than other players, which leads that cooperators and excluders coexist and dominate the population. As the cost of exclusion increases, the advantage of excluders weakens and population keeps high cooperation level in some regions of contribution rate ω . For low or middle values of r , the too small or relatively large values of ω will be not beneficial to the evolution of cooperation. For high values of r , a small increase in ω will be beneficial to the evolution of cooperation. This paper provides a new understanding of cooperation under heterogeneous investment mechanism.},

The stability of different mechanisms on promoting cooperation is thoroughly investigated in this manuscript. Numerical simulations are conducted while corresponding results are presented with sufficient clarifications. We find that the strategy learning mechanism can promote cooperation steadily. However, with the variance in the proportion of the two update rules in the investigated community, the strategy teaching mechanism seems to be more sensitive. Moreover, compared with strategy learning mechanism, strategy teaching mechanism plays a more important and apparent role in promoting cooperation. We also find that personal strategy is sensitive to the varying of Loner&#39;s payoff σ, especially when σ is close to 1. We hope our findings will shed some lights on resolving the social dilemmas.},

The numerical results are obtained by employing three different numerical strategies namely: finite difference based method, a Newton multigrid method and a nonlinear multigrid full approximation storage (FAS). We are able to handle the difficulty of unstable convergence behaviour by using MINRES method as a relaxation smoother in multigrid approach with an appropriate sinusoidal approximation as an initial guess. A comparison, in terms of convergence, accuracy and efficiency among the three numerical methods demonstrate an improvement for the values of λ ∈ (0, λ c ]. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the proposed numerical methods wherein FAS-MG method is shown to be the most efficient. Further, we present the numerical bifurcation behaviour for two-dimensional Gelfand-Bratu models and find new multiplicity of solutions in the case of a quadratic and cubic approximation of the nonlinear exponential term. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence of the solutions for different values of λ and prove the effectiveness of the nonlinear FAS-MG scheme.},

The practical factors including sensor saturation and measurement missing, which are modeled by mutually independent Bernoulli processes with uncertain probability, are taken into account. Utilizing non-parallel-distributed-compensation (non-PDC) scheme, a switching-type distributed filter based on estimated premise variables is designed to realize the sharing of filtering information and measurement information. A distributed robust filtering method is proposed to analyze the distributed filtering error system (DFES) containing unknown premise variables. Then by constructing a model-dependent fuzzy Lyapunov function , new less conservative sufficient conditions in term of LMIs are obtained to ensure the DFES stochastic finite-time bounded and achieving a modified H ∞ performance index under bounded disturbance . By solving a convex optimization problem , the filter gain parameters and average dwell time of topology switching signal are determined. Finally, a tunnel diode circuit in sensor networks is considered to verify the theoretical findings.},

A new asynchronous dynamic output feedback sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is developed due to the existing non-synchronization phenomenon of jump modes between the plant and the controller. In combination with adaptive control mechanism, the asynchronous adaptive dynamic output feedback SMC law is designed, which has the ability to compensate the effects of actuator faults and parameter uncertainties and ensure the reachability of the sliding surface. Sufficient conditions for the stochastically admissible and strictly dissipative of the closed-loop SMJSs are given, and the design scheme for controller gain matrices are presented.

The method uses appropriate error bounds and is applicable without restrictions on the rank of the matrix. But, it requires that the rank of the matrix is known in advance or computed beforehand. The method computes a sequence of monotonic inclusion interval matrices which contain the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse and converge to it. Successive interval matrices are constructed by using previous approximations generated from the hyperpower iterative method of an arbitrary order and appropriate error bounds of the Moore-Penrose inverse. A convergence theorem of the introduced method is established. Numerical examples involving randomly generated matrices are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The main property of our method is that the successive interval matrices are not defined using principles of interval arithmetic, but using accurately defined error bounds of the Moore-Penrose inverse.},

We find that when the vaccination-dependent basic reproduction number is less than one (ℜ 0  1, the endemic equilibrium is globally attractive. For the case when the disease is endemic, we apply the optimal control theory to the model under the assumption of a resource-constrained environment and we derive optimal coverage strategies. We also perform numerical simulations for the optimal control problem to verify and further support the theoretical results. In limited control resource cases with both constant and variable coverage rate strategies, we show that when the total control resources are rather scarce, the resources should be biased towards at the group with the high level of infection risk; and that the control resources should preferably be directed at the lower risk group if the total resources are relatively abundant.},

Two new control parameters ; vaccination rate and perfect recovery rate are introduced to validate the existence of computer virus infection via external devices likewise USBs. The model is comprehensively analyzed with and without control parameter for verification of proposed model and strategy. The recovery population of the infected computers has been divided into perfectly recovered with probability ‘ p ’ and partially recovered with probability ‘1 − p ’. The results show that as vaccination rate is increased reproductive number and number of infected computers decreased. Since reproductive number does not depend upon p , change in the value of p does not affect the basic reproductive number . However, as value of p is increased, a reduction in steady state of infected computer is observed. Local and global stability analysis of virus-free equilibrium has been investigated through basic reproductive number. The endemic equilibrium has also been determined under certain conditions. We introduce two control functions which are defined to present successful effort of repairing computers and fixing USBs and propose an optimal control problem with two control functions. The solution to the proposed problem is derived through forward-backward method. The necessary conditions for optimal control have been developed using the Pontryagin&#39;s Maximum Principle .

There have been many methods of constructing various cam curves in mathematical filed and mechanical engineering field. However they cannot guarantee dynamic performance and design conditions directly. In this paper, a novel method for constructing high-speed cam curves with optimized dynamic performance under any design conditions directly is proposed. First, an optimization model to determine the optimal high-order motion parameters is constructed by combing the high-order interpolation method and a feasible dynamic optimization model of cam curve. Then the solution to construct cam curve by this proposed method is presented, and a widely used single freedom dynamic model of cam mechanism is constructed to validate the dynamic performance of the constructed cam curve. Finally, taking a globoidal cam mechanism as a case, a high-speed cam curve is constructed by the proposed new method to satisfy the given design demands and the dynamic performance of constructed cam curve is evaluated. Thus the method is demonstrated to be effective and feasible in constructing high-speed cam curves.},

Stability analysis and the existence of transcritical bifurcation are studied. For the spatial system, the Hopf-bifurcation around the interior equilibrium, stability of homogeneous steady state , direction and stability of spatially homogeneous periodic orbits have been established. Using Normal form of the steady state bifurcation, the possibility of pitchfork bifurcation has been established. The impact of the level of fear and mutual interference on the stability and Turing patterns of the spatiotemporal system have been discussed in detail. Simulation results ensure that the fear of predator stabilizes the system dynamics and cost the overall population size of the species.},

However, the diffusion-driven instability/Turing instability for a single-handed discrete Fisher equation with the Neumann boundary conditions may occur and a series of 2-periodic patterns have been observed. Motivated by these pattern formations, the existence of 2-periodic solutions is established. Naturally, the periodic double and the chaos phenomenon should be considered. To this end, a simplest two elements system will be further discussed, the flip bifurcation theorem will be obtained by computing the center manifold, and the bifurcation diagrams will be simulated by using the shooting method. It proves that the Turing instability and the complexity of dynamical behaviors can be completely driven by the diffusion term. Additionally, those effective methods of numerical simulations are valid for experiments of other patterns, thus, are also beneficial for some application scientists.},

  abstract     = {Altruistic punishment is regarded as a solution for the social dilemma, yet the fact that altruistic punishment itself is a type of public good raises the second-order social dilemma. Previous studies have typically explained the emergence of altruistic punishment by recouping punishers with other public goods or altruistic behaviors , but introducing new public goods would then raise the n-order social dilemma. Costly signaling theory (CST), by viewing public goods as costly signaling, is a potential approach to explain the evolution of cooperation without introducing other public goods because partnering altruistic signalers is not necessarily an altruistic behavior. However, previous studies based on CST have rarely distinguished altruistic punishment as the distinctive costly signal from a nonpunishing contribution. In this study, we explore the rules of transforming payoffs into fitness by differentiating punishing costly signals from nonpunishing costly signals. The results show that, under the condition that the efficacy of costly signaling is incomplete, altruistic punishment can only emerge in the population with transforming rules in which individuals regard altruistic punishment as a distinctive costly signal rather than a nonpunishing contribution.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a new cubic B-spline-based semi-analytical algorithm is presented for solving 3D anisotropic convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) problems in the inhomogeneous medium. The mathematical model is expressed by the quasi-linear second-order elliptic partial differential equations (EPDE) with mixed derivatives and variable coefficients. The final approximation is obtained as a sum of the rough primary solution and the modified spline interpolants with free parameters. The primary solution mathematically satisfies boundary conditions. Thus, the free parameters of interpolants are chosen to satisfy the governing equation in the solution domain. The numerical examples demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method in solving 3D CDR problems in single- and multi-connected domains.},

Then, based on the special properties of these two elements and interpolation post-processing technique, the superconvergence results for u in broken H 1 -norm and p → p→ in L 2 -norm are obtained for the semi-discrete and Crank-Nicolson fully-discrete schemes without the restriction between the time step τ and coarse mesh size H or the fine mesh size h , which improve the results of the existing literature.

  abstract     = {A non-linear stability analysis of Rayleigh-Bénard convection is reported in the paper for the case of rigid isothermal boundaries. The Ginzburg-Landau equation with cubic non-linearity is obtained. Out of the three fixed points of the equation, one arises in the pre-onset regime and two during post-onset. The pre-onset one is unstable at post-onset times and hence we have a pitchfork bifurcation point . Comparing heat transports it is found that the Nusselt number of the rigid isothermal boundary condition is less than that of the free isothermal case. Prandtl number influence on the Nusselt number is negligible in very high Prandtl number liquids at all times and at long times this is true for all liquids. Using vital information from the procedure leading to the Ginzburg-Landau equation a minimal Fourier-Galerkin expansion is proposed to derive a generalized Lorenz model for rigid-isothermal boundaries. The Hopf bifurcation point signaling onset of chaos is obtained by transforming the Lorenz model of rigid isothermal boundaries to a standard form resembling the classical one. The possibility of regular, chaotic, periodic and mildly chaotic motions in the Lorenz system is shown through the plots of the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the bifurcation diagram .},

  abstract     = {Crowds in public spaces such as subway station are generally composed by diverse types of pedestrians with various motion features and behavior preferences. This paper aims to propose a behavior-based cellular automata model that can express the heterogeneous structure of crowds and explore the influence of different crowd composition on pedestrian dynamics, especially evacuation efficiency. The degree of aggressiveness is first introduced into cellular automata model as the internal state , which affects the motion characteristics and behavior preference of pedestrians. It is closely related to the motion characteristics including free walk velocity, target cells selection and conflict resolution mechanism. In addition, it determines the balance selection between keeping shorter paths and avoiding congestion. Simulation experiments of unidirectional pedestrian flow is conducted in the corridor with single exit. Simulation results indicate that a higher shortest path tendency leads to more time spent on blocking, and a higher detours tendency will cause longer detours time. A good balance between the two tendencies can make the individual&#39;s evacuation more efficient. A higher proportion of aggressive people and moderate degree of aggressiveness results in a higher average evacuation efficiency. In the crowd, the evacuation of conservative groups (i.e. pedestrians with zero aggressiveness) will be the most advantageous when the proportion of aggressive groups and degree of aggressiveness are moderate. For aggressive groups (i.e. pedestrians with the degree of aggressiveness greater than zero), evacuation efficiency will be the highest when the proportion of aggressive groups is moderate and the degree of aggressiveness is high. The proposed model provides a new perspective for the evaluation and analysis of heterogeneous pedestrian flow.},

A purely explicit treatment of the nonlinear term greatly simplifies the computational effort, since we only need to solve a constant-coefficient linear system at each time step. The curl-conforming nature of the Nédelec element assures its divergence-free property. In turn, we present the linearized stability analysis for the numerical error function to obtain an optimal L 2 error estimate. In more details, an O ( τ 2 + h s ) O(τ2+hs) error estimate in the L 2 norm yields the maximum norm bound of the numerical solution, so that the convergence analysis could be carried out at the next time step. A few numerical examples in the transverse electric (TE) case in two dimensional spaces are also presented, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed numerical scheme.},

A linear stability analysis based on a Fourier method states that the numerical scheme is unconditionally stable.

Motion of single solitary wave is examined using the present methods. The obtained results are indicated both in tabular and graphical form.},

This is a domain decomposition method in which the model problem is restricted to the small pieces by dividing the computational domain into the non-overlapping subdomains. An unknown (Lagrange multiplier) is introduced on the interfaces which serve as pressure Dirichlet boundary condition for local subdomain problems. A finite element space is defined on interface to approximate the pressure boundary such that the normal fluxes match weakly on interface.We demonstrated solvability of discretization, and established a priori L 2 -error estimates for both vector and scalar approximations. We proved the optimal order convergence rates by an appropriate choice of mortar space and polynomial degree of approximation. The uniqueness of discrete problem is shown for sufficiently small values of mesh size. An error estimate for the mortar pressure is derived via linear interface formulation with pressure dependent coefficient. We also present the analysis of the linear second order elliptic problem and prove the similar results. The computational experiments are presented to validate theory.},

People may need to seek for romantic partners, teammates, collaborators, etc. In this paper, we propose a minimalist framework of match making in complex networks. Specially we adopt a simple model where each individual would greedily seek for making a match with the strongest partner within his/her social connection range. We explore a few matching schemes including greedy mode, roulette wheel selection mode and completely random mode on different networks. We also investigate when social systems become more densely connected, how the match making process would be affected. Our observations show that, in a more densely connected social network, individuals’ efforts for seeking for matches with the strongest partners would be more likely to end up with matching with someone similar to themselves. Meanwhile, the cost of such an approach may be quickly increased. The implications of such observations in real-life systems and open problems are briefly discussed.},

In the present work, we introduce a simple periodic conformal map which accumulates nodes in the neighborhood of an arbitrarily located front, as well as its extension to several fronts. Despite its simplicity, this map allows for a very accurate approximation of smooth periodic functions with steep gradients.},

The rainbow number for H with respect to G , G, denoted r b ( G , H ) , rb(G,H), is the minimum number k such that, if H ⊆ G ∈ G , H⊆G∈G, then any k -edge-coloring of G contains a rainbow H (i.e., any two edges of H are colored distinct). Denote by T n Tn the class of all plane triangulations of order n and W d the wheel graph of order d + 1 d+1 . In this paper, we determine the exact rainbow numbers for matchings and a triangle with one or two pendant edges with respect to W d , and the exact rainbow numbers for the triangle with one pendant edge with respect to T n Tn . Furthermore, we give upper bounds of rainbow numbers for triangles with two pendant edges with respect to T n Tn .},

Based on the Eisert–Wilkens–Lewenstein quantization scheme, a quantum prisoner’s dilemma is introduced using a simple restricted one-parameter strategic space. Our scheme is found to preserve the quantum advantages of the Eisert–Wilkens–Lewenstein scheme, and improve its Nash equilibrium characteristics. The simplicity of the calculations enables us to address some important aspects of quantum games which can be applied to many real systems. The robustness of Nash equilibria to corruption in the initial state is studied, and a measure of robustness is defined. The robustness of Nash equilibria is found to scale inversely with the entanglement. Our scheme is applied to various prisoner’s dilemma games having different dilemma strength . Also, Some variant forms of restricted one-parameter strategic space are studied.},

Considering the network supervision such as forced silence and network topology, a novel delayed SIR(susceptible-propagating-recovery) epidemic-like rumor propagation model in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is proposed. By using the mean-field theory, we analyze the propagation dynamics of the model in detail. Firstly, we demonstrate the boundedness of the solutions, then we obtain the basic reproduction number and the existence of the rumor-prevailing equilibrium points. Secondly, the forward and backward bifurcation as well as the local and global stabilities of the equilibrium points in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are theoretically analyzed and revealed. Finally, the possible impact is analyzed through numerical simulations, and the factors affecting rumor propagation are theoretically analyzed, which prove the validity of the theoretical analysis.},

The drivers in the simulation system are given reinforcement learning ability based on Q-learning algorithm, by evaluating the benefits of each behavior. The conclusions are summarized as follows. For pure selfish drivers group, the application of ITPS has little impact on cooperation. For heterogeneous drivers group, the cooperation probability and passing efficiency of drivers can be improved by the regulation of the ITPS. Meantime, the fairness between drivers could be also maintained. It means that the application of ITPS can achieve the unity of fairness and efficiency. From a long-term perspective, the establishment of the ITPS will be a strong guarantee for the reciprocity of the travelers’ efficiency and fairness.

Based on the ranking of neighbors’ highest payoffs, self-aspiration payoffs and self-current payoffs, a dynamic strategy updating rule reflecting the process of progressively pursuing higher payoffs is proposed to study the synergistic effects of inner desires and external environment on cooperation. The dynamic strategy updating rule includes local optima, imitation rule and self-optimization. We apply this updating method to the investor sharing game and conclude the level of cooperation increases under small aspiration levels. Through the simulation results, we find that self-optimization rule will increase the probability of defectors with high investment transforming into cooperators, who will promote the imitation of cooperation behaviors later. Meanwhile, both of the lower monopoly of markets and more random networks boost cooperation in groups. In addition, this dynamic nature of the strategy updating rule may provide an idea for studying mixing rules, multi-person games and the heterogeneity of individuals.},

  abstract     = {Backtracking search optimisation algorithm (BSA) is a commonly used meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm and was proposed by Civicioglu in 2013. When it was first used, it exhibited its strong potential for solving numerical optimisation problems. Additionally, the experiments conducted in previous studies demonstrated the successful performance of BSA and its non-sensitivity toward the several types of optimisation problems. This success of BSA motivated researchers to work on expanding it, e.g., developing its improved versions or employing it for different applications and problem domains. However, there is a lack of literature review on BSA; therefore, reviewing the aforementioned modifications and applications systematically will aid further development of the algorithm. This paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis that emphasise on reviewing the related studies and recent developments on BSA. Hence, the objectives of this work are two-fold: (i) First, two frameworks for depicting the main extensions and the uses of BSA are proposed. The first framework is a general framework to depict the main extensions of BSA, whereas the second is an operational framework to present the expansion procedures of BSA to guide the researchers who are working on improving it. (ii) Second, the experiments conducted in this study fairly compare the analytical performance of BSA with four other competitive algorithms: differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and firefly (FF) on 16 different hardness scores of the benchmark functions with different initial control parameters such as problem dimensions and search space. The experimental results indicate that BSA is statistically superior than the aforementioned algorithms in solving different cohorts of numerical optimisation problems such as problems with different levels of hardness score, problem dimensions, and search spaces. This study can act as a systematic and meta-analysis guide for the scholars who are working on improving BSA.},

Besides, we indicate a noise-independent a-priori parameter choice when the function y possesses the form of ∑ k = 0 p − 1 a k t k + ∑ k = 1 N 1 b k cos k t + ∑ k = 1 N 2 c k sin k t , b N 1 , c N 2 ≠ 0 , ∑k=0p−1aktk+∑k=1N1bkcoskt+∑k=1N2cksinkt,bN1,cN2≠0, In particular, in numerical differentiations for functions above, good filtering effect (error approaches 0) is displayed with corresponding parameter choice. In addition, several numerical examples are given to show that even derivatives with discontinuity can be recovered well.},

We build the nonlinear discrete system to describe the dynamic contest with bounded rationality, and discuss the stability conditions of the Nash equilibrium theoretically. Meanwhile, our numerical simulation experiments also reveal that the model can exhibit very complex dynamical behaviors . In particular, there exist two different routes to chaos for the system: the period-doubling (flip) bifurcation which leads to periodic cycles and chaos, and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation which derives an attractive invariant closed curve. These two routes are significantly different for economic views. In addition, the stability of Nash equilibrium point is badly affected by the system parameters, such as the adjustment speeds, the values of the object, and so on. Therefore, the parameter adjustment method could be properly applied to make the system return to its stable state.},

In this paper, we limit this general question to the Beverton–Holt model with p -periodic harvesting. We fix a set of harvesting quotas and give ourselves the liberty to permute them. The total harvesting yield is unchanged by the permutation, but the population geometric-mean may fluctuate. We investigate this notion and characterize the cases in which a permutation of the harvesting quotas has no effect or tangible effect on the population geometric-mean. In particular, as long as persistence is assured, all permutations within the dihedral group give same population geometric-mean. Other permutations may change the population geometric-mean. A characterization theorem has been obtained based on block reflections in the harvesting quotas. Finally, we associate directed graphs to the various permutations, then give the complete characterization when the periodicity of the system is four or five.},

Relaying on the replicator dynamics that presumes an infinite and well-mixed population, a set of equilibria is deliberately drawn. In contrast to the expectations from this study, the introduction of CL did not substantially alter the evolutionary trails and always ended with all-defectors state. Some arguments on why such counter-intuitive result comes about is are discussed. The outcomes are justified by the CL&#39;s dependency on the other two strategic types and the reduced power in foiling defectors compared to the paradigmatic costly punisher model.},

However, most previous studies have considered neighbors’ historical payoffs when individuals choose role models whom they will learn from, but paid less attention to the stability of neighbors’ strategy which indicates how frequently they change their strategies in memory length. In this paper, we study the memory length M and the strategy persistence level u of individuals and the change rate of cooperative tendency δ on the cooperative evolution under the mixed strategy of the prisoner’s dilemma. Strategy persistence level is measured by the number of times which the strategy in neighbor’s memory length is continuous and consistent with neighbor’s current strategy, and can determine the probability that the individual learns the neighbor’s strategy when updating the strategy; the change rate of cooperative tendency δ is described by the standard deviation of the normal distribution . We investigate the effects of M and δ on the evolutionary of cooperation. The results show that the persistence strategy mechanism which we proposed in the memory length can improve network reciprocity and facilitate the generation and maintenance of cooperation, the larger the memory length is, the smaller the standard deviation value is, the more conducive to cooperation.},

Different experts in MCGDM may hold different decision interests. To generate the solution that is accepted by most experts, a group consensus reaching process has been widely applied in MCGDM along with multiple rounds of group analysis and discussion (GAD). How to characterize the dynamic variation of experts’ opinions in the above process is a critical issue. To solve this problem, expert reliability is defined by measuring the dynamic variation of the support degree from other experts in GAD. By considering expert reliability and expert weight simultaneously, a group consensus measure is proposed and a group feedback mechanism is constructed to accelerate the convergence of group consensus. The dynamic variation of experts’ opinions, especially their non-cooperative behaviors, can be well addressed by using the constructed feedback mechanism. The proposed group consensus reaching process including the group consensus measure and feedback mechanism is applied to solve a problem of evaluating the safety performance of an enterprise located in Changzhou, a city in Jiangsu Province, China, in order to verify its applicability and effectiveness in MCGDM.},

  abstract     = {Some diseases can live in people for many years without making them sick, during this time, the bacteria can spread to others who come in contact with the infected person. However, explosive individuals in infected people will exhibit certain dominant states associated with infectious diseases, as a results, the uninfected persons will avoid contact with such individuals with dominant infectious diseases. Considering the individual’s ability to avoid risks in the epidemic season, we propose the epidemic spreading model with individuals’ sensitivity. The epidemic spreading threshold is calculated by means of the mean-field theory and the next-generation matrix method. In addition, the locally, globally and exponential asymptotically stable conditions in the disease-free equilibrium state are given. Finally, we simulate the proposed epidemic spreading modeling in the ER random network and the BA scale-free network. The numerical simulations results show that the probability of the latent individuals transforming into explosive individuals has a greater impact on the spread of infectious diseases. Meanwhile, self-protection is an effective measure to reduce the outbreak of infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {The Sine Cosine Algorithm ( SCA ) has received much attention from engineering and scientific fields since it was proposed. Nevertheless, when solving multimodal or complex high dimensional optimization tasks, the conventional SCA still has a high probability of falling into the local optimal stagnation or failing to obtain the global optimum solution. Additionally, it performspoorly in convergence. Therefore, in this study, a multi-strategy enhanced SCA , a memetic algorithm termed MSCA , is proposed, which combines multiple control mechanisms including Cauchy mutation operator, chaotic local search mechanism, opposition-based learning strategy and two operators based on differential evolution to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation. To verify its performance, MSCA was compared with 11 state-of-the-art original optimizers and variant algorithms on 23 continuous benchmark tasks including 7 unimodal tasks, 6 multimodal tasks, 10 various fixed-dimension multimodal functions, and several typical CEC2014 benchmark problems. Furthermore, MSCA was utilized to solve three constrained practical engineering problems including tension/compression spring design, welded beam design, and pressure vessel design. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm MSCA is superior to other competitors in terms of quality of solutions and convergence speed and can serve as an effective andefficient computer-aided tool for practical tasks with complex search space.},

This result mainly follows from an augmented affine parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which, in turn, takes advantages of convexity properties. Then, as a second contribution, we invoke a result from robust control literature to show how the proposed stability condition can be checked exactly in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions.

Knowing how the cooperation evolves is of considerable importance since it plays an essential role in the understanding of the entire evacuation process. In this work, we study the evolution of cooperation in pedestrian room evacuation mixed with different individual behaviors by means of a cellular automaton (CA) model coupled with a spatial game. In the game, each agent interacts with its immediate neighbors and plays for the expected evacuation time which depends on its surroundings. Agents have one of the two possible modes of strategy to choose that lead to be either patient or impatient. Agents’ strategies are updated in parallel according to two kinds of individual behaviors: cherry-picking behavior and imitation behavior. This model shows how evacuation conditions and agents’ individual behaviors affect the evolution of cooperation during the evacuation process.},

However, all previous studies considered only symmetric games between players, i.e., players have the same strategies and the same associated payoffs, thus the players’ identities are interchangeable without affecting the game&#39;s dynamics. In this study, we analytically model and derive the ZD strategies for asymmetric two players’ games, focusing on one-memory strategies and infinite repeated encounters. We derive the analytical bounds of equalizer and extortionate ZD strategies in 2  ×  2 asymmetric games, which differ from the symmetric games case. Furthermore, we derive under what conditions a player using an extortionate ZD strategy will get a higher expected payoff than his/her opponent.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a methodology for nonlinear parameter identification of conservative Hamiltonian systems . In the proposed approach, the system’s Hamiltonian is used under the first integral concept. The time derivative of this first integral function is utilized to construct a signal termed surface variable, which depends on the system’s parameters. Then, the parameter convergence is ensured by driving this surface variable towards zero, employing the parameter estimates as control inputs. This procedure is approached by treating the parameter identification problem as an optimization one. Hence, different cost functions are defined to obtain various parameter updating laws. Besides, an automatic tuning methodology based on a meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed for tuning the adaptation gains of the new parameter updating laws. The proposed scheme shows that, when the surface variable reaches zero, the parameter estimates converge to the real ones. Furthermore, better estimation results are obtained when applying the automatic tuning scheme. Numerous numerical simulations validate the proposed parameter identification methodology, including the cases where the unknown system variables are estimated through the dirty derivative and a sliding-mode differentiator.},

It is noted that the state of links is very important to the networks in practical, such as, the tension value of webs in web-winding system, the relationships between individuals in social network, therefore, discussing the tracking control problem for links subsystem is also of practical significance. Considering the state of links is difficult to be measured accurately in practice applications, this makes it difficult to design the controller. In view of this, a state observer is proposed for the links subsystem modeled mathematically by the Riccati matrix difference equation in this paper. And then the control scheme is proposed for the links subsystem by employing the state observer such that the links subsystem asymptotically converging to the given target.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for the mixed optimal control problem are derived. A linear-quadratic (LQ) case of the mixed optimal control problem is also studied. The mixed optimal controllers are explicitly expressed by the solution of a fully coupled mean-field forward–backward stochastic differential equation (SDE). One of novel features is that a kind of mean-field BSDE naturally arises from the research on the mixed optimal control problem.

In this article, we investigate the effects of electromagnetic radiation distribution on the nonlinear dynamics of a neural network with n neurons. A new mathematical model of the neural network under electromagnetic radiation is developed and analyzed, where electromagnetic radiation is equivalent to the magnetic flux passing through the cell membrane. Chaotic dynamics of the nerve system is detailedly studied by stimulating different number of neurons in the neural network model consisted of three neurons. It is proved that with the increasing of the number of neurons stimulated by electromagnetic radiation, the dynamics behaviors of the neural network gradually change from period moving to chaos, transient chaos and intricate hyperchaos. That is, the dynamical behaviors of the neural system can be modulated through changing the number of neurons affected by electromagnetic radiation in neural network. Therefore, it could give new insights to understand the occurrence mechanism of some neuronal diseases. Moreover, a flexible hardware circuit of the neural network with different electromagnetic radiation distribution is implemented by using commercially available electronic elements, and the experimental measurements are consistent with numerical simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, many contributions deal with R-peak detection in Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. Although they present an accurate performance in detection, most of these are presented as offline solutions, both to be processed in high performance platforms (under a big cost), or to be analyzed in laboratories without constraints in time, neither in computational load. Owing to this, it is also very important to take one step further, trying to develop new solutions which work in portable/wearable low-cost platforms, with constraints in time and in computational load. In this work, an accurate and computationally efficient method for online and robust detection of R-Peaks is presented. This method is divided in three main stages: first, in the pre-processing stage, a complete elimination of artifacts is performed based on a noise and signal intensity approach; second, R-peaks detection is carried out through an efficient “area over the curve” method; finally, in the third stage, a novel iterative algorithm consisting in three sequential state machines performs the correct detection of the R-peaks applying heart period distance rules. Moreover, the method is performed over time in short length sliding windows. The algorithm has been tested using all 48 full-length ECG records of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, achieving 99.54% sensitivity and 99.60% positive predictivity in R-peak detection.},

Utilizing the proper Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions constructed in this paper and the common matrix inequalities technique, a novel condition is derived which is sufficient to make sure that system is passive. In addition, it relaxes the condition that the symmetric matrices are all required to be positive definite. The final results are presented by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and its verification is easy to be carried out by the LMI toolbox.

For paired two individuals in network, they can attend game under the condition that they both successfully choose the other party with the intensity of unidirectional interaction, and the changing of the intensity of unidirectional interaction according to the relation between individual’s current payoff and its previous payoff which are both gained from the other party. The simulation results show that this evolutionary rule can availably remove the stumbling blocks of cooperators for existence and hugely boost the cooperation in population. Interestingly, for a smaller or moderate cost-to-benefit ratio (0 &lt; r &lt; 0.235), the cooperation level ascends monotonically as the length of information increases; however, for a bigger cost-to-benefit ratio (0.235 ≤ r &lt; 0.249), there are some moderate values of length of information, resulting in the status of full cooperation. Surprisingly, we find that there is an optimal length of information which not just leads to the ultimately full cooperation in population but benefits the learning of cooperation strategy for individual, regardless of the value of cost-to-benefit ratio (0 &lt; r &lt; 0.249).

While, viscosity of hybrid nanofluids was rising up to 70% and 67% at the same concentration.

The governing shallow water equations are modified to include additional terms to model the porous region. Analytical solutions are sought in the non-porous bottom case using a separation of variables method to provide the natural resonant periods of the basin for the three different harbour geometries. For fixed basin length the lowest resonant frequency increases as the profile goes from rectangular to parabolic to triangular. However, the rate of amplification increases from triangular, rectangular to parabolic. A computational scheme is proposed, using a finite volume method on a staggered grid, and is validated against the analytical solution prior to being used to investigate the effect of porosity and friction on wave resonance. The relative effectiveness of friction and porosity in controlling resonance is found to be dependent on basin geometry.},

First, sufficient stability conditions are derived by constructing novel linear stochastic co-positive Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Second, the corresponding necessary conditions are established by applying a model transformation technique and analyzing the relationship between stochastic stability of the transformed systems and exponential mean stability with given decay rate of the original systems. Compared with the existing conditions, the proposed stability conditions are not only delay-dependent but also decay-rate-dependent, and the sufficient conditions plus the necessary conditions can be used to judge the system stability more precisely. Third, based on the new sufficient conditions, non-fragile controllers are designed by solving linear programming problems such that the closed-loop systems are positive and exponentially mean stable with an expected decay rate. Finally, by numerical examples, the effects of both time-delay and decay rate on exponential mean stability are exploited and the validity of the non-fragile controller design conditions is demonstrated.},

It incurs an inventory cost in the work-in-process storage of a stage, and also incurs a setup cost whenever a production batch is formed in the first stage. The problem is to determine the formation of each production batch in each period such that the total cost of setup and inventory is minimized. For the problem, we first provide a mixed-integer quadratic programming model and then propose some optimality properties.

  abstract     = {Covering perfect hash families (CPHFs) are used to represent compactly some covering arrays. For CPHFs there is an efficient way to determine if the covering arrays derived from them are or not complete covering arrays; and this characteristic eases the construction of large covering arrays by greedy and metaheuristic methods working over the CPHF representation. CPHFs has been constructed in other works by backtracking, tabu search, simulated annealing, and greedy methods. The present work introduces a new simulated annealing algorithm that is able to construct CPHFs with groups of rows with restricted entries. In a CPHF of this kind the entries have some dependencies among them, that is, the values in some rows restrict the values that can appear in other rows. Restricted CPHFs produce covering arrays smaller than the ones derived from CPHFs without restricted entries. By using the new simulated annealing algorithm, we construct 135 new CPHFs whose derived covering arrays improve the upper bound of 19,669 covering array numbers.},

  abstract     = {Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique for extracting hidden and intrinsic features of high-dimensional data sets. Recently, several Projective NMF (P-NMF) methods have been proposed for the purpose of resolving issues associated with the standard NMF approach. Experimental results show that P-NMF algorithms outperform the standard NMF method in some aspects. But some basic issues still affect the existing NMF and P-NMF methods, these include slow convergence rate, low reconstruction accuracy and dense basis factors. In this article, we propose a new and generalized hybrid algorithm by combining the concept of alternating least squares with the multiplicative update rules of the α -divergence-based P-NMF method. We have conducted extensive numerical experiments on 7 real-world data sets and compared the new algorithm with several state-of-the-art methods. The attractive features and added advantages of the new algorithm include remarkable clustering performances, providing highly “orthogonal” and very sparse basis factors, and extracting distinctive and better localized features of the original data than its counterparts.},

Since in this context the problem of constructing an adaptive discretization method to be really effective is still open, we propose some error indicators and refinement strategies, so that each of these two essential ingredients takes advantage of the potentiality of the other one. More precisely, the refinement techniques coupled with a local error indicator is an ad-hoc strategy for the RBF-PU method. The resulting scheme turns out to be flexible and the use of efficient searching procedures enables us a fast detection of the regions that adaptively need the addition/removal of points. Several numerical experiments and applications support our study by illustrating the performance of our adaptive algorithms.},

In addition, we propose an n th-order higher-order CB+ (HCBn+) method for compensating the ( n + 1)th residual flexibility in the n th-order HCB (HCBn) method by O&#39;Callahan&#39;s approach. Therefore, various CB methods with improved performance, such as the enhanced Craig-Bampton (ECB) method, which uses O&#39;Callahan&#39;s approximation, and the higher-order Craig-Bampton (HCB) method, which adds generalized coordinate vectors, and HCB+ are employed for the comparison of performance with the aid of multiprecision computing. Through three benchmark examples, it is revealed that the HCB1+ method, a modified version of the first-order HCB method (HCB1) with the aid of O&#39;Callahan&#39;s approximation proposed, shows better performance than HCB1 with the same number of retained modes. However, HCB2+ and HCB3+, modified versions of the second- and third-order HCB method, respectively, cannot be improved further.

A novel distributed OBCC scheme is proposed based on model-free reinforcement learning method to achieve OBCC, where the agent’s dynamics are no longer required. First, The coopetition networks are applied to establish the cooperative and competitive interactions among agents, and then the OBCC problem is formulated by introducing local neighbor bipartite consensus errors and performance index functions (PIFs) for each agent. Second, in order to obtain the OBCC laws, a policy iteration algorithm (PIA) is employed to learn the solutions to discrete-time (DT) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Third, to implement the proposed methods, we adopt a data-driven actor-critic-based neural networks (NNs) framework to approximate the control laws and the PIFs, respectively, in an online learning manner. Finally, some simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approaches.},

Hence, we characterize those graphs that uniquely minimize and maximize the adjacency-distance spectral radii in several sets of graphs, and determine trees with small adjacency-distance spreads.

Projection methods are then adopted to generate reduced models, and we show that a desired number of Laguerre coefficients are preserved by reduced models. Further, we extend the proposed method to general orthogonal polynomials, where the relationship between Taylor expansion and orthogonal polynomial expansion is examined to achieve the expansion of time-delay systems. Systems with multiple delays and delays appearing in the derivative of the states are also discussed. Two numerical examples are simulated to showcase the efficiency of our approach.},

Here, a model written in terms of differential equations is proposed to answer the question: do more legal guns mean less crime committed by illegal guns? From this model, the impact of distinct gun-control policies on the rate of gun-related crimes is investigated. It is analytically shown that strong gun-control leads to the minimum number of illegal guns; however, this policy does not assure a crime-free society. Weak gun-control can lead to a crime-free society; however, this policy requires the maximum number of legal guns in the hands of the civil society.},

  abstract     = {The significance of multi-variable special polynomials has been identified both in mathematical and applied frameworks. The article aims to focus on a new class of 3-variable Legendre-truncated-exponential-based Sheffer sequences and to investigate their properties by means of Riordan array techniques. The quasi-monomiality of these sequences is studied within the context of Riordan arrays. These sequences are expressed in determinant forms by utilizing the relation between the Sheffer sequences and Riordan arrays. Certain special Sheffer sequences are used to construct the Legendre-truncated-exponential-based Chebyshev polynomials. The same polynomials are used as base to introduce the hybrid classes involving the exponential polynomials and the Euler polynomials of higher order as illustrative examples of the aforementioned general class of polynomials. The shapes are shown and zeros are computed for these sequences by using mathematical software. The main purpose is to demonstrate the advantage of using numerical investigation and computations to discover fascinating pattern of scattering of zeros through graphical representations.},

  abstract     = {Reputation information plays an important role in human behavioral interactions. There have been many studies that have considered reputation in spatial public goods game models, but they essentially assumed that reputation will only change the payoff structure of the game (individuals with a good reputation will get more benefits in the future). In fact, individuals with good reputation will have greater influences which can also affect the decision of neighbors around them in the strategy updating process. Grounded on this observation, we proposed an improved strategy learning rule considering both reputation and payoff information. We employ evidence theory to fuse these two aspects of information, based on which individual strategies can be updated. In addition, we construct a weight coefficient to quantify the importance and reliability of reputation. Through numerical simulations, it is unraveled that the reputation effect can greatly attract nearest neighbors to form greater clusters, thus promoting the emergence of cooperation. With the reputation weight increasing gradually, the critical enhancement factor for cooperation to arise is by degrees reduced to the lower boundary, demonstrating that an increasing tendency of strategy adoption relying on reputation is more likely to allow cooperation to thrive. In the region of low reputation weights, reputation only plays a subtle role in inducing cooperation. Within the region of high reputation weights, cooperation is dramatically boosted by reputation and cooperators can swiftly occupy the whole population. Our work may be helpful to further understand the effect of reputation on the emergence of cooperation.},

To reduce transmission of signals in the limited bandwidth networks, a novel event-triggered scheme (ETS) is proposed. A networked singular Markovian jump filtering error system (FES) with time-delay is established by considering the network communication characteristic and the ETS. By utilizing Lyapunov–Kravoskii stability theory , some new criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the FES is stochastically admissible (SA) and has a prescribed level of mixed H ∞ H∞ and passive performance. The co-design method is given, which can realize the synchronous design for the filter and ETS parameters. The proposed method can deal with the mode-dependent or mode-independent filter design problems for SMJSs including H ∞ , H∞, passive and mixed filter (i.e., mixed H ∞ H∞ and passive filter) in a unified form.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a non-local feedback is used to force spiral waves in the oscillatory system modeled by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, where the feedback signal is derived from a circular measuring domain. It is found that the spiral tip could be driven to follow an attractor after a period of drift. The existence of multiple types of attractors, which include a point attractor at the measuring center and a set of circular attractors concentric with the measuring domain, is illustrated. Which to be chosen depends on the direction of the spiral initial drift and the distance between the initial tip position and the measuring center. Here the diameter of the circular attractor has a periodic change with the size of the measuring domain, but is not affected by the movement of the measuring domain. Correlation between the tip drift and the feedback signal is analyzed, and the modulus function of the feedback signal will has a constant value after the spiral tip arrives at the attractors. If the feedback signal is generated from the measuring domain far away from the position of the initial spiral tip, the spiral breakup can be caused by the feedback control, and it fist occurs near the boundary and then invades inward until the area of the remaining spiral is small enough. The effect of the feedback gain, the delay time and the scaling parameter is also considered.},

Analysis results on the weighted stochastic L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ control are proposed by constructing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing stochastic analysis methods.

Namely, an individual can punish his/her neighbors with the opposite strategy when his/her payoff is lower than the average payoff of his/her neighbors. The simulation results show that this mechanism promotes cooperation effectively even with antisocial punishment. By adopting such a mechanism, cooperative punishers form shields to protect cooperators inside, while defective punishers hide behind defectors without punishing anyone.},

We obtain that the basic reproduction number R 0 is a sharp threshold parameter such that the worm-free equilibrium is asymptotically stable for R 0 ≤ 1, implying that the worm dies out eventually and its attack remains under control; the worm-existence equilibrium is asymptotically stable when R 0 &gt; 1, namely, the worm is always persistent and spreading within a population. This paper provides some novel insights to cyber security by that (a) the stability of worm-free equilibrium establishes the control strategies to reduce the intensity of worm attacks, and the optimal control strategy is proposed by using Pontryagins Minimum Principle; (b) the stability of worm-existence equilibrium predicts the tendency of worm propagation in a long run and assesses the level of the worm popularity by the final scale of infected devices.

Our algorithm works on incomplete information games: each player needs not knowing the payoff function of the rest of the players. Also, it allows obtaining Pareto-efficient payoffs for all players using either Nash or correlated equilibrium concepts. We explain the main ideas behind the algorithm, explain the two key procedures on which algorithm relies on, provide a theoretical bound on the error introduced and show empirically the performance of the algorithm on four well-known repeated games.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a numerical quadrature method for solving two-dimensional linear and nonlinear Volterra integral equations . Firstly, we generalize one-dimensional quadrature formula to two-dimensional case and its corresponding error asymptotic expansion . Based on the quadrature formula and the error expansion, we next construct an iterative scheme and extrapolation algorithm. The numerical solution of any point can be calculated by iterative scheme, and the error accuracy and convergence order of the numerical solution are further improved by extrapolation algorithm. Using the extrapolation algorithm, we can improve the convergence order from O ( h 0 2 ) O(h02) to O ( h 0 3 ) O(h03) or even O ( h 0 4 ) O(h04) . Since, the numerical solution of each point is obtained by assignment operation and iteration, the computational complexity can be greatly reduced. Finally, four numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.},

  abstract     = {Recently, tensor train rank, defined by a well-balanced matricization scheme, has been shown the powerful capacity to capture the hidden correlations among different modes of a tensor, leading to great success in tensor completion problem. Most of the high-dimensional data in the real world are more likely to be grossly corrupted with sparse noise. In this paper, based on tensor train rank, we consider a new model for tensor robust principal component analysis which aims to recover a low-rank tensor corrupted by sparse noise. The alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. A tensor augmentation tool called ket augmentation is used to convert lower-order tensors to higher-order tensors to enhance the performance of our method. Experiments of simulated data show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of PSNR and SSIM values. Moreover, experiments of the real rain streaks removal and the real stripe noise removal also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The increasingly fragmented agricultural landscape necessitates network-organized models. In this paper, we develop a semiarid vegetation model to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics between plant and water on a network accounting for fragmented habitats which are connected by dispersal of seeds. Time delay is introduced to account for time lag in water uptake. By linear stability analysis we show that the coexistence equilibrium is asymptotically stable in the absence of time delay, but loses its stability via Hopf bifurcation when time delay is beyond a threshold. Applying the center manifold theory , we derive the explicit formulas that determine the stability and direction of the Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the emergence of spatial patterns on a network. Comparing our network-organized model to other model variants, we find that increasing landscape fragmentation is more likely to generate the variation of plant density among different habitats.},

Due to this, the noise covariance matrices of the standard stochastic SIR model will be modified. This will be done by using van Kampen&#39;s expansion method to approximate the master equation and the stochastic Fokker–Planck equation to analytically calculate a power spectral density (PSD) expression. A vector-valued process is used and shows that the absolute value of the real part of the principal diagonal of the PSD matrix solution is the spectral density of the system which is compared to the average PSD of the stochastic simulations. We aim to investigate the problem of identifiability when deceased humans act as an extended state of host infection using the SIR-D model during Ebola epidemics. Using our analytical solution model, we show that for an increasing degree of transmission parameter values the infected route cannot be identified, whereas the deceased human transmission shows enhancement for the persistence of Ebola virus disease using epidemiology data of the Democratic Republic of Congo.},

Based on fractional Jacobi polynomials , a class of differential equation solvers for Levin’s equation are developed, which leads to the fractional Jacobi–Galerkin–Levin method. The discretized equation is turned into a sparse linear system by properly choosing Jacobi polynomials and the inner product. Furthermore, convergence analysis with respect to the oscillation is presented by studying coefficients of the fractional Jacobi expansion of the error function. Numerical experiments indicate that in contrast to existing quadrature rules, the new method is efficient for computing oscillatory integrals with stationary points and unknown singular parameters.},

  abstract     = {A mathematical model of the steady flow of blood in arteries with six different types of mild stenoses (symmetric, triangular, trapezoidal, elliptical, bell-shaped and composite) is analyzed. The model comprises a core (suspension of cells) surrounded by a layer of plasma near the wall. The rheology of blood in the core region is characterized by a K-L (non-Newtonian) fluid model and the peripheral plasma layer as a Newtonian fluid . An attempt has been made to obtain analytical expressions for the velocity of blood flow in the stenotic arterial region, radius of the plug-core region, the velocity of the fluid in the plug-flow region, flow flux, shear stress at wall and resistance to flow, using the suitable boundary conditions. The computational results were presented graphically for several values of the parameters involved in the present analysis, and also several comparisons have been made with the existing models to endorse the applicability of the present model. The study revealed that the velocity of blood decreases by increasing values of the yield stress of the blood and K-L fluid parameters and an opposite nature is observed for wall shear stress and resistive impedance to flow. It is found that the shape of the plug flow region is purely dependent on the shape of the stenosis present in the cardiovascular system. It is also recovered that the wall shear stress and flow resistance are significantly reduced for the two-layered model (K.L-Newtonian) than those of the one-layered model (K-L) irrespective of the type of geometries of stenosis. Also, the axial variation of wall shear stress and resistive impedance are lowest for the bell-shaped stenosis than those of the other stenoses considered in the present study, and they found to be highest for the trapezoidal stenosis. A comparison of the velocity profiles obtained from the present study with the experimental data is made, and a good agreement between them is found. Further, the relevant physiological applications of the present mathematical model have been analyzed.},

Unlike the original Hamilton&#39;s principle, this formulation properly accounts for initial conditions, and it recovers all the governing differential equations as its Euler–Lagrange equation. Thus, it serves base for the development of novel computational methods, involving finite element representation over time. For its feasibility, we provide the simplest temporal finite element method by adopting linear temporal shape functions.

The perturbation matrixes, consisting of the elastic stiffness matrix and the geometric stiffness matrix, are introduced to derive the concept of safety margin. The concept of safety margin of buckling is first proposed to quantify the influence of uncertain parameters on structural buckling. Based on the spectrum norm and the singular value analysis, the mathematical basis of the safety margin is expounded. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate estimation of safety margin, the correction factor for the safety margin is introduced through the interval extension of interval analysis . Two engineering examples, compared with traditional interval analysis method, are utilized to demonstrate the validity of the proposed safety margin, and numerical results indicate that the safety margin can provide a relatively accurate index to indicate the allowable perturbation range of the perturbation matrix of a structure under given loads.},

Oncolytic alphavirus M1 is a naturally occurring virus which showed high selectivity and potent efficacy in human cancers. Our purpose in this paper is to propose and analyze a model of oncolytic M1 virotherapy with spatial effects and anti-tumor immune response. We investigate the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions for the modified model. We calculate all possible equilibrium points and determine the threshold conditions needed for their existence. One of the equilibria represents the success of the treatment, while the others represent a partial success or a complete fail. We study the global stability of the corresponding equilibrium points by constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals. We also provide the instability conditions of the equilibrium points. We perform some numerical simulations in order to verify the effect of the immune response on oncolytic virotherapy. Our results indicate that the immune response may weaken the effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy and control the tumor.},

The effective observable degree can not only be obtained before filtering but also be used to measure the system filtering performance. In applications, the exact knowledge of the system parameters and models is always unavailable. A basic smart Kalman filter (SKF) with online performance evaluation is proposed based on the observable degree in this paper. Since the collection of observations is limited in initial alignment with complex situations, mobile sensor networks are introduced. To improve the filtering performance with inaccuracy system parameters, the relatively optimal smart adjusting factor is iteratively selected by an optimized observable degree with autonomous learning function. The self-assessment function is also available for real-time performance evaluation. Finally, simulation examples are demonstrated to validate the proposed smart Kalman filter.},

The system contains source terms in nonconservative form, which cause lots of inconveniences for standard numerical schemes. Our proposed scheme is relied on exact solutions of local Riemann problems . Then, we provide many numerical tests, in which the errors and orders of accuracy of this scheme are computed. These tests show that our proposed van Leer-type scheme has a much better accuracy than the Godunov-type scheme, and that the scheme is well-balanced in the sense that it can capture exactly stationary waves. Furthermore, comparisons between van Leer’s limiter and Roe’s superbee limiter are given.},

Moreover, some novel synchronization criteria are established, which are closely related to the maximum uncontrolled ratio and the topological structure of considered networks.

  abstract     = {Cardiac simulations are often performed by numerically solving the bidomain or monodomain equations. In these simulations, much of the computational workload is devoted to the time integration of the systems of ordinary differential equations that arise from the myocardial cell models. For such time integration, a well-established top choice is the Rush–Larsen (RL) method, which partitions the myocardial cell models according to the gating and non-gating equations and treats them with the exponential Euler method and the forward Euler method, respectively. The partitioning strategy of the RL method is based on previous work by Moore and Ramon, with the main difference being that the Moore–Ramon (MR) method integrates the non-gating equations with Heun’s method, a two-stage, second-order explicit Runge–Kutta (ERK2) method. Although the RL method is less computationally expensive per step than the MR method, it should not be a foregone conclusion that the RL is more efficient. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the MR method typically outperforms the RL method in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, two new families of numerical methods are proposed based on the same partitioning strategy but integrating the non-gating equations with other ERK2 methods and multi-stage, first-order Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev methods, respectively. We show that the RL method is outperformed on 34 out of 36 cell models tested.},

The possibility of two endemic equilibria when R 0 &lt; 1 urges the system through backward bifurcation at R 0 = 1 R0=1 also verified using center manifold theory. The media awareness parameters influence the occurrence of backward bifurcation. An optimal control problem is framed considering a media intervention parameter u ( t ) as a control variable. The existence and characterization of the optimal solution to the problem solved analytically. Optimal media control strategy with accessible media intervention cost gradually reduce the prevalence of the disease. In addition to our analytical results, several numerical simulations are also performed to make the analysis more significant.

By the modified mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) approach, new stability criteria of DSTSs are obtained in both nonlinear and linear contexts, which are less conservative and more applicable in practice than those existing results. The design of stabilizing controller for linear DSTSs also is addressed by using LMIs. At last, three numerical examples with some comparisons to the existing results are involved to illustrate the superiority of the results in the paper.},

  abstract     = {The paper deals with the event-triggered fault detection filter design problem for continuous-time networked polynomial-fuzzy-model-based (PFMB) systems. Unlike some existing results, a novel polynomial event-triggered mechanism (PETM) is introduced to reduce the network resource occupancy. Moreover, the resultant event-triggered conditions are checked only at each sampling instant. A polynomial fault detection filter (PFDF), whose membership functions (MFs) and fuzzy rules are different from the considered PFMB systems, is designed to ensure the augmented PFMB fault detection system is asymptotically stable with H ∞ performance. The communication delay in communication network transmission is also considered. By adopting an appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii (L-K) functional, the sum of square (SOS)-based design conditions are less conservative and time-delay dependent. Two examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However the topological heuristic strategies neglect important features of the spreading dynamics and consequently may cannot yield reliable results. In this paper, we present a novel network immunization strategy based on explosive percolation and message passing, which considers both the network topology and epidemic dynamic. We compare its performance with the greedy strategy, topological heuristic strategy and random strategy. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our method on a variety of real-world examples.},

It is proved that the present method is unconditionally stable. Convergence analysis of the method is discussed. We prove that the method is ( 2 − α ) (2−α) th order convergence with respect to time variable and fourth order convergence with respect to space variable. Three test problems are considered to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the new method. It is shown that the rate of convergence predicted theoretically is the same as that obtained experimentally. Numerical results have been compared with those reported previously in literature.

  abstract     = {We consider a wave propagation problem in 2D, reformulated in terms of a Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) in the space-time domain. For its solution, we propose a numerical scheme based on a convolution quadrature formula by Lubich for the discretization in time, and on a Galerkin method in space. It is known that the main advantage of Lubich’s formulas is the use of the FFT algorithm to retrieve discrete time integral operators with a computational complexity of order R log R , R being twice the total number of time steps performed. Since the discretization in space leads in general to a quadratic complexity, the global computational complexity is of order M 2 R log R and the working storage required is M 2 R / 2 , where M is the number of grid points on the domain boundary. To reduce the complexity in space, we consider here approximant functions of wavelet type. By virtue of the properties of wavelet bases, the discrete integral operators have a rapid decay to zero with respect to time, and the overwhelming majority of the associated matrix entries assume negligible values. Based on an a priori estimate of the decaying behaviour in time of the matrix entries, we devise a time downsampling strategy that allows to compute only those elements which are significant with respect to a prescribed tolerance. Such an approach allows to retrieve the temporal history of each entry e (corresponding to a fixed couple of wavelet basis functions), via a Fast Fourier Transform, with computational complexity of order R ¯ e log R ¯ e . The parameter R ¯ e depends on the two basis functions, and it satisfies R ¯ e ≪ R for a relevant percentage of matrix entries, percentage which increases significantly as time and/or space discretization are refined. Globally, the numerical tests show that the computational complexity and memory storage of the overall procedure are linear in space and time for small velocities of the wave propagation, and even sub-linear for high velocities.},

In order to complete the calculation of uncertain information, the paper introduces a complex calculation method and establishes an interval decision model. The simulated experiment results show that the situation matrix proposed in this paper could represents the uncertainty in the battle field, and the interval decision method could process data effectively.

Through analysis, the formation optimization problem is transformed into a 0–1 nonlinear programming problem. In order to solve the problem quickly, the paper presents a genetic algorithm based on chaotic search optimization. When the method given in this paper is applied to specific requirements, only the constraint conditions need to be modified, so the method has good universality.

Using these results, the theoretical approximate formulae of the minimum non-zero eigenvalue and the maximum eigenvalue of Supra-Laplacian for partially interdependent networks are derived, respectively. The outcomes in this paper are more general and need fewer calculations than that in the literature [13] , [14] . Finally, the simulations and applications of synchronizability and diffusion process verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

  abstract     = {Complexity-entropy causality plane analysis and large deviations spectrums theory are proposed to study time series. The entropy plane analysis depicts the complexity of a system in two-dimensional plane, while large deviations theory shows the spectral structure of time series in the way of multifractal. In this paper, we combine the characteristics of these two popular methods and propose a generalized entropy plane model based on the large deviation theory. The methodology is applied to both synthetic data and financial markets. We discuss the impact of the parameters on the results in detail. Besides, the modified model can distinguish different time series. Meanwhile, we compare our results with the original complexity-entropy causality plane and large deviations spectrums, and the consistency of these results is confirmed. The method can provide abundant dynamical properties of complex systems.},

The switching dynamics among the operation modes are considered to be governed by a high level with average dwell time switching (ADTS) and a low level with stochastic Markov switching. Many practical systems such as general economic model subject to unpredictable structural changes can be described by switching Markov jump systems (SMJSs) with generally incomplete transition rates. By resorting to average dwell time switching approach, sufficient conditions are proposed to ensure the underlying system exponentially mean-square stable.

The X-ray attenuation parameters have been evaluated at six energies widely used in diagnostic radiology namely; 13.8, 22.1, 33.2, 59.9, 88 and 99 keV. The mass attenuation coefficient (MAC) has been calculated and the effect of the glass composition on this parameter was discussed. The results demonstrated that the increment of Gd 2 O 3 in the glasses gave rise to an increase in the MAC at 13.8 keV, 59.9 keV, 88 keV and 99 keV. While, at 22.1 keV and 33.2 keV, NbGd0 has the highest MAC, which means that MAC decreases with the addition of Gd 2 O 3 .The MAC values at 13.8 keV are higher for the present glasses than at other energies (in order of 48.89 to 52.84 cm 2 /g at this energy). The maximum effective atomic number was found to the sample with 2.5 mol% of Gd 2 O 3 , whereas the minimum Z eff values were found for NbGd0.The X-ray attenuation parameters of the selected glasses were compared with several types of glass systems, and commercial glasses.

The initial assignment scheme for guides based on clustering algorithm , taking the numbers of both informed and uninformed pedestrians into consideration, is studied. The guide choice method for informed followers based on an exponent model, considering the distance to the guide and the follower quantity, is further investigated. On the basis of the modeling method of this paper, evacuation behavior dynamics under guides is explored, from which the leading role of guides can be clearly observed. The effects of guide quantity, parameter in the guide choice method and the size of visual field on evacuations are analyzed. Simulation results indicate that the evacuation efficiency gradually increases with the increase of guide quantity until it reaches a certain level, and the optimal number of guides is closely related to the initial distribution of pedestrians. The combination of density factor and distance factor with a reasonable proportion when determining which guide is very necessary. Pedestrians have stronger evacuation ability within a certain period of time when continuously increasing their visual radii.

Results indicate that the ANN model predicts the experimental data with very high accuracy. Values of Nusselt number resulted from experiments and those obtained from the ANN have at most 9% difference, this value is 9.6% for the pressure drop. Multi-objective optimization was implemented with the aim of minimizing the total pressure drop and maximizing the nanofluids Nusselt number in the STHE according to NSGA-II algorithm. In optimization procedure nanofluids pressure drop and the Nusselt number (tube-side) was evaluated by the ANN model. To find the shell-side pressure drop method of Delaware was employed. Nanofluids concentration and Reynolds number were selected as decision parameters. The Pareto front was obtained. The best solution adopted from points on the Pareto front by two well-known decision-making methods LINMAP and TOPSIS. The Nusselt number of optimal solutions are about 30% greater than the base fluid and pressure drop of optimal solutions are about 10% lower than the base fluid.},

The two approximations to be assessed are the Finite Volume-Complete Flux (FV-CF) and the Enhanced Numerical Approximation of a Transport Equation (ENATE) schemes. They were proposed by the two groups that co-author the current paper. Both schemes share many similarities in 1D but differ, especially in 2D, in some aspects that will be highlighted. In their derivation the algebraic coefficients of the computational stencil are integrals of flow parameters whose calculation is crucial for the accuracy of either method. These factors and their various approximations will be analysed. Some test cases will be used to check the ability of both schemes to provide accurate results.},

While taking into consideration the occurrence of a delay in one boundary condition, the dynamics of the platform and the load mass are taken into consideration. Furthermore, the modulus of the cable is assumed to vary. Besides, the mathematical model of the crane system is assumed to have no displacement term. Then, a distributed (interior) damping feedback law is proposed so that one can exclude any possible negative impact of the delay. Indeed, invoking the frequency domain method, we show that the solutions of the closed-loop system must exponentially converge to a stationary position. This outcome improves the recent result obtained in [3], where the rate of convergence of solutions of the system without the interior damping is at most of polynomial type. The relevance of the theoretical findings is shown through several numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the ND-agent scheduling of linear-deteriorating tasks on a single machine with positional due indices. Under the ND-agent setting, there are two agents A and B and each agent X ∈ { A, B } has its set of tasks T ( X ) , T(X), called X -tasks. Moreover, ND-agent means that T ( A ) T(A) and T ( B ) T(B) are allowed to be non-disjoint, which is a generalization of the traditional two-agent setting. Each task has a linear-deteriorating processing time and a positional due index. In this paper, we consider two problems: The first problem is to find a feasible schedule which minimizes the total completion time of the A -tasks under the condition that the maximum cost of the B -tasks is bounded by a threshold value. The second problem is the Pareto scheduling problem to minimize the total completion time of the A -tasks and the maximum cost of the B -tasks, simultaneously. We show in this paper that the two problems are solvable in O ( n 2 ) time and in O ( n 4 ) time, respectively. If the maximum cost of the tasks of agent B is restricted to some lateness-like criteria, for the version without the positional restriction, the time complexity for solving the above two problems can be reduced to O ( n log n ) and O ( n 3 log n ), respectively. Our research includes a new technique for calculating the number of non-dominated points.},

It has been an interesting topic of research to find mappings from the binary vectors to permutations of the same length such that the Hamming distance is preserved or increased. As a natural variation we introduce the Hamming gap of radius r between two permutations, which is, in a way, equivalent to the number of digits where the corresponding pair of entries differ by at least r . This is called the r -Hamming gap. We first discuss the properties of this new concept. We then show mappings from binary vectors to permutations such that the images of a pair of binary vectors (at Hamming distance d ) have r -Hamming gap at least d . We also show the generalization of our findings to permutations on Z n Zn (where n ≡ 0) instead of [ n ].},

  abstract     = {It has been known that numerical solutions to Helmholtz problems obtained using several numerical methodologies (e.g. finite element approach) are always plagued by the pollution error effect particularly for high wave numbers, giving rise to erroneous results of numerical acoustic wave . To mitigate this effect, a truly meshfree technique using a local weak form and radial basis functions is employed to analyze acoustic problems. On the basis of the local Petrov–Galerkin weak form, numerical integration is performed over the quadrature domains related to all field nodes, instead of the mesh grid required in the global Galerkin weak form like finite element approach and element-free Galerkin method . Hence, the present methodology is totally independent of the mesh grid either in forming shape functions, or in the integration procedure for system matrices. Also, owing to the use of radial point interpolation by passing all the relevant nodes, the constructed shape functions hold the practical feature of the Kronecker delta function , resulting in easy enforcement of the essential boundary condition as in finite element approach. The results of several numerical examples have shown that with same group of field nodes the present methodology can lead to much more accurate solutions than finite element approach, in particular for relatively high frequencies, and can also generate comparable solutions in comparison to other global Galerkin meshfree techniques.},

By use of the character of the element and some special techniques, the superclose estimation in the H 1 -norm is deduced for the TGM scheme. Furthermore, the global superconvergent result is derived through interpolation postprocessing skill.

The proposed combined algorithm is called PA . Moreover, six closely related and well performing algorithms in the literature are modified to the problem, and PA is compared with these six algorithms. Extensive computational experiments reveal that PA reduces the error of the best modified algorithm by more than 50% for the same CPU times.

In this paper, we focused on the problem of static output feedback stabilization of NDFA under the framework of matrix semi-tensor product (matrix STP). First, the dynamics of Moore-type NDFA can be described as a discrete-time bilinear expression by a matrix-based modeling approach. Subsequently, equilibrium point and closed transition matrix of NDFA are introduced, and the corresponding computational formulas are given based on the new matrix expression. By utilizing the matrix STP approach, we can obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions to implement the static state output feedback stabilization for NDFA. Meanwhile, starting from the matrix STP, we designed a systematic procedure to seek the controller through an extended output feedback feasible event set. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to prove the efficacy of newly proposed method. Current results are conducive to better understand and devise the effective finite automata for discrete event systems.},

With the parametric method, the closed-loop system can be converted into a linear constant one with desired eigenstructure. Simultaneously, it also considers a novel technique to multi-objective optimization. Multiple performance indexes such as regional pole assignment, low sensitivity, disturbance attenuation, robustness degree and low gains are formulated by arbitrary parameters. Based on the above indexes, a synthetic objective function which includes each performance index weighted is formulated to express the comprehensive performances of control system . By using the degrees of freedom in arbitrary parameters, a dynamic compensator can be established by solving a multi-objective optimization problem.

The system under study contains unknown nonlinear functions and unmeasured states, which make it difficult or even impossible to check the assumption of input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to the measurement errors. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and the backstepping design technique, actual controllers for every subsystem and the corresponding triggering mechanism are designed at the same time, which removes the ISS assumption demanded in most literature. The proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded under a class of switching signals with average dwell time and the tracking errors can converge to a small residual near the origin. Simulation examples are also given to illustrate the validity of the proposed scheme.},

A generalized structure for the observer is employed to deal with a large number of systems, considering both non-singular and singular systems. The proposed observer scheme is based on non-strict and strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are derived using the concepts of generalized Lyapunov theory, uncertainty bounds, quadratic inner-boundedness, one-sided Lipschitz condition , matrix transformations, and L 2 gain minimization criteria. The proposed state filtering approach is robust for disturbances with asymptotically stable estimation error dynamics under zero external perturbations and attenuation of disturbance effects to keep the estimation error within prescribed limits. In comparison to the conventional observer designs for the one-sided Lipschitz systems, the presented scheme is based on a generalized observer and can deal with parametric uncertainties. A numerical simulation example and an application example of spring-mass-damper system are provided to verify the effectiveness of the suggested filtering schemes.},

The set of governing equations accounting for mass conservation and momentum and energy balance is first presented for the coupling method, followed by implementation details within a finite-volume framework. Steady numerical simulations focus on two classical problems: porous plug flow and the Beavers and Joseph problem. Both are successfully performed, demonstrating the feasibility and capability of this approach. An unsteady problem of flow over a square porous cylinder is then modeled; and results are compared with those from the existing literature, demonstrating the accuracy of the method for unsteady cases.},

  abstract     = {We propose a method, called ACQUIRE, for the solution of constrained optimization problems modeling the restoration of images corrupted by Poisson noise. The objective function is the sum of a generalized Kullback–Leibler divergence term and a TV regularizer, subject to nonnegativity and possibly other constraints, such as flux conservation. ACQUIRE is a line-search method that considers a smoothed version of TV, based on a Huber-like function, and computes the search directions by minimizing quadratic approximations of the problem, built by exploiting some second-order information. A classical second-order Taylor approximation is used for the Kullback–Leibler term and an iteratively reweighted norm approach for the smoothed TV term. We prove that the sequence generated by the method has a subsequence converging to a minimizer of the smoothed problem and any limit point is a minimizer. Furthermore, if the problem is strictly convex, the whole sequence is convergent. We note that convergence is achieved without requiring the exact minimization of the quadratic subproblems ; low accuracy in this minimization can be used in practice, as shown by numerical results. Experiments on reference test problems show that our method is competitive with well-established methods for TV-based Poisson image restoration, in terms of both computational efficiency and image quality .},

  abstract     = {Numerically obtaining the inverse of a function is a common task for many scientific problems, often solved using a Newton iteration method. Here we describe an alternative scheme, based on switching variables followed by spline interpolation, which can be applied to monotonic functions under very general conditions. To optimize the algorithm, we designed a specific ultra-fast spline routine. We also derive analytically the theoretical errors of the method and test it on examples that are of interest in physics. In particular, we compute the real branch of Lambert’s W ( y ) function, which is defined as the inverse of x exp ( x ), and we solve Kepler’s equation. In all cases, our predictions for the theoretical errors are in excellent agreement with our numerical results, and are smaller than what could be expected from the general error analysis of spline interpolation by many orders of magnitude, namely by an astonishing 3 × 10 − 22 3×10−22 factor for the computation of W in the range W ( y ) ∈ [0, 10], and by a factor 2 × 10 − 4 2×10−4 for Kepler’s problem. In our tests, this scheme is much faster than Newton-Raphson method, by a factor in the range 10 − 4 10−4 – 10 − 3 10−3 for the execution time in the examples, when the values of the inverse function over an entire interval or for a large number of points are requested. For Kepler’s equation and tolerance 10 − 6 10−6 rad, the algorithm outperforms Newton’s method for all values of the number of points N ≥ 2.},

Pattern avoidance in ascent sequences was first studied by Ducan and Steingrímsson in 2011, while the systematic study of patterns in inversion sequences was initiated only recently by Corteel–Martinez–Savage–Weselcouch and Mansour–Shattuck. In this paper, we investigate systematically the enumeration of inversion or ascent sequences avoiding vincular patterns of length 3, where two of the three letters are required to be adjacent. Our results connect restricted inversion sequences and ascent sequences to a number of well-known combinatorial sequences including Bell numbers, Fishburn numbers, Powered Catalan numbers, Semi-Baxter numbers and the number of 3-noncrossing partitions. A variety of combinatorial bijections, known or newly constructed, are applied to achieve these interesting connections.},

Using the heat equation as a model problem, random walks are designed to emulate the action of the Laplace–Beltrami operator without evolving or reconstructing the probability density function . The intensity of perturbations is fitted to the value of the rotary diffusion coefficient in the deterministic model. Simplified forms of Brownian motion generators are derived for rotated reference frames, and several practical approaches to generating random walks on a sphere are discussed. The alternatives considered in this work include projections of Cartesian random walks, as well as polar random walks on the tangential plane. In addition, we explore the possibility of using look-up tables for the exact cumulative probability of perturbations.

When being free of nonlinear disturbances, a necessary and sufficient condition for the consensus (resp. stability) problem is presented, which essentially shows that the coupling weights and topology structure suffice to assure the consensus (resp. stability) of the agents. Whereas, nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix also act a crucial role, provided that merely the absolute information of the auxiliary variable is demanded. The derived results implicitly manifest that structurally balanced graph (resp. isolated structurally balanced graph or containing the in-isolated structurally balanced subgraph) is merely the necessary condition for the consensus (resp. stability) of the agents within the second-order dynamical setting. In the presence of nonlinear dynamics , we explicitly extend the derived results with the help of the Lyapunov-based technique under quite mild assumptions.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an integrable semi-discrete and full-discrete analogues of the modified coupled integrable dispersionless (mCID) equation that was derived recently as a two-component generalization of CID equation. The key of the integrable discretization is to find the relation between the mCID equation and the sine-Gordon equation. We complete the integrable discrete analogues based on the discrete sine-Gordon equation. Numerical simulation of one-soliton, two-soliton and breather solution are conducted based on the integrable semi-discrete scheme. We also present the Casorati determinant solution in parametric form of N -soliton solutions for the semi-discrete analogue of the mCID equation. We show that the continuum limit of the full-discrete mCID equation leads to the semi-discrete mCID equation.},

Furthermore, based on DSC technique, a modified FO filter is designed to avoid the issue of the “explosion of complexity” generated by the traditional backstepping control design approach. Moreover, based on the recursive technique and an indirect Lyapunov method , an adaptive controller is constructed to ensure that all the signals of FO closed-loop systems are bounded.

This model takes account of peculiarities of deformation characteristics of the considered class of composites: the possibility of deforming without failure at finite deformations, a considerable difference between diagrams of deforming under tension and under compression, a dependence of the diagrams on a loading rate, the presence of pseudoplastic properties of materials caused by pulling threads from the fabric etc. Viscoelastic features of aramid fibres are taken into account as well. In addition, the model considers the damage and breakage of fibres in textile composites in their punching. A problem statement is formulated for dynamic deforming of textile composites. To solve the problem in its two-dimensional statement we applied the band adaptive grid method. The problem on punching a textile composite shield by a hard striker was solved numerically, and the computed results were compared with experimental data on punching the aramid textile composite plates.},

  abstract     = {This paper makes a first attempt to use a new localized method of fundamental solutions (LMFS) to accurately and stably solve the inverse Cauchy problems of two-dimensional Laplace and biharmonic equations in complex geometries. The LMFS firstly divides the whole physical domain into several small overlapping subdomains, and then employs the traditional method of fundamental solutions (MFS) formulation in every local subdomain for calculating the unknown coefficients on the local fictitious boundary. After that, a sparse linear system is formed by using the governing equation for interior nodes and the nodes on under-specified boundary, and by using the given boundary conditions for the nodes on over-specified boundary. Finally, the numerical solutions of the inverse problems can be obtained by solving the resultant sparse system. Compared with the traditional MFS with the “global” boundary discretization, the LMFS requires less computational cost, which may make the LMFS suitable for solving large-scale problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed LMFS for the inverse Cauchy problems of two-dimensional Laplace and biharmonic equations with noisy boundary data.},

With the use of AUTO and Matlab we classify the various regions separating the number of homogeneous steady-states solutions and analyze their stability, which turns out to be very rich. We discover a zoology of traveling wave solutions displaying a variety of interesting characteristics. Through this analysis we can make conclusions about the factors leading to different characteristics which have been observed in different riots. For example, the analysis provides evidence that the 2005 French riots were tension-inhibitive (where rioting helps release tension) versus tension-enhansing (where rioting slows down the release of tension).},

To reduce the computational problem, the full model is estimated in two steps, and a meticulous model of the nonlinear temperature effect is included using regression spline techniques.

It is shown that the first entropy monotonicity formula is intimately related to the concavity of the power of Shannon entropy and Fisher Information , from which the associated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for probability measure in Euclidean setting is recovered.

  abstract     = {This work examines the H ∞ H∞ performance state estimation problem for memory static neural networks (MSNNs) with reliable state feedback stochastic sampled-data control (SSDC). The purpose of presenting this study is to determine whether the H ∞ H∞ performance and criteria with less conservatism for stability could be gained by SSDC for MSNNs or not. Firstly, we suppose that the sampling interval values follow Bernoulli distribution and the probability of occurrence are teadfast constant, then generalize it to a more universal form. Secondly, on basis of considering the sampling input delay and its sawtooth structure characteristics, a modified augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is constructed on account of the free-matrix-based integral inequality (FMBII) together with generalized free-weighting-matrix (GFWM) inequality, which can reduce the conservatism of H ∞ H∞ performance criteria. Thirdly, the expected estimator gain matrix can be designed in the light of the solution to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an numerical example is given to check the superiority of the proposed MSNNs control design technique.},

  abstract     = {An outer independent double Roman dominating function (OIDRDF) of a graph G is a function h from V ( G ) to {0, 1, 2, 3} for which each vertex with label 0 is adjacent to a vertex with label 3 or at least two vertices with label 2, and each vertex with label 1, is adjacent to a vertex with label greater than 1; and all vertices labeled by 0 is independent. The weight of an OIDRDF h is ∑ w ∈ V ( G ) h ( w ), and the outer independent double Roman domination number γ oidR ( G ) is the minimum weight of an OIDRDF on G . In this article, we provide various bounds on γ oidR ( G ) and we show that its determining is NP-complete on chordal and bipartite graphs . Moreover, we establish Nordhaus–Gaddum bounds for γ o i d R ( G ) + γ o i d R ( G ¯ ) . γoidR(G)+γoidR(G¯).},

  abstract     = {The detection of abnormal lung sounds collected by electronic stethoscopes plays a fundamental role in pulmonary disease diagnostics for primary care and general patient monitoring in telemedicine . Over the past 40 years, the detection has been performed mainly by supervised learning. This method, however, is time- and cost-consuming, and error-prone because it requires manual labeling large numbers of samples. This work proposes a new method, a graph-based semi-supervised one class support vector machine (OCSVM). It can describe normal lung sounds and detect the abnormal ones only by using a small amount of labeled normal samples and abundant unlabeled samples as training samples, which avoids the shortcomings of the traditional methods. A spectral graph is constructed to indicate the relationship of all the samples, which enriches the information provided by only a small number of labeled normal samples. Then, a graph-based semi-supervised OCSVM model is built and its solution is provided. Employing the information in the spectral graph, the proposed method can enhance the effect of recognition and generalization which are crucial for the effective detection of abnormal lung sounds. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with all the samples collected in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province, China. The experimental results show that the method outperforms the original OCSVM when the labeled samples are rare. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed method becomes better as unlabeled abnormal samples increase.},
