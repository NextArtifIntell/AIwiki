Our conditions are satisfied by probabilities on Euclidean space with a general (bounded or unbounded) convex support which are not covered by Figalli. We also provide some additional results about center-outward distribution and quantile functions, including the fact that quantile sets exhibit a limiting form of the so-called “lighthouse convexity” property.},

  abstract     = {Principal component analysis (PCA) for binary data, known as logistic PCA, has become a popular alternative to dimensionality reduction of binary data. It is motivated as an extension of ordinary PCA by means of a matrix factorization , akin to the singular value decomposition , that maximizes the Bernoulli log-likelihood. We propose a new formulation of logistic PCA which extends Pearson’s formulation of a low dimensional data representation with minimum error to binary data. Our formulation does not require a matrix factorization , as previous methods do, but instead looks for projections of the natural parameters from the saturated model. Due to this difference, the number of parameters does not grow with the number of observations and the principal component scores on new data can be computed with simple matrix multiplication. We derive explicit solutions for data matrices of special structure and provide a computationally efficient algorithm for solving for the principal component loadings. Through simulation experiments and an analysis of medical diagnoses data, we compare our formulation of logistic PCA to the previous formulation as well as ordinary PCA to demonstrate its benefits.},

  abstract     = {Among undirected graph models , the β β -model plays a fundamental role and is widely applied to analyze network data. It assumes the edge probability is linked with the sum of the strength parameters of the two vertices through a sigmoid function . Because of the univariate nature of the link function, this formulation, despite its popularity, can be too restrictive for practical applications, even with a straightforward extension of the link function. For example, it is possible that vertices with similar strength parameters are more likely to be connected, in which case the edge probability depends on the distance of the strength parameters. Such common cases are not included in the β β -model or its immediate extensions. In this paper, we propose a bivariate gamma model that links the edge probability with the two strength parameters by a symmetric bivariate function. The proposed model is more flexible than the β β -model and its existing variants. It is also applicable to mirror various undirected networks. We show some special but representative cases of the bivariate gamma model by considering sparsity, mixture and other modifications, which cannot be properly handled by the β β -model. Asymptotic theory is established to justify the consistency and asymptotic normality of the moment estimators . Numerical studies present evidence in support of the theory and an example involving real data further illustrates the applications.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this paper is to develop a new framework of surface functional models (SFM) for surface functional data which contains repeated observations in two domains (typically, time-location). The primary problem of interest is to investigate the relationship between a response and the two domains, where the numbers of observations in both domains within a subject may be diverging. The SFMs are far beyond the multivariate functional models with two-dimensional predictor variables . Unprecedented complexity presented in the surface functional models, such as possibly distinctive sampling designs and the dependence between the two domains, makes our models more complex than the existing ones. We provide a comprehensive investigation of the asymptotic properties of the local linear estimator of the mean function based on a general weighting scheme, including equal weight (EW), direction-to-denseness weight (DDW) and subject-to-denseness weight (SDW), as special cases. Moreover, we can mathematically categorize the surface data into nine cases according to the sampling designs (sparse, dense, and ultra-dense) of both the domains, essentially based on the relative order of the number of observations in each domain to the sample size. We derive the specific asymptotic theories and optimal bandwidth orders in each of the nine sampling design cases under all the three weighting schemes. The three weighting schemes are compared theoretically and numerically. We also examine the finite-sample performance of the estimators through simulation studies and an autism study involving white-matter fiber skeletons.},

In this situation, the linear predictors and the link functions are not necessarily the same. The quasi-Fisher information matrix is obtained by using the method of generalized estimating equations. Then locally optimal designs for multivariate generalized linear models are investigated under the D- and A-optimality criteria. It turns out that under certain assumptions the optimality problem can be reduced to the marginal models. More precisely, a locally optimal saturated design for the univariate generalized linear models remains optimal for the multivariate structure in the set of all saturated designs. Moreover, the general equivalence theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition under which the saturated design is locally D-optimal in the set of all designs. The results are applied for multivariate models with gamma-distributed responses. Furthermore, we consider a multivariate model with univariate gamma models having seemingly unrelated linear predictors . Under this constraint, locally D- and A-optimal designs are found as product of all D- and A-optimal designs, respectively for the marginal counterparts.},

  abstract     = {Graphical modelling techniques based on sparse estimation have been applied to infer complex networks in many fields, including biology and medicine, engineering, finance and social sciences. One structural feature of some of these networks that poses a challenge for statistical inference is the presence of a small number of strongly interconnected nodes, which are called hubs. For example, in microbiome research hubs or microbial taxa play a significant role in maintaining stability of the microbial community structure. In this paper, we investigate the problem of estimating sparse networks in which there are a few highly connected hub nodes. Methods based on L 1 L1 -regularization have been widely used for performing sparse estimation in the graphical modelling context. However, while these methods encourage sparsity, they do not take into account structural information of the network. We introduce a new method for estimating networks with hubs that exploits the ability of (inverse) covariance estimation methods to include structural information about the underlying network. Our method is a weighted lasso approach with novel row/column sum weights, which we refer to as the hubs weighted graphical lasso. A practical advantage of the new method is that it leads to an optimization problem that is solved using the efficient graphical lasso algorithm that is already implemented in the R package glasso (Friedman et al., 2019). We establish large sample properties of the method when the number of parameters diverges with the sample size. We then show via simulations that the method outperforms competing methods and illustrate its performance with an application to microbiome data.},

  abstract     = {Categorical data are often observed as counts resulting from a fixed number of trials in which each trial consists of making one selection from a prespecified set of categories. The multinomial distribution serves as a standard model for such data but assumes that trials are independent and identically distributed. Extensions such as the Dirichlet-multinomial and random-clumped multinomial distribution can express positive association, where trials are more likely to result in a common category due to membership in a common cluster. This work considers a Conway–Maxwell-multinomial (CMM) distribution for modeling clustered categorical data exhibiting positively or negatively associated trials. The CMM distribution features a dispersion parameter which allows it to adapt to a range of association levels and includes several recognizable distributions as special cases. We explore properties of CMM, illustrate its flexible characteristics, identify a method to efficiently compute maximum likelihood (ML) estimates, present simulations of small sample properties under ML estimation , and demonstrate the model via data analysis examples.},

This testing problem occurs, for instance, when checking the goodness-of-fit or the effect of some infinite-dimensional covariates in regression models for functional data. Testing the independence, between a finite dimensional variable and a functional one, is another example that could be treated in our framework. We propose a new test based on kernel smoothing. The test statistic is asymptotically standard normal under the null hypothesis provided the smoothing parameter tends to zero at a suitable rate. The one-sided test is consistent against any fixed alternative, as well as against local alternatives à la Pitman and uniformly against classes of regular alternatives approaching the null hypothesis. In particular, we show that neither the dimension of the outcome nor the dimension of the functional covariates influences the theoretical power of the test against such alternatives. Simulation experiments and a real data application using a variable-domain functional regression model illustrate the performance of the new test.},

  abstract     = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) describe the relationship between two stochastic processes, namely, an observed outcome process and an unobservable finite-state transition process. Given their ability to model dynamic heterogeneity, HMMs are extensively used to analyze heterogeneous longitudinal data . A majority of early developments in HMMs assume that observation times are discrete and regular. This assumption is often unrealistic in substantive research settings where subjects are intermittently seen and the observation times are continuous or not predetermined. However, available works in this direction restricted only to certain special cases with a homogeneous generating matrix for the Markov process . Moreover, early developments have mainly assumed that the number of hidden states of an HMM is fixed and predetermined based on the knowledge of the subjects or a certain criterion. In this article, we consider a general continuous-time HMM with a covariate specific generating matrix and an unknown number of hidden states. The proposed model is highly flexible, thereby enabling it to accommodate different types of longitudinal data that are regularly, irregularly, or continuously collected. We develop a maximum likelihood approach along with an efficient computer algorithm for parameter estimation. We propose a new penalized procedure to select the number of hidden states. The asymptotic properties of the estimators of the parameters and number of hidden states are established. Various satisfactory features, including the finite sample performance of the proposed methodology, are demonstrated through simulation studies. The application of the proposed model to a dataset of bladder tumors is presented.},

Under ultra-high dimensional settings, a screening procedure is generally suggested before variable selection to reduce computational costs. However, most existing screening methods examine the marginal correlations, thus not suitable to discover the conditional dependence in graphical models . To overcome this issue, we propose a new procedure called graphical uniform joint screening (GUS) for edge identification in graphical models. Instead of screening out edges nodewisely, GUS utilizes a uniform threshold for all statistics indicating the significance of different edges to adapt to various kinds of graphical structures. We demonstrate that GUS enjoys the sure screening property and even the screening consistency by preserving the rankings of the significant edges. Furthermore, a scalable implementation of GUS is developed for big data applications. Simulation and real data studies are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The likelihood principle plays a prominent role in developing powerful statistical inference tools. In this context, we raise the question: can the univariate likelihood function based on a random vector be used to provide the uniqueness in reconstructing the vector distribution? In multivariate normal (MN) frameworks, this question links to a reverse of Cochran’s theorem that concerns the distribution of quadratic forms in normal variables. We characterize the MN distribution through the univariate likelihood type projections. The proposed principle is employed to illustrate simple techniques for assessing multivariate normality via well-known tests that use univariate observations. The displayed testing strategy can exhibit high and stable power characteristics in comparison to the well-known procedures in various scenarios when observed vectors are non-MN distributed, whereas their components are normally distributed random variables. In such cases, classical multivariate normality tests, such as Shapiro–Wilk’s, Henze–Zirkler’s and Mardia’s tests, may break down completely.},

The emphasis is on the case where the number of classes is bigger than two. We first deal with the asymptotic misclassification rates of linear discrimination rules under various conditions. In practical high-dimensional classification problems, it is reasonable to assume certain sparsity conditions on the class means and the common precision matrix. Our theoretical study reveals that with known sparsity structures an asymptotically optimal linear discrimination rule can be constructed. Motivated by the theoretical result, we propose a linear discrimination rule constructed based on estimated sparsity structures which is dubbed as linear discrimination with detected sparsity (LDwDS). The asymptotic optimality of LDwDS is established. Numerical studies are carried out for the comparison of LDwDS with other existing methods. The numerical studies include a comprehensive simulation study and two real data analyses. The numerical studies demonstrate that the LDwDS has an edge in terms of misclassification rate over all the other methods under consideration in the comparison.},

We develop sparse regularization methodology for estimating the skewness parameters of these two distributions. This methodology facilitates skewness selection, i.e., the identification of those marginal indices of skewness, if any, that are equal to zero. Obstacles that render skewness selection infeasible for existing parameterizations of the two distributions are described, and a new parameterization that permits the circumvention of those obstacles is introduced. A penalized likelihood method for sparsity-based regularized skewness estimation using the new parameterization is proposed. Model selection consistency and the oracle property of the method are established. A simulation study demonstrates that the method is reasonably effective for skewness selection and, because of inclusion of a ridge penalty, is more effective at preventing the divergence of the shape parameter in small samples than the Q Q -penalty approach of Azzalini and Arellano-Valle (2013). The simulation study demonstrates further that our method may improve the estimation of all parameters of the MSN and MST distributions, not merely the skewnesses, when some of the skewnesses are zero.},

The employment of a suitable linear operator in place of hypergeometric functions and zonal polynomials was conjectured by de Waal in (1972). Here we show how the umbral operator accomplishes this task and consequently represents an alternative tool to deal with these symmetric functions. When special formal variables are plugged in the variables, the evaluation through the umbral operator deletes all the monomials in the latent roots except those contributing in the elementary symmetric functions . Cumulants further simplify the computations taking advantage of the convolution structure of the polynomial trace. Open problems are addressed at the end of the paper.},

In recent work, (Cao et al., 2019), we established high-dimensional sparsity selection consistency for a hierarchical Bayesian DAG model, where an Erdös–Renyi prior is placed on the sparsity pattern in the Cholesky factor L L , and a DAG-Wishart prior is placed on the resulting non-zero Cholesky entries. In this paper we significantly improve and extend this work, by (a) considering more diverse and effective priors on the sparsity pattern in L L , namely the beta-mixture prior and the multiplicative prior, and (b) establishing sparsity selection consistency under significantly relaxed conditions on p p , and the sparsity pattern of the true model. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results via numerical simulations, and also use further simulations to demonstrate that our sparsity selection approach is competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods including both frequentist and Bayesian approaches in various settings.},

For this purpose, we focus on the vector correlation coefficient, ρ V ρV and propose an extension of its classical estimator which is constructed to correct potential sources of inconsistency related to the high dimensionality. Building on the proposed estimator of ρ V ρV , we derive the new test statistic and study its limiting behavior in a general high-dimensional asymptotic framework which allows the vector’s dimensionality arbitrarily exceed the sample size. Specifically, we show that the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the main hypothesis of independence is standard normal and that the proposed test is size and power consistent. Using our statistics , we further construct the step-down multiple comparison procedure based on the closed testing strategy for the simultaneous test for independence. Accuracy of the proposed tests in finite samples is shown through simulations for a variety of high-dimensional scenarios in combination with a number of alternative dependence structures . Real data analysis is performed to illustrate the utility of the test procedures.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the problem of functional data clustering . Functional data have their own characteristics and contain rich information that cannot be obtained when regarding the data as multivariate data . Functional data are inherently infinite-dimensional, so classical clustering techniques for finite-dimensional data may not be suitable for functional data. There are several clustering methods for functional data based on probabilistic models or basis expansion approaches. However, most of these depend on the symmetric structure of the model or the mean response; hence, these cannot reflect characteristics of the distribution of data beyond the mean, such as behavior at the extremes. In this paper, we propose a new approach for functional data clustering based on the concept of an asymmetric norm. For this purpose, we consider pseudo-quantiles, such as M-quantiles and expectiles, and their corresponding curves that can provide rich distributional information about hidden structures in the data at various levels. Moreover, as a theoretical justification for the proposed method, a strong consistency property is investigated. Results from numerical examples, including real data analysis, demonstrate the promising empirical properties of the proposed approach.},

Once new data become available, the previously estimated parameter needs updating. Shrinkage provides the means to this end, using the latter as a shrinkage target to acquire an updated estimate. The process of iteratively updating the Gaussian graphical model in shrinkage fashion is shown to yield an improved fit and an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator. The workings of updating via shrinkage are elucidated by linking it to Bayesian updating and through the inheritance by the update of eigen-properties of the previous estimate. The effect of shrinkage on the moments and loss of the estimator are pointed out. Practical issues possibly hampering updating are identified and solutions outlined. The presented updating procedure is illustrated through the reconstruction of a gene–gene interaction network using transcriptomic data.},

For each variable, we construct the corresponding marginal classifier according to the Bayes rule and thus classification accuracy of these marginal classifiers can be used as effective feature screening indexes to select all important variables. Not only for a fixed number of classes but also for a diverging number of classes, we can prove that the proposed method enjoys the sure screening property under some regularity conditions .

We also discuss a decomposition of the causal effect on product outcomes into marginal and joint causal effects , which respectively provide information on treatment effect on the marginal (product) structure of the product outcomes and on the outcomes’ dependence structure . We propose to model the distribution of the potential outcomes conditional on pre-treatment variables using the class of log-mean linear regression models, which is particularly appealing because all the causal estimands of interest and the decomposition into marginal and joint causal effects can be easily derived by model parameters.

  abstract     = {Hierarchical models are the workhorse of much of Bayesian analysis , yet there is uncertainty as to which priors to use for hyperparameters. Formal approaches to objective Bayesian analysis , such as the Jeffreys-rule approach or reference prior approach, are only implementable in simple hierarchical settings. It is thus common to use less formal approaches, such as utilizing formal priors from non-hierarchical models in hierarchical settings. This can be fraught with danger, however. For instance, non-hierarchical Jeffreys-rule priors for variances or covariance matrices result in improper posterior distributions if they are used at higher levels of a hierarchical model. Berger et al. (2005) approached the question of choice of hyperpriors in normal hierarchical models by looking at the frequentist notion of admissibility of resulting estimators. Hyperpriors that are ‘on the boundary of admissibility’ are sensible choices for objective priors, being as diffuse as possible without resulting in inadmissible procedures. The admissibility (and propriety) properties of a number of priors were considered in the paper, but no overall conclusion was reached as to a specific prior. In this paper, we complete the story and propose a particular objective prior for use in all normal hierarchical models, based on considerations of admissibility, ease of implementation and performance.},

We propose sup-Wald, sup-quasi-likelihood ratio and sup-Lagrange multiplier statistics for testing functionals restrictions uniformly over the support for both finite and infinite dimensional components of the parameters. The trinity of three statistics holds because they are asymptotically equivalent and can be strongly approximated by a sequence of chi-squared processes. Based on these results, we can, for instance, construct confidence intervals and uniform confidence bands for the unknown functions, the partial derivatives of the unknown functions and the functional combinations of the two parameters.},

The test is based on a modified multivariate kurtosis defined for directional data on S d Sd . We first reveal a relationship between the multivariate kurtosis and the types of modality for Euclidean data. In particular, the kurtosis of a rotationally symmetric distribution with decreasing sectional density is greater than the kurtosis of the uniform distribution, while the kurtosis of that with increasing sectional density is less. For directional data, we show an asymptotic normality of the modified spherical kurtosis, based on which a large-sample test is proposed. The proposed test of modality is applied to the problem of preventing overfitting in non-geodesic dimension reduction of directional data. The proposed test is superior than existing options in terms of computation times, accuracy and preventing overfitting. This is highlighted by a simulation study and two real data examples.},

  abstract     = {Factor models have been proposed for a broad range of observed variables such as binary, Gaussian, and variables of mixed types. They typically model a pairwise interaction parameter matrix with a low-rank and a diagonal component. The low-rank component can be interpreted as the effect of a few latent quantitative variables which are common in social science applications. Another line of research has investigated graphical models for the same types of observed variables, where the pairwise interactions are usually assumed to be sparse. Sparse network structures are often found in the natural sciences. Still overall, while factor and sparse models are suitable for many applications, they sometimes might not be expressive enough to fit certain data well. This has motivated the confluence of factor and graphical models , yielding models where the interaction parameters are decomposed into respectively sparse and low-rank components. Up to now, this has only been done separately for observed Gaussian and for observed binary variables, but never jointly. The present work accomplishes a unified treatment of pairwise sparse and low-rank models. It does so by simultaneously allowing observed binary and quantitative (conditional Gaussian) variables. The model parameters of the joint model can be estimated using a convex regularized likelihood optimization problem. We show that the resulting estimator has consistency properties in the high-dimensional setting.},

Multivariate binary time series data are used in many fields such as biology and environmental sciences. However, modeling the dynamics in multiple binary time series is not an easy task. Most existing methods model the joint transition probabilities from marginals pairwisely for which the resulting cross-dependency may not be flexible enough. Our proposed model, Bernoulli VAR (BerVAR) model, is constructed using latent multivariate Bernoulli random vectors. The BerVAR model represents the instantaneous dependency between components via latent processes, and the autoregressive structure represents a switch between the hidden vectors depending on the past. We derive the mean and matrix-valued autocovariance functions for the BerVAR model analytically and propose a quasi-likelihood approach to estimate the model parameters. We prove that our estimator is consistent under mild conditions. We perform a simulation study to show the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators and to compare the prediction power with existing methods for binary time series. Finally, we fit our model to time series of drought events from different regions in Mexico to study the temporal dependence, in a given region and across different regions. By using the BerVAR model, we found that the cross-region dependence of drought events is stronger if a rain event preceded it.},

These assumptions may be violated easily in practice and a robust estimator is desired. In this paper, we consider the case where the correlation matrix has a sparse Kronecker structure and propose a robust estimator based on Kendall’s τ τ correlation. The proposed estimator is extended further to tensor data. The theoretical properties of the estimator are established, showing that Kronecker structure actually increases the effective sample size and leads to a fast convergence rate. Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to bigraphical model, obtaining an estimator of better convergence rate than the existing results.

Such an interval can help improve the performance of various estimation methods for ν ν , such as restricting the parameter space or validating the assumptions for the asymptotic properties of the estimator. The test statistic is built on recursive applications of the Laplace operator to the observations. For this statistic , the fixed-domain asymptotic normality is established and the forms of asymptotic mean and variance are derived. Therefore, the proposed tests are guaranteed to have correct asymptotic size under certain conditions. Simulation studies indicate that our proposed methods are efficient for moderate sample sizes . As an application of the chain-like testing procedure, we provide a method of choosing the number of differencing for a local Whittle-likelihood type estimator of ν ν proposed by Wu, Lim, and Xiao, and show that it can avoid obtaining inconsistent estimates of ν ν via a numerical experiment.},

  abstract     = {In applied research, it is often sensible to account for one or several covariates when testing for differences between multivariate means of several groups. However, the “classical” parametric multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) tests ( e.g. , Wilks’ Lambda) are based on quite restrictive assumptions (homoscedasticity and normality of the errors), which might be difficult to justify. Furthermore, existing potential remedies ( e.g. , heteroskedasticity-robust approaches) become inappropriate in cases where the covariance matrices are singular or close to singular. Nevertheless, such scenarios are frequently encountered in the life sciences and other fields, when, for example, in the context of standardized assessments, a summary performance measure as well as its corresponding subscales are analyzed. Moreover, computational issues may also lead to singular covariance structures . In the present manuscript, we consider a general MANCOVA model, allowing for potentially heteroskedastic and even singular covariance matrices as well as non-normal errors. We combine heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimation methods with our proposed modified MANCOVA ANOVA-type statistic (MANCATS) and apply two different bootstrap approaches . We provide the proofs of the asymptotic validity of the respective testing procedures as well as the results from an extensive simulation study, which indicate that especially the parametric bootstrap version of the MANCATS outperforms its competitors in most small-sample scenarios, both in terms of type I error rates and power. These considerations are further illustrated and substantiated by examining real-life data from standardized achievement tests. Yet, for large sample sizes, Wald-type approaches are an attractive alternative option. Moreover, the choice between Wald-type and MANCATS-based tests might depend on the particular setting ( e.g. , the covariance structure, or the alternative under consideration).},

  abstract     = {The Wasserstein barycenter is an important notion in the analysis of high dimensional data with a broad range of applications in applied probability, economics, statistics , and in particular to clustering and image processing. In this paper, we state a general version of the equivalence of the Wasserstein barycenter problem to the n n -coupling problem. As a consequence, the coupling to the sum principle (characterizing solutions to the n n -coupling problem) provides a novel criterion for the explicit characterization of barycenters. Based on this criterion, we provide as a main contribution the simple to implement iterative swapping algorithm (ISA) for computing barycenters. The ISA is a completely non-parametric algorithm which provides a sharp image of the support of the barycenter and has a quadratic time complexity which is comparable to other well established algorithms designed to compute barycenters. The algorithm can also be applied to more complex optimization problems like the k k -barycenter problem.},

This paper introduces a BiConvex Blockwise Regularization (BCBR) sparse estimator for the precision matrix (inverse of the covariance matrix) of high dimensional multivariate longitudinal responses. Using the modified Cholesky block decomposition, we impose a block banded structure on the Cholesky factor and sparsity on the innovation variance matrices via a novel convex hierarchical penalty and lasso penalty, respectively. The blockwise banding structure is a generalization of the existing banding structure for univariate longitudinal data . An efficient alternative convex optimization algorithm is developed by using ADMM algorithm. The resulting estimators are shown to converge in an optimal rate of Frobenius norm , and the exact bandwidth recovery is established for the precision matrix. Simulations and real-life data analysis show that the proposed estimator outperforms its competitors.},

Analogous transforms exist on compact Riemannian manifolds , X X , in that for each distribution with continuous positive density on X X , there is a continuous mapping of X X to itself that transforms the distribution into the uniform distribution. In general, this mapping is far from unique. This paper introduces the construction of an almost-canonical version of such a probability integral transform . The construction is extended to shape spaces, Cartan–Hadamard manifolds, and simplices. The probability integral transform is used to derive tests of goodness of fit from tests of uniformity. Illustrative examples of these tests of goodness of fit are given involving (i) Fisher distributions on S 2 S2 , (ii) isotropic Mardia–Dryden distributions on the shape space Σ 2 5 Σ25 .

  abstract     = {This paper concerns large covariance matrix estimation via composite minimization under the assumption of low rank plus sparse structure. In this approach, the low rank plus sparse decomposition of the covariance matrix is recovered by least squares minimization under nuclear norm plus l 1 l1 norm penalization. The objective is minimized via a singular value thresholding plus soft thresholding algorithm. This paper proposes a new estimator based on an additional least-squares re-optimization step aimed at un-shrinking the eigenvalues of the low rank component estimated in the first step. We prove that such un-shrinkage causes the final estimate to approach the target as closely as possible in spectral and Frobenius norm , while recovering exactly the underlying low rank and sparsity pattern. The error bounds are derived imposing that the latent eigenvalues scale to p α pα and the maximum number of non-zeros per row in the sparse component scales to p δ pδ , where p p is the dimension, α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] α∈[0,1] , δ ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 5 ] δ∈[0,0.5] , and δ δ&amp;lt;α . The sample size n n is imposed to scale at least to p 1 . 5 δ p1.5δ . The resulting estimator is called UNALCE (UNshrunk ALgebraic Covariance Estimator), and it is shown to outperform state-of-the-art estimators, especially for what concerns fitting properties and sparsity pattern detection. The effectiveness of UNALCE is highlighted by a real example regarding ECB (European Central Bank) banking supervisory data.},

Further, we show that the weight functions for scatter must satisfy a critical scaling condition, which is implicitly fulfilled both by the Gaussian and by Tyler’s weight function. We generalize this principal result by introducing the class of power weight functions, which contains the two aforementioned weight functions as limiting cases. A simulation study confirms our theoretical findings.

Multivariate functional data occur naturally and frequently in modern applications, and extending independent component analysis to this setting allows us to distill important information from this type of data, going a step further than the functional principal component analysis. To allow the inversion of the covariance operator we make the assumption that the dependency between the component functions lies in a finite-dimensional subspace. In this subspace we define fourth cross-cumulant operators and use them to construct the two novel, Fisher consistent methods for solving the independent component problem for vector-valued functions. Both simulations and an application on a hand gesture data set show the usefulness and advantages of the proposed methods over functional principal component analysis.},

When such datasets are too big to be analyzed entirely by a single centralized computer, or when datasets are already stored in distributed database systems, the strategy of divide-and-combine has been the method of choice for scalability. Due to partition, the sub-dataset sample sizes may be uneven and some possibly close to p p , which calls for regularization techniques to improve numerical stability. However, there is a lack of clear theoretical justification and practical guidelines to combine results obtained from separate regularized estimators, especially when the final objective is simultaneous inference for a group of regression parameters . In this paper, we develop a strategy to combine bias-corrected lasso-type estimates by using confidence distributions. We show that the resulting combined estimator achieves the same estimation efficiency as that of the maximum likelihood estimator using the centralized data. As demonstrated by simulated and real data examples, our divide-and-combine method yields nearly identical inference as the centralized benchmark.},

Generally, the complete case analysis and the two stage procedure can be used to extend existing full data classification methods to deal with classification with missing class labels. Nevertheless, these two approaches cannot take full advantage of unlabeled subjects. In this paper, binary classification with the class label missing at random (MAR) is considered. Based on the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method and the augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) method, two new methods called IPW–CPC and AIPW–CPC are proposed to construct powerful classifiers by estimating the conditional probability in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Compared with the complete case analysis and the two stage procedure, the proposed IPW–CPC and AIPW–CPC methods can make the best use of unlabeled subjects, which contributes a lot to improving classification accuracy. Theoretically, we show that conditional misclassification rates of the proposed classifiers converge to the Bayes misclassification rate in probability and rates of convergence are also obtained. Finally, simulations and the real data analysis well demonstrate good performances of the proposed IPW–CPC and AIPW–CPC methods in comparison with existing methods.},

We investigate some properties of Koziol’s measures of multivariate kurtosis which motivate their use in statistical practice. Firstly, we show some of their connections with Mahalanobis angles. Secondly, we use inequalities to highlight their connections with other measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis. Thirdly, we obtain their analytical formulae for some well-known multivariate statistical models. Simple examples illustrate the interpretation of Koziol’s measures of multivariate kurtosis and detect a wrong statement about them which appeared in the statistical literature.

  abstract     = {Measuring and testing conditional dependence are fundamental problems in statistics . Imposing mild conditions on Rosenblatt transformations (Rosenblatt, 1952), we establish an equivalence between the conditional and unconditional independence, which appears to be entirely irrelevant at the first glance. Such an equivalence allows us to convert the problem of testing conditional independence into the problem of testing unconditional independence. We further adopt the Blum–Kiefer–Rosenblatt correlation (Blum et al., 1961) to develop a test for conditional independence , which is powerful to capture nonlinear dependence and is robust to heavy-tailed errors. We obtain explicit forms for the asymptotic null distribution which involves no unknown tunings, rendering fast and easy implementation of our test for conditional independence. With this conditional independence test, we further propose a conditional screening method for high dimensional data to identify truly important covariates whose effects may vary with exposure variables. We use the false discovery rate to determine the screening cutoff. This screening approach possesses both the sure screening and the ranking consistency properties. We illustrate the finite sample performances through simulation studies and an application to the gene expression microarray dataset.},

To overcome the weak identifiability issues, we fit the model using a penalized Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and develop sequential locally restricted likelihood ratio tests to determine the number of components in the Gaussian mixture. Our work is motivated by an application to nationwide kidney transplant center evaluation in the United States, where the patient-level post-surgery outcomes are repeated measures of the care quality of the transplant centers. By taking into account patient-level risk factors and modeling the center effects by a finite Gaussian mixture model , the proposed model provides a convenient framework to study the heterogeneity among the transplant centers and controls the false discovery rate when screening for transplant centers with non-standard performance.},

We study the degrees of freedom of two polyhedral convex regularization classes defined through submodular functions called the Lovász extension regularization and submodular norm regularization. It has been pointed out that submodular regularization contains many existing penalties that induce structural sparsity. In this paper, we show that the degrees of freedom of submodular regularization estimators can be represented in terms of partitions induced by the estimators. Our formula does not depend on the choice of the design matrix and the penalty function. Moreover, if the design matrix has full column rank, calculating an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom requires an additional computational cost of only O(plogp) after a solution for the estimator is obtained, where p is the dimension of the parameter. Existing results for some regularization and projection type estimators , such as the lasso, the fused lasso, and the isotonic regression, are also recovered.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the multivariate estimation of a vector of Poisson means. A novel loss function that penalises bad estimates of each of the parameters and also the sum (or equivalently the mean) of the parameters is introduced. Under this loss function, a class of minimax estimators that uniformly dominate the maximum likelihood estimator is derived. Crucially, these methods have the property that for estimating a given component parameter, the full data vector is utilised. Estimators in this class can be fine-tuned to limit shrinkage away from the maximum likelihood estimator, thereby avoiding implausible estimates of the sum of the parameters. Further light is shed on this new class of estimators by showing that it can be derived by Bayesian and empirical Bayesian methods. In particular, we exhibit a generalisation of the Clevenson–Zidek estimator, and prove its admissibility . Moreover, a class of prior distributions for which the Bayes estimators uniformly dominate the maximum likelihood estimator under the new loss function is derived. A section is included involving weighted loss functions, notably also leading to a procedure improving uniformly on the maximum likelihood method in an infinite-dimensional setup. Importantly, some of our methods lead to constructions of new multivariate models for both rate parameters and count observations. Finally, estimators that shrink the usual estimators towards a data based point in the parameter space are derived and compared.},

This provides a direct access not only to the posterior distribution of the portfolio weights but also to their point estimates together with uncertainties and their asymptotic distributions . Furthermore, we present the posterior predictive distribution for the investor’s wealth at each time point of the investment period in terms of a stochastic representation for the future wealth realization. This in turn makes it possible to use quantile-based risk measures or to calculate the probability of default, i.e the probability of the investor wealth to become negative. We apply the suggested Bayesian approach to assess the uncertainty in the multi-period optimal portfolio by considering assets from the FTSE 100 in the weeks after the British referendum to leave the European Union. The behaviour of the novel portfolio estimation method in a precarious market situation is illustrated by calculating the predictive wealth, the risk associated with the holding portfolio, and the probability of default in each period.},

It is a fundamental research question to detect a set of nodes sharing similar connectivity patterns in time-evolving networks. Our work is primarily motivated by detecting groups based on interesting features of the time-evolving networks (e.g., stability). In this work, we propose a model-based clustering framework for time-evolving networks based on discrete time exponential-family random graph models , which simultaneously allows both modeling and detecting group structure. To choose the number of groups, we use the conditional likelihood to construct an effective model selection criterion . Furthermore, we propose an efficient variational expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm to find approximate maximum likelihood estimates of network parameters and mixing proportions. The power of our method is demonstrated in simulation studies and empirical applications to international trade networks and the collaboration networks of a large research university.},

  abstract     = {Three major difficulties are identified with an established echelon form approach (see Hannan (1987)) to specifying a Vector Autoregressive Moving Average, V A R M A VARMA , model for an observed time series. A family of state space representations, valid for each integer, h h , is introduced, and collectively referred to as multistep state space representations. This family includes as its special case, with h = 0 h=0 , a state space representation introduced earlier by Akaike (1974), and, with h = 1 h=1 , that introduced by Cooper and Wood (1982). Appropriate generalizations of the notions of minimality , McMillan degree, left matrix fraction description and Kronecker indices, as applicable individually to each member of this family, are presented. The reverse echelon form and state space representation corresponding to the Kronecker indices for each h h are derived, and the former illustrated with three examples of standard V A R M A VARMA processes. The question of how the presence of zero constraints on the coefficients of a reverse echelon form may be detected solely from an inspection of the Kronecker indices is examined. A canonical correlation procedure proposed originally by Akaike (1976) for h = 0 h=0 is considered for estimating the Kronecker indices with each h h . The efficacy of the estimation procedure is investigated by a simulation study. A procedure is suggested for implementing the new approach introduced in this paper with an observed time series, and three different applications of this approach are outlined. This approach is also related to some of its alternatives, including the Kronecker invariants of Poskitt (1992) and the scalar component approach of Tiao and Tsay (1989).},
