  abstract     = {In this work, an updated version of the homogeneous anisotropic hardening (HAH 20 ) model proposed by Barlat et al. (2020) is implemented into a finite element framework through a stress integration algorithm . To improve the convergence of this model inside the integration algorithm, the algorithmic step sizes of the solution variable increments are controlled by the line-search method. The HAH 20 20 implementation is validated by comparing the simulation results obtained from the finite element analysis with those calculated by stand-alone HAH 20 code. In addition, the simulation results of tests, including strain path changes such as tension–compression and cross-loading, are compared with experimental measurements, and the effectiveness of the step size control in the current HAH 20 model is investigated. The performance of the implemented algorithm is analyzed through convergence maps for critical strain path change simulations.},

  abstract     = {Electro-active polymers (EAPs) are increasingly becoming popular materials for actuators, sensors, and energy harvesters . To simulate the complex behaviour of actuators under coupled loads, particularly in the realm of soft robotics, biomedical engineering and energy harvesting , finite element simulations are proving to be an indispensable tool. In this work, we present a novel finite element framework for the simulation of coupled static and dynamic electromechanical interactions in electro-active polymeric materials. To model the incompressible nature of EAPs, a two-field mixed displacement–pressure formulation which, unlike the commonly-used mixed three-field and F F -bar formulations, is applicable for both nearly and fully incompressible materials , is employed. For the spatial discretisation , innovative quadratic Bézier triangular and tetrahedral elements are used. The governing equations for the coupled electromechanical problem are solved using a monolithic scheme; for elastodynamics simulations, a state-of-the-art implicit time integration is adapted. The accuracy and the computational efficiency of the proposed framework are demonstrated by studying several benchmark examples in computational electromechanics which include simulations of a spherical gripper in elastostatics and a dielectric pump in elastodynamics. Such complex simulations clearly depict the advantages of the proposed finite element framework over the Q1/P0 and Q1- F F -bar elements. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed framework in accurately capturing complex coupled electromechanical interactions in thin electro-active polymeric shells is demonstrated by studying a thin helical actuator under different excitation frequencies and by reproducing buckling instabilities in thin semi-cylindrical and semi-spherical shells. With the ability to simulate various elastostatics and elastodynamics phenomena using a single finite element framework for bulk as well as thin dielectric elastomers while using coarse structured or unstructured meshes that can be readily generated using existing mesh generators, this novel framework offers a robust, accurate, and computationally efficient numerical framework for computational electromechanics.},

  abstract     = {Liquids are one of the fundamental components for the functionality of a wide range of mechanical equipment (e.g. for lubrication, cooling, hydraulic, etc.). However, they could lead to secondary issues such as corrosion or contamination, caused, for instance, due to leakage of the liquid. As investigating the equipment during their operation is not always possible (e.g. for rotary machinery or in case of high-temperature working conditions), locating the origin of the leakage could be a challenging task, especially if the only traces left behind are a few droplets. In the present work, an algorithm for prediction of the leakage position, i.e. position of the injector, is developed. In order to guarantee intelligence and enhance flexibility, the designed algorithm is powered by a machine learning approach, Convolutional Neural Network. The developed algorithm is based upon using different deposition patterns, calculated by numerical simulations, as the input. The robust algorithm is designed to be so intelligent that it could ideally traceback (predict) the leakage location (i.e. reconstruct the droplet history) by only an image of the deposition.},

  abstract     = {The statistical model is commonly used in the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). However, it is difficult to obtain sufficient data to construct a reasonable statistical model in the practical engineering. The biased statistical model seriously reduces the accuracy of uncertainty modeling and further affects the validity of the optimal result of RBDO. In this paper, the uncertainty of statistical model caused by the insufficient data is taken into consideration, which is quantified by the confidence of failure probability . Confidence-based design optimization (CBDO) is used to ensure the validity of the optimal result, and thus the double-loop RBDO is replaced by the time-consuming treble-loop CBDO. To reduce the heavy computational cost, a complete performance measure approach (PMA) with single-loop strategy is proposed in this paper and performance measure value is applied in the whole optimization process. The modified second-order reliability method (SORM) is employed to replace the time-consuming MCS and calculate the minimum performance target point (MPTP) of the reliability constraint function. Then, the reliability analysis is integrated into the confidence level evaluation process by single-loop strategy. Four examples are used to verify the performance of the proposed method in this paper. All results have demonstrated that the proposed method only needs much lower computational cost but its accuracy is similar to the previous CBDO.},

The kinematic descriptions involve only displacements of the beam axis, which are approximated by non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves. Translational displacements of the control points are here considered as control variables. The motivation of this work is to propose a penalty-free method to handle in-plane dynamic analysis of multi-patch beam structures. A simple relation between cross-sectional rotations at the ends of the beams and control variables is derived, allowing the incorporation of the end rotations as degrees of freedom. This improved setting can straightforwardly tackle beam structures with many rigid multi-patch connections, a major challenging issue when using existing isogeometric Euler–Bernoulli beam formulations. Additionally, rotational boundary conditions are conveniently prescribed. Numerical examples with complicated beam structures such as circular arches and frames with kinks are considered to show the accuracy and performance of the developed formulation. The computed results are verified with those derived from the conventional finite element method , and the superior convergence properties of the proposed formulation are illustrated. A possible extension of the present approach to spatial beam structures is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Due to its ability to simulate complex microstructure evolution , the phase-field modeling has been extensively developed to investigate brittle fracture in recent years. However, low computational efficiency still imposes substantial difficulties in the development of phase-field models. In this work, we develop a novel adaptive phase-field approach based on the isogeometric meshfree collocation method (IMCM) to simulate the crack propagation in 2D and 3D polycrystalline materials . The concept of IMCM is based upon the correspondence between the isogeometric collocation and reproducing kernel meshfree method to facilitate a robust mesh adaptivity in isogeometric collocation. The strong form collocation formulation further enhances the computational efficiency of phase-field modeling by reducing the number of point evaluations. The present numerical framework is utilized for the adaptive phase-field modeling which introduces the anisotropy of fracture resistance for each grain in polycrystals . Furthermore, the discrete displacement and phase-field equations are generalized to enable the calculation of both second- and fourth-order gradients, which are required to solve the phase-field models using IMCM. The smoothness and higher-order continuity of IMCM enable the fourth-order phase-field equation to be solved directly without splitting it into two second-order differential equations. The fourth-order model can capture the crack surface accurately with fewer nodes than the second-order model. Several numerical examples of isotropic and anisotropic brittle fracture in polycrystalline materials are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.},

In contrast to state-of-the-art model reduction methods that are intrusive and thus require full knowledge of the governing equations and the operators of a full model of the discretized dynamical system, the proposed approach requires only the non-polynomial terms in analytic form and learns the rest of the dynamics from snapshots computed with a potentially black-box full-model solver. The proposed method learns operators for the linear and polynomially nonlinear dynamics via a least-squares problem, where the given non-polynomial terms are incorporated on the right-hand side. The least-squares problem is linear and thus can be solved efficiently in practice. The proposed method is demonstrated on three problems governed by partial differential equations , namely the diffusion–reaction Chafee–Infante model, a tubular reactor model for reactive flows, and a batch-chromatography model that describes a chemical separation process. The numerical results provide evidence that the proposed approach learns reduced models that achieve comparable accuracy as models constructed with state-of-the-art intrusive model reduction methods that require full knowledge of the governing equations.},

For rapid convergence, it is important that the resulting coarse spaces have good approximation properties. In our approach, the approximation quality can be directly improved by including more spectral degrees of freedom in the coarsening process. Further, by exploiting local coarsening and a piecewise-constant approximation when evaluating the nonlinear component, the coarse level problems are assembled and solved without ever re-visiting the fine level, an essential element for multigrid algorithms to achieve optimal scalability. Numerical examples comparing relative performance of the proposed nonlinear multigrid solvers with standard single-level approaches—Picard’s and Newton’s methods—are presented.

Using a standard matrix-based approach within the Finite Element Method requires lots of memory, which eventually becomes a serious bottleneck. A matrix-free approach overcomes this problem and greatly reduces the amount of required memory, allowing to solve larger problems on available hardware. One key challenge is concerned with the crack irreversibility for which a primal–dual active set method is employed. Here, the active set values of fine meshes must be available on coarser levels of the multigrid algorithm. The developed multigrid method provides a preconditioner for a generalized minimal residual (GMRES) solver. This method is used for solving the linear equations inside Newton’s method for treating the overall nonlinear-monolithic discrete displacement/phase-field formulation. Several numerical examples demonstrate the performance and robustness of our solution technology. Mesh refinement studies, variations in the phase-field regularization parameter , iterations numbers of the linear and nonlinear solvers, and some parallel performances are conducted to substantiate the efficiency of the proposed solver for single fractures , multiple pressurized fractures, and a L-shaped panel test in three dimensions .},

In this paper, we present overlapping Schwarz preconditioners for elliptic problems discretized with isogeometric analysis based on GB-splines. An h h -analysis of the proposed preconditioners shows an optimal convergence rate bound that is scalable in the number of subdomains and that is linear in the ratio between subdomain and overlap sizes. Numerical results in two- and three-dimensional tests confirm this analysis and also illustrate the good convergence properties of the preconditioner with respect to the discretization parameters, the domain deformation and the jumping coefficients.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel methodology for the solution of nonlinear problems using the Stable Generalized/eXtended Finite Element Method (SGFEM) in two-scale approach. The nonlinear analysis is performed in a coarse mesh and the solution of a local problem, represented by a fine mesh, is used to enrich the partition of unity of the coarse mesh in the so-called global–local strategy. The SGFEM is adopted to deal with the problem of ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix triggered by the enrichment strategy. Here, this problem is investigated for the first time for global–local analysis of physically nonlinear problem. In addition to the use of SGFEM, it is noteworthy that the relationship between the incremental-iterative process and changes in the constitutive variables are simultaneously updated on both scales. Differently from original GFEM global–local strategies, the evolution of the state variables is conduced only in the global scale. The local problem heritages the material degradation of the global scale, by using a mapping technique, and provides the numerically obtained functions that enriches the global approximation . Different constitutive models and material laws are adopted to incorporate the material degradation. Numerical examples are presented for validating this approach and to show its generality and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we deal with a probability-based scale bridging for concrete material when passing the detailed information at the meso-scale (the scale where the aggregate vs. cement microstructure is visible) with a Voronoi-cell based microstructure representation towards the chosen reduced model at the macro-scale (the scale where the concrete is a homogenized continuum) with a stochastic plasticity model for localized failure. This is accomplished by using Bayesian inference providing the probability distributions of the macro-scale model parameters expressed as random variables (RV) in order to compensate for the model reduction from the meso-scale, where parameters are expressed as random fields (RF). The original aspect of this approach is in the resulting macro-scale stochastic plasticity model, which can best quantify the uncertainty due to data loss in terms of the corresponding probability distribution of its parameters. The proposed procedure is illustrated in detail for the concrete meso-scale model presented in Part I of this paper (see Karavelić et al. (2019)), both for the simple elastic response, as well as for the plastic response with hardening in the fracture process zone (FPZ), followed by a softening response in the localized failure phase. This context of localized failure implies that the classical homogenization procedure no longer applies, and should be replaced by a macro-scale reduced model defined with respect to a quantity of interest (QoI), which is not necessarily the same for each particular response phase. The complete set of results for the parameter identification is combined together at the macro-scale in terms of a solid finite element with embedded discontinuity (ED-FEM), granting it very powerful predictive properties. The particular choice of ED-FEM for the macro-scale reduced model allows one to compute the QoI at an element-level, either as strain energy for the elastic response, or as plastic dissipation for each failure mode. Thus, the Bayesian inference computation of the probability distributions of the RVs representing the macro-scale model parameters, performed by matching such QoI results computed for the macro-scale and the meso-scale models, reduces to a homogenization-type procedure within a probabilistic setting that can successfully handle any case where the separation of scales no longer applies.},

  abstract     = {Ill conditioning of system matrices is one of the drawbacks of Generalized/eXtended IsoGeometric Analysis (GIGA/XIGA), which results in increase in computational cost in the case of iterative solvers or erroneous results in the case of direct solvers. Linear dependency between the basis functions which can be measured in terms of smallest angle among all the bases is one of the attributes of ill conditioning in XIGA. In the present study, a simplified method to find the smallest angle among all the bases is introduced. Also to reduce the problem of ill conditioning, Orthogonalized Generalized IsoGeometric Analysis (OGIGA) is proposed in which the standard and the corresponding enriched basis functions are orthogonalized. In order to study the performance of present method, various fracture mechanics problems like 2-D homogenous cracks, bi-material interface cracks , inclined cracks and 3-D crack problems are chosen. The effect of crack position and the radius of enrichment zone on accuracy, scaled condition number and smallest angle among all the bases is studied. The results obtained from the proposed OGIGA method are compared with results obtained from standard XIGA and XIGA with enrichment function orthogonalization (OE-XIGA) (Agathos et al., 2019). In all the cases considered, the conditioning of system matrices is significantly improved by employing present methodology and it can be easily extended to wide variety of problems.},

The finite element implementation of the latter is detailed. Computational efficiency of the Lagrange multiplier approach is highlighted in an example involving regularization of strain localization . The numerical performance improvement is shown to reach up to two orders of magnitude in computation time speedup. Then, size effects predicted by micromorphic and Lagrange multiplier based formulations of strain gradient plasticity are assessed. First of all numerical comparisons are performed on single crystal wires in torsion. Saturation of the size effects induced by the micromorphic approach and absence of saturation with the Lagrange multiplier approach when sample size is decreased are demonstrated. The Lagrange multiplier based formulation is finally applied to characterize size effects predicted for the ductile growth of porous unit-cells at imposed stress triaxiality . Excellent agreement with micromorphic results is obtained.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the boiling phase change is particularly challenging for Lagrangian particle methods due to a high density ratio and dramatic volume expansion. In this study, the incompressible moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method and the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method are coupled to develop an incompressible–compressible particle method for modeling a multiphase flow with boiling. The coupling strategies developed by Lind et al . (JCP, 2016) are adopted. A high speed of sound must be employed in SPH for incompressible bubbles in a heavy liquid under gravity, which can cause severe spurious pressure fluctuations. In this situation, a technique for detecting bubble connectivity is developed to average the pressure inside each bubble for stable coupling. This pressure averaging strategy is physically consistent due to the high density ratio. Because the pressure coupling strategy tends to break the force balance between the surface tension and the pressure jump across the interface, the surface tension model must be based only on the liquid particles near the interface. The boiling mass transfer is modeled in a straightforward manner by injecting gas particles towards the gas phase from the liquid interface particles. The gas volume expansion is naturally considered by the coupling method, as the gas particle distribution can be automatically regulated in the SPH calculation. Rising bubble simulations with different surface tension coefficients and density ratios verify the proposed method for a bubble flow. The Stefan and sucking problems as well as a horizontal film boiling flow are simulated to verify the boiling model and to demonstrate its straightforward capability to handle gas volume expansion.},

In realistic three-dimensional numerical simulations, these linear systems are large scale and ill-conditioned, thus they require the development of effective solvers. The aim of this work is the construction and numerical validation of parallel block preconditioners for a set of three-dimensional saddle point problems discretized by the low order virtual element method (VEM). VEM is a recent numerical technology for the approximation of PDEs on polygonal and polyhedral meshes. We focus on the following systems of PDEs: stationary Maxwell equations in the mixed Kikuchi formulation; elliptic equations in mixed form; Stokes system; linear elasticity in the mixed Hellinger–Reissner formulation. We provide two parallel block preconditioners: one based on the approximate Schur complement and the other on a regularization technique. Several numerical experiments are run in parallel on a Linux cluster. We analyze the performance of the iterative solvers in terms of GMRES iterations and computational time . We verify the robustness of the solvers with respect to different polyhedral meshes and the scalability of both the assembling and solution time by varying the number of processors. The performance of the two iterative solvers is also compared with state-of-the-art parallel direct linear solvers.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a new strategy to blend the outcome of physics-based numerical simulations with massive but poorly-labelled experimental databases such as in-situ data routinely recorded for monitoring purposes. The proposed approach relies on a set of adversarial learning techniques with a twofold purpose: (1) finding two reduced-dimensional non-linear representations of both synthetic and experimental data; (2) training a stochastic generator of fake experimental responses conditioned by the physics-based simulation results. This methodology is applied to earthquake ground motion prediction. Indeed, regional three-dimensional high-fidelity numerical models accounting for both extended sources and complex geology are still limited to a low-frequency range. Moreover, they are prone to significant uncertainties induced by a lack of data on small scale geological structures and rupture processes. Databases of broadband seismic signals recorded worldwide at seismological networks are used to retrieve some pieces of information on these small scale data to generate realistic broadband signals from synthetic ones. Outstanding performances in encoding seismic signals are demonstrated, together with efficient generation capabilities, provided that the physics-based results carry enough information to properly condition the stochastic generator. In addition, this paper shows that the proposed method, fed only with raw data from both databases and numerical models, outperforms other random signal generators based on pre-existing expertise such as prescribed spectra and more or less complex phenomenological models.},

The proposed SEFGM approximates displacement as the sum of a deterministic part and a stochastic part. The stochastic part is modelled with the help of an IRF, which is a function of discretized set of random variables . Moving least square shape functions are employed to discretize the random field. Utilizing Taylor series expansions of stiffness matrix and force vector and IRF approximation of displacement, explicit expressions for system responses in terms of random variables are derived. Stochastic informations of system responses are evaluated by employing Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) on the response function, which eliminates the need of construction and simulation of system matrices at each set of sample generation. 1D and 2D numerical examples in elasto-statics are solved using proposed method. Results are validated with those obtained by direct simulation of system of equations using MCS and also compared with other methods like second order perturbation and ad-hoc response function based SEFGM. Normalized computational times required for all the methods are also compared. It is found that the proposed method is computationally efficient and can produce accurate results even for higher coefficient of variation of input random fields.},

  abstract     = {While the theory of Bayesian system identification provides a probabilistic means for reliably and robustly inferring models of a dynamic system and their parameters based on measured dynamic response, exploiting sparseness during online tracking of changing model parameters is not well understood. The focus in this study is to implement the dual Kalman filter for real-time Bayesian sequential state and parameter identification based on noisy sensor signals while incorporating sparse Bayesian learning to impose sparse model parameter changes from their initial reference values. We also want out model to be able to capture the evolution of sparse model parameter changes between two successive time instants. To this end, we present a hierarchical Bayesian model for tracking the joint posterior distribution of the state and model parameter vectors for a monitored dynamical system, where the two afore-mentioned sparseness constraints (sparse changes from reference values and with time) are also effectively incorporated for each time. We show our stochastic model of the structural dynamical system can be represented as a coupled conditionally-linear Gaussian state space model for the state and model parameter vectors, leading to some interesting analytical properties of the method that allow quantities of interest to be calculated in real time by using Kalman filtering equations. The parameters for the measurement and state prediction errors are learned solely from the available data up to the current time and so our method resolves the well-known instability problem in Kalman filtering due to arbitrary assignment of the error-distribution parameters. Finally, two illustrative applications are presented, one for identification of stiffness degradation and the other for input time–history identification where both are based on noisy dynamic response measurements from a structure.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the outbreak dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for successful containment and mitigation strategies. Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019–February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.},

  abstract     = {The paper is concerned with the development of efficient and accurate solution procedures for the isogeometric boundary element method (BEM) when applied to problems that contain inclusions that have elastic properties different to the computed domain. This topic has been addressed in previous papers but the approach presented here is a considerable improvement in terms of efficiency and accuracy. One innovation is that initial stresses instead of body forces are used, resulting in discretised equations that can be written using matrix–vector multiplications. This allowed a one step solution to be implemented for elastic inclusions. In addition, a novel approach is used for the computation of strains, that avoids the use of highly singular fundamental solutions. Finally, a new type of inclusion is presented that can be used to model reinforcement bars or rock bolts and where analytical integration can be used. Test examples, where results are compared with Finite Element simulations, show that the proposed approach is sound.},

  abstract     = {We present a mixed finite element method for a five-field formulation of the Biot system of poroelasticity that reduces to a cell-centered pressure–displacement system on simplicial and quadrilateral grids. A mixed stress–displacement–rotation formulation for elasticity with weak stress symmetry is coupled with a mixed velocity–pressure Darcy formulation. The spatial discretization is based on combining the multipoint stress mixed finite element (MSMFE) method for elasticity and the multipoint flux mixed finite element (MFMFE) method for Darcy flow . It uses the lowest order Brezzi–Douglas–Marini mixed finite element spaces for the poroelastic stress and Darcy velocity , piecewise constant displacement and pressure, and continuous piecewise linear or bilinear rotation. A vertex quadrature rule is applied to the velocity, stress, and stress–rotation bilinear forms , which block-diagonalizes the corresponding matrices and allows for local velocity , stress, and rotation elimination. This leads to a cell-centered positive-definite system for pressure and displacement at each time step. We perform error analysis for the semidiscrete and fully discrete formulations, establishing first order convergence for all variables in their natural norms. The numerical tests confirm the theoretical convergence rates and illustrate the locking-free property of the method.},

Compared to continuous and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations, HDG reduces the computational cost by using the numerical traces for the global linear system , hence removing the degrees of freedom that are inside the cells. It is particularly attractive for large-scale time-harmonic quantitative inverse problems which make repeated use of the forward discretization as they rely on an iterative minimization procedure. HDG is based upon two levels of linear problems: a global system to find the solution on the boundaries of the cells, followed by local systems to construct the solution inside. This technicality requires a careful derivation of the adjoint-state method, that we address in this paper. We work with the acoustic wave equations in the frequency domain and illustrate with a three-dimensional experiment using partial reflection-data, where we further employ the features of DG-like methods to efficiently handle the topography with p p -adaptivity.},

  abstract     = {A generalized bond-based micropolar peridynamic model is proposed to simulate the nonlinear deformation and mixed-mode crack propagation of quasi-brittle materials under arbitrary dynamic loads. The mechanical behaviors of the material points are reformulated by incorporating the bond tension–rotation–shear coupling effects, which makes the model suitable for complex discontinuous problems in both three-dimensional spatial and two-dimensional plane conditions. The governing equations of the bond are established by employing the Timoshenko beam theory to simulate the interaction between material points as well as the bond coupling effect. Three kinds of peridynamic parameters, corresponding to the compressive, shear and bending stiffness of the bond, are introduced to keep the consistence of the strain energy obtained from the proposed peridynamic model and from the continuum mechanics under arbitrary deformation fields . Moreover, a novel energy-based failure criterion, involving the maximum stretch, shear strain and rotation angle limits of the bond, is proposed to describe the nonlinear behaviors and progressive failure for general quasi-brittle materials. The proposed model is verified by providing comparisons between its results and those from known analytical solutions and experimental observations. The influences of the bond tension–rotation–shear coupling effect as well as the applicability of the proposed model for the wave propagation, complex deformation and mix-mode fracture problems are also investigated. Results show that the proposed model with the bond coupling effect will greatly improve the simulation accuracy for dynamic problems of quasi-brittle materials under complex loading conditions. Results also indicate that the proposed model can well capture the nonlinear deformation, crack propagation, as well as progressive failure of materials with variable Poisson’s ratios under complex combined loads},

  abstract     = {Constitutive modeling is a cornerstone for stress analysis of mechanical behaviors of biological soft tissues. Recently, it has been shown that machine learning (ML) techniques, trained by supervised learning, are powerful in building a direct linkage between input and output, which can be the strain and stress relation in constitutive modeling. In this study, we developed a novel generic physics-informed neural network material (NNMat) model which employs a hierarchical learning strategy by following the steps: (1) establishing constitutive laws to describe general characteristic behaviors of a class of materials; (2) determining constitutive parameters for an individual subject. A novel neural network structure was proposed which has two sets of parameters: (1) a class parameter set for characterizing the general elastic properties; and (2) a subject parameter set (three parameters) for describing individual material response. The trained NNMat model may be directly adopted for a different subject without re-training the class parameters, and only the subject parameters are considered as constitutive parameters. Skip connections are utilized in the neural network to facilitate hierarchical learning. A convexity constraint was imposed to the NNMat model to ensure that the constitutive model is physically relevant. The NNMat model was trained, cross-validated and tested using biaxial testing data of 63 ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm tissue samples, which was compared to expert-constructed models (Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden, Gasser–Ogden–Holzapfel, and four-fiber families) using the same fitting and testing procedure. Our results demonstrated that the NNMat model has a significantly better performance in both fitting (R 2 value of 0.9632 vs 0.9019, p=0.0053) and testing (R 2 value of 0.9471 vs 0.8556, p=0.0203) than the Holzapfel–Gasser–Ogden model. The proposed NNMat model provides a convenient and general methodology for constitutive modeling.},

The associated nonlinear size-dependent modified couple stress-based differential motion equations are obtained based on third-order shear deformation plate model (TSDPM). A new power-law function incorporating simultaneously the material gradient and porosity dependency is employed for the extraction of the effective mechanical characteristics of PFGM microplates. Afterwards, the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-based isogeometric technique is put to use as an efficient discretization method taking the C −1 continuity satisfaction into account. It is observed that among various patterns of porosity distribution, the lowest and greatest effects of couple stress size dependency are observed on the nonlinear frequencies of microplates in which the porosity from top and down surfaces to center is increased and decreased, respectively. Also, it was observed that increase of the material property gradient index as well as plate deflection reduces couple stress size effect on the nonlinear oscillations of PFGM microplates. It was shown that there is a specific length to thickness ratio , corresponding to which the modified couple stress-based frequency ratio becomes minimum. This minimum value enhances with the increase of the porosity index of PFGM microplates.},

The Boolean subtraction operator (BSO) is introduced to guarantee the self-similarity among a hierarchical structure at different levels. This method allows us to generate a diversity of fractal structures which have, for instance, the geometric feature of either clockwise or counterclockwise chirality. By evoking the fractal Menger sponge as the non-designed domain, we have obtained fractal structures in which all internal transversal sections have hybrid fractal morphologies.

The fluid flow obeys Darcy’s seepage law in the entire domain including the damage zone, where the rock permeability is assumed to be anisotropic , following the maximum principal strain. The fully coupled problem is solved by a staggered scheme in which the mechanical equilibrium and fluid flow equations are linearized and solved using a Newton–Raphson(NR) method. Several numerical results are presented to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation. First, stability and convergence of the method are verified on a set of benchmark problems considering different time steps and mesh sizes . Second, it is shown that if the poroelastic parameters are kept constant and do not change with the phase field parameter, i.e. reducing to standard phase field approaches in the literature, the model will tend to underestimate the fracture length and overestimate the pore pressure.

In that regard, the consideration of polyconvexity inspired constitutive models and a new tensor cross product algebra are shown to be crucial in order to derive the so-called discrete derivatives, fundamental for the construction of the algorithmic derived variables, namely the second Piola–Kirchoff stress tensor and the entropy (or the absolute temperature). The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of the EM scheme recently published by Franke et al. (2018), whilst resulting in a simpler scheme from the implementation standpoint. A series of numerical examples will be presented in order to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the new EM scheme. Although the examples presented will make use of a temperature-based version of the EM scheme (using the Helmholtz free energy as the thermodynamical potential and the temperature as the thermodynamical state variable), we also include in an Appendix an entropy-based analogue EM scheme (using the internal energy as the thermodynamical potential and the entropy as the thermodynamical state variable).},

To account for exact approximation of complex geometries at interfaces, we developed a VEM technology for contact that considers curved edges.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an adjoint-based method for solving optimization problems involving pressurized membrane structures subject to external pressure loads. Shape optimization of pressurized membranes is complicated by the fact that, lacking bending stiffness , their three-dimensional shape must be sustained by the internal pressure of the inflation medium. The proposed method treats the membrane structure as an immersed manifold and employs a total Lagrangian kinematic description with an analytical pressure–volume relationship for the inflating medium. To demonstrate the proposed method, this paper considers hydrostatically loaded inflatable barriers and develops an application-specific shape parametrization based on the analytical inhomogeneous solution for the inflated shape of cylindrical membranes . Coupling this shape parametrization approach with the adjoint method for computing the gradients of functionals enables a computationally efficient optimization of pressurized membrane structures. Numerical examples include minimization and minimax problems with inequality and state constraints , which are solved considering both plane strain and general plane stress conditions. The numerical implementation leverages the high-level mathematical syntax and automatic differentiation features of the finite-element library FEniCS and related library dolfin-adjoint. The overall techniques generalize to a broad range of structural optimization problems involving pressurized membrane and thin shell structures .},

The chosen HDG solver combines robustness of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approaches in advection-dominated flows with higher-order accuracy and efficient implementations. Two coupling strategies are examined in this contribution, namely a partitioned Dirichlet–Neumann scheme in the context of hybrid HDG–CG discretizations and a monolithic approach based on Nitsche’s method, exploiting the definition of the numerical flux and the trace of the solution to impose the coupling conditions. Numerical experiments show optimal convergence of the HDG and CG primal and mixed variables and superconvergence of the postprocessed fluid velocity. The robustness and the efficiency of the proposed weakly compressible formulation, in comparison to a fully incompressible one, are also highlighted on a selection of two and three dimensional FSI benchmark problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose two approaches to apply boundary conditions for bond-based peridynamic models . There has been in recent years a renewed interest in the class of so-called non-local models, which include peridynamic models, for the simulation of structural mechanics problems as an alternative approach to classical local continuum models . However, a major issue, which is often disregarded when dealing with this class of models, is concerned with the manner by which boundary conditions should be prescribed. Our point of view here is that classical boundary conditions , since applied on surfaces of solid bodies , are naturally associated with local models. The paper describes two methods to incorporate classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions into bond-based peridynamics . The first method consists in artificially extending the domain with a thin boundary layer over which the displacement field is required to behave as an odd function with respect to the boundary points. The second method resorts to the idea that peridynamic models and local models should be compatible in the limit that the so-called horizon vanishes. The approach consists then in decreasing the horizon from a constant value in the interior of the domain to zero at the boundary so that one can directly apply the classical boundary conditions. We present the continuous and discrete formulations of the two methods and assess their performance on several numerical experiments dealing with the simulation of a one-dimensional bar.},

The conditioning of the method is of the same order as the standard FEM and it is robust with respect to the position of the mesh relative to 2-D or 3-D fractures. The method achieves an optimal rate of convergence in energy norm even when the solution of the problem in the neighborhood of the fracture front is not contained in the spaces spanned by the adopted singular enrichments. Control of conditioning associated with Heaviside enrichment functions is achieved by shifting them by their nodal values, combined with a diagonal pre-conditioner. In the case of singular enrichment functions, a simple extension of the enrichment shifting concept, denoted as discontinuous-shifting, is adopted. These enrichment modifications are space-preserving—the solution space spanned by the modified enrichments is the same as the space spanned by the unmodified ones. This is often not the case for conditioning control strategies proposed in the literature. The computational cost of these enrichment modifications is negligible and their implementation in existing G/XFEM software is straightforward. The optimal convergence, well-conditioning, and robustness of the method are numerically illustrated with the aid of representative 2-D and 3-D problems, including the case of a non-planar fracture with a curved fracture front.},

This paper presents a floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method based on the mixed displacement/pressure ( u / p ) finite element formulation and the ersatz material model. The former is able to release the need for tracking the interface boundaries explicitly between the structural and acoustic domains during the optimization process. The ersatz material model enables us to entirely avoid artificial localized vibration modes caused by the extremely high ratio between mass and stiffness. The floating projection simulates the original 0/1 constraints, and it gradually pushes the design variables toward 0 or 1 at the desired level so that the optimized element-based design can be accurately represented by a smooth design. Some 2D and 3D numerical examples , including minimizing sound pressure at the designated domain, restraining structural vibration , and maximizing sound transmission loss , are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topology optimization algorithm . The optimized solutions achieve the consistency of the objective function between the element-based design using the mixed formulation and the smooth design using the segregated formulation. The study suggests that the FPTO method using the ersatz material model is a promising approach for optimizing dynamic acoustic-mechanical structures.},

During the system design and development stages, a design engineer encounters the reliability and robustness measures of a dynamic uncertain system. Due to the existence of dynamic uncertainties, incorporating the time-dependent reliability of an engineering system in reliability based robust design optimization (RBRDO) is crucial. However, the time-dependent and highly non-linear performance functions present a new challenge to the RBRDO problem. This paper presents a multiobjective integrated framework and corresponding algorithms to handle a time-dependent RBRDO problem. The mean and coefficient of variation of the cost function are taken as a multiobjective problem that needs to be optimized to maximize the robustness without destabilizing the system performance. An evolutionary algorithm is employed to find the optimal design points. The performance functions used to estimate the time-dependent reliability are taken as dynamic probabilistic constraints. The dynamic probabilistic constraints are then converted into deterministic constraints by predicting the corresponding time-dependent reliability. A transfer learning based method integrated with the Kriging surrogate models is proposed to predict the time-dependent reliability for a given time interval. Various examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This paper presents a novel approach to control the minimal overhang angle only in enclosed voids in order to improve the manufacturability of AM structures with as little performance loss as possible. Firstly, a nonlinear virtual temperature method (N-VTM) is proposed to identify the enclosed voids. In the N-VTM method, void areas are assumed to be filled with a temperature-dependent heating material with high heat conductivity while the solid parts have low heat conductivity. Due to a nonlinear heat source term , the maximum temperature is controlled to a prescribed value, making the temperature in enclosed voids uniform over the whole structures. Hence, the enclosed voids can be easily identified without a careful selection of parameters. Then, the gradient of the filtered density field is applied to evaluate the overhang angle of the interface. Finally, a multiple filtering/projection process is developed to identify the overhang interface of enclosed voids, and then a logarithmic function-based constraint is developed to control overhang angle in enclosed voids by restricting the area of overhang interface of enclosed voids. Enhanced by the robust formulation, a topology optimization method for the design of structures with self-supported enclosed voids is then established. Several numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this method, the mixed isogeometric element is presented for the coupled multi-physics problems accompanied with the volumetric locking caused by the incompressibility of polymeric chains and solvent molecules. Such type of element is based on the subdivision properties of the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) basis functions, in which the fine and coarse basis functions with the same order are used to discretize the displacement and chemical potential fields, respectively. Meanwhile, an auxiliary configuration for the multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient is introduced to eliminate the difficulty due to certain specific cases, such as a negative infinite chemical potential for the hydrogel in a dry state. Then, the virtual work equations are derived based on the strain energy function with the ability of describing the constitutive relation of the hydrogel for large deformation from any swollen state and the mass conservation. The discrete formulations of the linearized virtual work equations for two fields on the base of the mixed isogeometric element are obtained. The efficiency, accuracy and validity of the proposed mixed isogeometric analysis approach are illustrated by solving several representative problems. The applicability of the proposed method is further demonstrated through two practical applications, which indicates that it has great potential to serve as an effective numerical tool for mechanical analysis and design of many hydrogel-based bionic devices.},

  abstract     = {Many quantities of interest (qois) arising from differential-equation-centric models can be resolved into functions of scalar fields . Examples of such qois include the lift over an airfoil or the displacement of a loaded structure; examples of corresponding fields are the static pressure field in a computational fluid dynamics solution, and the strain field in the finite element elasticity analysis. These scalar fields are evaluated at each node within a discretised computational domain. In certain scenarios, the field at a certain node is only weakly influenced by far-field perturbations; it is likely to be strongly governed by local perturbations, which in turn can be caused by uncertainties in the geometry. One can interpret this as a strong anisotropy of the field with respect to uncertainties in prescribed inputs. We exploit this notion of localised scalar-field influence for approximating global qois, which often are integrals of certain field quantities. We formalise our ideas by assigning ridge approximations for the field at select nodes. This embedded ridge approximation has favourable theoretical properties for approximating a global qoi in terms of the reduced number of computational evaluations required. Parallels are drawn between our proposed approach, active subspaces and vector-valued dimension reduction. Additionally, we study the ridge directions of adjacent nodes and devise algorithms that can recover field quantities at selected nodes, when storing the ridge profiles at a subset of nodes—paving the way for novel reduced order modelling strategies. Our paper offers analytical and simulation-based examples that expose different facets of embedded ridge approximations.},

An incompressible single fluid flow is governed by the Navier–Stokes (NS) equation and the binary fluid flow is governed by the two-phase Navier–Stokes–Cahn–Hilliard (NSCH) system. In the proposed method, we use a narrow band domain to embed the arbitrarily curved surface and extend the NSCH system and apply a pseudo-Neumann boundary condition that enforces constancy of the dependent variables along the normal direction of the points on the surface. Therefore, we can use the standard discrete Laplace operator instead of the discrete Laplace–Beltrami operator. Within the narrow band domain, the Chorin’s projection method is applied to solve the NS equation, and a convex splitting method is employed to solve the Cahn–Hilliard equation with an advection term . To keep the velocity field tangential to the surface, a velocity correction procedure is applied. An effective mass correction step is adopted to preserve the phase concentration. Computational results such as convergence test, Kevin–Helmholtz instability, and Rayleigh–Taylor instability on curved surfaces demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we develop the mixed variational formulation with independent displacement, rotation and stress fields based on the work of Hughes and Brezzi (1989). However, we further suppress rotation field to obtain element superior performance for classical continuum case with hybrid-stress interpolation. The lowest order Whitney’s interpolation or Raviart–Thomas vector space is employed to discretize stress field, which delivers superior performance by enforcing the continuity of traction field across element boundary. We further extend this optimal choice of hybrid-stress discrete approximation to dynamic analysis, by choosing the appropriate time-integration scheme that enforces stability for long-term computation. Several numerical simulations are given to illustrate an enhanced performance of the proposed element and algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The present work has been conducted in order to propose the extension of standard penalty and stabilization techniques to the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method, for the numerical solution of incompressible fluid flow problems . In principle, the numerical procedures to be implemented in this communication have been conceived for finite element method (FEM)-based solutions, and these include the reduced integration penalty method (RIPM), the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) scheme, and a penalty-based immersed boundary method (PBIBM) for the imposition of essential boundary conditions along internal fluid–solid interfaces. The linear momentum balance and mass conservation equations have been coupled via the RIPM, in order to obtain a global weak formulation where the IEFG model is entirely developed in terms of improved moving least squares (IMLS) approximations of the velocity field . A detailed explanation concerning the appropriate extension of both the RIPM and SUPG procedures to the context of IEFG formulations , has also been provided. The resulting formulation has been applied to the solution of two well-known benchmark problems: i) Lid-driven square cavity flow, and ii) Flow past a fixed cylinder. Regarding the flow past a fixed cylinder benchmark problem, the fluid–solid interaction has been imposed as an internal immersed boundary condition via the PBIBM. The feasibility and reliability of implementing the RIPM, SUPG and PBIBM procedures in the IEFG formulation, have been proven by comparison with experimental and mesh-based numerical results reported in the literature. The results obtained in this study have revealed that a proper extension of the aforementioned penalty and stabilization techniques to the IEFG formulation, allows the achievement of accurate and stable numerical results during the solution of incompressible fluid-dynamics problems.},

  abstract     = {A data-driven framework is proposed towards the end of predictive modeling of complex spatio-temporal dynamics, leveraging nested non-linear manifolds. Three levels of neural networks are used, with the goal of predicting the future state of a system of interest in a parametric setting. A convolutional autoencoder is used as the top level to encode the high dimensional input data along spatial dimensions into a sequence of latent variables. A temporal convolutional autoencoder (TCAE) serves as the second level, which further encodes the output sequence from the first level along the temporal dimension, and outputs a set of latent variables that encapsulate the spatio-temporal evolution of the dynamics. The use of dilated temporal convolutions grows the receptive field exponentially with network depth, allowing for efficient processing of long temporal sequences typical of scientific computations. A fully-connected network is used as the third level to learn the mapping between these latent variables and the global parameters from training data, and predict them for new parameters. For future state predictions, the second level uses a temporal convolutional network to predict subsequent steps of the output sequence from the top level. Latent variables at the bottom-most level are decoded to obtain the dynamics in physical space at new global parameters and/or at a future time. Predictive capabilities are evaluated on a range of problems involving discontinuities, wave propagation, strong transients, and coherent structures. The sensitivity of the results to different modeling choices is assessed. The results suggest that given adequate data and careful training, effective data-driven predictive models can be constructed. Perspectives are provided on the present approach and its place in the landscape of model reduction.},

For the position deviation of the interface nodes on the concave-curved boundary at a large time step, a position correction strategy is given. In addition, in order to control the numerical dissipation in the simulation, the implicit generalized- α α time integration strategy with second-order accuracy is used to solve the differential algebraic equations of the system. Finally, several numerical examples are studied to verify the mass conservation characteristics of the algorithm under coarse mesh and relatively large time steps, and the pressure calculation results are compared with the experimental results reported in the literature, which shows the stability and accuracy of the algorithms proposed.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials are emerging as a new paradigmatic material system to render unprecedented and tailorable properties for a wide variety of engineering applications . However, the inverse design of metamaterial and its multiscale system is challenging due to high-dimensional topological design space, multiple local optima , and high computational cost. To address these hurdles, we propose a novel data-driven metamaterial design framework based on deep generative modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for property prediction are simultaneously trained on a large metamaterial database to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and organized latent space. We show in this study that the latent space of VAE provides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enable interpolation between microstructures and encode meaningful patterns of variation in geometries and properties. Based on these insights, systematic data-driven methods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and multiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical properties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by simple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further extended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of mechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model . For multiscale metamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly generated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then assembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure compatibility between adjacent microstructures. We demonstrate our framework by designing both functionally graded and heterogeneous metamaterial systems that achieve desired distortion behaviors.},

Therein the phase-field modeling of fractures has attracted widespread interest by virtue of its outstanding performance in dealing with complex cracks. The ES-FEM is an excellent member of the S-FEM family developed in combination with meshless ideas and finite element method (FEM), which is characterized by higher accuracy, ‘softer’ stiffness, and insensitive to mesh distortion . Given that, the advantages of the phase-field method (PFM) and ES-FEM are fully combined by the approach proposed in this paper. With the costly computational overhead of PFM and ES-FEM in mind, a well-designed multi-level adaptive mesh strategy was developed, which considerably improved the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the detailed numerical implementation for the coupling of PFM and ES-FEM is outlined. Several representative numerical examples were recalculated based on the proposed method, and its effectiveness is verified by comparison with the results in experiments and literature. In particular, an experiment in which cracks deflected in rubber due to impinging on a weak interface was firstly reproduced.},

In this work, we propose a hybrid deep adversarial autoencoder (VAE-GAN) to integrate generative adversarial network (GAN) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for predicting parameterized nonlinear fluid flows in spatial and temporal dimensions. High-dimensional inputs are compressed into the low-dimensional representations by nonlinear functions in a convolutional encoder . In this way, the predictive fluid flows reconstructed in a convolutional decoder contain the dynamic fluid flow physics of high nonlinearity and chaotic nature. In addition, the low-dimensional representations are applied to the adversarial network for model training and parameter optimization, which enables fast computation process. The capability of the hybrid VAE-GAN is illustrated by varying inputs on a flow past a cylinder test case as well as a second case of water column collapse. Numerical results show that this hybrid VAE-GAN has successfully captured the spatio-temporal flow features with CPU speed-up of three orders of magnitude. These promising results suggest that the hybrid VAE-GAN can play a critical role in efficiently and accurately predicting complex flows in future research efforts.},

These elements constructed by the SBFEM can be used in analysis with their boundaries discretized only, which reduce the difficulty to connect elements with different sizes.

  abstract     = {Shape-anisotropic granules and their surrounding interphase networks are significant constituents in granular materials. Structural and physical configurations of these constituents significantly affect the overall thermal performance of granular materials, specifically microstructure-dependent thermal conductive properties. It has been a key but unresolved issue how to quantitatively understand the microstructure evolution of conductive interphase interacted by densely packed non-spherical particles triggering the change of thermal conductivity of granular materials. In this work, we devise a powerful scheme by using the discrete element method (DEM) and the dual-probability-Brownian motion simulation (DP-BMS) to accurately and efficiently predict the effective thermal conductivity of granular materials composed of homogeneous matrix, conductive (soft) interphase around randomly-dispersed elliptical particles over a broad range of aspect ratios with widespread applications, such as cracks, pores, fibers, cellulose whiskers, silicate nanorods, and aggregates. Comparison against extensive numerical and theoretical data validates that such the scheme can well predict the effective thermal conductivity of multiphase granular materials with densely packed non-spherical particles that is just the intrinsic limitation of the classical micromechanical homogenization theories. In this scheme, the DEM provides a direct means of investigating the time-dependent microstructure evolution of granular materials with elliptical particles from a loose parking state to a dense packing state. The DP-BMS provides an effective technique for predicting the effective thermal conductive transport properties of multiphase granular materials. By comparing with traditional numerical strategies like the finite element method (FEM) and random walk model (RWM), the DP-BMS is more user-friendly and efficient to accurately predict the effective thermal conductivity. This scheme can be regarded as a general procedure that is readily applicable to predictions of other transport properties of two-dimensional or three-dimensional multiphase granular materials. Furthermore, we use the scheme to probe the influences of the shape and high packing density of particles and the thickness and fraction of soft interphase on the effective thermal conductivity of granular materials. The results elucidate rigorous component-structure–property relations, which can provide sound guidance for composite design and microstructure optimization.},

For the purpose of investigating the probabilistic damage analysis problems, a freshly established machine learning approach, namely the capped-extended-support vector regression method (C-X-SVR), is proposed to eliminate the influences of random outliers in the first step, then establish the relationship between the uncertain systemic inputs and structural responses. Such that the training robustness and computational adaptability of the proposed regression model can be reinforced. Moreover, the proposed approach is competent of efficiently predicting the statistical information (i.e., means, standard deviations, probability density functions and cumulative density functions) of structural behaviours under continuous information update of the uncertain working condition from mercurial environment. One real-life experimental validation and two numerical investigations are implemented to further verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the uncertainty quantification framework against probabilistic damage analysis.},

The addition of a second-order entropy dissipative component to the antidiffusive part of a nearly entropy conservative numerical flux is generally insufficient to prevent violations of local bounds in shock regions. Our monolithic convex limiting technique adjusts a given target flux in a manner which guarantees preservation of invariant domains, validity of local maximum principles, and entropy stability. The new methodology combines the advantages of modern entropy stable/entropy conservative schemes and their local extremum diminishing counterparts. The process of algebraic flux correction is based on inequality constraints which provably provide the desired properties. No free parameters are involved. The proposed algebraic fixes are readily applicable to unstructured meshes, finite element methods, general time discretizations, and steady-state residuals.

We prove that discretizations using the EMAC formulation are potentially better than those built on the commonly used skew-symmetric formulation, by deriving a better longer time error estimate for EMAC: while the classical results for schemes using the skew-symmetric formulation have Gronwall constants dependent on exp ( C ⋅ R e ⋅ T ) exp(C⋅Re⋅T) with R e Re the Reynolds number , it turns out that the EMAC error estimate is free from this explicit exponential dependence on the Reynolds number . Additionally, it is demonstrated how EMAC admits smaller lower bounds on its velocity error, since incorrect treatment of linear momentum , angular momentum and energy induces lower bounds for L 2 L2 velocity error, and EMAC treats these quantities more accurately. Results of numerical tests for channel flow past a cylinder and 2D Kelvin–Helmholtz instability are also given, both of which show that the advantages of EMAC over the skew-symmetric formulation increase as the Reynolds number gets larger and for longer simulation times.},

  abstract     = {The evaluation of robustness and reliability of realistic structures in the presence of uncertainty is numerically costly. This motivates model order reduction techniques like the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), which gives an approximate model on the basis of a set of precomputations of a full model. This reduces the computational time . The reduction achieved by POD is usually not sufficient in the uncertainty quantification or optimization context where a large number of evaluations has to be carried out. In this context, it is also common that only a few quantities are of interest and a further reduction is possible. The second reduction may be represented by a mapping from a possibly high-dimensional parameter space onto each quantity of interest (QoI). In general, it is difficult to construct such a mapping from an unreduced model. Hence, in this paper a two-stage surrogate model that combines both reduction approaches is introduced. This surrogate model is tailored and applied to Neo-Hookean model problems with plasticity, hardening and damage. Here, the knowledge of the model allows an adaptive selection of the POD basis on the first stage. This idea is elaborated into a generalized framework called adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD). The second stage consists of the hierarchical tensor approximation (HTA) which is easily adjusted to the accuracy and computational cost of the first stage such that the two-stage surrogate model becomes an efficient option for uncertainty quantification and optimization for Neo-Hookean problems. Additionally, with both stages at hand, the HTA is utilized for a greedy snapshot search to improve the basis of APOD and POD. This is useful if no expert knowledge is available to guide the snapshot selection in the offline phase.},

The scheme has been formulated so that (i) time-integration is carried out by means of an arbitrary order backward differentiation formula, (ii) finite element space discretizations of any order can be employed, and (iii) it satisfies a discrete mass balance equation at each simulation instant and preserves mass in those cases in which no fluid enters nor leaves the control domain, as long as the integrals involved are computed exactly. These properties are achieved by posing a conservation law for a weighted mass –from which the standard mass can be seen as a particular case– that can be easily discretized in time and in space with any order of accuracy. Numerical experiments –which include a three-dimensional test– show that the method is as accurate in time as the employed time-marching formula, as accurate in space as the finite element discretization , and generally more accurate –especially in terms of mass conservation errors– and efficient than the classic, non-conservative Lagrange–Galerkin method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first conservative Lagrange–Galerkin method for convection-dominated equations that considers both non-divergence-free velocity fields and time and space discretizations of any order.},

In this paper, we present a robust numerical framework to simulate fluid-driven fracture propagation that addresses the challenges emerging in the simulation of this complex coupled nonlinear hydro-mechanical response. We observe that the numerical difficulties stem from the strong nonlinearities present in the fluid equations as well as those associated with crack propagation , from the quasi-static nature of the problem, and from the a priori unknown and potentially intricate crack geometries that may arise. An additional challenge is the need for large scale simulation owing to the mesh resolution requirements and the expected 3D character of the problem in practical applications. To address these challenges we model crack propagation with a high-order hybrid discontinuous Galerkin/cohesive zone model framework, which has proven massive scalability properties, and we model the lubrication flow inside the propagating cracks using continuous finite elements , furnishing a fully-coupled discretization of the solid and fluid equations. We find that a conventional Newton–Raphson solution algorithm is robust even in the presence of crack propagation. The parallel approach for solving the linearized coupled problem consists of standard iterative solvers based on domain decomposition . The resulting computational approach provides the ability to conduct highly-resolved and quasi-static simulations of fluid-driven fracture propagation with unspecified crack path. We conduct a series of numerical tests to verify the computational framework against known analytical solutions in the toughness and viscosity dominated regimes and we demonstrate its performance in terms of robustness and parallel scalability, enabling simulations of several million degrees of freedom on hundreds of processors.},

The medium consists of two adjacent regions with possibly different parameterizations. The model accounts for non-equilibrium effects like dynamic capillarity and hysteresis. The θ θ -scheme is adopted for the temporal discretization of the equations yielding nonlinear time-discrete equations. For these, we propose and analyze two iterative schemes , which combine a stabilized linearization iteration of fixed-point type, the L-scheme, and a non-overlapping domain decomposition method into one iteration. First, we prove the existence of unique solutions to the problems defining the linear iterations. Then, we give the rigorous convergence proof for both iterative schemes towards the solution of the time-discrete equations. The developed schemes are independent of the spatial discretization or the mesh and avoid the use of derivatives as in Newton based iterations. Their convergence holds independently of the initial guess , and under mild constraints on the time step. The numerical examples confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness of the schemes. In particular, the second scheme is well suited for models incorporating hysteresis. The schemes can be easily implemented for realistic applications.},

The momentum and phase-field equations are solved in a staggered scheme using isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love shell analysis for the structural part and isogeometric second- and fourth-order phase-field formulations for the brittle fracture part. For the application to complex multipatch structures, we propose penalty formulations for imposing all the required interface constraints, i.e., displacement ( C 0 C0 ) and rotational ( C 1 C1 ) continuity for the structure as well as C 0 C0 and C 1 C1 continuity for the phase field, where the latter is required only in the case of the fourth-order phase-field model. All involved penalty terms are scaled with the corresponding problem parameters to ensure a consistent scaling of the penalty contributions to the global system of equations. As a consequence, all coupling terms are controlled by one global penalty parameter, which can be set to 1 0 3 103 independent of the problem parameters. Furthermore, we present a multistep predictor–corrector algorithm for adaptive local refinement with LR NURBS , which can accurately predict and refine the region around the crack even in cases where fracture fully develops in a single load step, such that rather coarse initial meshes can be used, which is essential especially for the application to large structures.

  abstract     = {Many important multi-component crystalline solids undergo mechanochemical spinodal decomposition: a phase transformation in which the compositional redistribution is coupled with structural changes of the crystal, resulting in dynamically evolving microstructures. The ability to rapidly compute the macroscopic behavior based on these detailed microstructures is of paramount importance for accelerating material discovery and design. Here, our focus is on the macroscopic, nonlinear elastic response of materials harboring microstructure. Because of the diversity of microstructural patterns that can form, there is interest in taking a purely computational approach to predicting their macroscopic response. However, the evaluation of macroscopic, nonlinear elastic properties purely based on direct numerical simulations (DNS) is computationally very expensive, and hence impractical for material design when a large number of microstructures need to be tested. A further complexity of a hierarchical nature arises if the elastic free energy and its variation with strain is a small-scale fluctuation on the dominant trajectory of the total free energy driven by microstructural dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a data-driven approach, which combines advanced neural network (NN) models with DNS to predict the homogenized, macroscopic, mechanical free energy and stress fields arising in a family of multi-component crystalline solids that develop microstructure. The microstructures are numerically generated by solving a coupled, mechanochemical spinodal decomposition problem governed by nonlinear strain gradient elasticity and the Cahn–Hilliard phase field equation. The hierarchical structure of the free energy’s evolution induces a multi-resolution character to the machine learning paradigm: We construct knowledge-based neural networks (KBNNs) with either pre-trained fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs), or pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that describe the dominant characteristic of the data to fully represent the hierarchically evolving free energy. We demonstrate multi-resolution learning of the materials physics; specifically of the nonlinear elastic response for both fixed and evolving microstructures.},

Modeling of the slurry flow includes the effects of proppant bridging and the subsequent flow of fracturing fluid through the packed proppant. This allows for simulation of a tip screen-out, a phenomenon in which there is a high degree of physical interaction between the rock deformation, fluid flow, and proppant transport and leads to shock formation in the solution. The numerical implementation is verified and the model is used to simulate a tip screen-out in both planar and non-planar fractures. An analysis of the results is performed for three different coupling schemes: monolithic, sequential, and loose coupling. The monolithic scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of computational efficiency, robustness, and accuracy.

  abstract     = {This research work introduces a novel phase-field thermo-hydro-mechanical (P-THM) modeling approach that allows to deeply understand and model the freezing–thawing cyclic process in a fluid-saturated porous medium. In this, a biphasic macroscopic, non-isothermal porous media model, augmented by the phase-field method (PFM), is applied to account for the temperature development, the interstitial pore-fluid flow, and the volumetric deformations due to ice formation (phase change). Utilizing the theory of porous media (TPM) in the continuum mechanical formulation provides a well-founded basis for the description of deformable, fluid-saturated, non-isothermal porous solid materials. Of particular importance in the underlying work is the unified kinematics treatment of the ice and water constituents as a single pore-fluid, where the PFM is employed for the description of the phase transition between both constituents. The PFM is a diffuse-interface approach that relies on the specification of the free energy density function as the main driving force in the phase transition. It employs a scalar-valued, phase-field variable to indicate the state of the pore-fluid, i.e., a solid (ice) or a liquid (water). A significant virtue of using the PFM approach is its viability in the implementation within standard finite element frameworks, as no need to explicitly track the moving boundaries (interfaces) of the phase-change constituent. The numerical examples and comparisons presented at the end of the manuscript demonstrate the ability, reliability and usefulness of the proposed modeling framework in describing the freezing–thawing process in a saturated porous solid under thermal loading within an elastic deformation limit.},

First, the particular traits of the history-dependent response prediction problem are analyzed, which motivate the incorporation of the unrolled gated recurrent unit (GRU) structure and the attention mechanism into the classical Seq2Seq model in natural language processing . In the UA-Seq2Seq model, the Seq2Seq skeleton frees the restrictions on both the input and target mechanical variables. Meanwhile, the novel unrolled GRU structure conforms to the general process of mechanical simulation and manages to establish the gated links with the historical states, which is further boosted by the powerful attention mechanism dedicated to retrieving the super-long-term memory information. To quickly and informatively validate the UA-Seq2Seq model, a numerical experiment based on the cyclic stress–strain response of low-yield-point steel is conducted, whose constitutive behavior depends highly on the loading history. All the training and testing configurations in the numerical experiment are specified, including a novel data normalization method – named nonlinear reference-value scaling – tailored for mechanical variables. The results verify the effectiveness of the UA-Seq2Seq model to reproduce the history-dependent hysteresis loops and confirm its capability to capture the long-term memory effect . Furthermore, a parametric analysis is carried out to demonstrate the necessity of the unrolled structure and the attention mechanism as well as the advantage of selecting the L1 loss metric, following which a qualitative mechanical interpretation of the UA-Seq2Seq model is provided to aid in the intuitive comprehension. Finally, three feasible applications and extensions of the developed framework are introduced conceptually: integration with finite element analysis, outline analysis, and transfer learning to other similar tasks. Therefore, the proposed deep learning framework is able to cover a wide range of scenarios concerning the mechanical history-dependent response simulation in practice, which facilitates its universal employment in the academic research and engineering design.},

  abstract     = {It is known that spurious non-physical velocities can occur when one employs the finite element method for simulation of incompressible flows subjected to external forces. In presence of external body forces , the main reason for this is the incompressibility constraint that is satisfied only in a weak sense against test functions from the pressure function space. In case of the two-phase (incompressible) immiscible flow, a surface force, which is a function of the interface curvature, arises and introduces additional problematics to the finite element model . Due to discrete representation of the interface, the question arises on how to approximate the curvature. A particularly natural approach for the finite element method employs the Laplace–Beltrami operator which allows to express the mean curvature in a weak sense. However, once incorporated into the equations governing the fluid flow, Laplace–Beltrami-reconstructed curvature may introduce spurious non-physical forces at the interface if finite element spaces are chosen arbitrarily. The reason for this is that the test space used for curvature calculation is the test space associated with the velocity field . We show that it is necessary for the function space used for the geometry construction to be of the order equal to or higher than the order of the test space involved in curvature evaluation. This leaves two possibilities for practical fluid flow problems : use the same function spaces for the mesh geometry and the velocity field (isoparametric concept) or decouple the curvature calculation from the main problem.},

  abstract     = {A Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) has become a widespread technique for preventing reflections from computational boundaries for electromagnetic wave propagation problems in frequency domains. Especially, a PML for the Helmholtz equation is well developed and applied to the finite difference method . In the currently used methods of PMLs , additional 4 to 6 layers surrounding a computational domain are required to be added in a PML region in order to terminate infinite domain calculations. Such a requirement not only demands a relatively large computer memory, but also increases execution time and complexity in implementations. The objectives of this paper are to show how to derive and implement a highly efficient PML on the termination of a computational grid in electromagnetic scattering simulations by one property-dependent PML (PPML) with just a single additional layer, based on the stretched-coordinate PML (SC-PML) and unsplit-field PML formulations. Its effectiveness is validated by examples with varying background media and applied frequencies in computational domains. These validate our proposed PPML to be a universal and accurate tool for solving frequency-domain Maxwell’s equations discretized by finite differences accurately in both lossless and lossy media under a wide range of applied frequencies. On one hand, PPML effectively reduces requirements of CPU time and computer memory by an additional single layer in the PPML region. On the other hand, the proposed technique simply calculates the property-dependent parameters of the PPML to obtain high computational accuracy over the PMLs which are used currently. In addition, with this novel implementation, the PPML can be easily specified in one or more coordinate systems in the same manner as the standard Finite-Difference-Frequency-Domain (FDFD) equations without any increase in their derivation work.},

However, without considering graded multi-material infill pattern, existed infill design methods have not yet fully tapped the potential of multiple materials in structural design. In this paper, a systematic multi-phase infill design method is proposed to generate graded multi-material infill structures. The method builds upon a unified multi-material density-based topology optimization framework, in which a modified multi-phase material interpolation formulation is presented to represent the relationship between the stiffness matrix and design variables. To generate spatial-varying and multi-phase structures distributed in the interior of a design domain, the maximum local material volume constraints are imposed on each phase material in the neighborhood of each element in the design domain. A series of relaxations is introduced into the framework to facilitate the implementation of the gradient-based optimization algorithm . The whole design process is performed on a full-size finite element analysis, so it can avoid the separation of scales and naturally guarantee the optimized infills to be smoothly connected. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed multi-phase infill generation model are then demonstrated by several typical numerical examples with the objective of minimum compliance.},

  abstract     = {In variational phase-field modeling of brittle fracture, the functional to be minimized is not convex, so that the necessary stationarity conditions of the functional may admit multiple solutions. The solution obtained in an actual computation is typically one out of several local minimizers. Evidence of multiple solutions induced by small perturbations of numerical or physical parameters was occasionally recorded but not explicitly investigated in the literature. In this work, we focus on this issue and advocate a paradigm shift, away from the search for one particular solution towards the simultaneous description of all possible solutions (local minimizers), along with the probabilities of their occurrence. Inspired by recent approaches advocating measure-valued solutions (Young measures as well as their generalization to statistical solutions) and their numerical approximations in fluid mechanics, we propose the stochastic relaxation of the variational brittle fracture problem through random perturbations of the functional. We introduce the concept of stochastic solution , with the main advantage that point-to-point correlations of the crack phase fields in the underlying domain can be captured. These stochastic solutions are represented by random fields or random variables with values in the classical deterministic solution spaces. In the numerical experiments, we use a simple Monte Carlo approach to compute approximations to such stochastic solutions. The final result of the computation is not a single crack pattern, but rather several possible crack patterns and their probabilities. The stochastic solution framework using evolving random fields allows additionally the interesting possibility of conditioning the probabilities of further crack paths on intermediate crack patterns.},

  abstract     = {Phase-resolved wave prediction is important to a vessel for both predicting deterministic motion and assisting decision-making. In this study, both linear and nonlinear physical-based wave models are addressed for achieving phase-resolved wave prediction. These physical-based models are developed based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique. Although nonlinear wave models such as high order spectrum models are capable of nonlinear wave modeling, they still experience nonstationary difficulties. The FFT technique requires wave motions to be linear and stationary. Accordingly, inspired by the capability of machine learning in solving nonlinear dynamic problems, a machine learning method is applied in phase-resolved wave prediction. Thus, an artificial neural network-based wave prediction (ANN-WP) model is proposed. Experimental wave data sets are employed in model training optimization, verification, and comparison studies. The prediction accuracy of the ANN-WP model is verified and the input–output strategy is explored for training optimization of the ANN-WP model. A comparison between the ANN-WP and linear wave prediction (LWP) models is presented using the nonlinear experimental wave data. Furthermore, a preliminary discussion of the extreme wave predictive ability of the ANN-WP model is presented. The comparison results indicate that the ANN-WP model performs better than the LWP model. Although selected problems remain in extreme wave prediction, the proposed ANN-WP model provides a feasible and effective approach for achieving accurate nonlinear phase-resolved wave prediction.},

This technology is an inherently multiphysics problem, involving the simultaneous evolution of fluid flow, heat transfer, free surface, laser-material interaction and material phases including solid, liquid and gas. Multiphysics and multiphase models are typically used to understand the dominant physics driving AM processes through high fidelity simulations resolving the individual powders as they melt onto the substrate. However, these types of high fidelity models have not been applicable to modeling directed energy deposition (DED) process, where powders are delivered through the ambient vapor onto the substrate by a nozzle and subsequently fused. This paper presents a novel multiphase thermo-fluid formulation for modeling DED processes. A diffuse level set formulation coupled with the Navier–Stokes, energy conservation and radiative transport equation allows us to model complex free surface, fluid flow, thermal and laser interaction evolution. In addition, our formulation enables us to resolve the vapor flow field and its effect on deposited material during AM processes. The accuracy of our proposed method is assessed by comparing with literature solutions and experimental benchmarks. Our proposed formulation is then used to model simple DED processes that enable us to visualize the entrainment of powder particles into the melt pool. This process elucidates the dominant physical forces that can drive powders into the melt pool as well as their effect on the melt pool evolution within DED processes.},

Since the use of classical smoothers (e.g. Gauss–Seidel) results in a p p -multigrid/ h h -multigrid method with deteriorating performance for higher values of p p , the use of an ILUT smoother is investigated as well. Numerical results and a spectral analysis indicate that the use of this smoother exhibits convergence rates essentially independent of h h and p p for both p p -multigrid and h h -multigrid methods. In particular, we compare both coarsening strategies (e.g. coarsening in h h or p p ) adopting both smoothers for a variety of two and three dimensional benchmarks. Furthermore, the ILUT smoother is compared to a state-of-the-art smoother (Hofreither and Takacs 2017) using both coarsening strategies.

Higher-order smoothness yields a continuous representation of the strain rate, and, as a result, prevents jumps in the stress and other history variables as the material points cross the element boundaries. Furthermore, NURBS can exactly represent all conic sections and the corresponding symmetries in the solution, which may be important in some applications. Several numerical examples of increasing complexity are presented, and show the ability of IGA-MPM to eliminate the well known cell-crossing instability of the conventional MPM.

  abstract     = {In order to simulate the Kaufman-type discharge problems, a fully decoupled iterative method with anisotropic immersed finite elements on Cartesian meshes is proposed, especially for a three-dimensional (3D) non-axisymmetric anisotropic hybrid model which is more difficult than the axisymmetric or isotropic models. The classical hybrid model, which describes the important plasma distribution of the Kaufman-type discharge problems, couples several difficult equations together to form a large scale system . The 3D non-axisymmetric and anisotropic properties will further increase the complexity of this system. Hence it generally needs to be solved in the decoupled way for significantly reducing the computational cost. Based on the Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo collision (PIC–MCC) method and the immersed finite element (IFE) method, we propose a fully decoupled iterative method for solving this complex system. The IFE method allows Cartesian meshes for general interface problems, while the traditional finite element methods require body-fitting meshes which are often unstructured. Compared with traditional finite element methods, this feature significantly improves the efficiency of the proposed 3D fully decoupled iterative method, while maintaining the optimal accuracy of the chosen finite elements . Numerical simulations of traditional Kaufman ion thruster and annular ion thruster discharge chambers are provided and compared with the corresponding lab experiment results to illustrate the features of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The efficient estimation of the failure probability function of rare failure events is a challenging task in the structural safety analysis when the input variables are characterized by imprecise probability models due to insufficient information on these variables. The recently developed non-intrusive imprecise stochastic simulation (NISS) provides a general, yet competitive, framework for dealing with this type of problems, and it has been shown that many classical stochastic simulation techniques, with suitable adequations, can be injected into this framework for tackling different types of problems in uncertainty quantification. This work aims at investigating the rare failure event analysis based on the global version of NISS and line sampling. A new method, called global imprecise line sampling (GILS), is firstly proposed, to efficiently estimate failure probability function with the same computational cost as classical line sampling. By joint sampling from both the aleatory and epistemic spaces, the GILS provides elegant estimators for the functional components of the failure probability. Then, to further reduce the computational cost, and improve its suitability for nonlinear problems, an imprecise active learning line sampling procedure is established by combining GILS with Gaussian process regression (GPR) with the target of adaptively exploring the aleatory and epistemic spaces within the framework of line sampling. Two analytical examples and two engineering applications demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {We present a new stabilized method for the diffusion–reaction equation which develops sharp boundary and/or internal layers for the reaction-dominated case (i.e. singularly perturbed case). The method relies on an improved expression for the stabilization parameter that is derived via the fine-scale variational formulation facilitated by the variational multiscale (VMS) framework. The proposed fine-scale basis consists of enrichment functions which may be nonzero at element edges. The derived stabilization parameter enjoys spatial variation over element interiors and along inter-element boundaries that helps model the rapid variation of the residual of the Euler–Lagrange equations over the domain. This feature also facilitates consistent stabilization across boundary and internal layers as well as capturing anisotropic refinement effects. The method is able to better satisfy the maximum principle as compared to other existing methods. We present a priori mathematical analysis of the stability and convergence of the method for the diffusion–reaction equation. Optimal convergence on meshes comprised of linear triangles and bilinear quadrilateral elements are presented for smooth problems, as well as for problems with steep boundary layers. Stability and accuracy features of the method for problems with discontinuous forcing function, internal layers, and boundary layers are shown and its performance on unstructured and distorted meshes comprised of quadrilateral and triangular elements is highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Solving the time-dependent reliability-based design optimization (TRBDO) problems is quite cost-consuming in realistic engineering application. Surrogate model-based TRBDO methods can provide a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency of the solution. However, the existing surrogate model-based TRBDO methods pay efforts on enhancing surrogate models of constraint functions in both feasible region and infeasible region. While only the estimation accuracy of boundaries between feasible region and infeasible one has large effects on the calculation accuracy of design parameter, and the estimation accuracy of limit state surfaces of constraint functions in infeasible region has little effects on the calculation accuracy of design parameter. Therefore, it is no major demand to deliberately enhance the accuracy of surrogate models of constraint functions in the infeasible region, and the existing surrogate model-based TRBDO methods introduce extra computational cost. In this paper, a new surrogate model-based method called time-dependent system constraint boundary sampling (TSCBS) is proposed to overcome the limitation of existing surrogate model-based TRBDO methods. By employing the TSCBS, samples around the boundaries between feasible region and infeasible one are selected, and samples in the infeasible region far away from the boundaries are avoided as much as possible, to improve the surrogate models of constraint functions. Furthermore, in order to obtain the feasible region of the TRBDO, the safe region of each probabilistic constraint is to be sure first with an established adaptive coefficient. The adaptive coefficient can provide a good tradeoff between the input dimension and iteration. Numerical and engineering examples show that the proposed TSCBS generally performs higher computational efficiency than existing surrogate model-based TRBDO methods.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) was proposed within the class of unfitted (or immersed, or embedded) finite element methods . By reformulating the original boundary value problem over a surrogate (approximate) computational domain, the SBM avoids integration over cut cells and the associated problematic issues regarding numerical stability and matrix conditioning. Accuracy is maintained by modifying the original boundary conditions using Taylor expansions . Hence the name of the method, that shifts the location and values of the boundary conditions. In this article, we present enhanced variational SBM formulations for the Poisson and Stokes problems with improved flexibility and robustness. These simplified variational forms allow to relax some of the assumptions required by the mathematical proofs of stability and convergence of earlier implementations. First, we show that these new SBM implementations can be proved asymptotically stable and convergent even without the rather restrictive assumption that the inner product between the normals to the true and surrogate boundaries is positive. Second, we show that it is not necessary to introduce a stabilization term involving the tangential derivatives of the solution at Dirichlet boundaries, therefore avoiding the calibration of an additional stabilization parameter. Finally, we prove enhanced L 2 L2 -estimates without the cumbersome assumption – of earlier proofs – that the surrogate domain is convex. Instead we rely on a conventional assumption that the boundary of the true domain is smooth, which can also be replaced by requiring convexity of the true domain. The aforementioned improvements open the way to a more general and efficient implementation of the Shifted Boundary Method, particularly in complex three-dimensional geometries. We complement these theoretical developments with numerical experiments in two and three dimensions .},

  abstract     = {Reliability analysis for structural systems with multiple failure modes and expensive-to-evaluate simulations is challenging. In this paper, a new and efficient system reliability method is proposed based on the adaptive importance sampling and kriging models. The Metropolis–Hastings (M–H) algorithm is used to construct several Markov chains to fully explore complex failure regions. A number of Markov chain states are selected as the center of the component importance sampling functions to generate samples for reliability analysis. Based on the component importance sampling function of each selected chain state, the system importance sampling function is constructed with the weighting index. The system importance sampling function can be constructed effectively because it does not involve time-consuming simulations and the most probable point (MPP) search. The new learning function, which is directly linked to the system failure probability, is developed to adaptively select the best added samples for refining the kriging models at each iteration. The adaptive importance sampling method and kriging models are well-combined for system reliability analysis in the proposed method. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method, generally, offers the following advantages: (1) The learning function and stopping criterion are directly linked to system failure probability; (2)the adaptive importance sampling and kriging models are well-combined to yield accurate results based on a small sample size for small failure probability problems; (3) the weights of sampling centers are considered, and the MPP search is not required at each iteration; (4) it is applicable for complex systems regardless of the structure and system failure probability level. Three numerical examples are analyzed, which demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for complex system reliability analysis.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new algorithm to design lightweight and stiff structures exhibiting free-form features, with the aim of minimizing the compliance under a volume inequality constraint . The procedure is based on the coupling of geometric shape optimization with topology optimization . We start from a full-mass body corresponding to a given material occupying entirely the initial design domain. The first phase of geometric shape optimization acts as an out-of-the-box paradigm. It allows one to modify the initial design domain by acting only on its boundary, keeping the same volume and topology. With respect to the full-mass body, this phase reduces the compliance to a large extent. The successive step of topology optimization does actually change the topology of the structure, e.g., by introducing holes, reduces the volume according to the volume constraint, but does not affect the boundary of the structure, which is fixed by the previous phase. Overall, the combined approach allows us to design a new structure, that is lighter and stiffer with respect to the full-mass body. Additionally, the employment of a structure-tailored computational mesh, via an anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure during topology optimization, yields an intrinsically smooth final layout characterized by free-form features. An extensive numerical assessment corroborates both qualitatively and quantitatively the performances of the proposed optimization algorithm .},

  abstract     = {Mechanical metamaterials feature engineered microstructures designed to exhibit exotic, and often counter-intuitive, effective behaviour such as negative Poisson’s ratio or negative compressibility . Such a specific response is often achieved through instability-induced transformations of the underlying periodic microstructure into one or multiple patterning modes. Due to a strong kinematic coupling of individual repeating microstructural cells, non-local behaviour and size effects emerge, which cannot easily be captured by classical homogenization schemes. In addition, the individual patterning modes can mutually interact in space as well as in time, while at the engineering scale the entire structure can buckle globally. For efficient numerical predictions of macroscale engineering applications , a micromorphic computational homogenization scheme has recently been developed (Rokoš et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 123 , 119–137, 2019). Although this framework is in principle capable of accounting for spatial and temporal interactions between individual patterning modes, its implementation relied on a gradient-based quasi-Newton solution technique. This solver is suboptimal because (i) it has sub-quadratic convergence, and (ii) the absence of Hessians does not allow for proper bifurcation analyses. Given that mechanical metamaterials often rely on controlled instabilities, these limitations are serious. Addressing them will reduce the dependency of the solution on the initial guess by perturbing the system towards the correct deformation when a bifurcation point is encountered. Eventually, this enables more accurate and reliable modelling and design of metamaterials. To achieve this goal, a full Newton method , entailing all derivations and definitions of the tangent operators, is provided in detail in this paper. The construction of the macroscopic tangent operator is not straightforward due to specific model assumptions on the decomposition of the underlying displacement field pertinent to the micromorphic framework, involving orthogonality constraints. Analytical expressions for the first and second variation of the total potential energy are given, and the complete algorithm is listed. The developed methodology is demonstrated with two examples in which a competition between local and global buckling exists and where multiple patterning modes emerge. The numerical results indicate that local to global buckling transition can be predicted within a relative error of 6% in terms of the applied strains. The expected pattern combinations are triggered even for the case of multiple patterns.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a topology optimization formulation for frequency-domain dynamics to reduce solution dependence upon initial guess and considered loading conditions. Due to resonance phenomena in undamped steady-state dynamics, objectives measuring dynamic response possess many local minima that may represent poor solutions to a design problem, an issue exacerbated for design with respect to multiple frequencies. We propose an extension of the modified error-in-constitutive-equations (MECE) method, used previously in material identification inverse problems, as a new approach for frequency-domain dynamics topology optimization to mitigate these issues. The main idea of the proposed framework is to incorporate an additional penalty-like term in the objective function that measures the discrepancy in the constitutive relations between stresses and strains and between inertial forces and displacements. Then, the design problem is cast within a PDE-constrained optimization formulation in which we seek displacements, stresses, inertial forces, and a density-field solution that minimize our new objective subject to conservation of linear momentum plus some additional constraints. We show that this approach yields superior designs to conventional gradient-based optimization approaches that solely use a functional of displacements as the objective, while strictly enforcing the constitutive equations. The MECE strategy integrates into a density-based topology optimization scheme for void–solid or two-phase material structural design. We highlight the merits of our approach in a variety of scenarios for direct frequency response design, considering multiple frequency load cases and structural objectives.},

Herein, the resulting surrogate methods are shown to significantly reduce the assembly time in high frequency wave propagation problems. In particular, the assembly time is reduced with negligible loss in solution accuracy. This paper also extends the scope of previous articles in its series by considering multi-patch discretizations of time-harmonic, transient, and nonlinear PDEs as particular use cases of the methodology. Our a priori error analysis for the Helmholtz equation demonstrates that the additional consistency error introduced by the presence of surrogate matrices is independent of the wave number . In addition, our floating point analysis establishes that the computational complexity of the methodology compares favorably to other contemporary fast assembly techniques for isogeometric methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate clear performance gains for time-harmonic problems, both with and without the presence of perfectly matched layers. Notable speed-ups are also presented for a transient problem with a compressible neo-Hookean material.},

  abstract     = {Thermal fluid coupled analysis is essential to enable an accurate temperature prediction in additive manufacturing. However, numerical simulations of this type are time-consuming, due to the high non-linearity, the underlying large mesh size and the small time step constraints. This paper presents a novel adaptive hyper reduction method for speeding up these simulations. The difficulties associated with non-linear terms for model reduction are tackled by designing an adaptive reduced integration domain. The proposed online basis adaptation strategy is based on a combination of a basis mapping, enrichment by local residuals and a gappy basis reconstruction technique. The efficiency of the proposed method will be demonstrated by representative 3D examples of additive manufacturing models, including single-track and multi-track cases.},

  abstract     = {The microstructural configuration of a material affects its macroscopic viscoelastic behavior, which suggests that materials can be engineered to achieve a desired viscoelastic behavior over a range of frequencies. To this end, we leverage topology optimization to find the optimized topology of a multi-phase viscoelastic composite to tailor its energy dissipation behavior as a function of frequency. To characterize the behavior of each material phase, we use a fractional viscoelastic constitutive model. This type of material model uses differential operators of non-integer order, which are appropriate to represent hereditary phenomena with long- and short-term memory. The topology optimization formulation aims to find the lightest microstructure that minimizes the sum of squared loss modulus residuals for a given set of target frequencies. This leads to the design of materials with either maximized loss modulus for a given target frequency or tailored loss modulus for a predefined set of frequencies. We present several numerical examples , both in 2D and 3D, which demonstrate that the microstructural configuration of multi-phase materials affects its macroscopic viscoelastic behavior. Thus, if properly designed, the material behavior can be tailored to dissipate energy for a desired frequency (maximized loss modulus) or for a range of frequencies (tailored energy dissipation behavior).},

  abstract     = {A pore scale numerical method dedicated to the simulation of heat transfer and associated thermo–hydro-mechanical couplings in granular media is described. The proposed thermo–hydro-mechanical approach builds on an existing hydro-mechanical model that employs the discrete element method for simulating the mechanical behavior of dense sphere packings and combines it with the finite volume method for simulating pore space fluid flow and the resulting hydro-mechanical coupling. Within the hydro-mechanical framework, the pore space is discretized as a tetrahedral network whose geometry is defined by the triangulation of discrete element method (DEM) particle centers. It is this discretization of DEM particle contacts and tetrahedral pore spaces that enables the efficient conductive and advective heat transfer models proposed herein. In particular, conductive heat transfer is modeled explicitly between and within solid and fluid phases: across DEM particle contacts, between adjacent tetrahedral pores, and between pores and incident particles. Meanwhile, advective heat transfer is added to the existing implicit fluid flow scheme by estimating mass–energy–flux from pressure induced fluid fluxes. In addition to the heat transfer model, a thermo-mechanical coupling is implemented by considering volume changes based on the thermal expansion of particles and fluid. The conduction and advection models are verified by presenting comparisons to an analytical solution for conduction and a fully resolved numerical solution for conduction and advection. Finally, the relevance of the fully coupled thermo–hydro-mechanical model is illustrated by simulating an experiment where a saturated porous rock sample is subjected to a cyclic temperature loading.},

Numerous papers have been published on the application of offline POD, i.e., batch POD (BPOD) in civil and mechanical engineering encompassing Karhunen–Loève decomposition (KLD), principal component analysis (PCA), and singular value decomposition (SVD). Nevertheless, online POD which is more suited for online feature extraction and monitoring has been scarcely addressed when dealing with civil and mechanical systems , particularly in structural dynamics. In this paper, a number of recursive POD (RPOD) methods in form of recursive PCA (RPCA) are overviewed with their application to structural dynamics. RPCA with numerical eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), incremental principal component analysis (IPCA), matrix perturbation method , and Kalman filter RPCA (KFRPCA) are presented; their performance is probed in terms of initialization, structural parameter modification, noisy observation, and alteration of loading statistics . The novel KFRPCA algorithm developed in this paper is reformulated to resolve the unobservability issue of higher modes which was present in its previous version in the published literature. Online stochastic output-only system identification is presented by synergizing RPCA with nonlinear Bayesian filter. Augmented extended Kalman filter (AEKF) is employed to perform unknown-input dual estimation.},

  abstract     = {In engineering practice, the parameters of uncertain structures are often quantified as random variables, but their distribution parameters are appropriately modeled as fuzzy variables rather than deterministic values in some special engineering cases. To address such dual uncertain cases, an efficient approach is proposed for the possibility-based robust design optimization (PBRDO) of dual uncertain structures with fuzzy random variables (FRVs), in which the so-called dual robust design and the failure possibility are taken into account simultaneously. In the proposed approach, FRVs are firstly used to describe dual uncertainties and a design optimization model with FRVs is constructed. The structural responses involving FRVs are calculated and expressed in the forms of fuzzy means and fuzzy variances. To perform dual robust design, the weighted sum of the expectations and entropies of the fuzzy means and fuzzy variances of interested response is taken as optimization objective. The constraints involving dual uncertainties are established in the possibility context based on the concept of failure possibility. The established PBRDO model is a complicated nested problem. Secondly, the random moment-interval perturbation center difference method (RM-IPCDM) is derived to calculate the optimization objective efficiently. Next, the target performance approach (TPA) is employed to simplify the possibilistic constraints, and the obtained equivalent constraints can also be efficiently solved by RM-IPCDM. The nested PBRDO model with FRVs is finally simplified into a single-loop one with the aid of RM-IPCDM and TPA. Three dual uncertain numerical examples involving FRVs are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

Notably, this framework accommodates design dependent loads, has the ability to introduce holes, and ensures the satisfaction of optimality criteria. It builds upon the fictitious domain, ersatz material, material interpolation and level-set methods. It also borrows from parameterized density-based topology optimization methods. Since analytical sensitivities can be computed, we use efficient nonlinear programming algorithms to update the design instead of the Hamilton–Jacobi’s scheme of level-set methods.

The developed simulation tool is first validated by comparison with analytical and 2D numerical results from the literature, before being utilized to perform 3D numerical investigations accounting for the real 3D spherical and cylindrical shapes of the nanoheterogeneities in presence. The numerical simulations carried out enable us to study the global stiffness and the degree of the overall anisotropy of homogenized medium as a function of the shape ratio and the interface elastic properties of the nanoheterogeneities. The limit case of flattened or crack-like 3D nanovoids with surface energy compared to pure nano-cracks is also emphasized. Furthermore, the numerical simulations enable us to assess the slight effect of the adopted shape of the surrounding medium and the type of applied boundary conditions on the computed effective properties . Finally, and as a surprising output, which was also obtained in a 2D former work by the authors, it was numerically found that it is possible to tailor a nanoporous material that is stiffer than the parent medium provided the contribution of the surface energy of the nanopores is considered. In conclusion, the performed simulations show the predictive capability of the developed 3D simulation tool in capturing 3D features that are not attainable by 2D approach.},

  abstract     = {In structural health monitoring (SHM), risk assessment and decision strategies rely primarily on sensor responses. Simulated data can be generated to emulate the monitoring phenomena under different natural operational and environmental conditions in order to discriminate relevant features and thus identify potential anomalies. Reduced order modeling techniques and one-class machine learning algorithms allow to efficiently achieve this goal for a fixed number and location of sensors. However, since the number of sensors available on a structure is often a limitation for SHM, identifying the optimal locations that maximize the observability of the discriminant features becomes a fundamental task. In this work we propose to use the variational approximation of sparse Gaussian processes to systematically place a fixed number of sensors over a structure of interest. The healthy parametric variations of the structure are included by clustering the inducing inputs, i.e., the outcome of variational inference. This technique is tested on several numerical examples and is demonstrated to be efficient in detecting damages. In particular, it allows for considering the realistic case where damage types and locations are a priori unknown, thus, overcoming the main limitation of existing sensor placement strategies for SHM.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an efficient element-free modeling framework for variable stiffness composite laminates with cutouts is developed. In comparison with other numerical methods or semi-analytical methods, element-free meshless methods offer many advantages in modeling variable stiffness materials and structures, e.g. complex geometries with cut-outs, providing accurate stress computations and stable nonlinear behavior modeling. In this study, an element-free Galerkin (EFG) method based modeling framework is developed to model variable stiffness composite plates containing circular holes, specifically for buckling and post-buckling analysis. Weighted orthogonal basis functions are used to further reduce the computational costs of the meshless method. Modeling accuracy for variable stiffness composite structures using node-based fiber angle definitions in this element-free framework are validated against FEM results obtained from ABAQUS. The critical buckling loads of linearly varying fiber composite laminates with different sizes of central circular holes are then computed. Based on the proposed element-free modeling scheme, nonlinear post-buckling equilibrium paths of variable stiffness composite plates are traced using an incremental loading step control method, which enables efficient post-buckling analysis. Changes in both critical buckling loads and nonlinear post-buckling performance with respect to hole size and the linear variation of fiber angles are investigated with the results presented in the form of parametric studies. The numerical results show that stress redistribution remains the major factor driving improvements in the buckling and post-buckling performance of variable stiffness composite plates with cut-outs.

  abstract     = {Reliability-based optimization (RBO) offers the possibility of finding the best design for a system according to a prescribed criterion while explicitly taking into account the effects of uncertainty. Although the importance and usefulness of RBO is undisputed, it is rarely applied to practical problems, as the associated numerical efforts are usually extremely large due to the necessity of solving simultaneously a reliability problem nested in an optimization procedure. To alleviate this issue, this contribution proposes an approach for solving a particular class of problems in RBO: the minimization of the failure probability of a linear system subjected to an uncertain load. The main characteristic of this approach is that it is fully decoupled. That is, the solution of the RBO problem is reduced to the solution of a single deterministic optimization problem followed by a single reliability analysis. Such an approach implies a complete change of paradigm with respect to the more classical double-loop and sequential methods for RBO. The theoretical basis for the proposed approach lies in the application of the operator norm theorem. The application and capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated by means of three examples.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric analysis (IGA) has become a strong tool for analysis of shell structures, which can be considered as a powerful alternative to the standard finite element method (FEM). Besides several advantages of IGA over FEM in geometric nonlinear analysis of the shells, it has some drawbacks corresponding to tensor-product of B-spline and NURBS surfaces. One of the solutions to eliminate or at least reduce the effects of the mentioned shortcomings is to combine IGA with the other methods, such as FEM. In the present paper, a novel version of the finite strip method (FSM) is developed to carry out the geometric nonlinear analysis, which employs a combination of FEM and IGA in the transversal and longitudinal directions, respectively and is named isogeometric B-spline finite strip method (IG-SFSM). The strip elements have been formulated based on the Degenerated-Shell method for Updated-Lagrangian (UL) approach. Then, it is examined by some examples incorporating various geometries, boundary conditions (BCs), and material properties, such as laminated composites and sandwich FGMs. The results exhibited that, to achieve the complicated nonlinear equilibrium paths of the shells, IG-SFSM requires a lower number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) and, consequently, computational efforts comparing to the other common methods, such as finite element and mesh-free methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the limitation of measured data, the random and epistemic uncertainties must be simultaneously handled for the reliability analysis of curvilinear aircraft stiffened panels with multiple cutouts. A hybrid iterative conjugate first-order reliability method (CFORM) and adaptive dynamical harmony search (ADHS) optimization are developed for fuzzy reliability analysis (FRA) of stiffened panels. The proposed global level performs fuzzy analysis using ADHS, while the local level is utilized for reliability evaluation using efficient FORM. In ADHS, two adjusting procedures are implemented to update the new positions of reliability index bounds with dynamical parameters Due to the computational burden of fuzzy reliability analysis with robust iterative formula , a conjugate FORM is applied using finite-step size, which is formulated by applying the Armijo rule. A limited conjugate scalar factor is utilized to determine the conjugate nonlinear describe map. The proposed conjugate formula is examined by various FORM formulas. The fuzzy reliability index is obtained using alpha level set-based ADHS in terms of extracted results by conjugate FORM for stiffened panels. Furthermore, by the sensitivity measure of the fuzzy reliability index, boundaries of uncertainty interval for stiffener heights and thicknesses of the panel were proposed. Moreover, the influences of different stiffener height, design load, stiffener thickness, and skin thickness on buckling mode were discussed. Survey results demonstrated that the proposed FRA is more accurate to handle epistemic uncertainties of curvilinear aircraft stiffened panels than the classic reliability method-based FORM. The conjugate reliability method provides robust and efficient results compared to the modified iterative reliability methods.},

Two formulations for computing these forces are presented: one using the original configuration of the solids and the other employs the current configuration. Two and three dimensional numerical examples , covering massive tensile, compressive elastic and plastic deformation , demonstrate that the former formulation performs much better for extremely large deformation problems. Compared with previous material point methods, the proposed method offers these advantages: (i) better representation of solid boundaries, (ii) seamless enforcement of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions , (iii) seamless treatment of material interfaces and (iv) higher efficiency.

  abstract     = {High-order finite element methods harbor the potential to deliver improved accuracy per degree of freedom versus low-order methods. Their success, however, hinges upon the use of a curvilinear mesh of not only sufficiently high accuracy but also sufficiently high quality. In this paper, theoretical results are presented quantifying the impact of mesh parameterization on the accuracy of a high-order finite element approximation , and a formal definition of shape regularity is introduced for curvilinear meshes based on these results. This formal definition of shape regularity in turn inspires a new set of quality metrics for curvilinear finite elements. Computable bounds are established for these quality metrics using the Bernstein–Bézier form, and a new curvilinear mesh optimization procedure is proposed based on these bounds. Numerical results confirming the importance of shape regularity in the context of high-order finite element methods are presented, and numerical results demonstrating the promise of the proposed curvilinear mesh optimization procedure are also provided. The theoretical results in this paper apply to any piecewise-polynomial or piecewise-rational finite element method posed on a mesh of polynomial or rational mapped simplices and hypercubes . As such, they apply not only to classical continuous Galerkin finite element methods but also to discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods and even isogeometric methods based on NURBS , T-splines, or hierarchical B-splines.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to the development of a stabilised implicit non-ordinary state-based peridynamics approach. We propose a geometrically nonlinear implicit approach focusing on quasi-static analyses. Since the construction of the Jacobian matrix is the most time-consuming step in conducting this nonlinear analysis , we formulate an analytical expression based on the equation of motion of non-ordinary state-based peridynamics to ensure optimum convergence of the global residual force . The implicit formulation can adopt fairly large time increments, making it a good choice for analyses of finite deformation . Another important extension presented in this paper is the modification of the correspondence material model to remove zero-energy mode instabilities and reduce the spurious oscillations, as proposed by Silling (2017). The derivative of the additional stabilisation term with respect to displacement is included in the formulation of the Jacobian for the first time. Computational examples of 2D finite deformation problems with a stabilised correspondence model are presented. We assess the effectiveness of different values of the stabilisation parameter, G in terms of the particles’ spacings and horizon sizes for different problems. This allows the non-ordinary state-based peridynamics approach to model material behaviour with greater accuracy where correspondence materials have previously failed due to instabilities. In this paper, a damage model is also proposed, which provides for the first time an implicit approach for the static solution of crack propagation problems for non-ordinary state-based peridynamics. This paper lays the groundwork for non-ordinary state-based peridynamics to be used for a much greater variety of solid mechanics problems than is currently possible and at the same time satisfying the stability condition.},

Meshfree weighted least squares collocation method (WLSCM) can improve the accuracy and stability by minimizing the least squares functional corresponding to the governing equation and boundary conditions. However, usage of more discrete points in the least squares solution increases the computational cost which notably reduces the efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new meshfree stabilized collocation method (SCM) and introduce the reproducing kernel function as the approximation . Auxiliary collocation points located in the local subdomains are employed for the stabilization. Their proper positions and corresponding weighting factors for integration using constant and cubic B-spline weighting functions are derived to keep the consistency conditions. Therefore, in this method, the approximation can satisfy the consistency conditions not only on the points, but also in the subdomains. The suggested method has the comparable accuracy and stability compared with WLSCM, and the computation efficiency can match up to DCM. Numerical simulations demonstrate that SCM can surpass DCM in accuracy and stability, and outperform WLSCM in efficiency and conditioning of the matrix according to the discrete equations, where the condition number of matrix is related to the stability.},

In non-trivial cases, the domain is decomposed into patches having separate parameterizations and separate discretization spaces. If the discretization spaces agree on the interfaces between the patches, the coupling can be done in a conforming way. Otherwise, non-conforming discretizations (utilizing discontinuous Galerkin approaches) are required. The author and his coworkers have previously introduced multigrid solvers for Isogeometric Analysis for the conforming case.

Finite element analysis (FEA) is an important phase in implementing auxetic materials, but may become computationally expensive because simulation often needs microscale details and a fine mesh. It is also necessary to check that topological aspects of the microscale reflects not only micro but macromechanical behavior. This work presents a phenomenological approach to the problem using data-driven spline-based techniques to properly characterize orthotropic auxetic material requiring neither analytical constraints nor micromechanics , expanding on previous methods for isotropic materials. Hyperelastic energies of auxetic orthotropic material are determined from experimental data by solving the equilibrium differential functional equations directly, so no fitting or analytical estimation is necessary. This offers two advantages; (i) it allows the FEA study of orthotropic auxetic materials without requiring micromechanics considerations, reducing modeling and computational time costs by two to three orders of magnitude; (ii) it adapts the hyperelastic energies to the nature of the material with precision, which could be critical in scenarios where accuracy is essential (e.g. robotic surgery).},

  abstract     = {We present a machine learning approach that integrates geometric deep learning and Sobolev training to generate a family of finite strain anisotropic hyperelastic models that predict the homogenized responses of polycrystals previously unseen during the training. While hand-crafted hyperelasticity models often incorporate homogenized measures of microstructural attributes, such as the porosity or the averaged orientation of constituents, these measures may not adequately represent the topological structures of the attributes. We fill this knowledge gap by introducing the concept of the weighted graph as a new high-dimensional descriptor that represents topological information, such as the connectivity of anisotropic grains in an assemble. By leveraging a graph convolutional deep neural network in a hybrid machine learning architecture previously used in Frankel et al. (2019), the artificial intelligence extracts low-dimensional features from the weighted graphs and subsequently learns the influence of these low-dimensional features on the resultant stored elastic energy functionals. To ensure smoothness and prevent unintentionally generating a non-convex stored energy functional, we adopt the Sobolev training method for neural networks such that a stress measure is obtained implicitly by taking directional derivatives of the trained energy functional. Results from numerical experiments suggest that Sobolev training is capable of generating a hyperelastic energy functional that predicts both the elastic energy and stress measures more accurately than the classical training that minimizes L 2 L2 norms. Verification exercises against unseen benchmark FFT simulations and phase-field fracture simulations that employ the geometric learning generated elastic energy functional are conducted to demonstrate the quality of the predictions.},

  abstract     = {Fluid–structure interaction (FSI) is a multiphysics problem with diverse application scenarios ranging from the aeroelasticity of aircraft wings and the structural response of marine platforms, to blood circulation through aortic valves. Solving the FSI problems is challenging, predominantly because of the complex time-variant geometry in the fluid–structure interface. To alleviate the difficulties encountered by the grid-based methods in tracking and meshing the fluid–structure interface involving large deformation and structure failures, in this study, we propose a meshfree framework that couples smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with peridynamics (PD) for the numerical modeling of FSI problems. This SPH–PD framework involves a four-step partitioned coupling procedure, where the key point is utilizing the SPH moving ghost particles as a medium. An original data transfer scheme is developed based on the partnerships built between the SPH moving ghost particles and the PD particles. The structure failures are incorporated in the PD model by adopting a damage law of maximum bond stretch. The SPH–PD method is validated against existing experimental and numerical data. Through the use of this model, we successfully simulate the low-velocity fluid–structure impact and capture the large deformation with local failures.},

The AVS-FE method is a Petrov–Galerkin method which employs the concept of optimal discontinuous test functions of the discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) method. However, since AVS-FE method is a minimum residual method, we establish a global saddle point system instead of computing optimal test functions element-by-element. This system allows us to seek both the approximate solution of the KdV initial boundary value problem (IBVP) and a Riesz representer of the approximation error. The AVS-FE method distinguishes itself from other minimum residual methods by using globally continuous Hilbert spaces , such as H 1 H1 , while at the same time using broken Hilbert spaces for the test. Consequently, the AVS-FE approximations are classical C 0 C0 continuous FE solutions . The unconditional stability of this method allows us to solve the KdV equation space and time without having to satisfy a CFL condition. We present several numerical verifications for both linear and nonlinear versions of the KdV equation leading to optimal convergence behavior . Finally, we present a numerical verification of adaptive mesh refinements in both space and time for the nonlinear KdV equation.},

  abstract     = {Hydraulic fracturing is a technique in which pressurized fluid is pumped into the well to induce fracture propagation in the rock formation. The treatment aims at enhancing permeability and well-reservoir connectivity. However, the presence of natural fractures can impact the hydraulic fracture propagation, increasing the complexity of the hydraulic fracturing treatment, and affect the final configuration of the fracture network. Furthermore, different propagation regimes can develop depending on field conditions, properties of the porous matrix, fractures, the injection fluid, and time. This work introduces a robust fully coupled hydro-mechanical approach to investigate the impacts of natural fractures on hydraulic fracturing in four limiting propagation regimes: toughness-storage, toughness-leak-off, viscosity-storage, and viscosity-leak-off dominated. The proposed approach is based on the finite element method and incorporates the coupling of pore pressure/stress within the permeable rock formation and fracture propagation. An innovative mesh fragmentation technique with an intrinsic pore-cohesive zone approach is implemented in the in-house multiphysics framework to simulate fracture propagation with complex crack patterns. Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) represents the initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures while a contact model with the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is used to represent the normal closure/opening and friction/shear dilation of natural fractures. The results of the new approach are compared against analytical and numerical solutions. Moreover, the influence of parameters such as rock permeability, fluid viscosity, initial stress state, and intercepting angle on the hydraulic and natural fracture is also investigated. The robustness of the presented methodology is demonstrated by simulating crossing with an offset, branching, fracture propagation from the tip of a natural crack, and interaction of multiple cracks. These results can provide guidance for a better understanding of the complex process of hydraulic fracturing.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new approach to the simulation of discharge phenomena in dielectric breakdown including field fluctuations based on Maxwell’s equations in the finite element framework without introducing the artificial stochastic disturbance. This method is based on the idea that field fluctuations caused by the development of electrical treeing propagates as electromagnetic wave governed by Maxwell’s equations, and triggers next dielectric breakdown in a chain reaction. The obtained model can be regarded as the equivalent circuit model in which the resistors representing local property of material are arranged. The key point of the proposed method is the ease of expressing dielectric breakdown as replacement of the arranged resistors. Dielectric breakdown expressed as the local change of conductivity leads to the inhomogeneity of the conductivity. In addition to this simplest model for dielectric breakdown, constraint on the discharge paths to the finite edges in the circuit is applied. This corresponds to the introduction of the implicit inhomogeneity. This implicit inhomogeneity plays a significant role in the process of formation of branching discharge patterns. The capability of introduction of the implicit inhomogeneity and the constraint on the possible candidates for propagation paths enable the proposed method to find out a bifurcated solution and make it easier to analyze formation of discharge patterns in dielectric breakdown. This paper explains these features of the proposed mathematical model with results of numerical simulation of several example problems.},

  abstract     = {In Ahmed et al. (2019) a space–time domain decomposition method was proposed for two-phase flow in a porous medium composed of two different rock types, so that the capillary pressure field is discontinuous at the interface between the rocks. For this nonlinear and degenerate parabolic problem , with nonlinear and discontinuous transmission conditions on the interface, the Optimized Schwarz waveform relaxation method (OSWR) with Robin or Ventcell transmission conditions was considered. A guaranteed and fully computable a posteriori error estimate was derived, which in particular took into account the domain decomposition error. In this paper we provide a mathematical and numerical analysis of this space–time domain decomposition method in the Robin case. Complete numerical approximation is achieved by a finite volume scheme in space and the lowest order discontinuous Galerkin method in time. We prove the existence of a weak solution of the two-phase flow subdomain problem with Robin boundary conditions by analyzing the convergence of the finite volume scheme. The domain decomposition algorithm is based on the solution of space–time nonlinear subdomain problems over the whole time interval , allowing for different time steps in different parts of the domain, adapted to the physical properties of each subdomain, and we show that such an algorithm is well-defined. Numerical experiments on three-dimensional problems with different rock types illustrate the performance of the domain decomposition method.},

Each EGC is constructed by extruding a convex/non-convex polygon along the axis of the EGC and rounding the ends of the EGC. Using an adaptive mapping technique which allows mapping each ECG onto a support domain, the EGCs are mapped onto an analytical grid to obtain an effective density field for material interpolation. Moreover, 2D-plane calculations can be utilized to replace 3D-space calculations to enhance computing efficiency. The positions and the cross-sectional areas of the ECGs are simultaneously optimized through the determination of an optimum set of geometry parameters. Some structural benchmark problems were investigated to verify the applicability of the proposed approach. Compared with the solid isotropic material penalization (SIMP) approach, the underlying approach does not require any filtering or projection techniques. Hence, it can produce a stiffer optimum design with an explicit boundary description whilst the number of design variables dramatically reduces.},

  abstract     = {We develop a long-time moving window framework using Molecular Dynamics (MD) to model shock wave propagation through a one-dimensional chain of atoms. The moving window formulation “follows” a propagating shock wave allowing us to model shock wave propagation much longer than conventional non-equilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations. This formulation also significantly decreases the required domain size and thus reduces the overall computational cost. The domain is divided into a purely atomistic “window” region containing the shock wave flanked by boundary or “continuum” regions on either end which incorporate continuum shock conditions. Spurious wave reflections are removed by employing a damping band method using the Langevin thermostat applied locally to the atoms in each continuum region. The moving window effect is achieved by adding/removing atoms to/from the window and boundary regions, and thus the shock wave front is focused at the center of the window region indefinitely. We simulate the shock through a one-dimensional chain of copper atoms using either the Lennard-Jones, modified Morse, or Embedded Atom Model (EAM) interatomic potential. We first perform verification studies to ensure proper implementation of the thermostat, potential functions, and damping band method, respectively. Next, we track the propagating shock and compare the actual shock velocity and average particle velocity to their corresponding analytical input values. From these comparisons, we optimize the linear shock Hugoniot relation for the given “lattice” orientation and compare these results to those in literature. When incorporated into the linear shock equation, these new Hugoniot parameters are shown to produce a stationary shock wave front. Finally, we perform one-dimensional moving window simulations of an unsteady, structured shock up to a few nanoseconds and characterize the increase in the shock front’s width.},

  abstract     = {Isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love elements have been receiving increasing attention in geometrically nonlinear analysis of thin shells because they make it possible to meet the C 1 C1 requirement in the interior of surface patches and to avoid the use of finite rotations. However, engineering structures of appreciable complexity are typically modeled using multiple patches and, often, neither rotational continuity nor conforming discretization can be practically obtained at patch interfaces. Simple penalty approaches for coupling adjacent patches, applicable to either smooth or non-smooth interfaces and either matching or non-matching discretizations, have been proposed. Although the problem dependence of the penalty coefficient can be reduced by scaling factors which take into account geometrical and material parameters, only high values of the penalty coefficient can guarantee a negligible coupling error in all possible cases. However, this can lead to an ill conditioned problem and to an increasing iterative effort for solving the nonlinear discrete equations. In this work, we show how to avoid this drawback by rewriting the penalty terms in an Hellinger–Reissner form, introducing independent fields work-conjugated to the coupling equations. This technique avoids convergence problems , making the analysis robust also for very high values of the penalty coefficient, which can be then employed to avert coupling errors. Moreover, a proper choice of the basis functions for the new fields provides an accurate coupling also for general non-matching cases, preventing overconstrained solutions. The additional variables are condensed out and then not involved in the global system of equations to be solved. A highly efficient approach based on a mixed integration point strategy and an interface-wise reduced integration rule makes the condensation inexpensive preserving the sparsity of the condensed stiffness matrix and the coupling accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Previous works in topology optimization of structures with contact boundary conditions have concentrated on the two-dimensional rigid obstacle problem . This is because the contact analysis of multiple three-dimensional deformable bodies with meshes that are non-matching across the contact interface requires computationally complex contact algorithms beyond the scope of previous optimization investigations. Our research is devoted to addressing topology design problems with multiple deformable three-dimensional components in contact using state-of-the-art contact algorithms. We formulate and resolve the design simulation problem using large deformation continuum mechanics and the finite element method . To account for large sliding that can occur during the design optimization process here, the mortar segment-to-segment approach was used to discretize the contact surface due to its numerical robustness in this regime. Since, mortar integrals provide smooth contact forces as nodes slide on/off the surface, solution convergence is well behaved. Considering the contact problem is computationally expensive to solve, we solve the optimization problem using efficient nonlinear programming algorithms which require the sensitivities of the cost and constraint functions. To this end, we formulate analytical adjoint sensitivity expressions to compute the gradients of general functionals. As expected and corroborated in this work, the adjoint method is computationally efficient. Additionally, we use a B-spline design parameterization to regularize the topology optimization problem. We show that this parameterization reduces the number of design variables compared to usual element-wise parameterizations and provides a precise and smooth description of the design boundary. We present numerical example problems of multiple deformable three-dimensional bodies in contact with large deformations and find optimal topologies that maximize the total contact force, maximize the strain energy, and minimize the compliance.},

  abstract     = {The main idea of this manuscript is to assess the wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, which is designed for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent boundary layer , in transitional flow. In contrast to many other sub-grid-scale (SGS) models, the WALE model demonstrates the asymptotic decay of the eddy viscosity in the vicinity of a solid wall in turbulent boundary layer without relying on a dynamic procedure on the SGS model coefficient . Furthermore, the WALE model yields zero eddy viscosity in pure shear flow. Such features are attractive for LES of laminar-to-turbulent transition, yet the WALE model has not been thoroughly investigated in transitional boundary layer flow . Well-resolved LES is conducted for canonical boundary layer transition triggered by sub-harmonic resonance. The model formulation is thoroughly analyzed in the transition process. The asymptotic behavior of the two major tensors, i.e., the strain rate tensor and the traceless tensor of the velocity gradient squared, are confirmed in the current well-resolved LES. The cubic decay of the eddy viscosity in the wall distance is confirmed from the asymptotic analysis on the transitional flow. The presence of the strain rate in the model formulation generates practically zero eddy viscosity in the pre-transition region, allowing interactions of small-amplitude instabilities. The traceless tensor of the velocity gradient squared escalates if small-scale eddies appear, leading to sizable eddy viscosity particularly in the log-law layer in turbulent flow. The response of the WALE model to grid resolution is also discussed. The performance of the WALE model is compared to two other SGS models, Smagorinsky and Vreman models with a constant coefficient , in the current transitional wall-bounded flow.},

In the food industry, multiphase fluids are now relatively wide-spread, in particular, because of the desire to have faster throughput for large-scale food production. In many cases involving transport, such materials consist of a fluidized binder material with embedded particles. As one increases the volume fraction of particles, a corresponding increase in effective overall viscosity occurs. Often, during the process, the material must be heated, for example, to ensure food safety, induce pasteurization, sterilization, etc. For real-time control, this requires rapidly computable models to guide thermal processing, for example by applied electrical induction. In the present analysis, models are developed for the required heating field (electrically induced) and pressure gradient needed in a pipe to heat a multiphase material to a target temperature and to transport the material with a prescribed flow rate.},

The resulting continuous and discrete schemes, which involve the Cauchy fluid stress, the velocity of the fluid, and the concentration as the only unknowns, are then equivalently reformulated as fixed point operator equations. Consequently, the well-known Schauder, Banach, and Brouwer theorems, combined with Babuška–Brezzi’s theory in Banach spaces, monotone operator theory, regularity assumptions, and Sobolev imbedding theorems, allow to establish the corresponding well-posedness of them. In particular, Raviart–Thomas approximations of order k ≥ 0 k≥0 for the stress, discontinuous piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k ≤k for the velocity, and continuous piecewise polynomials of degree ≤ k + 1 ≤k+1 for the concentration, becomes a feasible choice for the Galerkin scheme. Next, suitable Strang-type lemmas are employed to derive optimal a priori error estimates. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the performance of the mixed-primal scheme and confirming the theoretical rates of convergence, are provided.},

  abstract     = {The free energy plays a fundamental role in theories of phase transformations and microstructure evolution. It encodes the thermodynamic coupling between different fields, such as mechanics and chemistry, within continuum descriptions of non-equilibrium materials phenomena. In mechano-chemically interacting materials systems, even consideration of only compositions, order parameters and strains results in a free energy description that occupies a high-dimensional space. Scale bridging between the electronic structure of a solid and continuum descriptions of its non-equilibrium behavior can be realized with integrable deep neural networks (IDNN) that are trained to free energy derivative data generated by first-principles statistical mechanics simulations and then analytically integrating to recover a free energy density function. Here we combine the IDNN with an active learning workflow to ensure well-distributed sampling of the free energy derivative data in high-dimensional input spaces, thereby enabling true scale bridging between first-principles statistical mechanics and continuum phase field models. As a prototypical material system we focus on Ni–Al. Cahn–Hilliard and Allen–Cahn phase field simulations using the resulting IDNN representation for the free energy density of Ni–Al demonstrate that the appropriate physics of the material have been learned. This work advances the treatment of scale bridging, starting with electronic structure calculations and proceeding through statistical mechanics to continuum physics. Its coupling of Cahn–Hilliard and Allen–Cahn phase field descriptions with nonlinear elasticity through the free energy density ensures a rigorous treatment of phase transformation phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The interaction of beam-like structures against surfaces is a challenging problem with applications in engineering (wheel–rail contact, pipeline–soil interaction, ropes sliding on the seabed) and in medical applications such as surgical planning and training (catheter navigation, aneurysm coiling, stent deployment). This contact problem is traditionally solved using Total Lagrangian beam formulations, which interact against Lagrangian triangulated surfaces. Overall, the computational speed is affected, due to the nonlinearities of the beam formulation and, as well as due to the expensive search algorithms, required to find the close point projection. In the search towards an efficient beam to surface contact algorithm, this paper explores the combined use of (1) a corotational beam formulation, where the motion of the beam element is decomposed in rigid body and pure deformational parts and (2) an implicit description of the surface by means of discrete signed distance fields (SDF), which can be seen as a Lagrangian beam immersed within an Eulerian (rigid) solid. To do so, a previously reported implicit corotational formulation for beam dynamics is modified to account for frictional contact, by means of a penalty term. The new contributions are fully linearized to update the tangent operator and the system is integrated in time by means of the HHT- α α method. Overall, a consistent implicit contact dynamics formulation is provided. A SDF, defined in a voxel-type grid, is used to represent implicitly the surface geometry. The SDF values and derivatives are computed at the Lagrangian point of integration of the beam by means of an efficient tensor product of compact, high order, 1D Kernels, as widely used in immersed Fluid–Structure Interaction techniques. A wide variety of validation tests are presented which prove the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

This in particular allows to lift a given algebraic residual. In connection with approaches lifting the total residual, we show how to obtain guaranteed, fully computable, and constant-free upper and lower a posteriori bounds on the algebraic, total, and discretization errors ; here we consider the model Poisson equation discretized by the conforming finite element method of arbitrary order and including an arbitrary iterative solver. We next formulate safe stopping criteria ensuring that the algebraic error does not dominate the total error. We also prove efficiency, i.e., equivalence of our upper total and algebraic estimates with the total and algebraic errors, respectively, up to a generic constant ; this constant is polynomial-degree-independent for the total error. Numerical experiments illustrate sharp control of all error components and accurate prediction of their spatial distribution in several test problems, including cases where some classical estimators fail. The H ( div ) H(div) -liftings at the same time allow to recover mass balance for any problem, any numerical discretization , and any situation such as inexact solution of (nonlinear) algebraic systems or algorithm failure, which we believe is of independent interest. We demonstrate this mass balance recovery in a simulation of immiscible incompressible two-phase flow in porous media .},

  abstract     = {Fracture propagation coupled with fluid flow in porous media has very important applications in fracking in oil and gas reservoirs, corrosion in ceramics, and degradation of human bones. Modeling fracture failure in porous media governed by the coupled solid and fluid field equations is challenging and time-consuming. This paper extends discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods to model crack openings in porous media through exploiting an easy construction of interfaces for potential crack paths by locally breaking continuous elements. Consequently, a finite element mesh for fracture apertures is completely and gracefully constructed using DG interface objects as well as the definitions of jumps of displacements across the DG interfaces defined for bulk matrices. Furthermore, rigid cohesive laws often adopted for crack openings can be naturally implemented in DG formulations without introducing artificial stiffness, which may eventually improve the performance for implicit formulations in handling crack openings in porous media. In this work, we perform a consistent, fully implicit, and fully coupled hybrid DG/continuous finite element formulation for three field equations including the solid, bulk fluid, and fluid in fracture apertures resulting from crack openings. We verify our DG formulation and implementation using the Khristianovich-Geertsma-DeKlerk analytical solutions. Finally, we further demonstrate a good performance of the proposed DG method by modeling fracking in an oil reservoir containing two nature fractures.},

The accuracy of computed solutions over coarse meshes, that have highly non-interpolatory control meshes, is achieved through the application of a continuous rotational approach. The starting point of the formulation is the modified Hellinger–Reissner variational principle with independent displacement, membrane, and shear strains as the unknown fields. To overcome locking, the strain variables are interpolated with lower-order spline bases while the variations of the strain variables are interpolated with the corresponding Bézier dual bases. Leveraging the orthogonality property of the Bézier dual basis, the strain variables are condensed out of the system with only a slight increase in the bandwidth of the resulting linear system. The condensed approach preserves the accuracy of the non-condensed mixed approach but with fewer degrees of freedom. From a practical point of view, since the Bézier dual basis is completely specified through Bézier extraction, any spline space that admits Bézier extraction can utilize the proposed approach directly.},

  abstract     = {The presence of uplift pressures in cracked plain concrete hydraulic structures is a major concern for their durability, serviceability and stability. To assess the performance of cracked structures several mechanical and hydraulic response parameters must be computed. This paper presents the development, implementation and application of a new nonlinear combined segregated fully-coupled hydromechanical model for application to non-planar 3D hydraulic fractures where complex flow is occurring. The eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) formulation is used, as it facilitates the computation of the crack aperture as well as the application of water pressure on crack surfaces for the simulation of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation. To take into consideration the effects of drainage in numerical modeling and simulation , two coupled (multi-physics) finite element models are used; (1) one for the uplift pressures where a hydraulic mesh with refinement around drains is used, and (2) one for the mechanical response coupled with the computation of the unsaturated interstitial seepage problem. The two subproblems are solved using a partitioned procedure, as they have different resolution requirements. Finally, the mechanical mesh and the hydraulic mesh have non-matching discrete interfaces that must be coupled while respecting the equilibrium of the applied loads. Applications of the proposed hydromechanical constitutive model and numerical solution strategy to different problems are presented on a wedge splitting test and a full scale gravity dam including multiple drainage configurations. A case study adapted from a real dam is also given with a complex 3D non-planar discontinuity surface .},

  abstract     = {With recent developments in topology optimization and additive manufacturing technology , it is now possible to fabricate architected materials with spatially varying microstructures. However, in designing these microstructures, the absence of proper interface connectivity can cause reduced effectiveness or even failure. We present a method for ensuring smooth interface connectivity for orthotropic microstructures through supershape-based parametric modeling. A microstructure can be reproduced by deleting the non-material regions, or voids, from a fully solid material domain. The proposed algorithm utilizes this void based representation to fuse two incompatible microstructures. Each of the voids of the input designs is detected and expressed using a superformula based implicit equation. To connect the two incompatible microstructures, a transition zone of intermediate microstructures are generated by morphing the voids of one structure to another. The morphing operation is posed as an optimization problem , which tries to minimize the difference between the two microstructures by altering their supershape parameters. An exact match at the interface of the intermediate microstructures is attained by putting restrictions on the shape of the voids that are neighboring each other. To prevent sharp changes in structural properties during morphing, homogenized total strain energy of the generated microstructure is constrained so that the properties are within a specified range from its previous microstructure in the sequence. Ancillary constraints on attainable volume fraction as well as on overlap of voids are also prescribed for controlling the optimization process. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the void morphing method to find intermediate microstructures in the design space under these constraints. The proposed algorithm is a post-processing approach, therefore it is versatile and applicable to a wide variety of results since it requires the optimization problem to be formulated only at the interface region.},

  abstract     = {A finite element method is introduced to simulate surface tension dominated flow of two immiscible fluids featuring an enriched space for capturing both strong and weak pressure discontinuities. The proposed enriched finite element space is created utilizing the standard finite element shape functions. Discontinuities are captured by adding merely one additional degree of freedom per each node of the elements cut by the interface. Being local to the cut elements, these additional degrees of freedom are eliminated before assembling the global system of equations following a condensation procedure. The method is stabilized introducing a procedure for improving the conditioning of the enriched pressure contribution to the stiffness matrix in small-cut situations. An improved smoothing strategy based on an artificial diffusion equation is proposed to enhance the performance of the method on rather coarse meshes. A series of three-dimensional two-phase fluid flow benchmarks are solved to assess the performance of the method. Particular attention is paid to surface tension dominated cases. The method is verified by showing its accuracy in capturing strong pressure discontinuity at the interface of a spherical droplet as well as its capability in handling large pressure gradient discontinuity in a hydrostatic liquid–gas container. The method is further validated by simulating oscillations of a slightly disturbed spherical droplet. The mass conservation property of the method and the effect of the smoothing procedure on the result is assessed by simulating the oscillations of a prolate droplet. Ultimately, the method is tested in a more challenging setting by simulating the rising gas bubble inside a liquid domain.},

In a discrete setting these modes pertain to the very low stiffness regions of the design domain occupied by hair-like elements with vanishing cross-sections and often surface when the computational optimizer tries to make dramatic changes to the topology. We demonstrate the inability of the classical approach to discrete topology optimization in capturing and repositioning these modes, and provide an elegant alternative which rests on the idea of expanding the set of design variables to include an “indicator” set, that similar to element densities in continuum domain, allow for quick clustering of contributing and non-contributing elements. The interplay between the set of basic design variables and the “indicator” set is shown to have the ability to identify the dominant eigenpairs that get pushed away in the presence of spurious modes and to effectively reposition them back to their original place where accurate values for the objective, constraints and the associated eigen-sensitivities are needed. A set of 2D frame structural topology optimization problems are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology as well as the impact of parameters that affect the size of the design space, such as minimum to maximum thickness ratio and constraint bounds , on the optimized topology.},

To this end, we discuss in detail how and under which circumstances diagonal mass matrices can be obtained. In addition, we propose an approach to improving the interpolation accuracy of quadratic scaled boundary-shape functions. In essence, our results show that mass lumping can be achieved without loss of accuracy if linear or quadratic node-based shape functions are deployed for the interpolation on the subdomain boundaries. This finding also applies to non-convex elements, which allow coarse discretizations — and, hence, comparably large time steps — in problems involving singularities. We discuss the application to polygonal and severely distorted meshes. Numerical examples include problems from the fields of acoustics, elasticity, and thermal diffusion.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we tackle the problem of surfactant spreading on a thin liquid film in the framework of isogeometric analysis. We consider a mathematical model that describes this phenomenon as an initial boundary value problem (IBVP) that includes two coupled fourth order partial differential equations (PDEs), one for the film height and one for the surfactant concentration. In order to solve this problem numerically, it is customary to transform it into a mixed problem that includes at most second order PDEs. However, the higher-order continuity of the approximation functions in Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) allows us to deal with the weak form of the fourth order PDEs directly, without the need of resorting to mixed methods. We demonstrate numerically that the IGA solution is able to reproduce results obtained before with mixed approaches. Complex phenomena such as Marangoni-driven fingering instabilities triggered by perturbations are easily captured.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturing new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners represents a computational challenge to industry, due to the large variability in material parameters and geometrical configurations that need to be tested during the early design phase. This process can be highly optimised through the employment of user-friendly computational metamodels constructed on the basis of Reduced Order Modelling (ROM) techniques, where high-dimensional parametric offline solutions are obtained, stored and assimilated in order to be efficiently queried in real time. This paper presents a novel Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) based metamodel for the analysis of electro-magneto-mechanical interactions in the context of MRI scanner design, with three distinct novelties. First, the paper derives, from scratch, a five-dimensional parametrised offline solution process, expressed in terms of (axisymmetric) cylindrical coordinates , external excitation frequency , electrical conductivity of the embedded shields and strength of the static magnetic field . Second, by exploiting the staggered nature of the coupled problem at hand, an efficient sequential PGD algorithm is derived and compared against a previously published monolithic PGD algorithm. As a third novelty, the paper draws some interesting comparisons against an alternative tailor-made ROM technique, where the electromagnetic equations are solved using a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition model. A series of numerical examples are presented in order to illustrate, motivate and demonstrate the validity and potential of the considered approach, especially in terms of cost reduction.},

However, most of the known phase-field fracture models have only considered the tensile failure and may not be directly applicable to the shear fracture . In this paper, a phase-field model for mixed-mode fracture is proposed based on a unified tensile fracture criterion . The proposed model is developed from the unified phase-field theory and the original unified phase-field model can be recovered as a particular case. General softening laws for cohesive zone models can also be considered. The unified tensile fracture criterion is embedded in the proposed mixed-mode phase-field model and different fracture patterns can be obtained in the simulation according to the material properties, including failures based on both maximum normal stress and maximum shear stress criteria. The crack propagation direction can be easily determined by the unified tensile fracture criterion. Compared with the classical phase-field model, two additional material parameters are needed, i.e., the failure tension strength and the ratio of the critical shear failure stress to the critical normal fracture stress. Numerical examples have shown that the proposed model has the ability to model mixed-mode fractures, and can also be applied to rock-like brittle materials under compression.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a surrogate modeling scheme based on Grassmannian manifold learning to be used for cost-efficient predictions of high-dimensional stochastic systems . The method exploits subspace-structured features of each solution by projecting it onto a Grassmann manifold. This point-wise linear dimensionality reduction harnesses the structural information to assess the similarity between solutions at different points in the input parameter space. The method utilizes a solution clustering approach in order to identify regions of the parameter space over which solutions are sufficiently similarly such that they can be interpolated on the Grassmannian. In this clustering, the reduced-order solutions are partitioned into disjoint clusters on the Grassmann manifold using the eigen-structure of properly defined Grassmannian kernels and, the Karcher mean of each cluster is estimated. Then, the points in each cluster are projected onto the tangent space with origin at the corresponding Karcher mean using the exponential mapping . For each cluster, a Gaussian process regression model is trained that maps the input parameters of the system to the reduced solution points of the corresponding cluster projected onto the tangent space . Using this Gaussian process model , the full-field solution can be efficiently predicted at any new point in the parameter space. In certain cases, the solution clusters will span disjoint regions of the parameter space. In such cases, for each of the solution clusters we utilize a second, density-based spatial clustering to group their corresponding input parameter points in the Euclidean space . The proposed method is applied to two numerical examples . The first is a nonlinear stochastic ordinary differential equation with uncertain initial conditions where the surrogate is used to predict the time history solution. The second involves modeling of plastic deformation in a model amorphous solid using the Shear Transformation Zone theory of plasticity, where the proposed surrogate is used to predict the full strain field of a material specimen under large shear strains.},

  abstract     = {High fidelity (HF) mathematical models describing the generation of active force in the cardiac muscle tissue typically feature a large number of state variables to capture the intrinsically complex underlying subcellular mechanisms. With the aim of drastically reducing the computational burden associated with the numerical solution of these models, we propose a machine learning method that builds a reduced order model (ROM); this is obtained as the best-approximation of the HF model within a class of candidate differential equations based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Within a semiphysical (gray-box) approach, an ANN learns the dynamics of the HF model from input–output pairs generated by the HF model itself (i.e. non-intrusively), being additionally informed with some a priori knowledge about the HF model. The ANN-based ROM, with just two internal variables, can accurately reproduce the results of the HF model, that instead features more than 2000 variables, under several physiological and pathological working regimes of the cell. We then propose a multiscale 3D cardiac electromechanical model, wherein active force generation is described by means of the previously trained ANN. We achieve a very favorable balance between accuracy of the result (order of 1 0 − 3 10−3 for the main cardiac biomarkers) and computational efficiency (with a speedup of about one order of magnitude), still relying on a biophysically detailed description of the microscopic force generation phenomenon.},

Implicit time integration is used in the case of the transient form. A differentiable local bounds preserving method has been developed, which combines a Rusanov artificial diffusion operator and a differentiable shock detector. Nonlinear stabilization schemes are usually stiff and highly nonlinear. This issue is mitigated by the differentiability properties of the proposed method. Moreover, in order to further improve the nonlinear convergence, we also propose a continuation method for a subset of the stabilization parameters. The resulting method has been successfully applied to steady and transient problems with complex shock patterns. Numerical experiments show that it is able to provide sharp and well resolved shocks. The importance of the differentiability is assessed by comparing the new scheme with its non-differentiable counterpart. Numerical experiments suggest that, for up to moderate nonlinear tolerances, the method exhibits improved robustness and nonlinear convergence behavior for steady problems. In the case of transient problem, we also observe a reduction in the computational cost.},

However, those computational units necessitate to re-write the program by using a low-level language which is suited to those architectures (e.g. CUDA for GPU NVIDIA®or OpenCL ). In this paper we focus our effort on the performance portability of LBM i.e. the possibility of writing LB algorithms with a high-level of abstraction while remaining efficient on a wide range of architectures such as multicores x86, GPU NVIDIA®, ARM, and so on. For such a purpose, implementation of LBM is carried out by developing a unique code, LBM_saclay written in the C++ language, coupled with the Kokkos library for performance portability in the context of High Performance Computing. In this paper, the LBM is used to simulate a phase-field model for two-phase flow problems with phase change. The mathematical model is composed of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations coupled with the conservative Allen–Cahn model. Initially developed in the literature for immiscible binary fluids, the model is extended here to simulate phase change occurring at the interface between liquid and gas. For that purpose, a heat equation is added with a source term involving the time derivative of the phase field. In the phase-field equation a source term is added to approximate the mass production rate at the interface. Several validations are carried out to check step-by-step the implementation of the full model. Finally, computational times are compared on CPU and GPU platforms for the physical problem of film boiling.},

  abstract     = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) encode physical conservation laws and prior physical knowledge into the neural networks, ensuring the correct physics is represented accurately while alleviating the need for supervised learning to a great degree (Raissi et al., 2019). While effective for relatively short-term time integration, when long time integration of the time-dependent PDEs is sought, the time–space domain may become arbitrarily large and hence training of the neural network may become prohibitively expensive. To this end, we develop a parareal physics-informed neural network (PPINN), hence decomposing a long-time problem into many independent short-time problems supervised by an inexpensive/fast coarse-grained (CG) solver. In particular, the serial CG solver is designed to provide approximate predictions of the solution at discrete times, while initiate many fine PINNs simultaneously to correct the solution iteratively. There is a two-fold benefit from training PINNs with small-data sets rather than working on a large-data set directly, i.e., training of individual PINNs with small-data is much faster, while training the fine PINNs can be readily parallelized. Consequently, compared to the original PINN approach, the proposed PPINN approach may achieve a significant speed-up for long-time integration of PDEs, assuming that the CG solver is fast and can provide reasonable predictions of the solution, hence aiding the PPINN solution to converge in just a few iterations. To investigate the PPINN performance on solving time-dependent PDEs, we first apply the PPINN to solve the Burgers equation, and subsequently we apply the PPINN to solve a two-dimensional nonlinear diffusion–reaction equation. Our results demonstrate that PPINNs converge in a few iterations with significant speed-ups proportional to the number of time-subdomains employed.},

  abstract     = {Recently we have developed a new numerical approach for PDEs with constant coefficients on irregular domains and Cartesian meshes. In this paper we extend it to a much more general case of PDEs with variable coefficients that have a lot of applications; e.g., the modeling of functionally graded materials , the inhomogeneous materials obtained by 3-D printing and many others. Here, we consider the 2-D wave and heat equations for isotropic and anisotropic inhomogeneous materials. The idea of the extension to the case of PDEs with variable coefficients is based on the representation of the stencil coefficients as functions of the mesh size . This leads to the increase in the size of the local system of algebraic equations solved for each grid point of the new approach; however, this does not change the size of the global system of semidiscrete equations and practically does not increase the computational costs of the proposed technique. Similar to our previous technique, the new 2-D approach with compact 9-point stencils uses trivial Cartesian meshes for complex irregular domains and provides the fourth order of accuracy for the wave and heat equations with variable coefficients. The calculation of the coefficients of the stencil equations is based on the minimization of the local truncation error of the stencil equations and yields the optimal order of accuracy of the new technique. At similar 9-point stencils, the accuracy of the new approach is much higher than that for the linear finite elements . The numerical results for irregular domains show that at the same number of degrees of freedom, the new approach is even much more accurate than the high-order (up to the third order) finite elements with much wider stencils. The wave and heat equations are uniformly treated with the new approach.},

The non-local PD theory is used for dealing with localized cracking process while the FEM is adopted for modeling elastic (or plastic) problems without localization. The evolving boundary between cracking domain and the elastic or plastic domain without localization is taken into account. A new bond damage model is implemented into the ordinary state-based PD theory, by considering the progressive degradation of bond strength and residual strength. The proposed coupling method and bond damage model are implemented in MATLAB framework. The accuracy of the PD-FEM coupling method is verified by the analytical solutions in elastic cases. The efficiency of the new bond damage model implemented in the adaptive PD-FEM coupling method for modeling the progressive failure process in cohesive materials is clearly validated through a series of representative laboratory tests on concrete structures.},

Previously, we have developed a phase-field model to capture the rate-dependent failure of rubber, and we have further enhanced it to describe failure due to cyclic loading. Although the model accurately describes fatigue failure, the associated cyclic simulations are slow. Therefore, this contribution presents an acceleration scheme for cyclic simulations of our previously introduced phase-field damage model so that the simulation speed is increased to facilitate large-scale simulations of industrially relevant problems. We formulate an explicit and an implicit cycle jump method, which, depending on the selected jump size, reduce the calculation time up to 99 . 5 % 99.5% . To circumvent the manual tuning of the jump size, we also present an adaptive jump size selection procedure . Thanks to the implicit adaptive scheme, all material parameters are identified from experiments, which include fatigue crack nucleation and crack growth. Finally, the model and its parameters are validated with additional measurements of the fatigue crack growth rate.},

  abstract     = {A new precipitation model based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method with elements of Cellular Automata is presented in the paper. The model consists of three submodels: nucleation, precipitation growth, and diffusion of niobium and carbon. The nucleation model used classical nucleation theory and considers homo- and heterogeneous nucleation . The nucleation rate depends on the number of possible nucleation sites , which are defined by dislocation density , i.e. deformation conditions . The nucleation rate depends also on the Zeldowicz parameter, the factor of condensation rate, precipitation work, temperature, and other variables. The nucleation rate is realized in the model by calculating the probability of nucleon appearance in every cell, free of precipitation, and depends on the nucleation rate, the cell volume, and the time step. The growth or dissolution of the precipitation depends on the model on particle size and prevailing local conditions near the particle. The temperature and concentration define the equilibrium size of the particle. LBM model is applied to solve the Fourier equation for niobium and carbon diffusion. Near the precipitations equilibrium concentration of niobium and carbon is established according to precipitations size and temperature, while free diffusion is considered in the other space. Strain-induced precipitation at different temperatures and with the different constant cooling rate was simulated. Results are coincident with theory and experimental researches reported in the scientific literature. Modeling of precipitation during the rolling process with consideration of recrystallization shows an ability of the model to simulate and study the more complex processes that strain-induced precipitation in single deformation. It can be applied for multi-stages deformation processes to design or optimize them in view of precipitation and microstructure evolution .},

By the hybrid model reduction, the stochastic optimal solution is represented by a low rank variable-separation expansion, by which fast online computation is achieved. A set of stochastic basis functions and deterministic physical basis functions are built for the variable-separation expression. These basis functions are model-oriented and involve offline computation. To efficiently identify the stochastic basis functions, we use a stochastic elliptic optimal system to learn the stochastic information and construct the stochastic basis functions. Then generalized multiscale finite element method is used to solve the parabolic optimality system at a few optimal samples, the solutions of which are used to train the deterministic physical basis functions. By the stochastic basis functions and the set of parabolic optimality system solutions, we construct a bi-fidelity model to efficiently compute the deterministic physical basis functions and get a low rank variable-separation representation for the stochastic parabolic optimal problem. For the hybrid model reduction, bi-model, multiscale coarse model and bi-fidelity model techniques are combined together to significantly reduce the computation complexity.

Our method is based on traditional seed placement and tessellation approaches, with three critical improvements: (i) allowing for controlled seed overlap to better represent microstructural statistics , (ii) multi-sphere representation of 3D ellipsoids to account for arbitrarily elongated grains, and (iii) novel application of the axis aligned bounding box tree structure for accelerated seed placement. Our method recreates a diverse set of microstructural features , including the presence of spherical and non-spherical grain geometries, amorphous phases , and voids. After the method is presented, we proceed with a rigorous numerical analysis demonstrating its ability to reproduce key statistical features of target microstructures.

A standard finite element method (FEM) is still one of the main methods to investigate properties and mechanical responses of magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) materials and structures. However, the computational features of FEM lead to some limitations. In this paper, we proposed the cell-based smoothed finite element method (CS-FEM) for superior calculations, in which the strain smoothing technique is introduced into FEM. We showed, that CS-FEM possesses high accuracy, low mesh restriction, much less computational-cost than FEM, and stronger handling ability when encountering strong mesh distortions and large deformations . CS-FEM with modified Newmark scheme was defined to show an effect of the high-temperature environment and mechanical load on the time-dependent responses of MEE structures . The convergence, effectiveness, and efficiency of CS-FEM were validated via the numerical examples for simplified bi-layer transducer and an energy harvester as MEE intelligent structures. Additionally, the transient performance of intelligent structures around Curie temperature was comprehensively discussed. The presented CS-FEM and obtained results can be used for future studies of the coupled multi-physical problems as well as investigations of the accuracy of intelligent structure models subjected to extreme conditions.},

However, the crucial UQ of high efficiency and confidence remains challenging for mixed multidimensional uncertainties. In this study, a generalized active subspace (GAS) for dimension reduction is presented and the characteristics of GAS are investigated by interval analysis. An adaptive response surface model can then be employed for uncertainty propagation. Since the precise eigenvalues of interval matrix are difficult to solve in mathematics, three alternative estimate methods, i.e. interval eigenvalue analysis (IEA), empirical distribution function (EDF), and Taylor expansions, are developed for the GAS computation and practical use. The efficacy of the GAS and the estimate methods is demonstrated on three test examples: a three-dimensional response function, a standard NASA test of six-dimensional mixed uncertainties, and a NACA0012 airfoil design case of ten epistemic uncertainties. The IEA estimate is comparatively more suitable, but needs more computational cost due to the requirement of bound matrices. When the uncertainty level is small, the three methods are all applicable and the estimate based on EDF can be more efficient. The methodology exhibits high accuracy and strong adaptability in dimension reduction, thus providing a potential template for tackling a wide variety of multidimensional mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ problems.},

In this paper, a numerical manifold model is presented for hydro-mechanical simulation of the saturated and semi-saturated SRMs. In the case of the semi-saturated SRMs, the model is based on the generalized Biot theory involving immiscible two-phase wetting and non-wetting fluids in deformable porous media. The wetting, non-wetting fluid pressure and skeleton displacement are chosen to be primary variables which are related to the wetting and non-wetting saturation and permeability by experimental relationships. For the mechanical problem, the material interfaces between soil and rock are deemed discontinuous by imposing a stick–slip contact constraint using an augmented Lagrange multiplier approach. For the hydraulic problem, the material interfaces are continuous for the fluid pressure and flux fields. Within the framework of the numerical manifold method (NMM), the discretized model including the interfacial discontinuities always can be established using the triangular mesh and the lumped mass representation is always available to increase computational efficiency. Besides the benchmark problems of saturated and semi-saturated porous media, two examples of soil–rock foundation and slope are performed to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the model and to investigate the hydro-mechanical responses of the porous SRMs .},

  abstract     = {An adsorbed gas amount obtained from excess adsorption isotherms is of great importance to an estimation of reservoir reserves and prediction of gas production in shale reservoirs. Generally, excess adsorption amounts are calculated by a void volume of an adsorbent measured by helium expansion tests. However, helium atoms can closely approach a pore wall and get into small pores due to their small size. Therefore, a helium-based volume is always larger than the accessible volume for a specific adsorbate. In this work, we use GCMC (Grand Canonical Monte Carlo) simulation to investigate methane adsorption on shale with pore sizes of 10, 20 and 30 Å at a temperature of 323 K. Five void volumes, including an apparent volume determined by helium expansion tests, a helium-probed volume, a simulated methane-based volume, an analytical methane-based volume, and a physical volume, are recognized. Use of a physical volume and a helium-based volume leads to negative excess adsorption at high pressure, which is not consistent with local density profiles at such pressure. It is thus necessary to calibrate a physical volume or use a methane-based volume as a theoretical value for calculating excess isotherms. Excess isotherms determined by a calibrated volume or methane-based volume are more accurate and keep positive even at high pressure. Appropriate calculations of excess isotherms also influence an estimation of proportions of excess adsorbed and free gas amounts in shale gas reservoirs, further having a great impact on the determination of a development strategy.},

  abstract     = {Many geologic materials have a composite structure, in which macroscopic mechanical behavior is determined by the properties, shape, and heterogeneous distribution of individual constituents. In particular, sedimentary rocks commonly exhibit a layered microstructure, with distinct bedding planes that can also form planes of weakness. In this work, we present a homogenization framework for modeling inelastic layered media. The proposed constitutive model allows for distinct micro-constitutive laws for each layer, explicit representation of layer distributions, as well as incorporation of imperfect bonding at the interface between adjacent layers. No a priori assumptions are needed regarding the specific constitutive models used for the layers and interfaces, providing significant modeling flexibility. The overall framework provides a simple and physically-motivated way of defining anisotropic material behavior as an emergent property of the layered microstructure. The model is calibrated using triaxial and true-triaxial experimental data to demonstrate its ability to describe anisotropic deformation and multiple modes of failure.},

  abstract     = {This work presents numerical techniques to enforce continuity constraints on multi-patch surfaces for three distinct problem classes. The first involves structural analysis of thin shells that are described by general Kirchhoff–Love kinematics. Their governing equation is a vector-valued, fourth-order, nonlinear, partial differential equation (PDE) that requires at least C 1 C1 -continuity within a displacement-based finite element formulation. The second class are surface phase separations modeled by a phase field. Their governing equation is the Cahn–Hilliard equation – a scalar, fourth-order, nonlinear PDE – that can be coupled to the thin shell PDE. The third class are brittle fracture processes modeled by a phase field approach. In this work, these are described by a scalar, fourth-order, nonlinear PDE that is similar to the Cahn–Hilliard equation and is also coupled to the thin shell PDE. Using a direct finite element discretization, the two phase field equations also require at least a C 1 C1 -continuous formulation. Isogeometric surface discretizations – often composed of multiple patches – thus require constraints that enforce the C 1 C1 -continuity of displacement and phase field. For this, two numerical strategies are presented: A Lagrange multiplier formulation and a penalty method. The curvilinear shell model including the geometrical constraints is taken from Duong et al. (2017) and it is extended to model the coupled phase field problems on thin shells of Zimmermann et al. (2019) and Paul et al. (2020) on multi-patches. Their accuracy and convergence are illustrated by several numerical examples considering deforming shells, phase separations on evolving surfaces, and dynamic brittle fracture of thin shells.},

This paper presents a novel efficient and robust phase field algorithm for quasi-static brittle fracture analysis. This algorithm overcomes two major issues that affect significantly the numerical cost of the method: the treatment of discontinuous crack propagation and the inequality constraint associated with the irreversibility of the damage evolution. To handle discontinuous crack propagation, a semi-implicit scheme, which combines the usual explicit and implicit schemes, is proposed. Different from explicit schemes that require small time steps and purely implicit schemes that lose immediately efficiency when encountering discontinuous propagation, the proposed method can alleviate the steps constraint while keeping a good robustness with discontinuous cracking. Concerning the irreversibility constraint, this work proposes a practical and easy-to-implement method. It is shown that this method is extremely efficient and robust without any supplementary numerical coefficient. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by means of representative numerical examples.},

In other words, these techniques explore the space of possible observations and determine an experimental setup that produces maximum information about the system parameters on average. Generally, optimal Bayesian design formulations result in multiple high-dimensional integrals that are difficult to evaluate without incurring significant computational costs as each integration point corresponds to solving a coupled system of partial differential equations. In the present work, we propose a novel approach for development of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogate model for the design utility function. In particular, we demonstrate how the orthogonality of PCE basis polynomials can be utilized in order to replace the expensive integration over the space of possible observations by direct construction of PCE approximation for the expected information gain. This novel technique enables the derivation of a reasonable quality response surface for the targeted objective function with a computational budget comparable to several single-point evaluations. Therefore, the proposed technique reduces dramatically the overall cost of optimal Bayesian experimental design. We evaluate this alternative formulation utilizing PCE on few numerical test cases with various levels of complexity to illustrate the computational advantages of the proposed approach.},

Among several strategies developed in the computational mechanics to deal with multiscale phenomena, the Arlequin method proposes overlapping a local discretization to a global one, in the neighborhood of localized effects, and gluing both models in an appropriate subzone of the overlap by means of Lagrange multipliers method , being successful in the solid mechanics context, but less explored in CFD analysis.

To circumvent convergence difficulties caused by excessive distortions of low-density elements under large deformations, an energy interpolation scheme is revisited to account for multiple candidate hyperelastic materials. Computational efficiency is addressed from both structural analysis and optimization perspectives. To solve the nonlinear state equations efficiently, we employ the lower-order Virtual Element Method in conjunction with tailored adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening strategies. To efficiently update the design variables of the multi-material system, we exploit the separable nature and improve the ZPR (Zhang–Paulino–Ramos) update scheme to account for positive sensitivities and update the design variables associated with each volume constraint in parallel.

This friction plays a critical role in the growth of these shear fractures, as revealed by the fracture mechanics theory of Palmer and Rice decades ago. In this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model of shear fracture in pressure-sensitive geomaterials, honoring the role of friction in the fracture propagation mechanism. Building on a recently proposed phase-field method for frictional interfaces, we formulate a set of governing equations for different contact conditions (or lack thereof) in which frictional energy dissipation emerges in the crack driving force during slip. We then derive the degradation function and the threshold fracture energy of the phase-field model such that the stress–strain behavior is insensitive to the length parameter for phase-field regularization. This derivation procedure extends a methodology used in recent phase-field models of cohesive tensile fracture to shear fracture in frictional materials in which peak and residual strengths coexist and evolve by confining pressure. The resulting phase-field formulation is demonstrably consistent with the theory of Palmer and Rice. Numerical examples showcase that the proposed phase-field model is a physically sound and numerically efficient method for simulating shear fracture processes in geologic materials, such as faulting and slip surface growth.},

We are interested in the issue whether quantitative error bounds can be a priori guaranteed in applications (including mathematical finance, scientific computing , and machine learning). Our main contribution is a numerical study of the error discrepancy function based on a comparison between several numerical strategies, when one varies the choice of the kernel, the number of approximation points, and the dimension of the problem. We consider two strategies in order to localize to a bounded set the standard kernels defined in the whole Euclidian space (exponential, multiquadric, Gaussian , truncated), namely, on one hand the class of periodic kernels defined via a discrete Fourier transform on a lattice and, on the other hand, a class of transport-based kernels . Relying on the Poisson formula on a lattice together with heuristic arguments , we study the derivation of theoretical bounds for the discrepancy function of periodic kernels. Then, for four kernels of particular interest we perform extensive numerical experiments and generate the optimal distributions of points and the discrepancy error functions. Our numerical results validate our theoretical observations and, importantly, provide us with quantitative estimates for the error made with a kernel-based strategy as opposed to a purely random strategy.},

  abstract     = {Different from large deflection analyses of plates and shells, for analysis of an isotropic membrane structure a form finding procedure is first performed to find the new geometry of membrane. With this new geometry, large deflection analysis is conducted and the membrane works in a pure membrane state. In the conventionally numerical approaches for analysis of membranes, form finding and large deflection analysis are performed separately and quite complexly by different techniques. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a unified adaptive approach (UAA) for analysis of membranes in the framework of isogeometric analysis (IGA). In UAA, both form finding and large deflection analysis are simultaneously and simply performed based on a modified Riks (M-R) nonlinear solver. As another advantage of UAA, it can be applied to various types of structures without any limitation or modification. For membranes, the proposed approach performs both form finding and large deflection analysis naturally. It is convenient that UAA automatically performs large deflection analysis without form finding when plates or shells are considered. Based on the adaptation of UAA, nonlinear responses of plates/shells and membranes are first obtained at the same time in this paper. Especially, a new type of equilibrium path of membranes is first proposed via UAA. The path includes two parts: one is obtained by form finding and another is from large deflection analysis. High accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach and the present formulation are verified via some benchmark problems. Effects of slenderness ratio , curvature and boundary condition on form finding and nonlinear responses of membranes are rigorously investigated. Some new equilibrium paths of square and cylindrical membranes are first provided.},

The discretization of the trial force fields is carried out on a uniform grid, which allows for the use of fast Fourier transforms to evaluate the convolution product arising from the Green function. A discretization of the Green function consistent with the variational framework is introduced to ensure the upper bound status of the homogenized permeability. The energy consistent discretization is compared to six alternative discretizations arising from truncation of Fourier series or from various finite difference schemes, in terms of accuracy of the homogenized permeability and of the local velocity fields as well as on the number of iterations required for convergence of the iterative solver.

In the proposed model, the finite element method (FEM) is used to calculate the vibration response of the shell structures and the singular boundary method (SBM) with near-field and far-field Green’s functions is used to simulate the underwater acoustic radiation excited by shell structural vibration in shallow water marine environment, namely, the hybrid FEM–SBM solver. For axisymmetric shell structures, the axisymmetric numerical formulation of the FEM–SBM solver is derived to save the computational cost. For general shell structures, the fast direct solver based on the recursive skeletonization factorization is introduced into the FEM–SBM solver to accelerate the computation of the underwater acoustic field. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FEM–SBM solver provides more efficient and reliable solutions in comparison with the coupled FEM/FEM solver (COMSOL software). The effect of the sound velocity profiles on the underwater acoustic radiation field in shallow water marine environment is numerically investigated.},

First, a mathematical model of the optimization problem is established with the structural compliance minimization as the objective function and the structural volume fraction as the design constraint. By converting the line integrals into volume integrals, the design-dependent loads imposed on the structure outline described by the zero-level set are converted, and a relatively easy boundary detection method is used. Subsequently, an updating strategy of the Lagrange multiplier is proposed to make the transition of the objective function smooth during the convergence process . Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed optimization method in solving design-dependent load problems can be shown through several classic numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {An artificial Neural Network (NNW) is designed to serve as a surrogate model of micro-scale simulations in the context of multi-scale analyses in solid mechanics. The design and training methodologies of the NNW are developed in order to allow accounting for history-dependent material behaviors. On the one hand, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is constructed, which allows mimicking the internal variables required to account for history-dependent behaviors since the RNN is self-equipped with hidden variables that have the ability of tracking loading history. On the other hand, in order to achieve accuracy under multi-dimensional non-proportional loading conditions, training of the RNN is achieved using sequential data. In particular the sequential training data are collected from finite element simulations on an elasto-plastic composite RVE subjected to random loading paths. The random loading paths are generated in a way similar to a random walking in stochastic process and allow generating data for a wide range of strain-stress states and state evolution. The accuracy and efficiency of the RNN-based surrogate model is tested on the structural analysis of an open-hole sample subjected to several loading/unloading cycles. It is shown that a similar accuracy as with a FE 2 FE2 multi-scale simulation can be reached with the RNN-based surrogate model as long as the local strain state remains in the training range, while the computational time is reduced by four orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {The semiclassical Schrödinger equation with time-dependent potentials is an important model to study electron dynamics under external controls in the mean-field picture. In this paper, we propose two multiscale finite element methods to solve this problem. In the offline stage, for the first approach, the localized multiscale basis functions are constructed using sparse compression of the Hamiltonian operator at the initial time ; for the latter, basis functions are further enriched using a greedy algorithm for the sparse compression of the Hamiltonian operator at later times. In the online stage, the Schrödinger equation is approximated by these localized multiscale basis functions in space and is solved by the Crank–Nicolson method in time. These multiscale basis functions have compact supports in space, leading to the sparsity of the stiffness matrix , and thus the computational complexity of these two methods is comparable to that of the standard finite element method. The spatial mesh size in the multiscale finite element methods is O ( ε ) O(ε) , while the mesh size in the standard finite element method is o ( ε ) o(ε) , where ε ε is the semiclassical parameter. Through a number of numerical examples in 1D and 2D, for approximately the same number of basis, we show that the approximation error of the multiscale finite element method is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the standard finite element method, and the enrichment further reduces the error by another one order of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {The boundary representation or B-rep is the prevalent geometry description in computer aided design (CAD). It combines aspects from explicit and implicit geometry and is incompatible with many downstream applications such as finite element analysis (FEA) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM). We develop a semi-automatic frame-field guided parameterization approach that converts trimmed B-rep geometry to conforming, watertight analysis-suitable NURBS. The resulting geometry description is simultaneously suitable for design as well as analysis and therefore avoids the need for further meshing and geometry-processing. While existing frame-field based global parameterization methods offer the high quality necessary in our application, they suffer from several robustness issues. Current challenges mainly stem from the lack of integrability of the frame-field which causes the computed parameterization to fold-over, particularly near parameterization singularities . We propose specialized constraints that incorporate properties of an analytical solution that resolve the poor behavior near singularities. Furthermore, we present a convenient and efficient solution framework that directly incorporates such constraints into a reduced basis. Improved behavior around parameterization singularities simplifies the extraction of a quadrilateral layout. This layout is subsequently fitted with C 0 C0 NURBS to yield a conforming watertight model that is analysis suitable. The latter is illustrated by performing isogeometric shell modal analysis on several geometric models .},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces an innovative physics-informed deep learning framework for metamodeling of nonlinear structural systems with scarce data. The basic concept is to incorporate available, yet incomplete, physics knowledge (e.g., laws of physics, scientific principles) into deep long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which constrains and boosts the learning within a feasible solution space. The physics constraints are embedded in the loss function to enforce the model training which can accurately capture latent system nonlinearity even with very limited available training datasets. Specifically for dynamic structures, physical laws of equation of motion, state dependency and hysteretic constitutive relationship are considered to construct the physics loss. In particular, two physics-informed multi-LSTM network architectures are proposed for structural metamodeling. The satisfactory performance of the proposed framework is successfully demonstrated through two illustrative examples (e.g., nonlinear structures subjected to ground motion excitation). It turns out that the embedded physics can alleviate overfitting issues, reduce the need of big training datasets, and improve the robustness of the trained model for more reliable prediction with extrapolation ability. As a result, the physics-informed deep learning paradigm outperforms classical non-physics-guided data-driven neural networks.},

Two effective stress measures emerge from the formulation, namely, σ ′ σ′ , which is energy-conjugate to the elastic strain , and σ ′ ′ σ′′ , which is energy-conjugate to the plastic strain. For the special case of transverse isotropy that is commonly encountered in natural rocks, the Biot tensor can be expressed in terms of its normal and tangential components to the bedding plane , along with a microstructure tensor. Apart from its thermodynamic consistency, an advantage of this new formulation is that standard mixed finite element formulation can be employed to discretize the domain and solve initial boundary-value problems. We conduct plane strain simulations of coupled solid deformation–fluid flow in a transversely isotropic porous medium to demonstrate the impacts of material anisotropy , stress history, and the Biot tensor on the system response .},

This approach allows to solve large-scale problems in parallel with only a fraction of the memory requirements compared to the standard approach which is to use a direct solver for the complete problem. While domain decomposition techniques have been used extensively for Helmholtz problems, this is the first application to aero-acoustics. The optimized Schwarz formulation is extended to the linearized potential theory for sound waves propagating in a potential base flow. A high-order finite element method is used to solve the governing equations in each sub-domain, and well-designed interface conditions based on local approximations of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map are used to accelerate the convergence of the iterative procedure.

Functionally graded composites are inhomogeneous materials with continuously varying spatial composition. The spatial variation in material properties might enable better performance than an isotropic multi-material structure or fiber-reinforced composite structure with fixed fiber volume fraction. In order to enable the simultaneous design of composite topology, spatially varying fiber material layout and orientation, a homogenization design method (HDM) is applied together with a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method taking into account the advantage of each method. The SIMP method is efficient in determining discrete material states while avoiding intermediate states. Thus, it is applied to determine whether a material is void or a composite state. The HDM allows intermediate material states because it considers true anisotropic composite materials. Taking this advantage, the HDM method is applied to optimize spatially varying anisotropic fiber material layout and orientation. The optimization result of the fiber material is visualized using the projection method proposed for periodic composite structures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical examples for compliance minimization problems are provided.},

In inverse problems, the boundary conditions are determined using sparse measurement of a variable such as velocity or temperature. Although this is mathematically tractable for simple problems, it can be extremely challenging for complex problems. To overcome the non-linear and complex effects, a brute force approach was used on a trial and error basis to find an approximate solution. With the advent of machine learning algorithms it may now be possible to model inverse problems faster and more accurately. In order to demonstrate that machine learning can be used in solving inverse problems, we propose a fusion between computational mechanics and machine learning. The forward problems are solved first to create a database. This database is then used to train the machine learning algorithms. The trained algorithm is then used to determine the boundary conditions of a problem from assumed measurements. The proposed method is tested for the linear/non-linear heat conduction, convection–conduction, and natural convection problems in which the boundary conditions are determined by providing three, four, and five temperature measurements. This study demonstrates that the proposed fusion of computational mechanics and machine learning is an effective way of tackling complex inverse problems.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by venation patterns of leaves, the new polyline-based core sandwich structures (PCSSs) are developed in this paper. A novel approach is proposed under explicit topology optimization framework based on surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm . Specifically, a multi-component topology description function is defined to characterize the shapes of polyline-based cores, and therefore the dimension of design variables in topology optimization of PCSSs is reduced to only tens of dimensions. To solve the optimization problem , a feedback mechanism-driven surrogate-assisted differential evolution algorithm is proposed, where two search phases, i.e., global and local search phases, are respectively implemented in sequence to achieve a good balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Specifically, the global search phase is utilized to not only explore unknown areas for locating the promising regions effectively, but also improve the accuracies of surrogates in specific promising areas. The local search phase is used to intensively search the local promising regions for accelerating the convergence rate. A feedback mechanism is proposed to drive the adaptive search in the global search phase based on three different kinds of feedback information. Based on the superiorities of constraint satisfactions of PCSSs, a volume domination-based ε ε -constraint handling method is employed to handle volume and other constraints differently in an appropriate way. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Particle finite element method (PFEM) is a computational tool suitable for simulating fluid dynamics problems characterized by presence of moving boundaries. In this paper a new version of the method for incompressible flow problems is proposed aiming at accuracy improvement. This goal is achieved essentially by applying Strang operator splitting to Navier–Stokes equations and selecting adequate integration schemes for the resulting advective and Stokes sub-problems. For achieving efficient implementation , the pressure and the velocity in the Stokes part are decoupled via the fractional step technique as in the classical PFEM. However, at the first fractional step an explicit pressure prediction procedure for alleviating mass losses is introduced. Three test cases are solved, validating the methodology and estimating its accuracy. The numerical evidence proves that the proposed scheme improves the accuracy of the PFEM.},

  abstract     = {Phase-field models for fracture have gained exceptional popularity in the last couple of decades and have been extended into areas well beyond brittle quasi-static fracture propagation to ductile, dynamic, or hydraulic fracturing . Despite the significant theoretical advancements in these more complex physical settings, little attention has been paid to the quantification of crack opening displacement to date as most applications do not explicitly require the crack opening displacement for the morphological evolution of cracks. However, one of the exemptions would be hydraulic fracturing where the crack propagation is driven by the fluid pressure which strongly depends on the crack opening displacement. In this study, we look into two known approaches, a line integral and a level-set method, for crack opening computation mainly from an implementation point of view. Firstly, we derive an approximation of a discontinuous function field in the variational phase-field setting which is then applied to obtain the crack opening (displacement jump) and verify the approximation against a closed solution. We then propose a “certain distance from the crack” required for the level-set function using a one-dimensional analysis. Finally, we compare these approaches under several different conditions such as crack alignment to the mesh or under loading (asymmetric displacement field) and investigate the convergence with respect to the mesh size .},

To overcome the complexity of the conventional geometric design-based method, this paper proposes a more efficient sample-driven procedure to construct the explicit mathematical expression of parallelepiped model. Instead of the geometric characteristics of minimum-volume parallelepiped, the statistical characteristics of available samples are employed to directly evaluate the marginal intervals and correlation coefficients of uncertain variables. Especially for the inconstant uncertainty problem with dispersed samples, a sub-parallelepiped modeling method is further presented by means of the sample clustering analysis, which can effectively decrease the invalid domains in uncertainty quantification. Besides, in order to improve the computing efficiency of uncertainty propagation analysis under the parallelepiped model, the radial basis function-based surrogate model is introduced as an approximation of the original time-consuming computational model.

  abstract     = {In this paper, the first self-adaptive deep learning algorithm is proposed in details to accelerate flash calculations, which can quantitatively predict the total number of phases in the mixture and related thermodynamic properties at equilibrium for realistic reservoir fluids with a large number of components under various environmental conditions. A thermodynamically consistent scheme for phase equilibrium calculation is adopted and implemented at specified moles, volume and temperature, and the flash results are used as the ground truth for training and testing the deep neural network . The critical properties of each component are considered as the input features of the neural network and the final output is the total number of phases at equilibrium and the molar compositions in each phase. Two network structures are well designed, one of which transforms the input of various numbers of components in the training and the objective fluid mixture into a unified space before entering the productive neural network . “Ghost components” are defined and introduced to process the data padding work in order to modify the dimension of input flash calculation data to meet the training and testing requirements of the target fluid mixture. Hyperparameters on both two neural networks are carefully tuned in order to ensure the physical correlations underneath the input parameters are preserved properly through the learning process. This combined structure can make our deep learning algorithm to be self-adaptive to the change of input components and dimensions. Furthermore, two Softmax functions are used in the last layer to enforce the constraint that the summation of mole fractions in each phase is equal to 1. An example is presented that the flash calculation results of a 8-component Eagle Ford oil is used as input to estimate the phase equilibrium state of a 14-component Eagle Ford oil. The results are satisfactory with very small estimation errors . The capability of the proposed deep learning algorithm is also verified that simultaneously completes phase stability test and phase splitting calculation. Remarks are concluded at the end to provide some guidance for further research in this direction, especially the potential application of newly developed neural network models .},

In this work, a physically anisotropic phase-field model is developed at finite strain in the framework of the second order phase-field theory. By using only one phase-field variable to evaluate the fracture status of the homogenized matrix and fiber materials simultaneously, an equivalent crack surface energy density function is established. Furthermore, the constitutive relations of the coupled problem are consistently derived by a straightforward variational principle, and are subsequently implemented into the context of the Finite Element Method.

  abstract     = {This paper considers topology optimization approaches where the geometry is described by a level set method and the system’s response is discretized on nonconforming meshes while providing a crisp definition of interface and external boundaries. Since the interface is explicitly tracked, the elements intersected by the interface are divided into sub-elements to which a phase needs to be assigned. Due to loss of information in the discretization of the level set field, certain geometrical configurations allow for ambiguous phase assignment of sub-elements, and thus ambiguous definition of the interface. The study presented here focuses on investigating these topological ambiguities in embedded geometries constructed from discretized level set fields on hexahedral meshes. Three-dimensional problems where several intersection configurations can significantly affect the problem’s topology are considered. This is in contrast to two-dimensional problems where ambiguous topological features exist only in one intersection configuration, and identifying and resolving them is straightforward. A set of rules that resolve these ambiguities for two-phase problems is proposed, and algorithms for their implementations are provided. The influence of these rules on the evolution of the geometry in the optimization process is investigated with linear elastic topology optimization problems . These problems are solved by an explicit level set topology optimization framework that uses the extended finite element method to predict physical responses. This study shows that the choice of a rule to resolve topological features can result in drastically different final geometries. However, for the problems studied in this paper, the performances of the optimized design do not differ.},

  abstract     = {Space fractional diffusion models generally lead to dense discrete matrix operators , which lead to substantial computational challenges when the system size becomes large. For a state of size N N , full representation of a fractional diffusion matrix would require O ( N 2 ) O(N2) memory storage requirement, with a similar estimate for matrix–vector products. In this work, we present H 2 H2 matrix representation and algorithms that are amenable to efficient implementation on GPUs , and that can reduce the cost of storing these operators to O ( N ) O(N) asymptotically. Matrix–vector multiplications can be performed in asymptotically linear time as well. Performance of the algorithms is assessed in light of 2D simulations of space fractional diffusion equation with constant diffusivity . Attention is focused on smooth particle approximation of the governing equations, which lead to discrete operators involving explicit radial kernels. The algorithms are first tested using the fundamental solution of the unforced space fractional diffusion equation in an unbounded domain , and then for the steady, forced, fractional diffusion equation in a bounded domain . Both matrix-inverse and pseudo-transient solution approaches are considered in the latter case. Our experiments show that the construction of the fractional diffusion matrix , the matrix–vector multiplication, and the generation of an approximate inverse pre-conditioner all perform very well on a single GPU on 2D problems with N N in the range 1 0 5 105 – 1 0 6 106 . In addition, the tests also showed that, for the entire range of parameters and fractional orders considered, results obtained using the H 2 H2 approximations were in close agreement with results obtained using dense operators, and exhibited the same spatial order of convergence. Overall, the present experiences showed that the H 2 H2 matrix framework promises to provide practical means to handle large-scale space fractional diffusion models in several space dimensions , at a computational cost that is asymptotically similar to the cost of handling classical diffusion equations .},

  abstract     = {In a previous work, embedded ensemble propagation was proposed to improve the efficiency of sampling-based uncertainty quantification methods of computational models on emerging computational architectures. It consists of simultaneously evaluating the model for a subset of samples together, instead of evaluating them individually. A first approach introduced to solve parametric linear systems with ensemble propagation is ensemble reduction . In Krylov methods for example, this reduction consists in coupling the samples together using an inner product that sums the sample contributions. Ensemble reduction has the advantages of being able to use optimized implementations of BLAS functions and having a stopping criterion which involves only one scalar. However, the reduction potentially decreases the rate of convergence due to the gathering of the spectra of the samples. In this paper, we investigate a second approach: ensemble propagation without ensemble reduction in the case of GMRES. This second approach solves each sample simultaneously but independently to improve the convergence compared to ensemble reduction. This raises two new issues which are solved in this paper: the fact that optimized implementations of BLAS functions cannot be used anymore and that ensemble divergence, whereby individual samples within an ensemble must follow different code execution paths, can occur. We tackle those issues by implementing a high-performing ensemble GEMV and by using masks. The proposed ensemble GEMV leads to a similar cost per GMRES iteration for both approaches, i.e. with and without reduction. For illustration, we study the performances of the new linear solver in the context of a mesh tying problem. This example demonstrates improved ensemble propagation speed-up without reduction.},

This model is solved via a fast Fourier transfer solver with an operator-split algorithm to update displacement, temperature and phase field, and chemical concentration incrementally. In nuclear waste disposal in salt formation, brine inside the crystal salt may migrate along the grain boundary and cracks due to the gradient of interfacial energy and pressure. This migration has a significant implication on the permeability evolution, creep deformation, and crack healing within rock salt but is difficult to incorporate implicitly via effective medium theories compared with computational homogenization. As such, we introduce a thermodynamic framework and a corresponding computational implementation that explicitly captures the brine diffusion along the grain boundary and crack at the grain scale. Meanwhile, the anisotropic fracture and healing are captured via a high-order phase field that represents the regularized crack region in which a newly derived non-monotonic driving force is used to capture the fracture and healing due to the solution–precipitation. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capacity of the thermodynamic framework to capture the multiphysics material behaviors of rock salt.},

  abstract     = {While crack nucleation and propagation in the brittle or quasi-brittle regime can be predicted via variational or material-force-based phase field fracture models, these models often assume that the underlying elastic response of the material is not size-dependent. Yet, a length scale parameter must be introduced to these models to enable sharp cracks properly represented by a regularized implicit function. However, many materials with internal microstructures that contain surface tension, micro-cracks, micro-fracture, inclusion, cavity or those of particulate nature often exhibit size-dependent behaviors in both the path-independent and path-dependent regimes. This paper is intended to introduce a unified treatment that captures the size effect of the materials in both elastic and damaged states. By introducing a cohesive micropolar phase field fracture theory, along with the computational model and validation exercises, we explore the interacting size-dependent elastic deformation and fracture mechanisms exhibits in materials of complex microstructures. To achieve this goal, we introduce the distinctive degradation functions of the force-stress–strain and couple-stress-micro-rotation energy-conjugated pairs for a given regularization profile such that the macroscopic size-dependent responses of the micropolar continua are insensitive to the length scale parameter of the regularized interface. Then, we apply the variational principle to derive governing equations from the micropolar stored energy and dissipative functionals. Numerical examples are introduced to demonstrate the proper way to identify material parameters and the capacity of the new formulation to simulate complex crack patterns in the quasi-static regime.},

  abstract     = {Ideas from the mathematical theory of optimal transport have recently been transferred to the micromechanics of polycrystalline materials, leading to fast methods for generating polycrystalline microstructures with grains of prescribed volume fraction in terms of centroidal Laguerre tessellations. In this work, we improve the state of the art solvers. For a given set of seeds and corresponding volume fractions summing to unity, there is a set of Laguerre weights such that the corresponding Laguerre tessellation realizes the prescribed volume fractions exactly. Furthermore, the Laguerre weights are unique up to a constant and can be determined by solving a convex optimization problem. However, whenever the optimization algorithm encounters a weight vector leading to an empty cell, the optimization problem is no longer locally strictly convex. To account for the latter, backtracking strategies are typically employed. We show that modern gradient-based optimization algorithms devoid of backtracking, like the Malitsky–Mishchenko method and the Barzilai–Borwein scheme easily overcome the described difficulty, leading to a significant speed-up compared to more traditional solvers. Furthermore, for computing centroidal Laguerre tessellations of prescribed volume fraction, we propose an Anderson-accelerated version of Lloyd’s algorithm, and show, by numerical experiments, that it consistently reduces the run-time. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methods for generating microstructures of polycrystalline materials with prescribed grain size distribution.},

  abstract     = {Modal metamodels can be effectively used as surrogates for expensive simulations in structural dynamics analysis with parametric variations. However, in the case of a system with clustered eigenvalues, e.g., a structure exhibiting symmetry or periodicity, mode interactions due to parametric variations are challenging to handle. Clustered eigenvalues are potentially associated with high sensitivity in eigenvectors . That is, a small perturbation to clustered eigenvalues may lead to significant changes in the corresponding eigenvectors . Neglecting the effect of mode interactions may produce large errors for modal metamodels in this case. To meet this challenge, we develop a novel automated mode tracking method (AMTM) for structures with clustered eigenvalues. Specifically, the changes in corresponding eigenvectors due to parametric variations are characterized by a transformation matrix representing a rotation in the subspace spanned by the reference eigenvectors. Modal metamodels are subsequently trained to predict both eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the presence of mode interactions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a four-edge clamped symmetric plate structure. In addition, an application of the proposed approach to uncertainty propagation (UP) of modal properties is presented using an example with a multi-dimensional parametric space .},

The design of the discrete Lagrange multiplier space is detailed for bilinear quadrangular elements with the potential presence of multiple interfaces/discontinuities within an element. We give numerical evidence that the designed Lagrange multiplier space is stable and provide examples demonstrating the robustness of the method. Relying on the stable discretization , a cohesive zone formulation equipped with a damage constitutive formulation expressed in terms of the traction is used to model propagation of multiple cracks at the interfaces between grains. The damage formulation makes use of an explicit solution procedure, couples the normal and tangential failure modes, accounts for different tension and compression behaviours and takes into account a compression-dependent fracture energy in mixed mode. The framework is applied to complex 2D problems inspired by indirect tension tests of heterogeneous rock-like materials.},

One important aspect is to include the design rules associated with the process restrictions of AM to prevent the requirement of relatively large support volumes during printing. This paper presents a TO filter that enforces a minimum overhang angle, resulting in an optimized topology that is printable without the need for support structures. The filter is based on front propagation, which, as it is described by a PDE , allows for a straightforward application on unstructured meshes , to enforce an arbitrary overhang angle. Efficient algorithms developed for front propagation are used in combination with adjoint sensitivities, in order to have a minor influence on the total computational cost. The focus of this work is on the implementation of the filter for high resolution 3D cases, which requires development of the front propagation for tetrahedral elements , and its parallelization .},

  abstract     = {Finite element simulations of frictional multi-body contact problems via conformal meshes can be challenging and computationally demanding. To render geometrical features, unstructured meshes are often generated via a trial-and-error procedure. This treatment also unavoidably increases the degrees of freedom and makes the construction of slave/master pairs cumbersome. In this work, we introduce an implicit material point method designed to bypass meshing of bodies by employing level set functions to represent boundaries at structured grids. This implicit function representation provides an elegant mean to link an unbiased intermediate reference surface with the true boundaries by closest point projection as shown in Leichner et al. (2019). We then enforce the contact constraints by a penalty method where the Coulomb friction law is implemented such that a return mapping algorithm can be used to provide constitutive updates for both the stick and slip states. To evolve the geometry of the contacts properly, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is solved incrementally such that the level set and material points are both updated according to the deformation field . To improve the accuracy and regularity of the numerical integration of the material point method, a moving least square method is used to project numerical values of the material points back to the standard locations for Gaussian-Legendre quadrature. Several benchmarks are used to verify the proposed model. Comparisons with discrete element simulations are made to analyze the importance of stress fields on predicting the macroscopic responses of granular assemblies.},

Spatial uncertainties may influence simulation results and lead to either unsafe or uneconomic designs. By implementing stochastic random field algorithms in Finite-Element simulations, the impact of such uncertainty can be integrated in the simulation results. However, the application of such algorithms implicates new requirements in understanding the relationships between correlation length, mesh coarseness, and required number of Finite-Element simulations. The present study intends to provide a deeper understanding of such aspects. In the presented approach, stochastic random fields analysis is applied in a Finite-Element code by remote scripting. Considering a slope stability analysis and using Monte-Carlo Simulations, the impact of varying mesh coarseness and the correlation length on the obtained safety factor is investigated. As for large numbers of mesh elements, computational costs increase rapidly, the study expands its investigations by employing two further advanced methods, namely mesh adaptivity and subset simulation. These state-of-the-art methods allow to reduce calculation efforts, once by iterative remeshing, once by selective sampling according to failure probability. The results show promising improvements in the concept of computational efforts.},

Therefore, the mesh-based finite element descriptions common in structural optimisation must be first translated into CAD models. Currently, this can at best be performed semi-manually. We propose a fully automated and topologically accurate approach to synthesise a structurally-sound parametric CAD model from topology optimised finite element models. Our solution is to first convert the topology optimised structure into a spatial frame structure and then to regenerate it in a CAD system using standard constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations. The obtained parametric CAD models are compact, that is, have as few as possible geometric parameters, which makes them ideal for editing and further processing within a CAD system. The critical task of converting the topology optimised structure into an optimal spatial frame structure is accomplished in several steps. We first generate from the topology optimised voxel model a one-voxel-wide voxel chain model using a topology-preserving skeletonisation algorithm from digital topology. The weighted undirected graph defined by the voxel chain model yields a spatial frame structure after processing it with standard graph algorithms. Subsequently, we optimise the cross-sections and layout of the frame members to recover its optimality, which may have been compromised during the conversion process. At last, we generate the obtained frame structure in a CAD system by repeatedly combining primitive solids, like cylinders and spheres, using boolean operations. The resulting solid model is a boundary representation (B-Rep) consisting of trimmed non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Based on a formulation on the special Euclidean group S E ( 3 ) SE(3) , a geometrically exact thin-walled beam with an arbitrary open cross-section is proposed to deal with the finite deformation and rotation issues. The beam strains are based on a kinematic assumption where warping deformation and Wagner effects are included such that the nonlinear behavior of a thin-walled beam is predicted accurately, particular under large torsion. To reduce the nonlinearity of rigid motion, static and dynamic equations are derived in the S E ( 3 ) SE(3) framework based on the local frame approach. As the value of the iteration matrix, including the Jacobian matrix of inertial and internal forces, is invariable under arbitrary rigid motion, the number of updates required during the computation process decreases sharply, which drastically improves the computational efficiency. Furthermore, the isogeometric analysis (IGA) based on the non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) basis functions, which promotes the integration of computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE), is adopted to interpolate the displacement, rotation, and warping fields separately. The interpolated strain measures satisfy the objectivity by removing the rigid motion of the reference point. To obtain the symmetric Jacobian matrix of internal forces, the linearization operation is conducted based on the previously converged configuration. A Lie group S E ( 3 ) SE(3) extension of the generalized- α α time integration method is utilized to solve the equations of motion for thin-walled beams. Finally, the proposed formulation is successfully tested and validated in several static and dynamic numerical examples.},

Compared to the existing grid and gridfree based computational methods, the general mesh method is endowed by nature with both the geometric flexibility of points (without topology connectivity) and physical accuracy of mesh (with node connectivity): 1. the meshing is as general, automated, efficient, and flexible as gridfree points but the numerical solution becomes more stable and accurate than the gridfree method; 2. the numerical scheme is as unified, compact, accurate, and robust as the unstructured grid, whereas the meshing becomes incredibly easier than the latter. Meanwhile, the proposed method is comprehensively validated by both low-speed and transonic high-Reynolds number flows. The simulation of HIRENASD demonstrates the potential to improve the convergence by converting the low-quality mesh elements into meshfree points.},

The velocity and temperature field are modeled through a double distribution function (DDF) approach. By introducing a new temperature equilibrium DF, the present TLBM not only recovers the correct macroscopic energy equation via Chapman–Enskog expansion but also possesses a consistent definition of heat capacity ratio which is lacked in previous thermal models. To validate the proposed method, four benchmark cases are tested, including the heat conduction in dual heterogeneous media, Couette flow in partially porous channel, natural convection in a porous cavity, and natural convection in a partially solid and porous cavity. Good agreement is attained, which shows the applicability of the present model for simulating thermal flows in combined solid, fluid, and porous media conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a nonlinear multiscale approach for periodic structures in the quasi-static, small strain regime. The approach consists in combining a domain decomposition method in which interface conditions are established through a “fictitious” frame with reduced-order modeling (ROM). We propose to approximate interface displacements, subdomain displacements and Lagrange Multipliers as linear combinations of reduced sets of dominant modes, and to assign to the coefficients of such linear combinations the role of coarse-scale displacements, strains and stresses, respectively. We discuss and propose a method based on subspace rotations that ensures that these three modal approximations lead to stable formulations. The modes of such expansions are determined in an offline “training” stage by applying the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the solutions obtained from Finite Element (FE) analyses. In contrast to other multiscale approaches, such as FE-ROM homogenization schemes, which uses a single unit cell with periodic conditions, here the “training” structures are formed by several unit cells. This way, we allow the SVD to extract also dominant patterns of interaction between subdomains in terms of reactive forces and deformations. This original feature confers to the proposed approach three unique advantages over FE-ROM homogenization schemes, namely: (1) It can deal with unit cells of arbitrary size (no need for scale separation). (2) It can model , not only how forces are transmitted through the structure, but also local effects . (3) It can also handle domains which are only periodic along one or two directions (beam-like or shell structures , respectively). To deal with material nonlinearities , element-wise Gauss integration of reduced internal forces is replaced by an algorithmically improved version of the hyperreduction scheme recently proposed by the author elsewhere, called the Empirical Cubature Method (ECM). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coarse-scale Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) of a subdomain can be expressed directly in terms of the (fine-scale) stresses and strains at the ECM integration points. This feature dispenses with the need of deploying a special algorithmic infrastructure of intertwined local/global problems, as it occurs in FE-ROM schemes, since the unit cell can be treated as a special type of finite element, in which the centroids of the interfaces and the ECM points play the role of nodes and Gauss points , respectively. To illustrate all these advantages, we present 4 distinct examples: two beam-like structures of rectangular-shape and I-shaped cross-sections, a 2D hexagonal cellular material, and a cylindrical shell made of a porous composite cell. In all 4 cases the proposed method is able to produce coarse-scale models reducing the number of DOFs and integration points by over two orders of magnitude, with errors below 5 %. Interestingly, in the case of the beam-like structures, we show that the method provides 2-node beam finite elements whose kinematics are identical to that predicted by “analytical” beam theories (6 DOFs per node in the case of the rectangular beam), and totally consistent with their 3D full-order counterparts.},

Transient heat conduction problems with temperature-dependent and temperature-independent thermal conductivity are firstly solved by the RIBEM respectively, and two types of snapshots are composed of these solved transient temperature fields. Subsequently, the POD is applied in the analysis of the snapshots, and then a set of optimal orthogonal basis can be obtained. In the procedure of establishing the reduced-order model, we need to redistribute the nonlinear equations. The strategy is to separate the boundary nodes defined as Dirichlet condition, and then the orthogonal basis is used to derive a reduced-order expression for the remaining unknowns. Therefore, the degree of freedom that needs to be solved can be greatly reduced. Numerical examples show that different reduced-order models based on nonlinear basis and linear basis are all consistent with the full-order model. What is more, the computational efficiency is greatly improved due to the introduction of the reduced-order model.},

  abstract     = {In the present work the multi-phase SPH model presented in Grenier et al. (2009) is considered and extended through the inclusion of a diffusive term in the continuity equation. The latter based on the δ δ -SPH model of Antuono et al. (2012), allows to improve the evaluation of the pressure field, removing numerical noise and improving also the particles spatial distribution. The time stepping and the choice of the speeds of sound for the different phases are discussed, showing that this choice is driven not only by physical consideration but also by numerical constraints linked to the stability of the scheme. To this aim, comparisons are provided to a Riemann–SPH multi-phase model. In particular we show that the proposed δ δ -SPH multi-phase solver has a different stability region than its Riemann–SPH counterpart, allowing for bigger time steps for some density and speed of sound ratios, while in other conditions the Riemann–SPH multi-phase model is more convenient. A series of validating tests are carried out over different benchmarks widely used in the SPH literature. As a final test-case the water entry of a corrugated panel involving the entrapment of an air cavity is considered to show how the proposed multi-phase δ δ -SPH method is able to accurately treat complex water impact events.},

Geometric features of triangular patches were employed as design variables to enable the representation of shell-like members and beam or bar members with a small number of design components. The minimum thickness for mean compliance minimization problems can be controlled simply by setting the lower bound of thickness variables of the patches as the given minimum. Regarding the maximum thickness, the patches with close-to-maximum thicknesses were controlled to be connected on their sides or perfectly overlapped, for which a void mask is introduced on each patch, avoiding partial overlapping through their faces. Thus, the maximum thickness of a member was obtained as the maximum value of thickness variables of the patches consisting of the member. Therefore, the maximum thickness of members can be controlled by the upper bound of thickness variables. A constraint was imposed on the material volume of each patch to prevent partial overlapping or incomplete connection with other patches. The effectiveness of the proposed formulation was verified by showing various examples with minimum, maximum, and uniform thickness controls.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the concept of generalized NURBS (GNURBS), recently introduced by the authors, we devise a novel adaptivity technique in isogeometric analysis (IGA), referred to as adaptive w- refinement. GNURBS-based IGA is a natural extension of IGA where the weights of the basis functions in geometry and solution space are decoupled. Considering the additional unknown control weights in the solution function space as design variables, we develop an adaptive algorithm to find these unknowns by solving an unconstrained optimization problem . Due to the decoupling of the weights, the analytical sensitivities can be derived cost effectively; consequently, the optimization problem can be solved efficiently by a gradient-based algorithm. This procedure leads to the optimal rational function space associated with the problem under study, while preserving the underlying geometry as well as its parameterization. We study the performance of this algorithm on elliptic problems with both smooth and rough solutions. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement of accuracy as well as the convergence rate compared to classic NURBS-based IGA. Moreover, the proposed method enables the isogeometric method to solve problems, whose closed-form solutions lie in rational space, exactly, revealing a new crucial aspect of employing rational splines for analysis. The proposed adaptive w- refinement technique serves as a new powerful adaptive technique in IGA, and perhaps a competitive tool with hierarchical splines for alleviating the deficiencies of NURBS for analysis.},

  abstract     = {The Brinkman equations can be regarded as a combination of the Stokes and Darcy equations which model transitions between the fast flow in channels (governed by Stokes equations) and the slow flow in porous media (governed by Darcy’s law). The numerical challenge for this model is the designing of a numerical scheme which is stable for both the Stokes-dominated (high permeability) and the Darcy-dominated (low permeability) equations. In this paper, we solve the Brinkman model in n n dimensions ( n = 2 , 3 n=2,3 ) by using the mixed discontinuous Galerkin (MDG) method, which meets this challenge. This MDG method is based on the pseudostress–velocity formulation and uses a discontinuous piecewise polynomial pair P ̲ k + 1 S P̲k+1S - P k Pk ( k ≥ 0 ) (k≥0) , where the stress field is symmetric. The main unknowns are the pseudostress and the velocity, whereas the pressure is easily recovered through a simple postprocessing. A key step in the analysis is to establish the parameter-robust inf–sup stability through specific parameter-dependent norms at both continuous and discrete levels. Therefore, the stability results presented here are uniform with respect to the permeability. Thanks to the parameter-robust stability analysis, we obtain optimal error estimates for the stress in broken H ̲ ( div ) H̲(div) -norm and velocity in L 2 L2 -norm. Furthermore, the L ̲ 2 L̲2 error estimate for pseudostress is derived under certain conditions. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to support the theoretical results and to show the robustness, accuracy, and flexibility of the MDG method.},

The original nonlocal differential operators used in ULPH have only the first-order accuracy, and they may not be able to simulate some complicated and delicate three-dimensional flow problems. In order to improve the computational accuracy and stability, we adopt the nonlocal synchronized differential operator from the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), which is regarded as the higher-order nonlocal differential operator, and we apply them to build higher-order ULPH formulations. The main advantage of the higher-order nonlocal differential operator over the original one is its high accuracy in unstructured particle distribution, and it is fully controlled by the approximation polynomial basis. Numerical verifications have been carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed approach by using various polynomial bases. Several challenging and delicate three-dimensional multiphase flow benchmark problems are solved to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. The numerical results of the higher-order ULPH show good agreement with theoretical and numerical solutions in the literature, demonstrating the promising potential of higher-order nonlocal ULPH formulation in modeling and simulating multiphase flows with substantial topological variations of interfaces and high density ratios.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to provide new insights into model calibration, which plays an essential role in improving the validity of Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) in engineering design and analysis. Various existing model calibration approaches including the direct Bayesian calibration method, the well-known Kennedy and O’Hagan (KOH) framework and its variants, and the optimization-based calibration method, are first investigated. It is observed that the direct Bayesian calibration and optimization-based calibration may be misled by potentially wrong information if the computer model cannot adequately capture the underlying true physics, while the effectiveness of the KOH framework and its variants is significantly affected by the prior distributions of the unknown model parameters. Based on this observation, a sequential model calibration and validation (SeCAV) framework is proposed to improve the efficacy of both model parameter calibration and bias correction for the purpose of uncertainty quantification and reduction. In the proposed method, the model validation and Bayesian calibration are implemented in a sequential manner, where the former serves as a filter to select the best experimental data for the latter, and provides the latter with a confidence probability as a weight factor for updating the uncertain model parameters. The parameter calibration result is then integrated with model bias correction to improve the prediction accuracy of the M&amp;S. A mathematical example and an engineering example are employed to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. The results show that the SeCAV framework, in general, performs better than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {A non-overlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) is proposed for the parallel finite-element solution of large-scale time-harmonic wave problems. It is well-known that the convergence rate of this kind of method strongly depends on the transmission condition enforced on the interfaces between the subdomains . Local conditions based on high-order absorbing boundary conditions (HABCs) have proved to be well-suited, as a good compromise between basic impedance conditions, which lead to suboptimal convergence, and conditions based on the exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map related to the complementary of the subdomain — which are too expensive to compute. However, a direct application of this approach for configurations with interior cross-points (where more than two subdomains meet) and boundary cross-points (points that belong to both the exterior boundary and at least two subdomains) is suboptimal and, in some cases, can lead to incorrect results. In this work, we extend a non-overlapping DDM with HABC-based transmission conditions approach to efficiently deal with cross-points for lattice-type partitioning. We address the question of the cross-point treatment when the HABC operator is used in the transmission condition, or when it is used in the exterior boundary condition, or both. The proposed cross-point treatment relies on corner conditions developed for Padé-type HABCs. Two-dimensional numerical results with a nodal finite-element discretization are proposed to validate the approach, including convergence studies with respect to the frequency, the mesh size and the number of subdomains. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the cross-point treatment for settings with regular partitions and homogeneous media . Numerical experiments with distorted partitions and smoothly varying heterogeneous media show the robustness of this treatment.},

  abstract     = {Accurate numerical simulation of coupled fracture/fault deformation and fluid flow is crucial to the performance and safety assessment of many subsurface systems. In this work, we consider the discretization and enforcement of contact conditions at such surfaces. The bulk rock deformation is simulated using low-order continuous finite elements, while frictional contact conditions are imposed by means of a Lagrange multiplier method. We employ a cell-centered finite-volume scheme to solve the fracture fluid mass balance equation. From a modeling perspective, a convenient choice is to use a single grid for both mechanical and flow processes, with piecewise-constant interpolation of Lagrange multipliers, i.e., contact tractions and fluid pressure. Unfortunately, this combination of displacement and multiplier variables is not uniformly inf–sup stable, and therefore requires a stabilization technique. Starting from a macroelement analysis, we develop two algebraic stabilization approaches and compare them in terms of robustness and convergence rate. The proposed approaches are validated against challenging analytical two- and three-dimensional benchmarks to demonstrate accuracy and robustness. These benchmarks include both pure contact mechanics problems and well as problems with tightly-coupled fracture flow.},

MinSolid and MinVoid mean that the size of solid parts and cavities must be greater than the size of a prescribed circle or sphere. This is ensured through the robust design approach based on eroded, intermediate and dilated designs. MaxSolid seeks to restrict the formation of solid parts larger than a prescribed size, which is imposed through local volume restrictions. In the first part of this article, we show that by proportionally restricting the maximum size of the eroded, intermediate and dilated designs, it is possible to obtain optimized designs satisfying, simultaneously, MinSolid, MinVoid and MaxSolid. However, in spite of obtaining designs with crisp boundaries, some results can be difficult to manufacture due to the presence of multiple rounded cavities, which are introduced by the maximum size restriction with the sole purpose of avoiding thick solid members in the structure. To address this issue, in the second part of this article we propose a new geometric constraint that seeks to control the minimum separation distance between two solid members, also called the Minimum Gap (MinGap). Differently from MinVoid, MinGap introduces large void areas that do not necessarily have to be round. 2D and 3D test cases show that simultaneous control of MinSolid, MinVoid, MaxSolid and MinGap can be useful to improve the manufacturability of maximum size constrained designs.},

In the context of the method of lines , the space discretization uses weighted essentially non oscillatory (WENO) reconstructions with adaptive order (WENO-AO), and the time evolution uses implicit Runge–Kutta methods. Therefore the timestep may be larger than the CFL timestep. To reduce oscillation in the solution, ideas related to spatially partitioned Runge–Kutta methods are used. An adaptive Runge–Kutta method is developed that blends the L-stable, third order, implicit Radau IIA method with the composite backward Euler method using a weighting procedure inspired from spatial WENO methods. The weighting procedure requires a smoothness indicator, and several possibilities are considered, although one is perhaps seen to be preferred. The overall scheme is proven to maintain third order accuracy when the solution is smooth. When the solution has a discontinuity, the scheme is shown computationally to be third order accurate away from shocks, and to achieve the overall accuracy of the backward Euler method . Numerical examples show that the adaptive Runge–Kutta method reduces oscillations in the solution. Moreover, the resulting scheme is shown to be unconditionally L-stable for smooth solutions to the linear problem.},

  abstract     = {Silica-based glass may possess paradoxically high resistance to hypervelocity impact due to the experimentally observed phase change emanating from high pressure characteristic to hypervelocity impact combined with irreversible densification of the material, which leads to a highly efficient kinetic energy-absorption mechanism. In order to capture this extraordinary behavior of silica glass in hypervelocity impact, a coupled thermo-mechanical model is developed in the framework of thermodynamics with internal state variables. In addition to pressure induced densification (phase change), the proposed model is aimed at capturing the effects of dramatic increase in temperature, strain rate sensitivity and fragmentation/comminution of the material. The proposed model is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into thermoelastic and plastic parts. The irreversible densification of silica glass is characterized by the plastic volumetric strain which is a basic internal state variable associated with a molecular structure rearrangement due to phase change. Evolution of the plastic deformation is described by a critical state plasticity model combined with damage evolution. In the absence of damage, the elastic domain is fully informed by molecular dynamics simulations of perfectly intact silica glass. With evolving damage, the atomistically informed elastic domain shrinks smoothly to another critical state plasticity elastic domain which serves as a granular description of the fragmented/comminuted state of the material. Thermo-mechanical coupling is considered where temperature rises as a result of mechanical dissipation while mechanical behavior depends on temperature through thermal softening. In addition, the model is capable of capturing both the material’s ductile behavior (featuring significant densification due to high pressure) in the vicinity of projectile–target contact interface and its characteristically brittle behavior exhibited elsewhere. This is achieved by introducing a brittle damage initial criterion based on the thermodynamic driving force for damage that is analogous to the energy release rate-based criterion for crack growth. Constitutive functions and material parameters in the model are determined from the molecular dynamics simulations. The proposed model has been implemented in the explicit coupled thermo-mechanical finite element code and validated against hypervelocity impact experiments.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of multiscale problems remains a challenge in many problems due to the complex interaction between the resolved and unresolved scales. This work develops a coarse-grained modeling approach for Galerkin discretizations by combining the Variational Multiscale decomposition and the Mori–Zwanzig (M–Z) formalism. An appeal of the M–Z formalism is that – akin to Green’s functions for linear problems – the impact of unresolved dynamics on resolved scales can be formally represented as a convolution (or memory) integral in a non-linear setting. To ensure tractable and efficient models, Markovian closures are developed for the M–Z memory integral. The resulting sub-scale model has some similarities to adjoint stabilization and orthogonal sub-scale models. The model is made parameter-free by adaptively determining the memory length during the simulation. To illustrate the generalizability of this model, the performance is assessed in detail in coarse-grained simulations of a range of problems from the one-dimensional Burgers equation and to incompressible turbulence.},

  abstract     = {Elasto-plastic multiscale approaches are known to be suitable to model the mechanical behavior of metallic materials during forming processes. These approaches are classically adopted to explicitly link relevant microstructural effects to the macroscopic behavior. This paper presents a finite strain elasto-plastic self-consistent model for damaged polycrystalline aggregates and its implementation into ABAQUS/Standard finite element (FE) code. Material degradation is modeled by the introduction of a scalar damage variable at each crystallographic slip system for each individual grain. The single crystal plastic flow is described by both the classical and a regularized version of the Schmid criterion. To integrate the single crystal constitutive equations, two new numerical algorithms are developed (one for each plastic flow rule). Then, the proposed single crystal modeling is embedded into the self-consistent scheme to predict the mechanical behavior of elasto-plastic polycrystalline aggregates in the finite strain range. This strategy is implemented into ABAQUS/Standard FE code through a user-defined material (UMAT) subroutine. Special attention is paid to the satisfaction of the incremental objectivity and the efficiency of the convergence of the global resolution scheme, related to the computation of the consistent tangent modulus. The capability of the new constitutive modeling to capture the interaction between the damage evolution and the microstructural properties is highlighted through several simulations at both single crystal and polycrystalline scales. It appears from the numerical tests that the use of the classical Schmid criterion leads to a poor numerical convergence of the self-consistent scheme (due to the abrupt changes in the activity of the slip systems), which sometimes causes the computations to be prematurely stopped. By contrast, the use of the regularized version of the Schmid law allows a better convergence of the self-consistent approach, but induces an important increase in the computation time devoted to the integration of the single crystal constitutive equations (because of the high value of the power-law exponent used to regularize the Schmid yield function). To avoid these difficulties, a numerical strategy is built to combine the benefits of the two approaches: the classical Schmid criterion is used to integrate the single crystal constitutive equations, while its regularized version is used to compute the microscopic tangent modulus required for solving the self-consistent equations. The robustness and the accuracy of this novel numerical strategy are particularly analyzed through several numerical simulations (prediction of the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline aggregates and simulation of a circular cup-drawing forming process).},

  abstract     = {The data-driven methodology with application to continuum mechanics relies upon two main pillars: (i) experimental characterization of stress–strain pairs associated to different loading states, and (ii) numerical elaboration of the elasticity equations as an optimization (searching) algorithm using compatibility and equilibrium as constraints. The purpose of this work is to implement a multiscale data-driven approach using experimental data of cortical bone tissue at different scales. First, horse cortical bone samples are biaxially loaded and the strain fields are recorded over a region of interest using a digital image correlation technique . As a result, both microscopic strain fields and macroscopic strain states are obtained by a homogenization procedure, associated to macroscopic stress loading states which are considered uniform along the sample. This experimental outcome is here referred as a multiscale dataset. Second, the proposed multiscale data-driven methodology is implemented and analyzed in an example of application. Results are presented both in the macroscopic and microscopic scales , with the latter considered just as a post-process step in the formulation. The macroscopic results show non-smooth strain and stress patterns as a consequence of the tissue heterogeneity which suggest that a preassumed linear homogeneous orthotropic model may be inaccurate for bone tissue. Microscopic results show fluctuating strain fields – as a consequence of the interaction and evolution of the microconstituents – an order of magnitude higher than the averaged macroscopic solution, which evidences the need of a multiscale approach for the mechanical analysis of cortical bone, since the driving force of many biological bone processes is local at the microstructural level. Finally, the proposed multiscale data-driven technique may also be an adequate strategy for the solution of intractable large size multiscale FE 2 2 computational approaches since the solution at the microscale is obtained as a postprocessing. As a main conclusion, the proposed multiscale data-driven methodology is a useful alternative to overcome limitations in the continuum mechanical study of the bone tissue. This methodology may also be considered as a useful strategy for the analysis of additional biological or technological hierarchical multiscale materials.},

Since the non-matching meshes can result in arbitrarily cut cells, additional stabilization terms are needed to obtain a stable method. In this contribution we extend the multimesh finite element method to the Navier–Stokes equations based on the incremental pressure-correction scheme. For each step in the pressure-correction scheme, we derive a multimesh finite element formulation with suitable stabilization terms. The proposed scheme is implemented for arbitrary many overlapping two dimensional domains, yielding expected spatial and temporal convergence rates for the Taylor–Green problem, and demonstrates good agreement for the drag and lift coefficients for the Turek–Schäfer benchmark (DFG benchmark 2D-3). Finally, we illustrate the capabilities of the proposed scheme by optimizing the layout of obstacles in a two dimensional channel.},

  abstract     = {Today numerical simulation is indispensable in industrial design processes. It can replace cost and time intensive experiments and even reduce the need for prototypes. While products designed with the aid of numerical simulation undergo continuous improvement, this must also be true for numerical simulation techniques themselves. Up to date, no general purpose numerical method is available which can accurately resolve a variety of physics ranging from fluid to solid mechanics including large deformations and free surface flow phenomena. These complex multi-physics problems occur for example in Additive Manufacturing processes. In this sense, the recent developments in Machine Learning display promise for numerical simulation. It has recently been shown that instead of solving a system of equations as in standard numerical methods, a neural network can be trained solely based on initial and boundary conditions . Neural networks are smooth, differentiable functions that can be used as a global ansatz for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). While this idea dates back to more than 20 years (Lagaris et al., 1998), it is only recently that an approach for the solution of time dependent problems has been developed (Raissi et al., 2019). With the latter, implicit Runge–Kutta schemes with unprecedented high order have been constructed to solve scalar-valued PDEs. We build on the aforementioned work in order to develop an Updated Lagrangian method for the solution of incompressible free surface flow subject to the inviscid Euler equations . The method is straightforward to implement and does not require any specific algorithmic treatment which is usually necessary to accurately resolve the incompressibility constraint. Due to its meshfree character, we will name it the Neural Particle Method (NPM). It will be demonstrated that the NPM remains stable and accurate even if the location of discretization points is highly irregular.},

Firstly, the nonlinear coupled thermo-mechanical model is proposed, and the high-order nonlinear local problems, effective material parameters and the nonlinear homogenization equations are derived successively by the multiscale asymptotic expansion . Further, in order to reduce the large computational amount evaluated by the classical multiscale homogenization approach, the reduced-order nonlinear multiscale models and the corresponding finite-element algorithms are established in detail. The key features of the proposed approach are that an efficient reduced-model form based on transformation field analysis (TFA) to analyze nonlinear local cell problems is proposed and a nonlinear thermo-mechanical problem which considers the mutual coupling for the temperature and displacement fields is computed. In particular, a new SORH algorithm is proposed for investigating the axisymmetric inelastic structures. Finally, three typical numerical experiments are carried out, and the effectiveness and correctness of our presented algorithms in simulating and predicting the macroscopic behavior of the heterogeneous structures are confirmed.},

The spectral stochastic finite element framework is extended to perform mixed uncertainty analysis of functionally graded material whereby the spatial variation of elastic modulus of the plate is uniquely characterised as the multiple-imprecise-random-field modelling more than a purely homogeneous random field. This characterisation has originated in heeding the construction of physical models and the significant influences of separately uncertain characteristics propagated on the physical model through different material ingredients are examined to make physical models more reliable and realistic. Mechanics and mathematics intrusive-formulations are then established to explicitly produce the uncertain-but-bounded statistical characteristics of responses, namely interval mean value, interval standard deviation. Bounded surfaces of statistical moments and bounding distribution functions are vividly depicted for demonstration.

The variational approaches for fluid and solid mechanics are based on a mixed least-squares finite element method . The L 2 L2 -norm minimization of the residuals of the constructed first-order systems of the governing differential equations is based on two-field stress–velocity (SV) functionals. For the time discretization of the SV-fluid formulation, four different types of implicit integration schemes are investigated, namely the Houbolt method, the Crank–Nicolson method and two explicit, singly diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta methods (ESDIRK). The SV-formulation for the solid is discretized applying the Houbolt method. The presented time integration schemes are validated investigating an unsteady fluid flow and an elastodynamic structural benchmark. Since both (fluid and solid) SV formulations are discretized using conforming finite element spaces in H H (div) and H 1 H1 , respectively, the inherent fulfillment of coupling conditions, when modeling fluid–structure interaction problems, is given a priori. Therefore, the applicability is also examined by two simplified FSI problems for small deformations , in order to represent the main characteristics of the presented approach.},

The model is derived from an energy minimization standpoint, and the governing equations are presented in a general Allen–Cahn form, unifying both brittle and cohesive fracture models. A novel elastic energy split is proposed to enforce frictionless contact conditions along the regularized crack set. A fixed-point iterative algorithm is used to solve the system of equations, and an active-set strategy is incorporated to enforce the crack set irreversibility . The model is then applied to study the mechanical-fracture coupling in the fracture of thin films and soil desiccation problems in which intricate crack networks form. We present results for one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and fully three-dimensional configurations, and examine the relationship between the generalized driving energies for fracture and the resulting fracture patterns. We also investigate the impact of stochastic spatial variations in material parameters on fragment statistics and fracture network morphology. To this end, we develop a random field model for fracture properties and address a forward propagation problem. The versatility offered by the probabilistic framework is finally highlighted by considering a statistical inverse problem based on physical experiments. It is shown, in particular, that the formulation allows key characteristics of observed crack patterns to be reproduced with reasonable accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Stochastically reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) structure of porous media from a given two-dimensional (2D) image is an outstanding problem. For such problem, despite that the big progress has been made on reconstruction methods such as optimization-based and multi-point statistics-based algorithms, however, the reconstruction of topologically complex or non-stationary materials is still not well addressed. Besides, the reconstruction efficiency is another remarkable challenge, and a 12 8 3 1283 reconstruction using these methods generally requires several hours. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we propose a general end-to-end deep learning-based 3D reconstruction framework. Specially, the mapping (function) between a 2D slice and its 3D structure is first learned by a neural network . Then, the 3D reconstruction of a new 2D image using this mapping is instantaneous. For a 12 8 3 1283 reconstruction, our method only requires 0 . 2 s 0.2s , thus achieving a 3 . 6 × 1 0 4 3.6×104 speedup factor compared with the classical methods. Besides, to yield diverse 3D structures for the same 2D input, a Gaussian noise is introduced into the network. Our approach is tested on two statistically isotropic materials and a non-stationary porous material, and evaluated in terms of both visual and quantitative comparisons . Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is accurate, fast, and stable. The proposed framework also enables that theoretically an arbitrary number of constraints can be incorporated to further improve the reconstruction accuracy .},

This method first divides the reference design domain into cells, and then in each cell it uses multiple basic level set functions combined with their cutting functions to describe the microstructure. The basic level set functions are used to describe microstructure prototypes that are kept fixed during the course of optimization. Each basic level set function is cut by its own cutting function to achieve shape and topology variation of microstructure. After the cutting operations, multiple virtual microstructures are obtained in each cell, and they are further combined together through a union operation to generate an actual microstructure. Based on the multiple virtual microstructures, multiple combination options are available, thus resulting in an enlarged design space and performance improvement as compared to the VCUT level set method developed in our previous study. Moreover, as a generalization of the VCUT level set method, connections between microstructures in neighboring cells are naturally guaranteed without any extra constraints.},

  abstract     = {The multiphase flow model has been extensively used to describe complicated flow behaviors in subsurface formations, together with sophisticated reservoir models and well-defined fluid property. In this study, the fully implicit method, as one of most promising schemes for subsurface flow modeling, is employed to solve multiphase flow problems. In contrast to the conventional approach where mathematical models often include a pressure equation, the multiphase flow problems are modeled by up to three continuity equations so that mass conservation holds for all present phases. Another challenge that frequently shows up is the computed solution may sit outside its physically meaningful range, thereby leading to inaccurate predictions or even a failure of the simulation process. A simple remedy is to apply a cutting-off operation to the out-of-bound solution but such an action could ruin both local and global mass conservation. Instead, we replace the original model by a variational inequality formulation with box inequality constraints to protect the boundedness requirement on pressure and saturations from being violated. The variational inequality problem is then solved by a well-designed nonlinear solver consisting of the active-set reduced-space method and the nonlinear elimination preconditioning technique. A number of examples are presented to demonstrate that the proposed formulation is bound-preserving and mass-conservative for each of the present phases/components.},

In this study, firstly, the crack initiation algorithm for both ductile and brittle material is proposed based on the damage evolution. Besides, in the simulation, we assume that the crack tip coincides with the stress point, which means that the crack tip moves from one stress point to another, and by connecting the crack tip, the crack path is generated. Then a 3D visibility criterion for arbitrary curved shell structures is established, based on which the support domain of stress points is cut by the crack path to model the crack discontinuity. Finally, the crack propagation algorithm for dynamic fracture in curved shells is established; several numerical examples are studied to verify the reliability of the proposed algorithm.},

The transmission conditions across the interface are derived in a unified framework for three types of interface problems. Usually, the well-posedness of an H 1 H1 -elliptic problem requires two transmission conditions for both the solution and the normal flux. The well-posedness for H ( curl ) H(curl) - or H ( div ) H(div) -elliptic problem requires three transmission conditions. This provides the guideline for designing stable high-order finite element methods on unfitted meshes. Optimal error estimates are proven in energy norms for interface-penalty finite element methods within a unified framework for H 1 H1 , H ( curl ) H(curl) , and H ( div ) H(div) . All error estimates are independent of the location of the interface relative to the mesh. High-order numerical quadrature rules are employed to compute surface integrals and volume integrals in sub-domains with curved boundaries which are produced by the intersection of the interface and the tetrahedral mesh. Numerical examples show optimal convergence of the proposed finite element methods for piecewise smooth solutions.},

We show that this singularity is of removable type which, once removed, makes the system well defined everywhere. No cut-off length or mollifier is used to remove this singularity. An efficient finite difference scheme is presented for the numerical solution of this singularity free system of equations. We show that the presented numerical scheme turns out to be computationally efficient compared to an alternate approach in which the uniformly distributed charge is modeled by placing equivalent lumped charge at discrete locations along the rod.

Only the functionals based on the nonlocal operators (termed as operator functional) are needed to obtain the final discrete system of equations, which significantly facilitates the implementation.

Compared to standard knot insertion , this allows to increase refinement locality. Moreover, the implementation of hierarchical refinement on existing codes can be facilitated by Bézier extraction. This approach was initially developed for unrefined patches and then extended to local refinement. In case of B-Spline patches that are not locally refined, extraction and projection algorithms can be optimized by leveraging the tensor structure . However, these optimizations are not straightforwardly applicable to hierarchical B-Splines. In this contribution, we show an approach where all extraction operations are formulated to work directly on the univariate extraction operators, without explicitly computing and storing the full tensor product. In particular, we consider the extraction of functions, and projection of degrees of freedom for refinement and coarsening. A slightly modified Bézier projection is proposed to fully exploit the developed algorithms. We finally compare our approach to an explicit computation of the extraction operator in both a linear transient and a nonlinear example.},

The method makes use of higher-order NURBS for the contact integral evaluations. The minimum orders of NURBS capable of representing the complex geometries exactly are employed for the bulk computations. The proposed methodology provides a possibility to refine the geometry through controllable order elevation for isogeometric analysis. To achieve this, a higher-order NURBS layer is used as the contact boundary layer of the bodies. The NURBS layer is constructed using different surface refinement strategies such that it is accompanied by a large number of additional degrees of freedom and matches with the bulk parameterization. The capabilities and benefits of the proposed method are demonstrated using the two-dimensional frictionless and frictional contact problems, considering both small and large deformations . The results with the existing fixed-order based NURBS discretizations are used for comparisons. Numerical examples show that with the proposed method, a much higher accuracy can be achieved even with a coarse mesh as compared to the existing NURBS discretization approach. It exhibits a major gain in the numerical efficiency without the loss of stability, robustness, and the intrinsic features of NURBS-based IGA technique for a similar accuracy level. The simplicity of the proposed method lends itself to be conveniently embedded in an existing isogeometric contact code after only a few minor modifications.},

The iterative algorithm is designed based on the variational multiscale formulation and the generalized- α α scheme. The spatiotemporal discretization leads to a block structure of the resulting consistent tangent matrix in the Newton–Raphson procedure. As a generalization of the conventional block preconditioners , a three-level nested block preconditioner is introduced to attain a better representation of the Schur complement , which plays a key role in the overall algorithm robustness and efficiency. This approach provides a flexible, algorithmic way to handle the Schur complement for problems involving multiscale and multiphysics coupling.

The robustness, efficiency, and parallel scalability of the proposed technique are then examined in several settings, including moderately high Reynolds number flows and physiological flows with strong resistance effect due to coupled downstream vasculature models. Two patient-specific hemodynamic simulations, covering systemic and pulmonary flows, are performed to further corroborate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract     = {The goals of this work are two-fold: firstly, to propose a new theoretical framework for representing random fields on a large class of multidimensional physical domain in the tensor train format; secondly, to develop a new algorithmic framework for accurately computing the modes and describing the correlation structure of the latent factors beyond second order within moderate time. Central to the algorithmic framework is the tensor train decomposition of cumulant functions. This decomposition is accurately computed with a novel rank-revealing algorithm. For computing the modes, compared with existing Galerkin-type and collocation-type methods, the proposed computational procedure totally removes the need of selecting the basis functions or collocation points and the quadrature points, which not only greatly enhances adaptivity, but also avoids solving large-scale eigenvalue problems. Moreover, by computing with higher-order cumulant functions, the new theoretical and algorithmic frameworks show great potential for representing general non-Gaussian non-homogeneous random fields. Three numerical examples, including a three-dimensional random field discretization problem, illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithmic framework.},

  abstract     = {Over the last few decades, Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) has slowly but surely inched towards widespread acceptance in computational mechanics, as well as other simulation-based fields. Projection-based Reduced Order Modeling (PROM) relies on the construction of an appropriate Reduced Basis (RB), which is typically a low-rank representation of a set of “observations” made using full-field simulations, usually obtained through truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). However, SVD encounters limitations when dealing with a large number of high-dimensional observations, requiring the development of alternatives such as the incremental SVD. The key advantages of this approach are reduced computational complexity and memory requirement compared to a regular “single pass” spectral decomposition. These are achieved by only using relevant observations to enrich the low-rank representation as and when available, to avoid having to store them. In addition, the RB may be truncated ’on-the-fly’ so as to reduce the size of the matrices involved as much as possible and, by doing so, avoid the quadratic scale-up in computational effort with the number of observations. In this paper, we present a new error estimator for the incremental SVD, which is shown to be an upper bound for the approximation error, and propose an algorithm to perform the incremental SVD truncation and observation selection ’on-the-fly’, instead of using a prohibitively large number of frequently “hard to set” parameters. The performance of the approach is discussed on the reduced-order Finite Element (FE) model simulation of impact on a Taylor beam.},

A tessellated convex domain is used as a reference for mapping of either simply or multiply connected non-convex geometries that are difficult to generate through simple cut operations using geometric primitives. Subroutines are developed in MATLAB for mapping the tessellations. The developed routines are also capable of generating geometry files that allow in further discretization or meshing of the tessellated domain.

  abstract     = {Recently, there is an increasing demand for bonding systems applied to multi-material structures. Among them, adhesives have been widely used to reduce cost and weight instead of traditional mechanical fasteners and welding. However, because the adhesive part can be easily separated under tensile stress, it is necessary to set the proper position of the adhesive in the early design process so that tensile stress does not occur in the adhesive part. This study proposes a method to prevent separation of adhesive bonds between different material phases in topology optimization. The interfacial tension energy density (ITED) is introduced into the objective function to restrict the generation of regions where the material interface with the adhesive is subject to tensile stress. Instead of using multi-design variables based on the number of material phases, the phase section method which uses a single variable is applied for the multi-material topological design. By adding the ITED to the ordinary compliance objective, the proposed method does not require the analysis of the nonlinear material behavior of the bonded areas. Through numerical examples, it is confirmed that the proposed method can offer a simple but effective multi-material design process considering the interfacial behavior.},

In this work, we study, from the numerical point of view, a strain-adaptive bone remodeling model coupled with a damage model. The variational problem is written as a coupled system consisting of a nonlinear variational equation for the displacement field and nonlinear parabolic variational inequalities for the apparent density and damage. Then, fully discrete approximations are introduced, using the finite element method and a hybrid combination of Euler schemes . A priori error estimates are proved under adequate regularity conditions , and the linear convergence of the algorithm is deduced.

  abstract     = {When milling a thin-walled workpiece, knowledge of machining error due to the workpiece deformation induced by cutting force is crucial to ensuring the quality of the final machined part. In the current research of deformation prediction, the finite element method (FEM) is the dominant tool for calculating the deformation induced by the cutting force. However, FEM needs tremendous manual effort to generate a mesh of the in-process workpiece (IPW) and cannot be directly applied to discrete structured models such as the voxel or dexel models that are widely used for its advantage on parallel computation. In addition, a very fine mesh is needed for FEM to preserve the geometry of IPW, but it will lead to a huge global stiffness matrix . Therefore, it calls for a new method of fast deformation prediction in the milling of thin-walled workpieces. In this paper, aiming at the fast prediction of the deformation error of five-axis milling directly and efficiently on the voxel model, we present a prediction algorithm based on a combination of the finite cell method (FCM) and the voxel model. Specifically, in this study, a pipeline of FCM combined with the voxel model is specially designed for the efficient analysis of IPW deformation along a continuous tool path in the five-axis milling of thin-walled workpieces. By introducing a technique of partially updating the global stiffness matrix and the cells’ stiffness matrices , the proposed algorithm can tremendously reduce the FCM calculation time per sample point on the tool path , by as much as 19 times in our test examples. Both computer simulation and physical cutting experiments performed by us have convincingly verified the accuracy of the proposed deformation prediction algorithm. To our best knowledge, this is the first work of introducing FCM on the voxel model to the prediction of deformation induced by cutting force in milling problems, which enables customized tool path design and optimization in the five-axis milling of free-form surfaces.},

In this paper, a general frame based on a new finite mixture model ( λ λ MM) constructed by derivative lambda probability density function and polynomial chaos expansion method is put forward to efficiently solve the multimodal distribution propagation problem. First, λ λ MM with high accuracy and extensive applicability is proposed to represent the arbitrary unimodal distributions and multimodal distributions. Second, a pseudo EM method proved strictly is proposed to estimate the parameters of this λ λ MM. Third, the statistical moments of the response by polynomial chaos expansion method is derived mathematically. Since the new mixture model can be decomposed into several unimodal probability distributions, the multimodal distribution propagation can be successfully converted into several unimodal distribution propagations, which further can be easily solved by polynomial chaos expansion method. Finally, the maximum entropy principle is adopted to evaluate the probability density function of the result of every unimodal distribution propagation, which is then superimposed into the final probability density function of the system response. The proposed frame only requires the first four statistical moments to evaluate the probability density function and avoid calculating the higher statistical moments, especially for the situation that the probability distribution of the system response is multimodal. Four examples are presented to verify the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed general frame for uncertainty propagation.},

In the case p = 1 p=1 , when the system of nonlinear algebraic equations is solved exactly, we derive an a posteriori error estimate on both the energy error norm and a norm approximating the time derivative error. When p ≥ 1 p≥1 , we provide a fully computable and guaranteed a posteriori estimate in the energy error norm which is valid at each step of the linearization and algebraic solvers. Our estimate, based on equilibrated flux reconstructions, also distinguishes the discretization, linearization, and algebraic error components. We build an adaptive inexact semismooth Newton algorithm based on stopping the iterations of both solvers when the estimators of the corresponding error components do not affect significantly the overall estimate. Numerical experiments are performed with the semismooth Newton-min algorithm and the semismooth Newton–Fischer–Burmeister algorithm in combination with the GMRES iterative algebraic solver to illustrate the strengths of our approach.},

  abstract     = {A hierarchical multiscale coupling of the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM) is proposed to model coupled thermo-mechanical behavior of granular materials. The DEM is employed to model the thermo-mechanical responses of a representative volume element (RVE, a granular assembly) embedded at a Gauss (quadrature) point of the FEM. The material responses derived from each Gauss point feed two superimposed FEMs to find global solutions subject to two concurrent boundary value problems (BVPs), i.e., heat conduction and mechanical deformation. The two concurrent FEMs exchange information on temperature change and fabric variation at their commonly shared Gauss points. The proposed approach is benchmarked by two examples of transient and steady-state thermal conduction where analytical solutions are available. It is further applied to investigating the thermo-mechanical responses of confined granular columns under cyclic thermal loads with emphasis placed on the effect of boundary condition and inherent anisotropy of a granular column. The proposed approach offers a novel multiscale pathway to model thermo-mechanical responses of granular media based on sound physics.},

  abstract     = {The isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) has great potential for the simulation of elasticity problems because of its exact geometric representation and good approximation properties. These advantages can be extended to thin structures, including coatings, but the development of an accurate and efficient method to deal with the large number of nearly singular integrals existing in the IGABEM presents a great challenge for very thin sections. In this paper, we propose a new sinh + + scheme for weakly, strongly and hyper near-singular integrals arising in 3D IGABEM for thermoelastic problems, based on the sinh transformation method and adaptive integral method. The presented scheme is efficient, since it combines the advantages of both methods: (1) when the thickness δ δ of coatings/thin structures is moderately small, an accurate and efficient integral result will be obtained by the adaptive integral method; (2) when δ δ is very small, the nearly singular integrals are computed by the sinh + + scheme efficiently. With the introduction of NURBS in IGABEM, truncation errors arising in the Taylor expansion cannot be ignored. Based on the values of these errors, the computed knot spans are further divided into several sub-knot spans and different methods will be used to evaluate the integral over each sub-knot span in the new scheme. In addition, based on the analytical extension of the NURBS surface , an adaptation of the sinh transformation method is proposed which can evaluate the near-singular integrals accurately for cases in which the projection point lies outside of the considered knot span. Several numerical examples are presented to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the 3D IGABEM based on the sinh + + scheme in the analysis of thermoelastic problems.},

  abstract     = {Inverse problems in computational mechanics consist of inferring physical fields that are latent in the model describing some observable fields. For instance, an inverse problem of interest is inferring the Reynolds stress field in the Navier–Stokes equations describing mean fluid velocity and pressure. The physical nature of the latent fields means they have their own set of physical constraints, including boundary conditions. The inherent ill-posedness of inverse problems, however, means that there exist many possible latent fields that do not satisfy their physical constraints while still resulting in satisfactory agreement in the observation space. These physical constraints must therefore be enforced through the problem formulation. So far there has been no general approach to enforce boundary conditions on latent fields in inverse problems in computational mechanics, with these constraints often simply ignored. In this work we demonstrate how to enforce boundary conditions in Bayesian inversion problems by choice of the statistical model for the latent fields. Specifically, this is done by modifying the covariance kernel to guarantee that all realizations satisfy known values or derivatives at the boundary. As a test case the problem of inferring the eddy viscosity in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is considered. The results show that enforcing these constraints results in similar improvements in the output fields but with latent fields that behave as expected at the boundaries.},

To efficiently control the transient motion of particles in steady state laminar fluid, it is possible to apply the fluid topology optimization method considering the particle and fluid interaction condition. Inside steady state laminar fluid, particles move due to the fluid drag forces which are the functions of the fluid velocity and the velocities of particles. Indeed, the motions of particles can be controlled and optimized by changing the movement of fluid for several engineering applications. From a topology optimization point of view, the design variables determining the Darcy’s forces in fluid are optimized in order to control the velocities of particles. The transient sensitivity analysis is newly derived considering the steady laminar fluid and Newton’s 2nd equation. Through several optimization examples, the validity and the application of the present topology optimization method are illustrated.},

For perforated shells it is thus possible that for the given dimensionless thickness, the local features dominate, and the problem of deriving effective material parameters becomes ill-posed. In the general case, one has to account for many different aspects of the problem that directly affect the effective material parameters. Through a computational study we derive a conjecture for the admissible thickness-ranges. The effective material parameters are derived with a minimisation process over a set of feasible instances. The efficacy of the conjecture and the minimisation process is demonstrated with an extensive set of numerical experiments.},

The method was implemented for 3-D and is applicable to contact constraints with normal pressures and tied constraints with surface tractions. The addition of stabilization requires some special attention to show that the inequality constraints are treatable according to the standard KKT conditions. In fact, it is shown that the proposed scheme is equivalent to a particular form of intermediate surface constraint method. The examples compare the standard single surface mortar with the dual pass approach when applicable. Several sensitivity studies of the stabilization parameter are included in the results.

  abstract     = {Evolving boundaries are an intrinsic part of many physical processes and numerical methods . Most efforts to model evolving boundaries rely on implicit schemes, such as the level-set method (LSM). LSM provides the means to efficiently model the evolution of a boundary, but lacks the ability to transmit information or provide information directly at the boundary. Explicit alternatives based on remeshing or partial-remeshing are often computationally expensive and inherently complex to implement. This work proposes a solution to this dichotomy: a novel finite element method (FEM) based formulation capable of explicitly discretising moving boundaries in an accurate and numerically-efficient way. It couples the floating node method (FNM) with LSM for the first time, which yield a methodology suitable for implementation as user-element in a generic FEM package. The explicitly discretised boundary allows for a new velocity-extension methodology, and a new LSM-reinitialisation procedure, which show benefits in accuracy and efficiency. The potential of this formulation is showcased within topology optimisation , showing greater geometrical accuracy and improvements in the optimum solution attained when compared to implicit methods.},

It has the ability to compute the static and dynamic finite deformation stress fields of arbitrary (evolving) dislocation distributions in finite bodies of arbitrary shape and elastic anisotropy under general boundary conditions. This capability is used to present a comparison of the static stress fields, at finite and small deformations, for screw and edge dislocations, revealing heretofore unexpected differences. The computational framework is verified against the sharply contrasting predictions of geometrically linear and nonlinear theories for the stress field of a spatially homogeneous dislocation distribution in the body, as well as against other exact results of the theory. Verification tests of the time-dependent numerics are also presented. Size effects in crystal and isotropic versions of the theory are shown to be a natural consequence of the model and are validated against available experimental data. With inertial effects incorporated, the development of an (asymmetric) propagating Mach cone is demonstrated in the finite deformation theory when a dislocation moves at speeds greater than the linear elastic shear wave speed of the material.},

The main advantage of considering time-dependent sub-grid scales is that stable solutions for anisotropic space–time discretizations are obtained; however other benefits related with elastic problems are found along this study. Additionally, a split term-by-term stabilization method is discussed and redesigned, where only the momentum equation is approached using a term-by-term methodology, and which turns out to be much more efficient than other residual-based formulations. The proposed methods are designed for the standard and logarithmic formulations in order to deal with high Weissenberg number problems in addition to anisotropic space–time discretizations , ensuring stability in all cases. The proposed formulations are validated in several benchmarks such as the flow over a cylinder problem and the lid-driven cavity problem, obtaining stable and accurate results.

On the one hand, the fully-loaded spent nuclear fuel canister is constituted of a repetition of identical components, resulting in a pseudo-periodicity; and the components of a given level are separated from each other and only connected to their upper level through localized attachments. This gives rise to an advantageous structural connectivity that can be exploited for efficiency. On the other hand, the necessary fine mesh resolution of the small levels leads to a high-dimensional computational model and, in addition, the independent resonant vibrations of each of the components produce a very large number of vibration eigenmodes. The aforementioned opportunities and difficulties are respectively leveraged and tackled by an adapted method that combines domain decomposition, shift–invert Lanczos eigenvalue solver, and Craig–Bampton substructuring technique. A parallel eigensolution via spectrum slicing is facilitated by an efficient block factorization by Schur complement due to the sparsity of the Craig–Bampton matrices. A computational gain of four orders of magnitude is obtained, at the expense of negligible errors that are exactly characterized. The proposed methodology enables a high-fidelity vibration analysis of the sealed fully-loaded spent nuclear fuel canister, useful for non-intrusive inverse identification of the structural integrity of the internal structural levels holding the nuclear material.},

A methodology to reconstruct the NURBS surfaces from the triangular faces of the boundary mesh is presented. The description of the boundary is used for the computation of the analytical sensitivities with respect to the control points employed in surface design. Further, the mesh is updated at each iteration of the structural optimization process by a pseudo-elastic moving mesh method. In this procedure, the existing mesh is deformed to match the updated surface and therefore reduces the need for remeshing. Numerical examples are presented to test the performance of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {This paper serves to extend the existing literature on the Stochastic Galerkin Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SGSBFEM) in two ways. The first part of this work deals with the formulation of multiple non-correlated Gaussian random fields using the conventional Karhunen–Loéve expansion technique and its forward propagation through the Spectral Stochastic Scaled Boundary Finite Element setting using the polynomial surface fit method in terms of the scaled boundary coordinates. The advantages in adopting such a forward propagation technique in capturing the statistical moments of Quantities of Interest (QoI) across the domain, are highlighted using carefully chosen linear elastic problems having large to least correlated random fields as inputs. The second contribution is the extension of the proposed forward Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to take into account multiple independent random fields, followed by Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) based sensitivity analysis. Both the computational efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed framework under different input random field correlation settings are elaborated upon by comparing their results against that obtained using the current existing SGSBFEM in the literature. Moreover, the stochastic results are validated for all the numerical examples using the Monte Carlo method.},

  abstract     = {This paper continues our efforts to exploit optimization and control ideas as a common foundation for the development of property-preserving numerical methods . Here we focus on a class of scalar advection equations whose solutions have fixed mass in a given Eulerian region and constant bounds in any Lagrangian volume. Our approach separates discretization of the equations from the preservation of their solution properties by treating the latter as optimization constraints . This relieves the discretization process from having to comply with additional restrictions and makes stability and accuracy the sole considerations in its design. A property-preserving solution is then sought as a state that minimizes the distance to an optimally accurate but not property-preserving target solution computed by the scheme, subject to constraints enforcing discrete proxies of the desired properties . We consider two such formulations in which the optimization variables are given by the nodal solution values and suitably defined nodal fluxes, respectively. A key result of the paper reveals that a standard Algebraic Flux Correction (AFC) scheme is a modified version of the second formulation obtained by shrinking its feasible set to a hypercube . We conclude with numerical studies illustrating the optimization-based formulations and comparing them with AFC.},

However, the ultra-low permeability and strong heterogeneity of low-permeable rocks hinder the accurate determination of permeability experimentally and numerically. In this study, 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to rapidly evaluate the permeability of low-permeable porous media. An improved quartet structure generation set considering pore size distribution (PSD) acquired by experiment and anisotropy (QSGS) was proposed to generate low-permeable porous media. Together with the permeability calculation using D3Q19 model of Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), the whole dataset with a size of 4,500 was prepared for CNN modelling. Moreover, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of CNN architecture and training epochs on its performance. The performance discrepancy corresponding to the magnitude of absolute permeability was also discussed. The modelling results indicate that the CNNs architecture has an important effect on its performance. The best architecture achieved an average validating loss of 1.20 × × 10 −3 while the worst architecture achieved an average validating loss of 3.60 × × 10 −3 . The CNN modelling suffered a little from over-fitting when the epoch was over 20. The optimum 3D CNN achieved remarkably high accuracy of permeability prediction with high correlation coefficient (R=0.996) and low errors (MAE=0.017, RMSE=0.03) on the testing set. Furthermore, it was found that the testing error of the lower permeability groups was relatively larger than that of larger permeability groups.},

The force density of EBPD is described using 2-node rod elements for one-dimensional (1D) problems, 3-node triangle elements for two-dimensional (2D) problems and 4-node tetrahedron elements for three-dimensional (3D) problems. The EBPD equations are derived from the principle of the minimum potential energy. The treatments of surface effects, boundary conditions, failure criterion and solving process of the EBPD are provided in detail. The examples of the 1D singular bar, 2D stationary crack near-tip solution, 2D plate crack propagation and 3D cubic demonstrate the effectivity of the proposed EBPD. The proposed EBPD model is used for elasticity, and defined new nonlocal stress and strain expressions. In addition, no restriction of Poisson’s ratio and no zero energy modes are included in EBPD. Furthermore, EBPD has the potential to study the nonuniform discretization, varying horizons, plasticity, thermodynamic and anisotropic material.

The new methodology considers the combination of simple and enhanced explicit time-marching procedures, which are both based on adaptive time integrators. By applying this combined approach, the hybrid formulation allows avoiding solver routines (explicit analysis), enables considering larger time-step values (higher stability limits are provided by the method) and permits reduced computational efforts , per time step, to be obtained. Thus, the novel technique may be considered very efficient. In addition, the proposed hybrid approach is entirely automated, providing automatic distributions of regular and enhanced subdomains along the discretized model, demanding no expertise and/or effort from the user. The time integrators of the method are adaptively evaluated, taking into account the local properties of the discretized domain and the behaviour of the computed responses, enabling a very versatile solution methodology. In this context, a link between the temporal and the spatial discretizations may be established, as well as optimized algorithmic dissipation can be introduced into the analyses, providing enhanced accuracy. Numerical results are presented at the end of the manuscript, illustrating the excellent performance of the proposed adaptive hybrid explicit method.},

  abstract     = {A new density field representation technique called the Bézier skeleton explicit density (BSED) representation scheme for topology optimization of stretchable metamaterials under finite deformation is proposed for the first time. The proposed approach overcomes a key deficiency in existing density-based optimization methods that typically yield designs that do not have smooth surfaces but have large number of small intricate features, which are difficult to manufacture even by additive manufacturing . In the proposed approach, Bézier curves are utilized to describe the skeleton of the design being optimized where the description of the entire design is realized by assigning thickness along the curves. This geometric representation technique ensures that the optimized design is smooth and concise and can easily be tuned to be manufacturable by additive manufacturing . In the optimization method, the density field is described by the Heaviside function defined on the Bézier curves. Compared to NURBS or B-spline based models, Bézier curves have fewer control parameters and hence are easier to manipulate for sensitivity derivation, especially for distance sensitivities. Due to its powerful curve fitting ability, using Bézier curve to represent density field allows exploring design space effectively and generating concise structures without any intricate small features at the borders. Furthermore, this density representation method is mesh independent and design variables are reduced significantly so that optimization problem can be solved efficiently using small-scale optimization algorithms such as sequential quadratic programming . Numerical optimization results in three typical tests, uniaxial tension, biaxial tension and shear tests are presented by imposing symmetry on a unit cell for lattice structure design. Numerical examples illustrate that the optimized metamaterials have better stretchability and higher stiffness, and hence the proposed method has great potential of impacting the design of future applications that exploit stretchability of structures.},

For a strictly accurate evaluation based on the local fracture stress criterion, we introduce the nodal force release technique to the local mesh to simulate dynamic crack propagation. Based on the numerical results, we identify the appropriate global and local mesh conditions required to achieve accurate and efficient local stress evaluations. Comparisons with the standard finite element method using equivalent accuracies show that the proposed strategy can successfully reduce numerical costs. Our results thus demonstrate that the proposed strategy for dynamic crack propagation analysis based on the s-method significantly improves the efficiency of dynamic crack propagation analysis.},

However, even considering a locally truncated support, their evaluation requires a significantly higher number of neighbors, as compared to finite elements and other meshfree methods , which poses several challenges towards a computationally efficient allocation and filling of the required sparse matrices structures . The proposed algorithm relies on a clustering strategy, and it is structured to exploit the massive parallelism of GPU architectures. Numerical examples demonstrate that this strategy enables a substantial performance boost, deriving from a synergic effect of the relatively higher computational throughput and typically larger memory bandwidth of GPUs, as compared to conventional CPUs.

An interface connects the neural network and the finite element method using a new data pre- and post-processing strategy.

  abstract     = {Dynamic fracture is a complex multiscale physical phenomenon . The process occurs in multiple time and length scales . Macroscopic behaviors such as crack instability and brittle/ductile transition are consequences and combinations of a series of microscopic events such as dynamic dislocation motions and formation of nano voids. On the other hand, the atomistic bond breaking and the motion of dislocation are strongly affected by continuum stress field as well. Thus, delineating the underlining multiscale process is demanding to understand the fundamental physics . In this work, we employed previously proposed concurrent multiscale method between multiscale micromorphic molecular dynamics (MMMD) and peridynamics to simulate dynamic fracture. To achieve widely adaptive message translation, especially for heterogeneous messages, the coupling utilizes the recently developed MMMD which has an intrinsic multiscale structure to serve as the translator for the messages from different scales. The main innovations of this work are: (1) The proposed MMMD/Peridynamics coupling is a non-local to non-local multiscale method; (2) The coarse-scale peridynamic model is built based on an atomistic-informed Cauchy–Born material model that has minimum empiricism, and (3) The multiscale method has the consistent dynamic fracture criterion at all scales. We investigate the crack nucleation, branching and propagation under different loading rates, putting the emphasis on brittle/ductile transition and crack propagation through the atomistic–continuum interface. Quantitative results of nucleation, bifurcation and the crack speed under different loading rates are presented and discussed in the paper.},

  abstract     = {A reliable prediction of structural failure is extremely important in industrial applications. The promising phase-field model has been intensively studied in fracture simulation and been validated by experiments to effectively predict crack initiation, propagation as well as branching. Experimentally motivated, a variety of phase-field models have been proposed for ductile fracture , which redefine either the fracture driving force H H consisting of both the elastic energy and the pseudo plastic energy or modify the degradation function g ( d ) g(d) of the fracture driving force H H . Different from the existing approaches, this work formulates a novel ductile phase-field model by defining the fracture toughness G c Gc depending on the accumulated plastic strain , i.e. the local fracture toughness decreases due to increased plastic deformation . The phase-field driving force H H is still defined only consisting of the elastic strain potential based on the definition of Griffith -type fracture. As a result, the locally increasing H H and the locally decreasing G c Gc govern the ductile fracture evolution simultaneously. This approach is formulated for small strain by coupling the classical Von Mises plasticity and, subsequently, is implemented into the context of the Finite Element (FE) framework. Several representative examples are evaluated to demonstrate the capabilities of the model, and corresponding findings and perspectives are consequently summarized.},

However, most traditional numerical methods do not account for the underlying geometric structure of the physical system, leading to simulation results that may suggest nonphysical behavior. The field of geometric numerical integration (GNI) is concerned with numerical methods that respect the fundamental physics of a problem by preserving the geometric properties of the governing differential equations. Research over the past two decades has produced GNI methods that are so accurate that they are now used for benchmarking purposes for long-time simulation of conservative dynamical systems. However, their utility for large-scale engineering problems is still an open question. This paper presents a review of structure-preserving numerical methods with focus on their engineering applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of different classes of GNI methods for mechanical systems while providing a survey of practical examples from numerical simulation of realistic engineering problems.},

To overcome this drawback, the method to calculate the first-order partial derivatives with a back-propagation neural network is investigated, and a numerical example is presented to demonstrate its fine precision. In the optimization process, the back-propagation neural network and its first-order derivatives are introduced into the interval perturbation method and combined with the subinterval method, the extrema of the uncertain objective function and uncertain constraints can be approximated without much computational cost. Thus the most challenging problem in current interval optimization, namely low optimization efficiency caused by nested optimization can be solved to a certain extent. A two-bar structure system is adopted to validate its fine precision and high computational efficiency in interval bounds estimation. Based on the interval order relation and interval possibility degree model, an interval uncertain optimization model can be transformed into a deterministic optimization model, and be solved by some auxiliary optimization algorithm. A numerical example and an engineering application have indicated that this method is efficient for uncertain optimization problems.},

A clear and explicit boundary-conforming mesh can be obtained by using trimmed hexahedral elements placed at the boundary of the solid domain, which leads to an accurate estimation of stresses and shape sensitivities. Since the void domain is not considered in the optimization process, the singularity phenomenon in stress-constrained optimization problems is essentially eliminated without using any relaxation technique.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses computational aspects in dynamic sub-structuring of built-up structures with uncertainty. Component mode synthesis (CMS), which is a model reduction technique, has been integrated within the framework of domain decomposition (DD), so that reduced models of individual sub-systems can be solved with smaller computational cost compared to solving the full (unreduced) system by DD. This is particularly relevant for structural dynamics applications where the overall system physics can be captured by a relatively low number of modes. The theoretical framework of the proposed methodology has been extended for application in stochastic dynamic systems. To limit the number of eigen-value analyses to be performed corresponding to the random realizations of input parameters, a locally refined high dimensional model representation model with stepwise least squares regression is presented. Effectively, a bi-level decomposition is proposed, one in the physical space and the other in the stochastic space. The geometric decomposition in the physical space by the proposed model reduction-based DD reduces the computational cost of a single analysis of the system and the functional decomposition in the stochastic space by the proposed meta-model lowers the number of simulations to be performed on the actual system. The results achieved by solving a finite-element model of an assembled beam structure and a 3D space frame illustrate good performance of the proposed methodology, highlighting its potential for complex problems.},

  abstract     = {We develop a fast solver for the spectral element method (SEM) applied to the two-sided fractional diffusion equation on uniform, geometric and graded meshes. By approximating the singular kernel with a degenerate kernel we construct a hierarchical matrix (H-matrix) to represent the stiffness matrix of the SEM and provide error estimates , which we verify numerically. We can solve efficiently the H-matrix approximation problem using a hierarchical LU (H-LU) decomposition method , which reduces the computational cost to O ( r 2 N d log 2 N ) + O ( r 3 N d log N ) O(r2Ndlog2N)+O(r3NdlogN) , where r r is the rank of the H-LU decomposition, N d Nd is the total number of degrees of freedom and N N is the number of elements. However, we lose the high accuracy of the SEM. To prevent this, we solve the corresponding preconditioned system by using the H-matrix approximation problem as a preconditioner , hence, recovering the high-order accuracy of the SEM. Numerical results show that the condition number of the preconditioned system is independent of the polynomial degree P P and grows with the number of elements, but at modest values of the rank R R (here R R is the rank of submatrices of the H-matrix approximation) it is below order 10 in our experiments, which represents a reduction of more than 11 orders of magnitude from the unpreconditioned system. This reduction is higher in the two-sided fractional derivative compared to one-sided fractional derivative. The corresponding cost is O ( r 2 N d log 2 N ) + O ( r 3 N d log N ) + O ( N d 2 ) O(r2Ndlog2N)+O(r3NdlogN)+O(Nd2) . Moreover, by using a structured mesh (uniform or geometric mesh), we can further reduce the computational cost to O ( r 2 N d log 2 N ) + O ( r 3 N d log N ) + O ( P 2 N log N ) O(r2Ndlog2N)+O(r3NdlogN)+O(P2NlogN) for the preconditioned system. Furthermore, we compare the present method with the adaptive cross approximation (ACA), which is kernel independent and relies on the coefficient matrix . The comparison shows that the accuracy using the present algorithm is better than the one using ACA for the H-matrix approximation problem, and furthermore, we have observed that the ACA method may fail to converge in some cases.},

  abstract     = {Discrete particle models have been widely used as an alternative to classical continuum mechanics to describe the mechanical behavior of solids, fluids and granular matter. Lattice particle models (LPM) are a subset of discrete particle models which treat the body as a set of interacting point masses with fixed sets of neighbors. Heretofore, the types of interaction forces considered in LPMs have been very limited; consisting mainly of linear pairwise interactions or empirically motivated generalizations thereof. Thus LPMs have been able to describe a very limited range of macroscopic constitutive behavior and the properties have generally been strongly dependent on the discretization . We present a new paradigm for incorporating multibody interactions in LPMs using a mesoscale analog of the Cauchy–Born rule which relates the deformation of the continuum to that of the underlying atomic lattice. We consider a Delaunay triangulation of an irregular lattice of particles comprising the body in its reference configuration. We calculate linear transformations to map the particle positions of each triangle in the current configuration to its reference configuration. Invoking the analogy of the Cauchy–Born rule, we identify the linear transformations with the continuum deformation gradient . Using this we express the continuum constitutive free energy of the body, which is a function of the deformation gradient, in terms of the current positions of the particles. The neighbor interaction forces on each of the particles are taken to be the gradients of this energy. The equations of motion for each particle are then solved numerically to obtain the particle trajectories and the overall deformation of the body. This model is validated using comparisons with classical results of stress distribution in isotropic and anisotropic material plates with circular holes. We then show how this model is able to describe formation of fine microstructure in two different materials: crack branching in brittle materials and twinning in phase transforming materials.},

  abstract     = {When modeling large-scale structures, knowledge of the systems and their environment is often incomplete, i.e., wind or wave loads, and possible defects in the structural components, often referred to as uncertainty parameters, can have a significant impact. However, conventional simulations are deterministic and do not take such uncertainty into consideration, making structural reliability analysis, e.g. rare event simulation, necessary. In this work, uncertainties are assumed to be in the parameters of the models, such that the numerical formulation of the models can be parametrized to account for the uncertainties. As a result, a rare event simulation becomes a quantification of the impact of the uncertain parameters on a quantity of interest of the structure, and comprises an essential part of risk assessment. However, traditional parametrized simulations, i.e., through finite element methods (FEMs), for large-scale infrastructures, possibly with a moderate to high dimensional parameter domain and a fine mesh discretization, are computationally intractable due to the multi-query sampling required by the simulation. This becomes an even harder challenge when nonlinearities are present in the structural analysis. In this work, we adopt non-intrusive reduced order modeling and machine learning techniques as an enabling technique for different fidelity rare event simulations. We consider various techniques for risk assessment for large-scale structures with local nonlinearities and moderate to high dimensional parameter spaces, and provide a comparative study through several numerical examples to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented approaches.},

We formulate a moment fitting scheme for each material subdomain using the same quadrature points , such that the resulting weights from all material subdomains can be added and the total number of point evaluations remains the same as in standard Gauss quadrature.

The coupled system of equations involves as unknowns the skeleton displacement, Darcy discharge, fluid pressure and temperature. We treat the system in its incremental (i.e. time-discrete) form. We prove existence by applying a fundamental theorem of Brézis on pseudo-monotone operators. Moreover we show that the free energy of the system acts as a Lyapunov functional. This yields global stability in the time-stepping process. Our theoretical results are substantiated with two-dimensional numerical tests using a monolithic formulation. Temporal discretization is based on the backward Euler scheme and finite elements are employed for the spatial discretization. The semi-linear discrete system is solved with Newton’s method.

  abstract     = {Image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling enables derivation of hemodynamic information (e.g., flow field, wall shear stress, and pressure distribution), which has become a paradigm in cardiovascular research and healthcare. Nonetheless, the predictive accuracy largely depends on precisely specified boundary conditions and model parameters, which, however, are usually uncertain (or unknown) in most patient-specific cases. Quantifying the uncertainties in model predictions due to input randomness can provide predictive confidence and is critical to promote the transition of CFD modeling in clinical applications. In the meantime, forward propagation of input uncertainties often involves numerous expensive CFD simulations, which is computationally prohibitive in most practical scenarios. This paper presents an efficient bi-fidelity surrogate modeling framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in cardiovascular simulations, by leveraging the accuracy of high-fidelity models and efficiency of low-fidelity models. Contrary to most data-fit surrogate models with several scalar quantities of interest, this work aims to provide high-resolution, full-field predictions (e.g., velocity and pressure fields). Moreover, a novel empirical error bound estimation approach is introduced to evaluate the performance of the surrogate a priori . The proposed framework is tested on a number of vascular flows with both standardized and patient-specific vessel geometries, and different combinations of high- and low-fidelity models are investigated. The results show that the bi-fidelity approach can achieve high predictive accuracy with a significant reduction of computational cost, exhibiting its merit and effectiveness. Particularly, the uncertainties from a high-dimensional input space can be accurately propagated to clinically relevant quantities of interest (e.g., wall shear stress) in the patient-specific case using only a limited number of high-fidelity simulations, suggesting a good potential in practical clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the reliability assessment of structures exhibiting both bounded field uncertainties and uncertain-but-bounded parameters in a non-probabilistic framework. Based on the bounded field model for spatially varying uncertainties and the multi-ellipsoid convex set description for uncertain parameters, the mathematical definition of a new reliability index is proposed to quantify the safety measures of a structure. The problem is defined as finding the maximal allowable range of uncertainties within the safety margin of the performance function in the normalized uncertain space. A gradient-based mathematical programming algorithm is used to seek the most probable failure realization of uncertainties and to obtain the non-probabilistic reliability index. The proposed index provides a general and unified formation of structural non-probabilistic reliability with uncertain-but-bounded field or parameters. Numerical examples , considering the reliability assessment of structural performance in stiffness, eigenfrequency , and buckling problems, are also given to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method.},

Firstly, a screening criterion is proposed for determining competitive sampling points based on low-fidelity surrogate model (LFSM). Then, the competitive sampling strategy is combined with the fuzzy clustering algorithm , which can adaptively obtain the reduced design space with more possibility to find the optimal result. In the reduced design space, the VFSM is constructed by means of the Gaussian process regression algorithm. Based on the VFSM, a gradient-based optimization can start from the competitive sampling point to search out the optimal solution quickly. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method, three test functions and an engineering example of hierarchical stiffened shells are carried out. Optimization results indicate that, under the similar computational cost, the proposed optimization method achieves significantly higher global optimizing ability than the high-fidelity surrogate model (HFSM) optimization method, the LFSM optimization method and the traditional VFSM optimization method by direct sampling.},

  abstract     = {A strategy for sensor number determination and placement optimization for structural health monitoring is proposed based on an interval possibility model and clustering avoidance distribution index. The performance of sensor configuration with optimum sensor number and less redundant information is primarily improved by considering two types of incomplete information simultaneously, namely uncertainty and redundancy. This study regards uncertainty as a non-probabilistic interval number to avoid the deficiency caused by the insufficient statistical distribution of uncertain structural parameters. As long as the bound of uncertainty is obtained, then a strategy for the sensor number can be determined using the interval possibility model and effective independence method. A novel redundant information elimination model is defined to reduce the redundant information caused by sensor clustering configuration, which considers the near neighbor distance, sensor configuration region and sensor number synchronously. Based on these two methods to address incomplete information in the sensor configuration field, the strategy for sensor placement optimization constitutes a novel combined fitness function, which comprises the effective independence method and clustering avoidance distribution index. Using the normalization and weighting factor, the combined fitness function is made more competitive by eliminating the order difference between the two objectives. Therefore, the best sensor number is suggested and the corresponding optimum sensor locations are achieved simultaneously using the genetic algorithm and the proposed strategy for sensor number and placement. The performance of sensor configuration and redundant information with incomplete information is balanced by the proposed strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and method is verified through three engineering numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the least-squares finite element methods (LSFEM) for the linear hyperbolic transport equations. The linear transport equation naturally allows discontinuous solutions and discontinuous inflow conditions, while the normal component of the flux across the mesh faces needs to be continuous. Traditional LSFEMs using continuous finite element approximations will introduce unnecessary extra error for discontinuous solutions and boundary conditions. In order to separate the continuity requirements, a new flux variable is introduced. With this reformulation, the continuities of the flux and the solution can be handled separately in natural H ( div ; Ω ) × L 2 ( Ω ) H(div;Ω)×L2(Ω) conforming finite element spaces. Several variants of the methods are developed to handle the inflow boundary condition strongly or weakly. With the reformulation, the new LSFEMs can handle discontinuous solutions and boundary conditions much better than the traditional LSFEMs with continuous polynomial approximations . With least-squares functionals as a posteriori error estimators, the adaptive methods can naturally identify error sources including singularity and non-matching discontinuity. For discontinuity aligned mesh, no extra error is introduced. If an R T 0 × P 0 RT0×P0 pair is used to approximate the flux and the solution, the new adaptive LSFEMs can approximate discontinuous solutions with almost no overshooting even when the mesh is not aligned with discontinuity. Existence and uniqueness of the solutions and a priori and a posteriori error estimates are established for the proposed methods. Extensive numerical tests are performed to show the effectiveness of the methods developed in the paper.},

The schemes are fourth-order accurate in space and time, and are based on solving the velocity-pressure form of the equations. Both schemes employ predictor-corrector time-stepping approaches. The first is an explicit Adams-type scheme, while the second is an IMEX-BDF-type scheme in which the viscous/advective terms in the equations are treated implicitly/explicitly. The equations and boundary conditions are discretized in space using fourth-order accurate finite-difference approximations. The formulation of discrete boundary conditions for each stage of the fractional-step scheme is found to be critical to the accuracy and stability of the approach. A WENO-based scheme, called BWENO, provides upwind dissipation and ensures robustness of the schemes for problems where the solution is under-resolved on the grid (e.g. near boundary or shear layers). Complex, and possibly moving, domains are handled efficiently using composite overlapping grids. A variety of problems in two and three dimensions, some for which exact solutions are either known or manufactured, are used to verify the stability and accuracy of the new schemes.},

For the problem which has axisymmetric characteristics, the solving of the entire three-dimensional domain can be simplified which saves computational cost dramatically. In this paper, a novel derivation for the SPH formulation in cylindrical coordinate is presented, which is straightforward and physically meaningful. A multiphase numerical model is developed based on the derived formulation including the discretization formulas of surface tension force , viscous force , interface sharpness force and the treatment of high density ratio near the multiphase interface, as well as an improved anti-penetration treatment close to the axis. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed multiphase SPH model are demonstrated via the classical surface-tension test and bubble rising problems at different conditions. The results are compared with analytical solutions, the experimental data and other numerical results. The promising results of the novel axisymmetric SPH model demonstrate a great potential for an efficient SPH modeling of complex axisymmetric multiphase flows . Dramatic efficiency boost is achieved by comparing the axisymmetric simulation with 3-D simulation in terms of CPU time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we design and analyze an explicit partitioned procedure for a 2D dynamic local-to-nonlocal (LtN) coupling problem, based on a new nonlocal Robin-type transmission condition. The nonlocal subproblem is modeled by the nonlocal heat equation with a finite horizon parameter δ δ characterizing the range of nonlocal interactions, and the local subproblem is described by the classical heat equation. We consider a heterogeneous system where the local and nonlocal subproblems present different physical properties, and employ no overlapping region between the two subdomains. We first propose a new generalization of classical local Neumann-type condition by converting the local flux to a correction term in the nonlocal model, and show that the proposed Neumann-type boundary formulation recovers the local case as O ( δ 2 ) O(δ2) in the L ∞ L∞ norm. We then extend the nonlocal Neumann-type boundary condition to a Robin-type boundary condition, and develop a local-to-nonlocal coupling formulation with Robin–Dirichlet transmission conditions. To stabilize the explicit coupling procedure and to achieve asymptotic compatibility, the choice of the coefficient in the Robin condition is obtained via amplification factor analysis for the discretized system with coarse grids. Employing a high-order meshfree discretization method in the nonlocal solver and a linear finite element method in the local solver, the selection of optimal Robin coefficients are verified with numerical experiments on heterogeneous and complicated domains. With the developed optimal coupling strategy, we numerically demonstrate the coupling framework’s asymptotic convergence to the local limit with an O ( δ ) = O ( h ) O(δ)=O(h) rate, when there is a fixed ratio between the horizon size δ δ and the spatial discretization size h h .},

But the proposed scheme, after modification, also demonstrates its values in two aspects of applications. First, it provides a fairly simple way of generating an IGM configuration continuously patching any given cell configurations. Second, it tenders a straightforward means for generating microstructures on a given manifold. We will further show that the form of topology description function given here effectively offers a platform for unifying most existing approaches for IGM generation. Fuelled by asymptotic analysis of the mechanical behaviour of the resulting IGM configurations, a topology optimisation scheme for their compliance minimisation is thus presented, whose effectiveness is further shown with numerical examples.},

The FORM based probabilistic model is a computational method and it may provide inaccuracy and unstable results for complex problems. In this paper, a probabilistic model is proposed to evaluate the MPP using cumulative distribution function (CDF) of basic random variables. The MPP is determined by solving an optimization problem in the original space which maximizes a multiplier function in terms of the CDF of the random variables. The performance of the proposed probabilistic model, usual FORM and first order saddle point approximation method (FOSAM) using SQP optimization solver is demonstrated by several numerical and engineering problems with normal and non-normal variables. The results of the numerical study illustrate that the proposed model provides an efficient approach to obtain the MPP which is simpler and more accurate than the usual FORM and FOSAM; particularly for reliability problems with non-normal random variables.},

  abstract     = {Recently developed phase field models of fracture require a diffusive crack representation based on an introduction of a crack phase field. We outline a thermodynamically consistent framework for phase field models of crack propagation in elastic solids, develop incremental variational principles . In this work, the numerical implementation of the phase field model for brittle fracture using natural neighbor Galerkin method is presented. Phase field method diffuses the sharp discontinuity by introducing a regularized crack functional. The notion of regularized crack functional provides a basis for defining suitable convex dissipation functions which govern the evolution of the crack phase field. The use of natural neighbors to dynamically decide the compact support at a nodal point makes it truly mesh free and nonlocal. The method uses smooth non-polynomial type Sibson interpolants , which are C 0 C0 at a given node and C ∞ C∞ everywhere else. This allows to capture the interface region in a phase field model more accurately with only few nodes. For a given accuracy, there is an improvement in the computational time with the use of natural neighbor interpolants. Several benchmark problems were solved to investigate the efficiency of the numerical implementation of phase field model using natural neighbor Galerkin method.},

  abstract     = {Due to its advantages of simplicity and high efficiency, Hasofer–Lind and Rackwitz–Fiessler (HL–RF) method is widely used in structural reliability analysis . However, it may encounter difficulties in convergence, such as periodic oscillation, bifurcation and chaos when complex performance functions are involved. In this study, a new efficient and robust method is proposed to deal with the convergence problem and is applied to reliability-based design optimization (RBDO). The strategy is to modify the search direction of HL–RF to make it adaptable to changes, thereby reducing the risk of periodic oscillations. A step size adjustment formula is then established to adaptively adjust the finite-step size to prevent bifurcation or chaos. In addition, the proposed method is integrated into double loop method (DLM) to strengthen the robustness and efficiency of DLM for complex RBDO problems . The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison with other existing first order reliability methods (FORMs) through five numerical examples and two structural examples. Two complex RBDO problems also show that DLM based on the proposed method has the ability to solve complex RBDO problems.},

A method integrating generalized iso-geometrical analysis (GIGA) and an improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (IMOPSO) is proposed, with numerous technical advantages. B-spline basis functions in two dimensions are used to robustly represent the volume fraction distribution, with volume fraction and shape profile at control points located along the plane set to be design variables. The mechanical behavior of the 2D-FGPs is treated with a third-order shear deformation theory and a non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS)-based GIGA scheme. The IMOPSO algorithm incorporates chaotic sequence mapping, a diversity feedback mechanism, and a hybrid mutation mechanism to mitigate premature convergence and enhance evolution of the Pareto frontier .

  abstract     = {Although isogeometric analysis possesses many advantages over classical finite element methods , the computational costs of matrix assembly (especially for high polynomial degrees) constitute a bottleneck in isogeometric numerical simulations. To address this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm for the formation of isogeometric Galerkin matrices based on the interpolation, look-up and sum factorization techniques . This method consists of three steps: First, we project the common factors occurring in the integrals into an appropriate spline space via the interpolation or quasi-interpolation operator. Subsequently, the entries of the stiffness and mass matrices are approximated by a sum of integrals of tensor-product B-splines. Second, to perform an exact integration of the integrands in the approximated matrices , a look-up table for the standardized B-spline tri-product integrals is built. Finally, the system matrices are efficiently assembled by invoking the sum factorization technique. We present a detailed analysis of the computational costs, in order to compare the new method with the existing approaches for all polynomial degrees . Several numerical tests confirm that the proposed method ensures the efficiency of matrix assembly. In addition, the extension of our approach to matrix-free applications is also discussed.},

Each quad-mesh induces a conformal structure of the surface, and a meromorphic quartic differential, where the configuration of singular vertices corresponds to the configurations of the poles and zeros (divisor) of the meromorphic differential. Due to Riemann surface theory, the configuration of singularities of a quad-mesh satisfies the Abel–Jacobi condition. Inversely, if a divisor satisfies the Abel–Jacobi condition, then there exists a meromorphic quartic differential whose divisor equals the given one. Furthermore, if the meromorphic quartic differential is with finite trajectories, then it also induces a quad-mesh, the poles and zeros of the meromorphic differential correspond to the singular vertices of the quad-mesh. Besides the theoretic proofs, the computational algorithm for verification of Abel–Jacobi condition is also explained in detail. Furthermore, constructive algorithm of meromorphic quartic differential on genus zero surfaces is proposed, which is based on the global algebraic representation of meromorphic differentials. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the algorithm. This opens up a novel direction for quad-mesh generation using algebraic geometric approach .},

On top of that, the contributions of the microstructure to the governing equations in the coarse-grained domain are sampled using only a few unit cells. In both domains, geometrical and material variability along the strut can be naturally taken into account using a 3D co-rotational beam finite element with embedded plastic hinges .

The most appealing advantages are the ability to improve the integration accuracy by making full use of the spatial correlation information among the design points, and the treatment of discretization error as a source of epistemic uncertainty being explicitly propagated to the integration results. This paper aims to develop an adaptive algorithm for further improving the efficiency and accuracy of the probabilistic integration when it is applied to the time-consuming computer simulators. A learning function is first extracted from the posterior variance of the integration and is shown to be especially useful for identifying the design point, by adding which to the training data set, the most reduction of the posterior variance of integration can be achieved. Based on this learning function, an adaptive experiment design algorithm is then developed for actively producing optimal design points. Results of the experiment tests and engineering application show that, with the same number of design points, the developed design strategy always produce more accurate and robust integration results, than the three kinds of commonly used random sampling design strategies (i.e., Monte Carlo design, Latin-hypercube design and Sobol sequence).},

Firstly, ropes, membranes and three-dimensional continua are treated with one set of governing equations. Secondly, the reformulated boundary value problem applies to parametrized and implicit geometries. Therefore, the formulation is more general than classical ones as it does not rely on parametrizations implying curvilinear coordinate systems and the concept of co- and contravariant base vectors . This leads to the third unification: TDC-based models are applicable to two fundamentally different numerical approaches . On the one hand, one may use the classical Surface FEM where the geometry is discretized by curved one-dimensional elements for ropes and two-dimensional surface elements for membranes. On the other hand, it also applies to recent Trace FEM approaches where the geometry is immersed in a higher-dimensional background mesh. Then, the shape functions of the background mesh are evaluated on the trace of the immersed geometry and used for the approximation . As such, the Trace FEM is a fictitious domain method for partial differential equations on manifolds. The numerical results show that the proposed finite strain theory yields higher-order convergence rates independent of the numerical methodology, the dimension of the manifold, and the geometric representation type.},

  abstract     = {Standard approaches for uncertainty quantification in cardiovascular modeling pose challenges due to the large number of uncertain inputs and the significant computational cost of realistic three-dimensional simulations. We propose an efficient uncertainty quantification framework utilizing a multilevel multifidelity Monte Carlo (MLMF) estimator to improve the accuracy of hemodynamic quantities of interest while maintaining reasonable computational cost. This is achieved by leveraging three cardiovascular model fidelities , each with varying spatial resolution to rigorously quantify the variability in hemodynamic outputs. We employ two low-fidelity models (zero- and one-dimensional) to construct several different estimators. Our goal is to investigate and compare the efficiency of estimators built from combinations of these two low-fidelity model alternatives and our high-fidelity three-dimensional models. We demonstrate this framework on healthy and diseased models of aortic and coronary anatomy, including uncertainties in material property and boundary condition parameters. Our goal is to demonstrate that for this application it is possible to accelerate the convergence of the estimators by utilizing a MLMF paradigm. Therefore, we compare our approach to single fidelity Monte Carlo estimators and to a multilevel Monte Carlo approach based only on three-dimensional simulations, but leveraging multiple spatial resolutions. We demonstrate significant, on the order of 10 to 100 times, reduction in total computational cost with the MLMF estimators. We also examine the differing properties of the MLMF estimators in healthy versus diseased models, as well as global versus local quantities of interest. As expected, global quantities such as outlet pressure and flow show larger reductions than local quantities, such as those relating to wall shear stress , as the latter rely more heavily on the highest fidelity model evaluations. Similarly, healthy models show larger reductions than diseased models. In all cases, our workflow coupling Dakota’s MLMF estimators with the SimVascular cardiovascular modeling framework makes uncertainty quantification feasible for constrained computational budgets.},

This results in a reformulation of the system transport equations in terms of the chemical potential rather than the composition as the independent field variable . The numerical conditioning of the reformulated system, discretised by finite elements , is shown to be significantly improved, and convergence to the Cahn–Hilliard solution is demonstrated for the case of binary spinodal decomposition.

Here, the term discrete domain represents the discrete sub-domains obtained after division of the computational domain, where PINN is applied and the conservation property of cPINN is obtained by enforcing the flux continuity in the strong form along the sub-domain interfaces. In case of hyperbolic conservation laws, the convective flux contributes at the interfaces, whereas in case of viscous conservation laws, both convective and diffusive fluxes contribute. Apart from the flux continuity condition, an average solution (given by two different neural networks) is also enforced at the common interface between two sub-domains. One can also employ a deep neural network in the domain, where the solution may have complex structure, whereas a shallow neural network can be used in the sub-domains with relatively simple and smooth solutions. Another advantage of the proposed method is the additional freedom it gives in terms of the choice of optimization algorithm and the various training parameters like residual points, activation function, width and depth of the network etc. Various forms of errors involved in cPINN such as optimization, generalization and approximation errors and their sources are discussed briefly. In cPINN, locally adaptive activation functions are used, hence training the model faster compared to its fixed counterparts. Both, forward and inverse problems are solved using the proposed method. Various test cases ranging from scalar nonlinear conservation laws like Burgers, Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equations to systems of conservation laws, like compressible Euler equations are solved. The lid-driven cavity test case governed by incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is also solved and the results are compared against a benchmark solution. The proposed method enjoys the property of domain decomposition with separate neural networks in each sub-domain, and it efficiently lends itself to parallelized computation, where each sub-domain can be assigned to a different computational node.},

Bayesian analysis is applied to learn the parameters of the random fields that characterize the mesoscale material properties using computer-simulated images of the material microstructure. The information from such images is used to define the likelihood function of the random field parameters given the homogenized microscale data. The uncertainty in the parameter estimates is quantified through determining their full posterior distribution instead of a point estimate by application of an adaptive sampling algorithm. In addition, the Bayesian approach allows for assessing the plausibility of different correlation models belonging to the Matérn class through computing their respective marginal likelihoods for various choices of the smoothness parameter. The framework is applied to a composite material with large inclusion/matrix stiffness ratio and useful conclusions are derived with regard to the most appropriate correlation model and its parameters.},

  abstract     = {Reliable prediction and thorough understanding of crack growth in engineering materials and structures are of challenging problems, but scientific and technical community has been continuously pursuing an efficient numerical approach to crack propagation simulation. We present in this paper a significant extension and development of the adaptive extended isogeometric analysis (XIGA) based on LR B-splines (locally refined B-splines), which facilitates the local refinement, for accurately modeling crack growth in isotropic and orthotropic media. The discontinuity and singularity of displacements and stresses induced by cracks are locally captured by special enrichment functions, for both isotropic and orthotropic media. This allows the representation of crack to be independent of the computational mesh and avoids the requirement for re-meshing in crack growth simulation. The numerical integration accuracy is improved with the use of the almost-polar integration and sub-triangle technique for the crack-tip and cut elements, respectively. The posteriori error estimator based on Zienkiewicz–Zhu error estimation is employed to define refinement domains, and thereby, drives the adaptivity. On the other hand, the maximum circumferential stress criterion is adopted to determine the direction of crack growth. Several crack growth numerical examples for both isotropic and orthotropic media are studied in different scenarios to show the performance and accuracy of the developed approach. Numerical results reveal that the present approach integrated with the adaptive local refinement scheme offers higher accuracy and convergence rate than the standard XIGA. Furthermore, the adaptive XIGA in a tandem with Nitche’s method is applied to simulate the crack growth of complicated structures. We additionally explore the effects of some numerical aspects or factors on crack path. Smaller crack growth increment could be used to improve the accuracy of crack path within a finer mesh in the adaptive XIGA.},

  abstract     = {Data-driven material models have many advantages over classical numerical approaches , such as the direct utilization of experimental data and the possibility to improve performance of predictions when additional data is available. One approach to develop a data-driven material model is to use machine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed material behaviour and then be applied in online applications. However, learning and predicting history dependent material models, such as plasticity, is still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material modelling framework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning based hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network (FNN) directly whereas the machine learning based plasticity model is developed by using of a novel method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward Neural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading history, the accumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the plasticity model. Additionally, the strain–stress sequence data for plasticity is collected from different loading–unloading paths based on the concept of sequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the multi-dimensional stress sequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient sequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by multiple independent neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output, which leads to less training time and better training performance. To apply the machine learning based material model in finite element analysis, the tangent matrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen. The effectiveness and generalization of the presented models are investigated by a series of numerical examples using both 2D and 3D finite element analysis .},

We also provide the rate of convergence when each row of the pseudostress is approximated by Raviart–Thomas elements and the velocity is approximated by continuous piecewise polynomials . We develop an a posteriori error analysis based on a Helmholtz-type decomposition, and derive a posteriori error indicators that consist of two residual terms per element except on those elements with a side on the Dirichlet boundary, where they both have two additional terms. We prove that these a posteriori error indicators are reliable and locally efficient. Finally, we provide several numerical experiments that support the theoretical results.},

The piezoelectric-structure–fluid interaction system is decomposed into subsystems of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) and piezoelectric field, then the piezoelectric field and the FSI are coupled using the block Gauss–Seidel method, the fluid–structure interaction is split into the fluid–structure velocity field and the pressure field using an algebraic splitting and the fluid–structure velocity field is partitioned into fluid velocity field and structure velocity field.

  abstract     = {Brittle and ductile dynamic fracture in solids is a complex mechanical phenomenon which attracted much attention from both engineers and scientists due to its technological interests. Modeling cracks in dynamic cases based on a discontinuous description is difficult because it needs additional criteria for branching and widening. Due to the very short time scales and the spatial complexity of the dynamic problem , its experimental analysis is still very difficult. Therefore, researchers still have to rely on numerical simulations to find a deeper explanation for many observed phenomena. This study is set out to investigate the effect of plasticity on dynamic fracture propagation . On the other hand, the diffuse phase-field formulation makes it possible to initiate, propagate, arrest or even branch cracks while satisfying the basic principles of thermodynamics. An implicit, staggered elastoplastic version of the phase-field approach was implemented in the commercial finite element code Abaqus through the UEL option. By means of simple examples we show that localized ductile deformations first increase both resistance and toughness. Then, after a maximum value, the resistance starts to decrease with a significant increment in energy dissipation . By favoring shear deformation over tensile failure the fracture pattern changes. First the branching disappears, then the crack propagation angle changes and becomes a shear band. Finally, we observed the increment of the instantaneous dynamic stress intensity factor during the acceleration stage of the crack without introducing a rate dependent critical fracture energy. We explained this phenomenon with the increasing roughness of the fracture surface .},

In many relevant situations, the time-step requirements of explicit methods imposed by the transport and mixing in the vertical direction are more restrictive than those for the horizontal, and this may cause the need to use very small time steps if a fully explicit method is employed. To overcome this issue, we propose an exponential time differencing (ETD) solver where the vertical terms (transport and diffusion) are treated with a matrix exponential , whereas the horizontal terms are dealt with in an explicit way. We investigate numerically the computational speed-ups that can be obtained over other semi-implicit methods, and we analyze the advantages of the method in the case of multiple tracers.},

The applications are limited to densely distributed stiffeners with no significant scale effect in the homogenization process, which is revealed in this work. A data-driven SSPO method, which is inspired by the popular principal component analysis (PCA) in data processing, is proposed for sparse stiffener layout design. With several referential layouts as input, the PCA generates a sequence of principal layouts. Together with weighting factors and distortion techniques, using only a small number of dominant principal layouts is enough to represent most possible synthesized layouts, which significantly reduces the number of design variables while preserving and extending a large design space. This strategy is further enhanced with a detailed modeling technique based on multiple point constraints (MPCs) to automate the modeling process. The data-driven SSPO method can be integrated with either gradient-based or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms due to the small number of design variables. A flexible objective target, to maximize the critical buckling load or minimize the structural weight, can be used since the structural responses are evaluated on the detailed model. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing the layout of sparsely distributed stiffeners.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques for fluid flow modelling have gained significant attention in recent years. Advanced deep learning techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without prior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. However, most of existing researches focused mainly on either sequence learning or spatial learning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid flows (Reichstein et al., 2019). In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fluid model based on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) has been developed for predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions. In deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional flows can be converted into the low-dimensional “latent” representations. The complex features of flow dynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. The above DCGAN fluid model enables us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while maintaining a high computational efficiency. The performance of the DCGAN is illustrated for two test cases of Hokkaido tsunami with different incoming waves along the coastal line. It is demonstrated that the results from the DCGAN are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model (Fluidity). The spatio-temporal flow features have been represented as the flow evolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks can be captured accurately. In addition, the results illustrate that the online CPU cost is reduced by five orders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations. The promising results show that the DCGAN can provide rapid and reliable spatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear fluid flows.},

  abstract     = {A multiphase SPH model based on Roe’s approximate Riemann solver is proposed to simulate complex interfacial flows in hydraulics. In this multiphase model, the solution to a one-dimensional Riemann problem is introduced into the SPH governing equations to determine the interaction between particles. The Riemann problem is solved by Roe’s approximate Riemann solver which may introduce excessive numerical dissipations. To reduce these dissipations, a dissipation limiter is applied. An equivalent relation between the dissipation term in the dissipation limiter and the Reynolds number is derived to model viscous flows of different Reynolds numbers. For flows of high density ratios (up to 1000), stable and smooth interfacial pressure can be obtained. The realistic compressibility can be considered for the light fluid and a larger time step can be allowed, leading to a decrease of the computational cost. To further make the simulation more efficient, an optimized adaptive linked-list search algorithm is introduced. Using this optimized algorithm, the particle interaction list can be updated every dozen of time steps instead of at each time step, which contributes to a significant reduction of the total computational cost. Seven numerical tests are presented to validate this multiphase model.},

The electrical formulation is then coupled with a mechanical micropolar peridynamic formulation with adjustable Poisson’s ratio. The obtained unified model is capable to predict the elastic response and the electrical conduction of elastic brittle materials taking into account the influence of cracks and other defects. The accuracy of the proposed model has been assessed by several problems including the simulation of fracture propagation and damage sensing in a lamina under tensile loading and the piezoresistive response of nanocomposite materials.},

  abstract     = {In the isogeometric formulation for three-dimensional Kirchhoff rods, the invariance is required such that rigid-body modes associated with translations and infinitesimal rotations can be exactly represented. By enforcing the invariance in the isogeometric formulation of the rod, the equilibrium of forces and moments at fixed ends is preserved, and the performance is improved considerably for elements of finite sizes. We recognize that not all existing isogeometric formulations are invariant for general geometry of rods. Though an alternative formulation based on the Frenet–Serret frame and rotation angle representation was shown to be invariant, it does not work for rods with vanishing curvature, while its accuracy is affected by the low continuity of the angle of twist used. Motivated by this, two new invariant isogeometric formulations are developed, through different interpolations for the angle of twist. One uses the derivatives of the NURBS functions as the basis for the angle-of-twist interpolation, and the other uses a mixed interpolation incorporating both the Lagrange and NURBS functions. Several representative numerical examples were prepared to verify the accuracy and robustness of the two new formulations. Particularly, for rods of variable curvatures simulated by elements of finite or large sizes, the proposed formulations are demonstrated to outperform the two existing ones mentioned in predicting the displacements, end reactions and stress resultants.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel strategy for detecting multiple flaws based on the dynamic extended finite element method (XFEM) and an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm. To improve the qualities of the initial iterative candidates, a chaotic sequence is adopted to replace the random sequence in the conventional artificial colony algorithm. Meanwhile, an adaptive parameter dimension search is proposed to prevent the iterative solution from falling into a local optimum trap, and a set of subcandidates is utilized to describe the shape of irregular flaws. The detection process of multiple flaws in the structure is divided into two stages. First, the improved ABC algorithm with preset discrete points is combined with topology variables to obtain the number of and approximate locations of the flaws and output the corresponding narrow subdomains . Second, a set of circular candidates is regenerated in the new subdomains derived from the first stage to capture the target flaws. In addition, XFEM is employed for the forward analysis, and the discontinuities of the flaws are characterized by level set functions . Several numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy. The effects of sensor layout and measurement noise with different levels are considered to assess the robustness of this strategy. The results show that this strategy is able to quantify the number of and capture the shape of unknown flaws. The narrow distributions of the Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the proposed strategy is robust against noise.},

  abstract     = {Data-Driven Computational Mechanics is a novel computing paradigm that enables the transition from standard data-starved approaches to modern data-rich approaches. At this early stage of development, one can distinguish two mainstream directions. The first one, which can be classified as a direct approach, relies on a discrete-continuous optimization problem and seeks to assign to each material point a point in the phase space that satisfies compatibility and equilibrium, while being closest to the data set provided. The second one, which can be classified as an inverse approach, seeks to reconstruct a constitutive manifold from data sets by manifold learning techniques, relying on a well-defined functional structure of the underlying constitutive law. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of the two existing directions and mitigates some of their weaknesses. This is achieved by the formulation of an approximate nonlinear optimization problem, which can be robustly solved, is computationally efficient, and does not rely on any special functional structure of the reconstructed constitutive manifold. Additional benefits include the natural incorporation of kinematic constraints and the possibility to operate with implicitly defined stress–strain relations. We discuss important mathematical aspects of our approach for a data-driven truss element and investigate its key numerical behavior for a data-driven beam element that makes use of all components of our methodology.},

The proposed technique, which we refer to as the Adjoint Petrov–Galerkin (APG) method, is derived by decomposing the generalized coordinates of a dynamical system into a resolved coarse-scale set and an unresolved fine-scale set. A Markovian finite memory assumption within the Mori–Zwanzig formalism is then used to develop a reduced-order representation of the coarse scales. This procedure leads to a closed reduced-order model that displays commonalities with the adjoint stabilization method used in finite elements. The formulation is shown to be equivalent to a Petrov–Galerkin method with a non-linear, time-varying test basis, thus sharing some similarities with the Least-Squares Petrov–Galerkin method. Theoretical analysis examining a priori error bounds and computational cost is presented. Numerical experiments on the compressible Navier–Stokes equations demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to improvements in numerical accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency over the Galerkin method on problems of practical interest. Improvements in numerical accuracy and computational efficiency over the Least-Squares Petrov–Galerkin method are observed in most cases.},

The proposed framework considers a wide range of candidate features, regression methods, and additive noise models. We consider primarily recursive regression techniques developed for time-series modeling, including both classical time-series models (e.g., autoregressive models) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), but also analyze standard non-recursive regression techniques (e.g., feed-forward neural networks) for comparative purposes. Numerical experiments conducted on multiple benchmark problems illustrate that the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of RNN, outperforms other methods and yields substantial improvements in error predictions over traditional approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fluid injection or production in petroleum reservoirs affects the reservoir stresses such that it can even sometime reactivate dormant faults in the vicinity. In the particular case of deep carbonate reservoirs , faults can also be chemically active and chemical dissolution of the fault core can transform an otherwise impermeable barrier to a flow channel. Due to the scale separation between the fault and the reservoir, the implementation of highly non-linear multiphysics processes for the fault, needed for such phenomenon, is not compatible with simpler poromechanics controlling the reservoir behaviour. This contribution presents a three-scale finite element framework using the REDBACK simulator to account for those multiphysics couplings in faults during fluid production. This approach links the reservoir (km) scale – implementing poromechanics both for the fault interface and its surrounding reservoir – with the fault at the meso-scale (m) – implementing a THMC reactivation model – and the micro-scale ( μ μ m) – implementing a hydro-chemical model on meshed μ μ CT-scan images. This model can explain the permeability increase during fault reactivation and successfully replicate fault activation, slip evolution and deactivation features, predicted by common fault reactivation models, yet with continuous transitions between the sequences. The multiscale coupling allows to resolve the heterogeneous propagation of the fault slip which can be uncorrelated from the initial highest slip tendency location. We also demonstrate the advantage of dynamically upscaled laws compared to empirical ones as we show that a hydraulically imperceptible alteration of the microstructure’s geometry can lead to different durations of the reactivation event at the macro-scale.},

  abstract     = {The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method (DGMPM) presented in Renaud et al. (2018)[14] is based on the discretization of a solid domain by means of particles in a background mesh. Owing to the employment of the discontinuous Galerkin approximation on the grid, the weak form of a hyperbolic system involves fluxes that are computed at cell interfaces by means of an approximate Riemann solver. Combining these fluxes with the projection of the updated solution from the nodes to the particles originally used in the Particle-In-Cell method allows a significative reduction of the numerical oscillations that pollute the classical MPM solutions . Although the DGMPM exhibits very promising aspects, such as the control of the time-stepping (Renaud et al., 2020 [43]) or the ability to locally increase the approximation order in an arbitrary grid, the method first needs to be tested in its early version on problems involving a more complex wave content. It is then proposed in this paper to couple the DGMPM with variational integrators of hyperelastic–plastic constitutive models. The genericity provided for dealing with rate-independent or rate-dependent plasticity, as well as the possibility to easily extend the DGMPM to thermomechanical problems, makes this class of integrators appealing. The approach is here illustrated on numerical examples for which comparisons are shown with the finite element and the material point methods, as well as a one-dimensional exact solution in the linearized geometrical limit.},

Its extension to the Neumann boundary conditions that was a big issue due to the presence of normal derivatives along irregular boundaries is considered in this paper. Trivial Cartesian meshes and simple 27-point uniform and nonuniform stencil equations are used with the new approach for 3-D irregular domains. The Neumann boundary conditions are introduced as the known right-hand side into the stencil and do not change the width of the stencil. The calculation of the coefficients of the stencil equations is based on the minimization of the local truncation error of the stencil equations and yields the optimal order of accuracy of the new technique. Very small distances ( 0 . 1 h − 1 0 − 9 h 0.1h−10−9h where h h is the grid size) between the grid points of a Cartesian mesh and the boundary do not worsen the accuracy of the new technique. At similar 27-point stencils, the accuracy of the new approach is much higher than that for the linear finite elements . The numerical results for irregular domains show that at the same number of degrees of freedom, the new approach is even much more accurate than the high-order (up to the fourth order) tetrahedral finite elements with much wider stencils. The wave and heat equations can be uniformly treated with the new approach. The order of the time derivative in these equations does not affect the coefficients of the stencil equations of the semi-discrete systems. The new approach can be directly applied to other partial differential equations .},

  abstract     = {The immersed boundary method is a mathematical framework for modeling fluid–structure interaction. This formulation describes the momentum, viscosity , and incompressibility of the fluid–structure system in Eulerian form, and it uses Lagrangian coordinates to describe the structural deformations, stresses, and resultant forces . Integral transforms with Dirac delta function kernels connect the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. The fluid and the structure are both typically treated as incompressible materials . The discretization scheme can readily enforce incompressibility exactly for the Eulerian velocity field . Because of the regularization of the Dirac delta function kernel, however, the Lagrangian velocity field of the solid generally does not retain this property. To obtain an immersed method for incompressible hyperelastic structures that is robust under large structural deformations, we introduce a volumetric energy in the solid region that stabilizes the formulation and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme . This formulation augments the discrete Eulerian Lagrange multiplier for the incompressibility constraint, thereby improving the original method’s accuracy. This volumetric energy is incorporated by decomposing the strain energy into isochoric and dilatational components, as in standard solid mechanics formulations of nearly incompressible elasticity. We study the performance of the stabilized method using several quasi-static solid mechanics benchmarks, a dynamic fluid–structure interaction benchmark, and a detailed three-dimensional model of esophageal transport. The accuracy achieved by the stabilized immersed formulation is empirically demonstrated to be comparable to that of a stabilized finite element method for incompressible elasticity using similar numbers of structural degrees of freedom.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a stabilized node-based smoothed radial point interpolation method (SNS-RPIM) was proposed to simulate the magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) structures in hygrothermal environment. The node-based smoothing domains were constructed based on triangular background elements, and the approximate strain, electric field intensity and magnetic flux density were derived using node-based strain smoothing operation. In the present formulation, the stabilization term related to the gradient variance of the field variables was used to obtain the system stiffness matrices . Then, by using the smoothed Galerkin weak form, discrete equations of the system were established to solve the generalized displacement of the structure. The numerical experiments validated the feasibility of SNS-RPIM for solving hygrothermo-magneto-electro-elastic (HMEE) coupling problems with different hygrothermal loadings and boundary conditions. Results proved that the introduction of the stabilization term made the SNS-RPIM had a ‘close-to-exact’ stiffness, thereby solving the ‘overly-soft’ in the traditional node-based smoothed radial point interpolation method (NS-RPIM). SNS-RPIM was in good agreement with the reference solution when using the same fewer nodes as finite element method (FEM), and the errors were much smaller than those of FEM. Moreover, SNS-RPIM performed better than NS-RPIM and FEM when processing distorted meshes. Therefore, the developed method showed great potential in simulating MEE structure in hygrothermal environment.},

  abstract     = {3D fiber-reinforced composites demand for a special simulation technique, because they consist of fiber bundles. Therefore, in the corresponding representative volume element of these metamaterials, secondary effects as a micro inertia and a curvature–twist stiffness have to bear in mind. The latter increases the strength-to-weight ratio of thin-walled lightweight structures due to a separate twisting and bending stiffness of the fiber bundles. In this paper, these secondary effects are introduced in a continuum formulation by means of independent drilling degrees of freedom. The resulting non-isothermal constrained micropolar continuum is derived by a principle of virtual power, which simultaneously generates in the discrete setting a mixed B-bar method and a Galerkin-based energy–momentum scheme of higher order. This work also takes into account viscoelastic material behavior in the fiber bundles, which arises from a mixture of organic and inorganic fibers. Here, the viscous evolution equation is solved elementwise by using a mixed field as viscous internal variable. Representative numerical examples demonstrate the inelastic material behavior, the effect of micro inertia on the physical properties of the continuum as well as on its space and time discretization and, finally, the twisting and bending stiffness of the fiber bundles. Further, non-standard boundary conditions are applied in the dynamic simulations performed by higher order energy–momentum schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes and investigates two formulations to topology optimization of compliant mechanisms considering stress constraints, manufacturing uncertainty and geometric nonlinearity . The first formulation extends the maximum output displacement robust approach with stress constraints to incorporate the effects of geometric nonlinear behavior during the optimization process. The second formulation relies on the concept of path-generating mechanisms, where not only the final configuration is important, but also the load–displacement equilibrium path. A novel path-generating formulation is thus proposed, not only to achieve the prescribed equilibrium path, but also to take stress constraints and manufacturing uncertainty into account during the optimization process. Although both formulations have different goals, the same main techniques are employed: density approach to topology optimization, augmented Lagrangian method to handle the large number of stress constraints, three-field robust approach to handle the manufacturing uncertainty, and the energy interpolation scheme to handle convergence issues due to large deformation in void regions. Several numerical examples are addressed to demonstrate applicability of the proposed approaches. The optimized results are post-processed with body-fitted finite element meshes. Obtained results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed nonlinear analysis based maximum output displacement approach is able to provide solutions with good performance in situations of large displacements, with stress and manufacturing requirements satisfied; (2) the linear analysis based maximum output displacement approach provides optimized topologies that show large stress constraint violations and rapidly varying stress behavior under uniform boundary variation, when these are post-processed with full nonlinear analysis ; (3) the proposed path-generating formulation is able to provide solutions that follow the prescribed control points, including stress robustness.},

  abstract     = {When computing pointwise contact between bodies in a numerical model, one has to define a gap quantity. This is evaluated along the model evolution to quantify contact contributions. In this context, the evaluation of the gap for a fixed configuration of the system is here denoted as the local contact problem (LCP). Present work discusses the LCP in the context of the master–master contact formulation between surfaces, which yields the solution of a four-variable set of nonlinear equations . We present and solve the LCP employing trust-region optimization methods, leading to a robust and general scheme. After, the developed method is applied for several examples of contact involving surface parameterizations , such as super-elliptical extruded surfaces in the context of beam-to-beam contact, arc-based extruded and revolved surfaces and NURBS surfaces for rigid body contact modeling. Applications are quite general, such as pointwise contact involving finite elements and contact between particles addressed by the discrete element method. The main contribution of present work is the discussion, characterization and a proposal for solution algorithm of the LCP in the context of the master–master contact between surfaces. This is fundamental for a successful use of master–master contact schemes.},

The discrete energy stability of the proposed scheme has been proven, irrespective of the time step sizes. Within each time step the scheme entails the computation of two velocity fields and two pressure fields, by solving an individual de-coupled Helmholtz (including Poisson) type equation with a constant pre-computable coefficient matrix for each of these field variables . The auxiliary variable, being a scalar number, is given by a well-defined explicit formula within a time step, which ensures the positivity of its computed values. Extensive numerical experiments with several flows involving outflow/open boundaries in regimes where the backflow instability becomes severe have been presented to test the performance of the proposed method and to demonstrate its stability at large time step sizes.},

DEM is often limited however in its ability to capture particle shape, particularly when used for breakage. This paper presents the first brittle breakage technique where level set functions will allow for the description of arbitrary shape for both particles and fracture surfaces. The breakage model to be described here uses fracture surfaces defined by level sets to take advantage of simple intersection and difference set operations to split particles in both two and three dimensions. We show how this method is implemented and how we can use it to define and apply arbitrary fracture surface shapes. We then give qualitative examples of using the method in both simple and exotic ways. Finally, we model oedometric tests and rock crushing, both very common uses for previous DEM breakage techniques, to present a validation that the method captures the physics of the problem.},

The new model completes the standard linear model by taking the transport of ionic charge into account, which was ignored in the standard equation. We propose Bayesian inversion methods to extract electrical properties of inhomogeneities in the main body, which is essential in medicine to screen the interior body and detect tumors or determine body composition. We also prove well-definedness of the posterior measure and well-posedness of the Bayesian inversion for the presented nonlinear model. The new model is able to distinguish between liquid and tissues and the state-of-the-art delayed-rejection adaptive-Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm is capable of analyzing the statistical variability in the measured data in various EIT experimental designs. This leads to design a reliable device with higher resolution images which is crucial in medicine for diagnostic purposes. We first test the validation of the presented nonlinear model and the proposed inverse method using synthetic data on a simple square computational domain with an inclusion. Then we establish the new model and robustness of the proposed inversion method in solving the ill-posed and nonlinear EIT inverse problem by presenting numerical results of the corresponding forward and inverse problems on a real-world application in medicine and healthcare.

We provide a mathematical view on data-driven boundary value problems as well as the associated mathematical tools. The notion of function spaces is introduced into a data-driven boundary value problem and thus it can be formulated as a continuous optimization problem. An explanation of a data-driven boundary value problem as a double-minimization problem is given. This problem is subsequently broken down into two single-minimization problems, one of which is a constrained optimization problem. The associated constraint is given in terms of differential equations and the method of choice is the method of Lagrange multipliers. For the constrained optimization problem, we seek solutions by solving a system of equations for nodal degrees of freedom. The second is an unconstrained optimization problem whose solution is sought by working with the values of the solution at quadrature points and the supplied material data. The proposed variational formulation renders the high-order polynomial interpolation to straightforward implementation. In particular, spectral element methods are employed to reduce the computational cost while assuring the high accuracy of the data-driven solution. Within the spirit of the variational formulation, diffusion and dynamic problems can be efficiently studied in the data-driven setting with only few necessary modifications. Some representative numerical examples for parabolic and hyperbolic equations are presented. Numerical convergence studies show the reliability and robustness of the proposed formulation.},

The proposed method is robust in the Stokes and Darcy limits, in addition, hanging nodes can be automatically incorporated in the construction of the method, which are desirable features in practical applications. There are three unknowns involved in our formulation, namely velocity gradient , velocity and pressure. Unlike the original staggered DG formulation proposed for the Stokes equations in Kim et al. (2013), we relax the tangential continuity of velocity and enforce different staggered continuity properties for the three unknowns, which is tailored to yield an optimal L 2 L2 error estimates for velocity gradient , velocity and pressure independent of the viscosity coefficient. Moreover, by choosing suitable projection, superconvergence can be proved for L 2 L2 error of velocity. Finally, several numerical results illustrating the good performances of the proposed method and confirming the theoretical findings are presented.},

  abstract     = {Problems with localized nonhomogeneous material properties arise frequently in many applications and are a well-known source of difficulty in numerical simulations. In certain applications (including additive manufacturing), the physics of the problem may be considerably more complicated in relatively small portions of the domain, requiring a significantly finer local mesh compared to elsewhere in the domain. This can make the use of a conforming, highly non-uniform mesh numerically unfeasible. In fact, such meshes may be challenging to generate (particularly for regions with complex boundaries) and more difficult to precondition. The problem becomes even more prohibitive when the region requiring a finer-level mesh changes in time, requiring the introduction of refinement and derefinement techniques. To address the aforementioned challenges, we employ a technique related to the Fat boundary method as a possible alternative. We analyze the proposed methodology from a mathematical point of view and validate our findings with a series of two-dimensional numerical tests.},

Using an implicit geometry description we derive a single-scale interpretation of optimal multi-scale designs on a very fine mesh (de-homogenization). By performing homogenization-based topology optimization , optimal multi-scale designs are obtained on a relatively coarse mesh resulting in a low computational cost. As microstructure parameterization we use orthogonal rank-3 microstructures, which are known to be optimal for a single loading case. Furthermore, a method to get explicit control of the minimum feature size and complexity of the final shapes will be discussed. Numerical examples show excellent performance of these fine-scale designs resulting in objective values similar to the homogenization-based designs. Comparisons with well-established density-based topology optimization methods show a reduction in computational cost of 3 orders of magnitude, paving the way for giga-scale designs on a standard PC.},

  abstract     = {A computational framework is designed to accurately predict the elastic response of thin shells undergoing large displacements induced by local hydrodynamic forces, as well as to resolve the complex fluid pattern arising from its interaction with an incompressible fluid. Within the context of partitioned algorithms, two different approaches are employed for the fluid and structural domain. The fluid motion is resolved with a pressure projection method on a Cartesian structured grid. The immersed shell is modeled by means of a NURBS surface, and the elastic response is obtained from a displacement-based isogeometric analysis relying on the Kirchhoff–Love theory. The two solvers exchange data through a direct-forcing immersed-boundary approach, where the interpolation/spreading of the variables between Lagrangian and Eulerian grids is implemented with a Moving Least Squares approximation, which has proven to be very effective for moving boundaries. In this scenario, the isoparametric paradigm is exploited to perform an adaptive collocation of the Lagrangian markers, decoupling the local grid density of fluid and shell domains and reducing the computational expense. The accuracy of the method is verified by refinement analyses, segregating the Eulerian/Lagrangian refinement, which confirm the expected scheme accuracy in space and time. The effectiveness of the method is then validated against different test-cases of engineering and biologic inspiration, involving fundamentally different physical and numerical conditions, namely: (i) a flapping flag, (ii) an inverted flag, (iii) a clamped plate, (iv) a buoyant seaweed in a free stream. Both strong and loose coupling approaches are implemented to handle different fluid-to-structure density ratios, providing accurate results.},

This SGFEM is based on p p -hierarchical FEM enrichments and its approximation space is the same as in its GFEM counterpart. Singular enrichments are modified using a discontinuous finite element interpolant for conditioning control. This leads, with the proper choice of enrichments, to stiffness matrices with a scaled condition number of O ( h − 2 ) O(h−2) — the same order as in the standard FEM. The robustness of the method with respect to the position of a crack relative to the mesh is demonstrated. A scalar implementation of singular enrichments that can exactly reproduce the first term of the Mode I, II, and III of the asymptotic expansion of the elasticity solution is presented. Improved approximations of signed distance functions based on integration sub-elements are also presented. Convergence studies of a fully 3-D fracture problem with a non-planar crack surface and a curved crack front are presented. They show that the convergence rate of the proposed method on a sequence of uniform meshes is three times higher than quadratic quarter-point finite elements.},

This paper presents an efficient non-gradient approach to the topology optimization of structures when no information is available about design sensitivity. Based on the material-field series expansion (MFSE), the problem of topology optimization is constructed as a constrained minimization model with the series expansion coefficients as the design variables, thereby involving a considerable reduction of design variables. The Kriging-based optimization algorithm incorporating two infill criteria is used to solve the optimization problem . A special strategy of (i) using a self-adjusting design domain and (ii) remodeling the surrogate function is proposed to improve the searching efficiency of the Kriging-based algorithm.

While several such predictive modeling techniques have been proposed, their use in the clinic has been limited due in part to the significant time required to perform virtual interventions and compute the resultant changes in hemodynamic conditions. We propose a fast hemodynamic assessment method to aid in interventional planning based on first constructing an exploration space of geometries, tailored to each patient, and subsequently building a physics driven reduced order model in this space. We demonstrate that this method can predict fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography in response to changes to a patient-specific lumen geometry in real time while achieving high accuracy when compared to computational fluid dynamics simulations. We validated this method on over 1300 patients that received a coronary CT scan and demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.98 with an error of 0 . 005 ± 0 . 015 0.005±0.015 (95% CI: (-0.020, 0.031)) as compared to three-dimensional blood flow calculations. This technology is implemented in a product that has received clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is being used clinically to enable physicians to predict changes in blood flow resulting from removal of coronary stenoses as might occur with percutaneous coronary interventions.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a general thermodynamically consistent non-isothermal phase field framework to model effects of damage, fracture and fatigue evolutions in elasto-plastic materials under the hypothesis of small strains. The proposed methodology is obtained from the principle of virtual power, energy balance and second law of thermodynamics in the form of a generalized Clausius–Duhem inequality for entropy. Aspects of the energy degradation functions are thoroughly investigated for an isotropic elasto-plastic material with viscous dissipation and constant specific heat. A new combined degradation function is proposed to degrade both elastic and plastic energy densities as an alternative to the classical degradation functions. Our conceptual framework leads to thermodynamically consistent models that may include contributions not usually considered in the literature, as temperature and inertia effects as well as time-rate dependent processes. The governing nonlinear transient equations obtained are solved adopting a semi-implicit time integration scheme combined with the classical Newton–Raphson iterative procedure. Results for an I-shaped specimen made of 7075-T7351 aluminum alloy under different conditions are presented. The proposed model is able to reproduce qualitative and quantitatively the ductile fracture and the fatigue phenomena. In particular for fatigue, both the S–N experimental data and the Paris crack growth curve over cycles are recovered. In addition, the cycle jump strategy reduces four times the CPU time for fatigue simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present a monolithic incremental Lagrangian framework based on meshfree methods, the Hot Optimal Transportation Meshfree (HOTM) method, for a robust and efficient solution of the dynamic response of materials under extreme thermomechanical conditions, possibly involving extremely large deformation, phase transition and multiphase mixing. The HOTM method combines the Optimal Transportation Meshfree (OTM) method and the variational thermomechanical constitutive updates. The variational structure of a dynamic system with general internal dissipative mechanisms is discretized in time by applying the Optimal Transportation theory, while material points and nodes are introduced for the spatial discretization. A phase-aware constitutive model is developed to describe the history-dependent material behavior in various phases due to melting, vaporization and solidification. The fully discretized conservation equations of linear momentum and energy are solved simultaneously using an operator splitting algorithm to predict the deformation, temperature and internal variables of the computational domain. The convergence property of the meshfree solution of the energy conservation equation is studied in a three-dimensional transient heat conduction problem by comparing to the analytical solutions. Accuracy of the HOTM method is also assessed in the example of upsetting a metallic billet up to a compression ratio of 95% under various external heating and cooling strategies. The scope and robustness of the HOTM method are demonstrated in the application of the laser cladding technology.},

In this method, stress-update is driven by a set of one-dimensional stress–strain data generated by numerical or physical experiments under uniaxial loading. Numerical results indicate that combined with the classical strain-driven scheme, the proposed method can predict the mechanical response of isotropic elastoplastic materials (characterized by J2 plasticity model with isotropic/kinematic hardening and associated Drucker–Prager model) accurately without resorting to the typical ingredients of classical model-based plasticity, such as decomposing the total strain into elastic and plastic parts, as well as identifying explicit functional expressions of yielding surface and hardening curve. This mechanistic-based data-driven approach has the potential of opening up a new avenue for numerical analysis of problems where complex material behaviors cannot be described in explicit function/functional forms. The applicability and limitation of the proposed approach are also discussed.},

Foremost, the distributed forces are approximated by truncated Legendre orthogonal polynomial in the time history. The RBF ANN implementation is introduced, whereby the normalized structural responses are deemed as input variables, and the normalized polynomial coefficients are regarded as output variables. To improve the generalization of the trained RBF ANN, the structural responses and polynomial coefficients with respect to different types of distributed dynamic forces at every instant are defined as the samples. Thus, the coefficients of the distributed force to be identified may be ascertained after inputting the corresponding responses. In terms of the multi-source uncertainties, the random white Gaussian noise is brought in to simulate the noise of measured signals polluted, and the interval vector is involved to characterize the uncertainties of material dispersion subsequently. In view of the issue of large interval parameters, the subinterval theory is established by a combination of the Taylor series expansion in each subinterval . Eventually, the validity and feasibility of the developed methodology are demonstrated by two numerical examples .},

  abstract     = {Many problems in softmatter and membrane biophysics, such as finding the equilibrium configurations of protein clusters on cell-membranes, the highly defect ridden structure of Gag polyproteins in immature HIV capsids, and the unusual fluid-like state of Archaeal viruses can be understood as systems of interacting particles (typically representing proteins or protein capsomers) on deformable surfaces. The coupled interactions between the particles and the underlying elastic medium to which they are constrained pose significant computational challenges. Existing methods often employ expensive constraints to anchor particles to the surface or artificially restrict the particles movement yielding spurious equilibrium states. In this work, a new method is presented where the particles positions are parameterized in the reference configuration. This pull-back operation allows the particles to move freely on the surface without the need of additional constraints. Furthermore, the mapping necessary to describe the particles positions in a discretized setting, e.g., in a finite element mesh, can be done on the reference undeformed configuration at a reduced computational cost. The proposed method is applied to particles moving on manifolds in one and two dimensions to study its convergence characteristics and error when compared to derived analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Finally, the newly developed method is applied to generalized Tammes problems of packing interacting point particles on a deformable shell.},

To efficiently solve the linear systems at each step, we use low-rank tensor representations within the Krylov subspace method, which leads to significant reductions in storage requirements and computational costs. Combined with effective mean-based preconditioners and the idea of inexact solve, we show that only a small number of linear iterations are needed at each Picard step.

From a collection of low-fidelity (LF) snapshots, parameter locations are extracted for the evaluations of high-fidelity (HF) snapshots to recover a reduced basis. Multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression (GPR) is employed to approximate the combination coefficients of the reduced basis. LF data is assimilated either via projection onto an LF basis or via an interpolation approach inspired by bifidelity reconstruction. The correlation between HF and LF data is modeled with hyperparameters whose values are automatically determined in the regression step. The proposed methods not only leverage the assimilated LF data to reduce the cost of the offline phase, but also allow for a fast evaluation during the online stage, independent of the computational cost of neither the low-nor the high-fidelity solution. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on manufactured examples and problems in nonlinear structural mechanics. Clear benefits of using lower resolution models rather than reduced physics models are observed in both the basis selection and the regression step. An active learning scheme is used for additional snapshot selection at locations with high error. The speed-up in the online evaluation and the high accuracy of extracted quantities of interest makes the multifidelity RB method a powerful tool for outer-loop applications in engineering, as exemplified in uncertainty quantification.},

  abstract     = {This paper applies the Recursive Projection Method (RPM) to the problem of finding the effective mechanical response of a periodic heterogeneous solid. Previous works apply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in combination with various fixed-point methods to solve the problem on the periodic unit cell. These have proven extremely powerful in a range of problems ranging from image-based modeling to dislocation plasticity. However, the fixed-point iterations can converge very slowly, or not at all, if the elastic properties have high contrast, such as in the case of voids. The paper examines the reasons for slow, or lack of convergence, in terms of a variational perspective. In particular, when the material contains regions with zero or very small stiffness, there is lack of uniqueness, and the energy landscape has flat or shallow directions. Therefore, in this work, the fixed-point iteration is replaced by the RPM iteration. The RPM uses the fixed-point iteration to adaptively identify the subspace on which fixed-point iterations are unstable, and performs Newton iterations only on the unstable subspace, while fixed-point iterations are performed on the complementary stable subspace . This combination of efficient fixed-point iterations where possible, and expensive but well-convergent Newton iterations where required, is shown to lead to robust and efficient convergence of the method. In particular, RPM-FFT converges well for a wide range of choices of the reference medium, while usual fixed-point iterations are usually sensitive to this choice.},

When the physical field is defined on a three-dimensional domain with its boundary conditions defined on a two-dimensional manifold corresponding a surface or an interface of this three-dimensional domain, the material density is used to formulate a mixed boundary condition of the partial differential equation for the physical field and implement the penalization between two different boundary types. Based on the homeomorphic property of two-dimensional manifolds, typical two-dimensional manifolds, e.g., sphere, torus, Möbius strip and Klein bottle, are included in the numerical tests, which are used to demonstrate this topology optimization approach for the design problems of fluidic mechanics, heat transfer and electromagnetics.},

  abstract     = {Tractions exerted by cells on the extracellular matrix (ECM) are critical in many important physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. Three-dimensional Traction Microscopy (3DTM) is a tool to quantify cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement field in the ECM in response to these tractions, and then using this measurement to infer tractions. Most applications of 3DTM have assumed that the ECM has spatially-uniform mechanical properties, but cells secrete enzymes that can locally degrade the ECM. In this work, a novel computational method is developed to quantify both cellular tractions and ECM degradation. In particular, the ECM is modeled as a hyperelastic, Neo-Hookean solid, whose material parameters are corrupted by a single degradation parameter. The feasibility of determining both the traction and the degradation parameter is first demonstrated by showing the existence and uniqueness of the solution. An inverse problem is then formulated to determine the nodal values of the traction vector and the degradation parameter, with the objective of minimizing the difference between a predicted and measured displacement field, under the constraint that the predicted displacement field satisfies the equation of equilibrium. The inverse problem is solved by means of a gradient-based optimization approach, and the gradient is computed efficiently using appropriately derived adjoint fields. The computational method is validated in-silico using a geometrically realistic neuronal cell model and synthetic traction and degradation fields. It is found that the method accurately recovers both the traction and degradation fields. Moreover, it is found that neglecting ECM degradation can yield significant errors in traction measurements. Our method can extend the range of context where tractions can be appropriately measured.},

The pressure dependency for applications in soils is further considered using a hyperbolic yield function, and a regularized non-associative constitutive model is formulated. Numerically, the Jacobian matrix is obtained by linearizing the residual vector and a finite element procedure coupling both displacements and micro-variable is implemented. The applicability of the proposed methodology to capture strain softening response accompanied by localized shear bands is verified using two numerical examples, and the computed numerical solutions exhibit excellent mesh-independent results. The plastic dissipation analysis further verifies the ability of the proposed model to regularize ill-posed boundary value problems induced by material softening.

Conventional density-based topology optimization using the finite element method is a time-consuming approach, owing to the large model size and repeated function evaluations involved in the frequency response. To address this issue, an efficient topology optimization method that uses the hybrid finite element–wave based method is proposed in this paper. In this method, the entire problem domain is divided into design and non-design domains. The mixed displacement–pressure finite element method is applied to the design domain for material interpolation in the topology optimization. Moreover, the wave based method, which is an efficient numerical scheme for acoustic problems, is applied to the non-design domain to reduce the computational cost. A direct coupling approach is proposed to construct hybrid models for vibroacoustic problems. The adjoint variable method is also presented to compute the design sensitivities efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by benchmark problems. The optimization results indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computational cost, while maintaining almost identical optimized layouts to those obtained using the conventional approach.},

  abstract     = {In many applications, projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) have demonstrated the ability to provide rapid approximate solutions to high-fidelity full-order models (FOMs). However, there is no a priori assurance that these approximate solutions are accurate; their accuracy depends on the ability of the low-dimensional trial basis to represent the FOM solution. As a result, ROMs can generate inaccurate approximate solutions, e.g., when the FOM solution at the online prediction point is not well represented by training data used to construct the trial basis. To address this fundamental deficiency of standard model-reduction approaches, this work proposes a novel online-adaptive mechanism for efficiently enriching the trial basis in a manner that ensures convergence of the ROM to the FOM, yet does not incur any FOM solves. The mechanism is based on the previously proposed adaptive h h -refinement method for ROMs (carlberg, 2015), but improves upon this work in two crucial ways. First, the proposed method enables basis refinement with respect to any orthogonal basis (not just the Kronecker basis), thereby generalizing the refinement mechanism and enabling it to be tailored to the physics characterizing the problem at hand. Second, the proposed method provides a fast online algorithm for periodically compressing the enriched basis via an efficient proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, which does not incur any operations that scale with the FOM dimension. These two features allow the proposed method to serve as (1) a failsafe mechanism for ROMs , as the method enables the ROM to satisfy any prescribed error tolerance online (even in the case of inadequate training), and (2) an efficient online basis-adaptation mechanism , as the combination of basis enrichment and compression enables the basis to adapt online while controlling its dimension.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy for the topology optimization of structures made of discrete geometric components using the geometry projection method. Practical structures made of geometric shapes such as bars and plates typically exhibit low volume fractions with respect to the volume of the design region they occupy. To maintain an accurate analysis and to ensure well-defined sensitivities in the geometry projection, it is required that the element size is smaller than the smallest dimension of each component. For low-volume-fraction structures, this leads to finite element meshes with very large numbers of elements. To improve the efficiency of the analysis and optimization, we propose a strategy to adaptively refine the mesh and reduce the number of elements by having a finer mesh on the geometric components, and a coarser mesh away from them. The refinement indicator stems very naturally from the geometry projection and is thus straightforward to implement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AMR method by performing topology optimization for the design of minimum-compliance and stress-constrained structures made of bars and plates.},

Recently, an effective and efficient Reduced Order modeling method, namely Self-consistent Clustering Analysis (SCA), is proposed to solve the RVE problem. In this work, the curse of computational cost in woven RVE problem is countered using the SCA, which maintains a considerable accuracy compared with the standard Finite Element Method (FEM). The Hill anisotropic yield surface is predicted efficiently using the woven SCA, which can accelerate the microstructure optimization and design of woven composites. Moreover, a two-scale FEM × × SCA modeling framework is proposed for woven composites structure. Based on this framework, the complex behavior of the composite structures in macroscale can be predicted using microscale properties. Additionally, macroscale and mesoscale physical fields are captured simultaneously, which are hard, if not impossible, to observe using experimental methods. This will expedite the deformation mechanism investigation of composites. A numerical study is carried out for T-shaped hooking structures under cycle loading to illustrate these advantages.},

For the stochastic part of the SDD–IGA method, an innovative dimension-reduction integration technique is presented for efficiently calculating the expansion coefficients. Analytical formulae have been derived to calculate the second-moment properties of an SDD–IGA approximation for a general output random variable of interest. Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of a low-order SDD–IGA in efficiently delivering probabilistic solutions with an approximation quality as good as, if not better than, that obtained from a high-order polynomial dimensional decomposition.

An improved hybrid perturbation analysis (IHPA) method is formulated to estimate the expectation and stand variance of the objective function in the worst case. Combined with the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) framework, the robust designs of the structure and its composite material are carried out.

The method is steered by an a posteriori error estimator, which is computed with the aid of an auxiliary residual-like problem formulated onto a space spanned by splines with single element support. The local refinement of the basis is achieved thanks to the use of truncated hierarchical B-splines. We prove numerically the applicability of the proposed estimator to various engineering-relevant problems, namely the Poisson problem , linear elasticity and Kirchhoff–Love shells, formulated on trimmed geometries. In particular, we study several benchmark problems which exhibit both smooth and singular solutions , where we recover optimal asymptotic rates of convergence for the error measured in the energy norm and we observe a substantial increase in accuracy per-degree-of-freedom compared to uniform refinement.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel computational approach for SIMP-based Topology Optimisation (TO) of hyperelastic materials at large strains. During the TO process for structures subjected to very large deformations , and especially in the presence of intermediate density regions, the standard Newton-solver (or its arc length variant) have been reported not to converge (refer to References Wang et al. (2014), Lahuerta et al. (2013) and Liu et al. (2017)). In this paper, the new TO stabilisation technique proposed in Ortigosa et al. (2019) in the context of level-set TO, initially devised to alleviate numerical instabilities inherent to level-set TO, is extended for the TO by means of the SIMP method. The success of the methodology rests on the combination of two distinct key ingredients. First, the nonlinear equilibrium equations of motion for intermediate TO design stages are solved in a non-exact albeit consistent incrementally linearised fashion by splitting the design load into a number of load increments . Second, the resulting linearised tangent elasticity tensor is locally stabilised (regularised) in order to prevent its loss of positive definiteness and, thus, avoid the loss of convexity of the discrete tangent operator. This solution strategy is shown to be extremely robust in the context of density-based TO, where the constitutive law of the underlying evolving solid structure is a mixture of solid and void constituents, the latter classically defined by means of a fictitious strain energy. The robustness and applicability of this TO methodological approach are thoroughly demonstrated through an ample spectrum of challenging numerical examples , ranging from benchmark two-dimensional (plane stress) examples to larger scale three-dimensional applications. Crucially, the performance of all the final designs has been tested at a post-processing stage without adding any source of artificial stiffness. Specifically, an arc-length Newton–Raphson method has been employed in conjunction with a ratio of the material parameters for void and solid regions of 1 0 − 12 10−12 .},

Stable equilibria are calculated by minimizing the sum of the gravitational and elastic energies of the ribbon, under a developability constraint. Our algorithm compares favorably to standard shooting and collocation methods, as well as to experiments. It furthermore shows significant differences in behavior compared to numerical models for thin elastic rods, while yielding a substantial speed-up compared to a more general thin elastic shell simulator.

The proposed approach is able to fit general non-convex sets of target points (TPs) by extending the NURBS formalism to the N-dimensional (N-D) case. The shape of such a hyper-surface is tuned by several parameters: the number of control points (CPs), their coordinates and the related weights, the degrees of the blending functions and the knot-vector components defined along each direction. The goal of the proposed strategy is to automatically determine (i.e. without the user’s intervention) the full set of parameters defining the NURBS hyper-surface approximating a given set of TPs, without considering simplifying hypotheses. To this purpose, the problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear programming problem (CNLPP) wherein the optimization variables are all the parameters tuning the shape of the NURBS hyper-surface. Nevertheless, when the number of CPs and the degrees of the basis functions are included among the design variables, the resulting problem is defined over a space having a changing dimension. This problem is solved by means of an original genetic algorithm able to determine, simultaneously, the optimum value of both the design space size (related to the integer variables of the NURBS hyper-surface) and the NURBS hyper-surface continuous parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of two meaningful test cases. In addition, the proposed method has been applied to a benchmark taken from the literature and the results have been compared to those provided by the Proper Generalized Decomposition method.},

Two equivalent time-independent RBDOs are obtained based on the established two-stage optimization, and the key point is estimating the Minimum Performance Target Point (MPTP) in each stage. Two single optimization processes are constructed in T-SORA to efficiently estimate MPTPs in its two stages respectively. Two sequential single procedures are established in T-SLA to efficiently solve MPTPs and design parameter solutions in its two stages respectively, in which a new MPTP searching technique named Angle Descent Mean Value (ADMV) is proposed to approximate MPTP in each iteration. Furthermore, time-dependent reliability analysis is only required in the second stage, which will further improve the computational efficiency.

An adaptation of this problem to frictional contact is then solved for various friction coefficients and it is checked that the optimization algorithm indeed exploits the presence of friction for lowering the objective further. Secondly, we propose and demonstrate the use of a p p -norm based objective function to control the distribution and variation of contact pressure, on an a priori unknown area of contact, between a body of unknown topology and an obstacle. To have control over the contact pressure, a Lagrange multiplier based contact formulation is used within a coupled Newton solution, for imposing impenetrability, friction, and the corresponding complementarity conditions. The adjoint method is employed for deriving consistent design sensitivities for the mixed formulation involving both displacements and contact Lagrange multipliers. Through a series of numerical examples , it is demonstrated how an even distribution of contact pressure and crisp solid–void designs can be obtained for problems with and without friction.},

On the other hand, a reduced order technique e.g. proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) has been employed to get a fast numerical method and to decrease the elapsed CPU time. On the other hand, since the considered problem is fully nonlinear, thus in the reduced order model based on the POD idea, there are some nonlinear terms that they take more computational time . Hence, we employ the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) to overcome the nonlinear terms . Four test problems have been proposed to show the ability of the numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate modeling techniques such as polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) are widely used to simulate the behavior of manufactured and physical systems for uncertainty quantification. An inherent limitation of many surrogate modeling methods is their susceptibility to the curse of dimensionality, that is, the computational cost becomes intractable for problems involving a high-dimensionality of the uncertain input parameters. In the paper, we address the issue by proposing a novel surrogate modeling method that enables the solution of high dimensional problems. The proposed surrogate model relies on a dimension reduction technique, called sparse partial least squares (SPLS), to identify the projection directions with largest predictive significance in the PCE surrogate. Moreover, the method does not require (or even assume the existence of) a functional form of the distribution of input variables, since a data-driven construction, which can ensure that the polynomial basis maintains the orthogonality for arbitrary mutually dependent randomness, is applied to surrogate modeling. To assess the performance of the method, a detailed comparison is made with several well-established surrogate modeling methods. The results show that the proposed method can provide an accurate representation of the response of high-dimensional problems.},

Numerical discretization is performed using the Godunov-type finite-volume method in σ σ coordinates. An approximate Riemann solver is used for numerical flux evaluations. To efficiently and accurately resolve the wet–dry fronts, we propose a local 2D transition approach (i.e., switching from solving the three-dimensional shallow-water equations to solving the depth-averaged two-dimensional shallow-water equations) with using a rather small value of threshold water depth ( 1 × 1 0 − 6 m 1×10−6m ) to distinguish dry cells from the wet ones. A fully-implicit discretization method of the bed-friction terms is developed, which was originally proposed to solve the depth-averaged two-dimensional shallow-water equations. A series of benchmark tests are used to assess the performance of the numerical models, showing that the proposed model is well-balanced and robust to resolve violent free-surface flows. The local 2D transition approach is found to significantly reduce the computational time by one to three orders in a dam-break wave propagation test, and by about 1 ∕ 2 1∕2 – 2 ∕ 3 2∕3 in a breaking solitary wave runup test, compared with a same simulation without using this approach.},

Their computational effectiveness benefits from efficient FFT based algorithms as well as a favourable condition number . Here these kinds of methods are accelerated by low-rank tensor approximation techniques for a solution field using canonical polyadic, Tucker, and tensor train formats. This reduced order model also allows to efficiently compute suboptimal global basis functions without solving the full problem. It significantly reduces computational and memory requirements for problems with a material coefficient field that admits a moderate rank approximation. The advantages of this approach against those using full material tensors are demonstrated using numerical examples for the model homogenisation problem that consists of a scalar linear elliptic variational problem defined in two and three dimensional settings with continuous and discontinuous heterogeneous material coefficients. This approach opens up the potential of an efficient reduced order modelling of large scale engineering problems with heterogeneous material.},

  abstract     = {Most electromechanical cardiac models available in the literature are based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Despite FEM’s high accuracy, its performance is intrinsically dependent on the geometrical mesh quality onto which equations are discretized and solved. The construction and personalization of meshes representing the high complexity and inter-subject variability of anatomical structures such as the heart are often challenging and require tedious manual adjustments. Meshless methods are an interesting alternative to overcome meshing difficulties. The majority of meshless methods have been applied to simulate fluid dynamics problems but rarely in cardiac tissue electromechanics due to the lack of advanced numerical techniques to correct instabilities near the boundary conditions. In this paper, we propose a fully coupled model of cardiac electromechanics based on Total Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (TL-SPH). A zero-dimensional (0D) circulation model of hemodynamics was coupled to the 3D electromechanical model, linking ventricular volume changes along the cardiac cycle with pressures exerted on the endocardial surface of the heart. For calibration purposes, the proposed TL-SPH model was personalized to minimally invasive in vivo pressure measurements and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the left ventricle (LV) of a canine heart. The parameters of the electromechanics and hemodynamics models were estimated to fit LV volumetric and displacement data from MRI and available pressure signals in two phases: first, passive parameters based on diastolic data minimizing point-based differences between simulations and measurements; and, subsequently without any pressure information, active contraction and hemodynamics parameters based on volumetric and pressure data over the entire cardiac cycle. The TL-SPH model was able to reproduce pressure, volumetric and morphological indices from experimental measurements with good accuracy: end systolic / diastolic errors of 0.29 / 0.46 % and 1.82 / 4.18 % for maximal volume and pressure measurements, respectively. As this was achieved without the burden of mesh generation, the obtained results support the use of meshless methods as a valid alternative to standard FEM for cardiac electromechanical modeling, especially to assimilate point-based cardiac medical data.},

In an earlier paper Zhang et al. (2019), a Strongly Stable Generalized Finite Element Method (SSGFEM) was proposed to approximate solution of such problems. The method required two separate enrichment functions at O ( h − 1 ) O(h−1) number of nodes ( h h is the mesh parameter) and a local orthogonalization technique, requiring additional operations, was used to ensure its stability and robustness. In this paper, we present a simplified SSGFEM that does not require two enrichment functions at any of the nodes. As a result, we obtain an optimally converging GFEM that is stable, i.e., its scaled condition number is of the same order that of a standard FEM, and robust, i.e., the conditioning is independent of the position of meshes relative to the interface; these properties are illuminated by well-designed experiments. The simplified SSGFEM does not require LOT and requires less degrees of freedom, and is easier to implement, in contrast to the SSGFEM proposed in (Zhang et al., 2019). We also proved the optimal convergence for the simplified SSGFEM in this paper that required a more involved analysis based on a smart observation on approximation of weak singularities near the corner.},

The main goal is to minimise the computational footprint of the MOOD limiting approach by employing WENO schemes—by virtue of requiring a smaller number of cells to reduce their order of accuracy compared to an unlimited scheme. The key characteristic of the present relaxed MOOD formulation is that the Numerical Admissible Detector (NAD) is not uniquely defined for all orders of spatial accuracy, and it is relaxed when reaching a 2nd-order of accuracy. The augmented numerical schemes are applied to the 2D unsteady Euler equations for a multitude of test problems including the 2D vortex evolution, cylindrical explosion, double-Mach reflection, and an implosion. It is observed that in many events, the implemented MOOD paradigm manages to preserve symmetry of the forming structures in simulations, an improvement comparing to the non-MOOD limited counterparts which cannot be easily obtained due to the multi-dimensional reconstruction nature of the schemes.},

Assuming that the parametrization of the initial domain is bijective and that it is possible to find a locally invertible displacement field, the method yields a bijective parametrization of the target domain. We compute the displacement field by solving the equations of nonlinear elasticity with the neo-Hookean material law, and we show an efficient variation of the incremental loading algorithm tuned specifically to this application. In order to construct the initial domain, we simplify the target domain’s boundary by means of an L 2 L2 -projection onto a coarse basis and then apply the Coons patch approach. The proposed methodology is not restricted to a single patch scenario but can be utilized to construct multi-patch parametrizations with naturally looking boundaries between neighboring patches. We illustrate its performance and compare the result to other established parametrization approaches on a range of two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples.},

The proposed approach reduces the consideration of infeasible solutions by directly updating variable bounds with constraints, which is called the boundary update (BU) method. Two illustrative examples are used to explain the proposed approach, followed by applying it to mathematical and engineering constrained optimization problems. Finally, a surrogate-based problem and a large-dimensional and highly constrained problem are used to evaluate the BU method on these types of problems. The BU method is coupled with seven well-known evolutionary and mathematical optimization algorithms and the results show that the proposed BU method is a practical and effective approach and leads to better solutions with fewer function evaluations in nearly all cases, particularly for population-based optimization algorithms. This study should motivate optimization researchers and practitioners to pay more attention to the direct handling of constraints, rather than constraint handling by penalty or other fix-ups.},

A similar result holds for the high-order TecNO reconstruction. However, this does not prevent the numerical solution from developing negative partial densities or internal energy. Numerical experiments were performed on one-dimensional and two-dimensional interface and shock-interface problems. The present scheme exactly preserves stationary interfaces. On moving interfaces, it produces spurious pressure oscillations typically observed with conservative schemes (Karni, 1994). We find that these anomalies, which are not present in the single-component case, violate neither entropy stability nor a minimum principle of the specific entropy. Finally, we show that the scheme is able to reproduce the physical mechanisms of the two-dimensional shock-bubble interaction problem (Haas and Sturtevant, 1987; Quirk and Karni, 1996).},

  abstract     = {This work presents a multilevel approach to large-scale topology optimization accounting for linearized buckling criteria. The method relies on the use of preconditioned iterative solvers for all the systems involved in the linear buckling and sensitivity analyses and on the approximation of buckling modes from a coarse discretization . The strategy shows three main benefits: first, the computational cost for the eigenvalue analyses is drastically cut. Second, artifacts due to local stress concentrations are alleviated when computing modes on the coarse scale. Third, the ability to select a reduced set of important global modes and filter out less important local ones. As a result, designs with improved buckling resistance can be generated with a computational cost little more than that of a corresponding compliance minimization problem solved for multiple loading cases. Examples of 2D and 3D structures discretized by up to some millions of degrees of freedom are solved in Matlab to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, a post-processing procedure is suggested in order to reinforce the optimized design against local buckling.},

  abstract     = {Finding the best setup for experiments is the primary concern for Optimal Experimental Design (OED). Here, we focus on the Bayesian experimental design problem of finding the setup that maximizes the Shannon expected information gain . We use the stochastic gradient descent and its accelerated counterpart, which employs Nesterov’s method, to solve the optimization problem in OED. We adapt a restart technique, originally proposed for the acceleration in deterministic optimization, to improve stochastic optimization methods. We combine these optimization methods with three estimators of the objective function: the double-loop Monte Carlo estimator (DLMC), the Monte Carlo estimator using the Laplace approximation for the posterior distribution (MCLA) and the double-loop Monte Carlo estimator with Laplace-based importance sampling (DLMCIS). Using stochastic gradient methods and Laplace-based estimators together allows us to use expensive and complex models, such as those that require solving partial differential equations (PDEs). From a theoretical viewpoint, we derive an explicit formula to compute the gradient estimator of the Monte Carlo methods, including MCLA and DLMCIS. From a computational standpoint, we study four examples: three based on analytical functions and one using the finite element method . The last example is an electrical impedance tomography experiment based on the complete electrode model. In these examples, the accelerated stochastic gradient descent method using MCLA converges to local maxima with up to five orders of magnitude fewer model evaluations than gradient descent with DLMC.},

In this paper, based on the conventional Duffy transformation, a general algorithm for numerical integration of three-dimensional crack singularities is proposed for the vertex/edge singularity problems, which takes the integration cell shape into full consideration. Besides, the corresponding 3D conformal preconditioning strategy is constructed to fully eliminate the shape influence of tetrahedron elements. Extensive numerical examples , including ill-shaped integration cells and crack-front tetrahedron elements with parallel/nonparallel crack front, are given to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. As a result, for each crack-front element, several hundreds of Gauss points are sufficient to achieve the precision of 1 0 − 6 10−6 for both kernels 1 ∕ r 1∕r and 1 ∕ r 1∕r , in sharp contrast with around ten thousands of Gauss points using the conventional Duffy transformation.},

In order to tangibly illustrate this process, this work develops a framework for a specific model problem combining: (I) a meshless discrete element “submodel” that tracks the trajectory of airborne hot particles/embers, subject to prevailing wind velocities and updrafts, (II) a topographical “submodel” of the ambient combustible material whereby airborne embers that make contact are allowed to start secondary fires (if conditions are appropriate), combined with ground-based surface spread and burn rates for generating new embers, new updrafts (due to hot air), etc., and (III) a Machine-Learning Algorithm to rapidly ascertain the multi-submodel system parameters that force the overall model to match observations. The submodels compute both ground and airborne hot-ember driven fire propagation, as well as subsequent distribution of debris/soot, which is important for air-quality assessment. The overall framework is designed for use in digital twin technology, which refers to an adaptive digital replica of a physical system , whereby model updates are continuously in near real-time. This necessitates a rapid simulation paradigm that can easily interface with telecommunications, cameras and sensors.

It is observed that, when tackling real-world applications, unexpected problems arise and, therefore, theoretical studies only with manufactured solutions are not enough for a complete verification of a method. The chosen application reveals problems with certain quadratures and that some simple stabilization strategies cannot completely suppress hourglass modes. Additionally, the effects of quadrature rules on the total computational costs are demonstrated and the influence of the maximum stable time step is assessed using a highly demanding simulation.},

  abstract     = {Peridynamics is a continuum mechanics modelling method, which is emerging as a solution for – in particular – the modelling of brittle fracture . The inherent variability of brittle fracture is captured well by the Weibull distribution , which describes the probability of fracture of a given material at a given stress. Recreating a Weibull distribution in peridynamics involves adjusting for the fact that the body is made up of a large number of bonds, and the distribution of strengths associated with these bonds must be different to the distribution of strengths associated with the peridynamic body. In the local case, where the horizon ratio, m = 1 m=1 is used, Weibull’s original simple size scaling gives exact results, but the overlapping nature of non-local bonds that occurs in higher m cases, typically used in the peridynamics literature (such as m = 3 m=3 ), causes a significant distortion of Weibull distributions. The cause of these distortions is spurious toughening and partial component failures as a result of the reduced localisation associated with larger horizon ratios. In order to remove these distortions, appropriate size scaling is used for the bonds, and a methodology that is capable of reflecting the heterogeneity of the material in the model, is proposed. The methodology described means Weibull parameters measured at specimen or component level can be reproduced for higher values of m .},

To deal with the difficulties aroused from the growth and incompressibility of soft materials, a numerical scheme based on two multiplicative decompositions of deformation gradient is developed. For introducing the growth effect, the deformation gradient is decomposed into a growth tensor and an elastic deformation gradient. For circumventing the volumetric locking caused by incompressibility of soft materials, the elastic deformation gradient is further decomposed into its volume-preserving and volumetric-dilatational parts. Meanwhile, the volumetric-dilatational part is modified by a linear projection operator. Then, the incremental equations of the weak form are derived by an effective linearization method for this nonlinear problem . After introducing the discrete technique in isogeometric analysis, the formulations for numerical calculations , i.e., the stiffness matrices and the force vectors, are derived. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed isogeometric method are demonstrated by several examples discretized by the high-order NURBS elements exactly, including conic sections and other complex geometries . The proposed method is also proved to have great potentials for analyzing the mechanical behaviors of swellable soft materials as well as bionic structures and designing the bionic devices.},

This mechanical model is coupled with a poro-damage model where the permeability is increased as micro-cracks coalesce into macro-cracks. The crack opening computation during continuum damage is based on a local XFEM formulation without the need for a reference length in a strongly coupled hydro-mechanical formulation to update the uplift pressures. The 3D crack path computation is adapted from an analogy to the heat conduction problem to draw the envelope of the discontinuities’ tangent vector field.

  abstract     = {We propose a simulation-based decision strategy for the proactive maintenance of complex structures with a particular application to structural health monitoring (SHM). The strategy is based on a data-driven approach which exploits an offline–online decomposition. A synthetic dataset is constructed offline by solving a parametric time-dependent partial differential equation for multiple input parameters, sampled from their probability distributions of natural variation. The collected time-signals, extracted at sensor locations, are used to train classifiers at such sensor locations, thus constructing multiple databases of healthy configurations. These datasets are then used to train one class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVMs) to detect anomalies. During the online stage, a new measurement, possibly obtained from a damaged configuration, is evaluated using the classifiers. Information on damage is provided in a hierarchical manner: first, using a binary feedback, the entire structure response is either classified as inlier (healthy) or outlier (damaged). Then, for the outliers, we exploit the outputs of multiple classifiers to retrieve information both on the severity and the spatial location of the damages. Because of the large number of signals needed to construct the datasets offline, a model order reduction strategy is implemented to reduce the computational burden. We apply this strategy to both 2D and 3D problems to mimic the vibrational behavior of complex structures under the effect of an active source and show the effectiveness of the approach for detecting and localizing cracks.},

We design the lattices to extremize effective properties . As customary in topology optimization , we design a periodic unit cell of the lattice and obtain the effective properties via numerical homogenization. Each bar is represented as a cylindrical offset surface of a medial axis parameterized by the positions of the endpoints of the medial axis . These parameters are smoothly mapped onto a continuous density field for the primal and sensitivity analysis via the geometry projection method. A size variable per material is ascribed to each bar and penalized as in density-based topology optimization to facilitate the entire removal of bars from the design. During the optimization, we allow bars to be made of a mixture of the available materials. However, to ensure each bar is either exclusively made of one material or removed altogether from the optimal design , we impose optimization constraints that ensure each size variable is 0 or 1, and that at most one material size variable is 1. The proposed material interpolation scheme readily accommodates any number of materials. To obtain lattices with desired material symmetries, we design only a reference region of the unit cell and reflect its geometry projection with respect to the appropriate planes of symmetry. Also, to ensure bars remain whole upon reflection inside the unit cell or with respect to the periodic boundaries, we impose a no-cut constraint on the bars. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via numerical examples of bulk and shear moduli maximization and Poisson’s ratio minimization for two- and three-material lattices with cubic symmetry .},

  abstract     = {The application of unsteady inflow conditions represents an important aspect when scale resolving turbulence models are adopted in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses. In such context, with reference to Wind Engineering applications, the main concern is often represented by the generation of a synthetic velocity field representative of the turbulent fluctuations impinging on the studied body. Once such synthetic field has been generated, it is applied at the inflow patch. Unfortunately, such operation is not trivial: undesired pressure fluctuations are often generated due to the incompatibility between the applied inflow condition and the flow field found inside the computational domain. In this paper, a procedure able to guarantee a correct application of synthetically generated velocity fields to CFD simulations is described. The procedure, which relies on a variational background, is simple and can be readily implemented in existing codes. Numerical results confirm that, by adopting the proposed corrections, pressure fluctuations are strongly reduced, so confirming the soundness of the proposed approach. An OpenFoam implementation of the method is available for download at https://site.unibo.it/cwe-lamc/en .},

The correlated scales in the classical FE 2 method are here split to be computed sequentially and separately: the microscopic problems are calculated in advance to construct an offline material genome database, which is later used in the macroscopic data-driven analysis. In this new framework, the difficulties in formulating and solving complicated multiscale system are avoided by dealing with single scale problems. Moreover, the online computation of microscopic problems in classical FE 2 method is replaced by searching data points over the offline database resulting in a data-driven FE 2 method. Thus, the online computing efficiency of structural analysis is significantly improved.},

The key concept of the proposed study is based on the fact that physics models are governed by Partial Differential Equation (PDE), and its loading/response mapping can be solved using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Based on this, a special type of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed that takes advantage of our prior knowledge in physics to build data-driven models whose architectures are of physics meaning. This type of network is named as FEA-Net and is used to predict the mechanical response under external loading. Thus, the identification of mechanical system parameters and the computation of its responses are treated as the learning and inference of FEA-Net, respectively. Case studies on multi-physics (e.g., coupled mechanical–thermal analysis) and multi-phase problems (e.g., composite materials with random micro-structures) are used to demonstrate and verify the theoretical and computational advantages of the proposed method.},

However, higher order GFEM/XFEM with the properties (i)–(iii) have not been successfully addressed yet. Various enrichment schemes for GFEM/XFEM based on D D or D P k DPk ( D D is a distance function or the absolute value of level set function , and P k Pk is the polynomial basis of degree k k ) have been reported recently to obtain higher order convergence, but they are not stable or robust in general; in fact, they even may not yield the optimal orders of convergence. In this paper, we propose a stable GFEM/XFEM of degree 2 (SGFEM2) for the interface problems, where we used the enrichment scheme based on D { 1 , x , y } D{1,x,y} , instead of D D or D { 1 , x , y , x 2 , x y , y 2 } D{1,x,y,x2,xy,y2} in the literature. We prove that the SGFEM2 yields the optimal order of convergence, i.e., O ( h 2 ) O(h2) , for the interface problems with curved (smooth) interfaces. A local principal component analysis technique has been proposed, which ensures that the SGFEM2 is stable and robust. Numerical experiments for straight and curved interfaces have been presented to illuminate these properties.},

The global problem is the scale of the structure which is discretized with relative coarse meshes while the local problem is a subdomain of interest of the global problem where refined meshes can be used to simulate localized crack growth. The proposed method uses the converged nonlinear local problem solution as enrichment functions for the global problem which is considered linear with no need for an iterative procedure to solve it. The strategy is validated and compared with reference solutions and experimental results with crack propagation in mode I and mixed-mode conditions in monotonic tests of quasi-brittle materials. The results show that the method has the capability to transfer the kinematic effects and the damage state variable that occurs in the local problem to accurately predict the global structural behavior under the damage process. The proposed strategy demonstrated the capability to accurately predict the experimental crack paths and load–displacement curves with a reduced number of iterations and degrees of freedom in relation to the conventional finite element and generalized finite element methods.},

In the present study, we incorporate material interfacial stress constraints into topology optimization of bi-material structures. A multi-material level set method, in conjunction with interface-conforming finite element meshes, is employed to describe the distribution of different material phases and to capture the evolution of the material interfaces. The use of interface-conforming meshes enables accurate analysis of both interfacial stresses and their design sensitivities. Noting that the interfacial strength failure is usually characterized by a tension/compression asymmetric mechanism, we adopt an equivalent interfacial stress (which was originally proposed for strength criterion concerning composite delamination) expressed by the interface tensile and tangential stresses in the considered strength criterion. To handle the local nature of such interfacial stress constraints, we propose a global stress measure, which is an approximation of the p-norm of the equivalent interfacial stress field. An adjoint sensitivity analysis scheme is derived by taking into account the interface transmission conditions . To treat multiple constraints (the volume constraints and the interfacial stress constraint) in level set-based topology optimization, the velocity field-level set method is employed. Numerical examples are presented to show effectiveness of the present method. It is also shown that the tension/compression asymmetric interfacial strength criteria may lead to asymmetric designs.},

A set of physics-motivated modeling equations are developed to achieve the targets of domain decomposition , communication volume optimization and high-quality unstructured mesh generation simultaneously. A unified density field is defined as the target function for both partitioning the geometry and distributing the mesh-vertexes. A multi-phase Smoothing Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method is employed to solve the governing equations. All the optimization targets are achieved implicitly and consistently by the particle relaxation procedure without constructing triangulation/tetrahedralization explicitly. The target of communication reduction is achieved by introducing a surface tension model between distinct partitioning sub-domains, which are characterized by colored SPH particles. The resulting partitioning diagram features physically localized sub-domains and optimized interface communication. The target of optimizing the mesh quality is achieved by introducing a tailored equation-of-state (EOS) and a smooth isotropic kernel function . The mesh quality near the interface of neighboring sub-domains is improved by gradually removing the surface-tension force once a steady state is achieved. The proposed method is developed basing on a new parallel environment for multi-resolution SPH to exploit both coarse- and fine-grained parallelism . A set of benchmarks are conducted to verify that all the optimization targets are achieved consistently within the current framework.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the traditional decreasing tolerance continuation solid isotropic material with penalization (CSIMP) was extended by providing a way to adapt the penalty step between subproblems, decreasing the number of subproblems solved. Four linearly elastic, volume constrained, compliance minimization problems were used to test the efficacy of the penalty adaptation for different parameter settings. Three of the problems are common 2D test problems and one is 3D. The main factors affecting the efficacy of the penalty adaptation were identified. Experimental results confirmed that the penalty adaptation successfully reduces the number of finite element analysis (FEA) simulations needed to converge to the optimal solution when using the decreasing tolerance CSIMP (Dec-Tol CSIMP), with exponentially decaying tolerance. In particular, the number of FEA simulations required by Dec-Tol CSIMP was cut down by an average of 28.8% with no more than 4.1% increase in the objective value in the worst case. Finally, a mathematical and experimental treatment of the effect of x m i n on the convergence of the SIMP algorithm was given, with recommendations for choosing a suitable value for x m i n .},

  abstract     = {A new formulation is herein proposed to embed discrete fibres and cracks in finite elements . The main features of the fibre behaviour are automatically accounted for, including bond and snubbing effects. Fibres can interact with cracks and are modelled without the need for additional degrees of freedom. A comprehensive constitutive law directly models the two possible fibre failure modes : pull-out and tensile rupture. The bridging effect of fibres crossing active cracks follows a pull-out relation that depends on the current crack width, fibre orientation, relevant mechanical and geometric fibre properties, and quality of surrounding cement-based matrix. Fibres can be randomly positioned inside a structural member using a non-uniform distribution. The effect of crack openings is transmitted to the neighbouring material as rigid body movement. Numerical tests of material and structural scale are simulated to assess the performance of the technique. The model is shown to adequately simulate the complete behaviour of the members without the need for fitting material parameters to capture complex failure mechanisms. The model is also used for a rational justification about the loss of ductility when fibres are used in concrete beams flexurally reinforced with small amounts of longitudinal reinforcement.},

In the linear case, treated in this paper, direct linear relationships can be established between a reduced number of parameters describing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the subdomains boundaries and the degrees of freedom of a coarse mesh. The problem associated with the coarse mesh can be solved in one iteration and allows reconstructing the fine mesh solution in all subdomains.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the frame-invariance (and the lack thereof) exhibited in simulated anisotropic elasto-plastic responses generated from supervised machine learning of classical multi-layer and informed-graph-based neural networks , and proposes different remedies to fix this drawback. The inherent hierarchical relations among physical quantities and state variables in an elasto-plasticity model are first represented as informed, directed graphs , where three variations of the graph are tested. While feed-forward neural networks are used to train path-independent constitutive relations (e.g., elasticity), recurrent neural networks are used to replicate responses that depends on the deformation history, i.e. or path dependent. In dealing with the objectivity deficiency, we use the spectral form to represent tensors and, subsequently, three metrics, the Euclidean distance between the Euler Angles , the distance from the identity matrix , and geodesic on the unit sphere in Lie algebra , can be employed to constitute objective functions for the supervised machine learning. In this, the aim is to minimize the measured distance between the true and the predicted 3D rotation entities. Following this, we conduct numerical experiments on how these metrics, which are theoretically equivalent, may lead to differences in the efficiency of the supervised machine learning as well as the accuracy and robustness of the resultant models. Neural network models trained with tensors represented in component form for a given Cartesian coordinate system are used as a benchmark. Our numerical tests show that, even given the same amount of information and data, the quality of the anisotropic elasto-plasticity model is highly sensitive to the way tensors are represented and measured. The results reveal that using a loss function based on geodesic on the unit sphere in Lie algebra together with an informed, directed graph yield significantly more accurate rotation prediction than the other tested approaches.},

The proposed computational method guarantees the smoothness of the foliation and the orthogonality between each pair of leaves from different foliations. Moreover, it minimizes the number of singularities to theoretical lower bound and produces the tensor product structure as globally as possible. This method is ideal for the physical realization of woven surface structures on a variety of applications, including wearable electronics , sheet metal craft, architectural designs , and conformal woven composite parts in the automotive and aircraft industries.

  abstract     = {Morphoelasticity is a framework commonly employed to describe tissue growth. Its central premise is the decomposition of the deformation gradient into the product of a growth tensor and an elastic tensor. In this paper we present a 2D finite element method to solve compressible morphoelasticity problems in arterial cross sections. The arterial wall is composed of three layers: the intima, media and adventitia. The intima is allowed to grow isotropically while the areas of the media and adventitia are approximately conserved. All three layers are modeled as Holzapfel–Gasser–Ogden type anisotropic hyperelastic materials with different mechanical parameters. This paper consists of three main contributions. First, a new energy functional that underpins the finite element method for morphoelasticity is presented. The bulk energy is associated with elastically deforming grown elements, rather than elements in the reference configuration which is the usual practice in classical hyperelasticity. A surface energy describes live pressure loading through a lumen blood pressure. We derive the equivalent weak form and show that stationary points correspond to the usual boundary value problem for mechanical equilibrium. Second, we present the details of a displacement-based morphoelastic finite element method. The primary variable for our method is the deformation, which we separate into two groups (horizontal and vertical deformations). We arrive at a system of nonlinear algebraic equations that are organized into self-contained blocks which can be assembled independently. We present a method to compute the Jacobian of this system which is fed into a Newton algorithm. The direction of collagen fibers in each layer is computed off-line by interpolating tangent vectors from nearby boundaries and a minimum norm solution for the grown and deformed artery is found by the QR factorization. This single-field approach produces reasonable numerical results, although the locking phenomenon is clearly present. For axisymmetric meshes, our position and stress fields are validated by the solution obtained from solving a system of ordinary differential equations. Finally, we use the code to simulate intimal thickening in pseudo-realistic arterial cross sections. We find that (i) Oscillations in the lumen-intima interface are unstable and amplify with growth (ii) Glagov remodeling occurs with lumen area initially increasing and then decreasing with growth and (iii) Maximum stresses migrate from the lumen-intima interface to the media-intima interface so that the media eventually bears the maximum stress.},

  abstract     = {Solving wave problems with isogeometric analysis has attracted a significant attention in the past few years. It is well known that keeping a fixed number of degrees of freedom per wavelength leads to an increased error as higher wavenumbers are considered. This behaviour often cited as the pollution error, improves significantly with isogeometric analysis when compared to the conventional finite element method . The improvement in handling pollution along with the ability to represent exact geometries has been the main reasons behind the attention that isogeometric analysis has received. Furthermore, using high order elements also presents major advantages over low order elements for this range of frequencies. However, it remains to be studied how iterative linear solvers, often necessary for solving high frequency wave problems, perform when using isogeometric analysis compared to the finite element method especially at high polynomial orders . This paper is one of the first studies in this direction. In this work we investigate the Generalised Minimal Residual method, a standard Krylov subspace iterative technique , for solving the linear system resulting form isogeometric analysis. Furthermore, we look into the use of some recently proposed preconditioners for Helmholtz problem, such as shifted Laplace or ILU with a complex shift preconditioners and how they perform with high order isogeometric analysis and finite element method . In general the results show improvement when using isogeometric analysis in terms of the number of iterations required for convergence compared to the finite element method for both preconditioned and non-preconditioned linear systems. We use eigenvalue spectra to understand this improvement.},

To solve the optimization problem, we present an efficient design variable update scheme, which we have derived in the context of the Zhang–Paulino–Ramos (ZPR) update scheme by Zhang et al. (2018). The new update scheme has the ability to solve non-self-adjoint topology optimization problems with an arbitrary number of volume constraints, which can be imposed either to a subset of the candidate materials, or to sub-regions of the design domain, or to a combination of both. We present several examples that explore the ability of the formulation to obtain candidate Pareto fronts and to design support structures for additive manufacturing. Enabled by the ZPR update scheme, we are able to control the complexity and the length scale of the support structures by means of regional volume constraints.},

  abstract     = {Physics-constrained data-driven computing is an emerging hybrid approach that integrates universal physical laws with data-driven models of experimental data for scientific computing. A new data-driven simulation approach coupled with a locally convex reconstruction, termed the local convexity data-driven (LCDD) computing, is proposed to enhance accuracy and robustness against noise and outliers in data sets in the data-driven computing. In this approach, for a given state obtained by the physical simulation, the corresponding optimum experimental solution is sought by projecting the state onto the associated local convex manifold reconstructed based on the nearest experimental data. This learning process of local data structure is less sensitive to noisy data and consequently yields better accuracy. A penalty relaxation is also introduced to recast the local learning solver in the context of non-negative least squares that can be solved effectively. The reproducing kernel approximation with stabilized nodal integration is employed for the solution of the physical manifold to allow reduced stress–strain data at the discrete points for enhanced effectiveness in the LCDD learning solver. Due to the inherent manifold learning properties, LCDD performs well for high-dimensional data sets that are relatively sparse in real-world engineering applications. Numerical tests demonstrated that LCDD enhances nearly one order of accuracy compared to the standard distance-minimization data-driven scheme when dealing with noisy database, and a linear exactness is achieved when local stress–strain relation is linear.},

Flows around a spanned marine pipeline at a subcritical Reynolds number 1 . 31 × 1 0 4 1.31×104 have been computed. The hydrodynamic forces are compared to the published experimental data by a PIV and numerical results by a RANS and a classical LES. Although the magnitude of the predicted hydrodynamic forces are over-predicted compared to the experimental data, they are in good agreement with those obtained by the classical LES. The effect of the gap distance between the cylinder and the seabed on the hydrodynamic forces are analyzed. It is found that the drag coefficients and the root-mean-square of the lift coefficients decrease as the gap distance decreases. The flow characteristics around the spanned pipeline are examined. It is demonstrated that the proximity of the cylinder to the seabed severely affects the wake flow of the cylinder, and that the vortex shedding is suppressed as G ∕ D &lt; 0 . 3 G∕D&amp;lt;0.3 , which is in agreement with the experimental and other numerical results. The pressure distributions along the seabed appear to coincide with the experimental data. It is significant that the present method results in more reliable shear stresses (friction velocities) along the seabed than the RANS, which is very important for the research of the sediment transportation.},

  abstract     = {We consider in this paper numerical approximations of a melt-convective phase-field dendritic solidification model. A challenging numerical issue for solving this model is how to develop efficient time marching schemes that are not only unconditionally energy stable, but also linear and totally decoupled since the model is a highly coupled nonlinear system . We solve this issue by combining the modified projection scheme for the Navier–Stokes equations, the stabilized-Invariant Energy Quadratization method for the anisotropic phase field equation. Meanwhile, in order to obtain the fully decoupled feature, we introduce an auxiliary intermediate temperature variable to decouple the computation of the temperature from the phase field variable . We prove the unconditional energy stability of the developed scheme and further present various numerical simulations in 2D and 3D to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the developed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Auxetic composites, a kind of rationally artificial materials, possess superior multifunctional properties due to a mixture of materials. In this paper, an Isogeometric Topology Optimization (ITO) method is proposed for computational design of both the re-entrant and chiral auxetic composites in both 2D and 3D. The homogenization is numerically implemented using isogeometric analysis (IGA) to predict macroscopic effective properties of microstructures, where the periodic boundary formulation is imposed. An effective Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS)-based Multi-Material Interpolation (N-MMI) model is applied to compute material properties of all points in composite microstructures, mainly including the Fields of Design Variables (DVFs), Fields of Topology Variables (TVFs), and multi-material interpolation. A unified ITO formulation is developed for 2D and 3D auxetic composites, where an appropriate objective function with a weight parameter is defined to control the generation of different deformation mechanisms . Finally, several numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ITO method, and a series of 2D and 3D auxetic composites with the re-entrant and chiral deformation mechanisms are found. The optimized composite structures are simulated using ANSYS to show the auxetic behavior.},

In FS-DEM, Fourier series-based particle geometric description and coordinate representation are introduced, where particle shapes are implicitly determined by FS coefficients , which remain constant and are independent of particle positions or kinematics. Using the FS-based particle representation, contact detection and resolution algorithms are then developed to identify contacts and resolve contact geometric features . The FS-DEM method is completed with recourse to conventional contact behavior, laws of motion, and movement integration. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the FS-DEM framework are evaluated via three numerical examples and compared with the Overlapping Discrete Element Cluster-based DEM method. Results demonstrate the robust and superior performance of the FS-DEM method and its potential for efficient computational modeling of irregular-shaped particle systems.},

In this article we explain in which sense reduced constitutive models can be expressed as minimization problems , helping to formulate the global equilibrium as a single optimization problem . Casting the problem this way has implications from the mathematical and numerical points of view, naturally defining error indicators.

We also show that local splitting is applicable to simple multi-patch problems. For these problems, we obtain results closer to the reference solution, despite using less control points. We also use the custom-designed enrichment function to simulate the folding and wrinkling of clothes without changing mesh. In addition, a discontinuous enrichment function can be used to express cutting cloth.

Using this intermediate interface as the master face, a dual mortar method can be formulated by discretizing Lagrange multipliers on the subdomain interfaces using dual basis functions. Furthermore, the computational cost is minimized by static condensation of Lagrange multipliers and elimination of displacement unknowns on subdomain interfaces. Owing to the three-field formulation, the presented method is free of master/slave bias and can handle the cross corner problem naturally. The stability condition for the intermediate interface mesh is investigated by theoretical analysing and numerical modelling. Numerical tests show that the presented method has optimal convergence rate and allows great flexibility in mesh preparation.},

  abstract     = {A multiscale approach to investigate the influence of the grain boundary (GB) lattice structures on the dynamic intergranular failure in 3 D 3D polycrystalline materials is proposed. The model comprises the meso- and atomistic scales using the boundary element method (BEM) and molecular dynamics (MD), respectively. At the mesoscale, stochastic grain morphologies, random crystalline orientations and initial defects are included in the physical model. Moreover, a dynamic high-rate load is imposed to produce dynamic stress and strain waves propagating throughout the polycrystal, inducing the material to be susceptible to fail. The intergranular failure is governed by the critical energy density for shear and cleavage modes, evaluated from a set of nano GBs at the atomistic scale. The novelty is the assessment of the energy density considering its dependency on the interface lattice, leading to a group of failure criteria distributed along the aggregate. The difference in the order of magnitude between these length scales is a challenge for the transition multiscale model. Hence, an asymptotic scaling methodology is adapted for bridging the mechanical strength. Finally, it is worth noting that the level of detail of this criterion, is a remarkable enhancement over other intergranular failure models.},

When it comes to the selection of infill point, we not only maximize the well-known Expected Improvement but also evaluate the Approximate Probability of Stationary Point as a “double-check” step. Then the infill decision is made according to the extent of consistency between these two quantities. Furthermore, to examine whether the optimization process will gain from sparing more costs for response evaluation, we investigate also the cases that the gradient evaluation step is conditionally skipped in some iterations. Three new infill criteria are proposed and experimented with three analytical test functions and an airfoil optimal shape design.

Despite MPM’s advantages for such problems, some aspects of current contact methods are prone to instabilities. The main causes of instabilities are errors in the methods used to calculate normal vector and material separation. This paper presents new methods for these tasks by applying logistic regression to material point clouds contributing to each contact node. The new logistic regression process determines the most probable plane between two materials and finds their separation. The separation calculation explicitly accounts for particle deformation for increased accuracy in large deformation problems. Another improvement to multimaterial MPM is to do contact mechanics corrections twice each time step — first after initial velocity extrapolation to the grid and second after updating grid momenta. Two corrections are needed to find the correct acceleration when updating particle velocities and to extend methods that filter null-space noise to account for contact mechanics. Several examples validate the new methods and demonstrate their advantages over prior methods.},

On the theoretical level, this condition is natural since the size of the phase field layer, around the crack, itself scales like the internal length; on the numerical level, it should be satisfied by local h h -refinement. Technically, convergence holds in the sense of Γ Γ -convergence, with respect to the strong topology of L 1 L1 , while the sharp crack energy is defined in G S B D 2 GSBD2 . The constraint on the phase field to take values in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] is taken into account both in the Sobolev setting and in the iso-geometric setting; in the latter, it requires a special treatment since the projection operator on the space of tensor product B B -splines is not Lagrangian (i.e., interpolatory).},

  abstract     = {In this paper a new collocation technique for constructing time-dependent absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) applicable to elastic wave motion is devised. The approach makes use of plane waves which satisfy the governing equations of motion to construct the absorbing boundary conditions. The plane waves are adjusted so that they can cope with the satisfaction of radiation boundary conditions. The proposed technique offers some advantages and exhibits the following features: it is easy to implement; its approximation scheme is local in space and time and thus it does not deal with any routine schemes such as Fourier and Laplace transform, making the method computationally less demanding; as the employed basis functions used to construct the absorbing boundary condition are residual-free, it requires neither any differential operator (to approximate the wave dispersion relation), nor any auxiliary variables; it constructs Dirichlet-type ABCs and hence no derivatives of the field variables are required for the imposition of radiation conditions. In this study, we apply the proposed technique to the solution procedure of a collocation approach based on the finite point method which proceeds in time by an explicit velocity-Verlet algorithm. It contributes to developing a consistent meshless framework for the solution of unbounded elastodynamic problems in time domain. We also apply the proposed method to a standard finite element solver. The performance of the method in solution of some 2D examples is examined. We shall show that the method exhibits appropriate results, conserves the energy almost exactly, and it performs stably in time even in the case of long-term computations.},

This study proposes a method for dynamic topology optimization problems considering natural frequencies using successively executed iterations for the structural analysis and design. By using the Rayleigh quotients as approximations of the natural frequencies and achieving sequential approximation of the eigenpairs through inverse iteration-like procedures to improve the eigenvectors along with the topological evolution of the structure, the method avoids solving the time-consuming eigenvalue problem in each design iteration . This makes the method particularly suitable for large-scale frequency-constrained topology optimization problems. The convergence property of the method is analyzed under the assumption of sufficiently small design changes between two successive design iterations. Numerical examples regarding frequency and frequency gap constraints show that this method is able to realize concurrent convergence of the eigenvalue analysis and design optimization, and is more efficient than the conventional double-loop approach.},

  abstract     = {The Helmholtz equation is notoriously difficult to solve with standard numerical methods , increasingly so, in fact, at higher frequencies. Controllability methods instead transform the problem back to the time-domain, where they seek the time-harmonic solution of the corresponding time-dependent wave equation. Two different approaches are considered here based either on the first or second-order formulation of the wave equation. Both are extended to general boundary-value problems governed by the Helmholtz equation and lead to robust and inherently parallel algorithms . Numerical results illustrate the accuracy, convergence and scalability of controllability methods for the solution of high frequency Helmholtz equations with up to a billion unknowns on massively parallel architectures .},

  abstract     = {5 α α -reductase inhibitors are regarded as a promising chemoprevention strategy to reduce the incidence and delay the progression of prostate cancer. Landmark clinical trials have shown the chemopreventive potential of these drugs, but they appear to be mostly effective in mild tumors and have also been correlated with a higher prevalence of advanced prostate cancer. Hence, the use of 5 α α -reductase inhibitors for prostate cancer chemoprevention has become a controversial issue. The effects of these drugs on prostate cancer growth remain incompletely understood, but they are thought to promote apoptosis in the tumor. Additionally, 5 α α -reductase inhibitors induce global prostate shrinkage, which decreases the tumor-inhibiting effect of the mechanical stress accumulated in prostatic tissue due to common prostate enlargement with age. Thus, the competition between this mechanical effect and apoptotic upregulation may explain the controversial outcomes of 5 α α -reductase inhibitors on prostate cancer. Here, we extend our mechanically-coupled model of prostate cancer growth by including the mechanical and apoptotic action of 5 α α -reductase inhibitors and explore their combined effect on an aggressive tumor in silico . Our simulations show that the apoptotic boost dominates in the first months of therapy but the long-term outcome of 5 α α -reductase inhibitors depends on its competition with a decrease in hydrostatic stress caused by prostate shrinkage, which favors tumor growth. By combining moderate or strong prostate shrinkage with mild or intense apoptotic upregulation, our simulations show different tumor growth dynamics ranging from long-term inhibition of prostate cancer growth to rapidly growing large tumors, which may evolve towards advanced disease. Thus, our proposed mechanism for the action of 5 α α -reductase inhibitors may contribute to resolve the controversy around the use of these drugs for chemoprevention and to gain insight on prostate cancer dynamics during its use. The computational technology used herein could also assist physicians to monitor prostatic tumors during 5 α α -reductase inhibitor therapy and enable the early identification of responders from non-responders in a patient-specific manner.},

Overlapping domain techniques have been introduced as a way to combine the fluid–solid mesh conformity, seen in moving-mesh methods, without the need for mesh smoothing or re-meshing, which is a core characteristic of fixed mesh approaches. In this work, we introduce a novel overlapping domain method based on a partition of unity approach. Unified function spaces are defined as a weighted sum of fields given on two overlapping meshes. The method is shown to achieve optimal convergence rates and to be stable for steady-state Stokes, Navier–Stokes, and ALE Navier–Stokes problems. Finally, we present results for FSI in the case of 2D flow past an elastic beam simulation. These initial results point to the potential applicability of the method to a wide range of FSI applications, enabling boundary layer refinement and large deformations without the need for re-meshing or user-defined stabilization.},

Explicit discretization of the layers is computationally impractical except for very small domains, while homogenized material models cannot account for stress and strain variations and partition through the thickness. The new formulation allows for calculation of the transverse and interlayer stresses based on the material properties of the individual cell layers.

To validate and show the efficiency of the proposed SPH model, the results from our simulation at specific conditions were compared with experimental measurements and results from commercial software packages. Furthermore, the new SPH model is utilized to simulate the effects of heat flux variation, down-flowing velocity and thickness of water film on temperature distribution of glass during fire. The developed SPH model is well able to describe glass cooling under different conditions. The computational results show that the rate of cooling increases when velocity or thickness of down-flowing water film increases. However, the glass temperature increases when heat flux increases.},

We formulated a numerical model for coupling chemical damage and mechanical damage defined based on the diffusive phase-field fracture method. Furthermore, the chemical damage is linked to the change in porosity due to dissolution. The developed theoretical framework was numerically implemented and applied to subsurface undergoing calcite dissolution due to exposure to CO 2 2 , as a real-world example where understanding chemo-mechanical damage is crucial. The chemical damage assists mechanical damage obtained from phase-field in degradation of the material. This application of the phase-field method to subsurface rocks demonstrates its ability to predict chemo-mechanical coupling, and to quantify the impact of chemical alteration on fracture behavior.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and modeling the interface behavior is an important task for predicting materials response in various applications. To formulate the behavior of an arbitrary interface, one needs to construct the relation between acting tractions and displacement jumps at the interface. In addition to capturing the correct physics of the interface, the so-called traction–separation relation must also be thermodynamically consistent and satisfy the basic balance laws. Apart from many attempts in the literature to address these issues, a new and simple method to capture the complex mechanical behavior at an arbitrary interface is proposed. The new formulation is based on introducing a new quantity called “traction density”. As a result, the traction–separation relation for any arbitrary interface is automatically computed by integrating the traction density over the interface. The traction density can be formulated based on understandings and observations from lower scales. As will be shown, the mathematical representation of the traction density is relatively simple and therefore its consistency can be verified easily. When it comes to the grain boundary (GB) behavior, the proposed methodology is able to represent not only intergranular fracture but also grain boundary sliding . For calibration and verification of the model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for aluminum Σ 5 Σ5 GB are utilized. Interestingly, the calculations from current MD simulations show size-dependent behavior for the GB. By introducing a healing parameter in the new interface model, it is now possible to explain and predict possible GB size-dependent behavior.},

  abstract     = {Computational biomechanics plays an important role in biomedical engineering : using modeling to understand pathophysiology, treatment and device design. While experimental evidence indicates that the mechanical response of most tissues is viscoelastic, current biomechanical models in the computational community often assume hyperelastic material models. Fractional viscoelastic constitutive models have been successfully used in literature to capture viscoelastic material response; however, the translation of these models into computational platforms remains limited. Many experimentally derived viscoelastic constitutive models are not suitable for three-dimensional simulations. Furthermore, the use of fractional derivatives can be computationally prohibitive, with a number of current numerical approximations having a computational cost that is O ( N T 2 ) O(NT2) and a storage cost that is O ( N T ) O(NT) ( N T NT denotes the number of time steps). In this paper, we present a novel numerical approximation to the Caputo derivative which exploits a recurrence relation similar to those used to discretize classic temporal derivatives, giving a computational cost that is O ( N T ) O(NT) and a storage cost that is fixed over time. The approximation is optimized for numerical applications , and an error estimate is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the method. The method, integrated into a finite element solid mechanics framework, is shown to be unconditionally stable in the linear viscoelastic case. It was then integrated into a computational biomechanical framework, with several numerical examples verifying the accuracy and computational efficiency of the method, including in an analytic test, in an analytic fractional differential equation , as well as in a computational biomechanical model problem.},

  abstract     = {Advanced transition elements are of utmost importance in many applications of the finite element method (FEM) where a local mesh refinement is required. Considering problems that exhibit singularities in the solution, an adaptive hp -refinement procedure must be applied. Even today, this is a very demanding task especially if only quadrilateral/hexahedral elements are deployed and consequently the hanging nodes problem is encountered. These element types, are, however, favored in computational mechanics due to the improved accuracy compared to triangular/tetrahedral elements. Therefore, we propose a compatible transition element – x N y -element – which provides the capability of coupling different element types. The adjacent elements can exhibit different element sizes, shape function types, and polynomial orders . Thus, it is possible to combine independently refined h - and p -meshes. The approach is based on the transfinite mapping concept and constitutes an extension/generalization of the pNh -element concept. By means of several numerical examples , the convergence behavior is investigated in detail, and the asymptotic rates of convergence are determined numerically. Overall, it is found that the proposed approach provides very promising results for local mesh refinement procedures.},

  abstract     = {The present work aims at developing a new flexible computational framework to simulate macro and microscale two-phase flows with dynamic boundaries. Such a technique is extremely useful for periodic and very large domains which requires exhaustive computational resources , consequently reducing the required numerical domain. In this article an interface tracking Finite Element (FE) method is used to solve the equations governing the motion of two immiscible incompressible fluids in the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework (ALE). The equations are written in axisymmetric coordinates, however the proposed moving boundary technique can be easily extended to 3-dimensional flows and other methods using the ALE framework such as the finite volume method . The two-phase interface separating the fluids is a subset of the domain mesh, therefore a layer of zero thickness is achieved assuring sharp transition of properties among phases. At the scale of interest, surface tension plays an important role and is thus considered in the flow equations. Several validations and results are presented for gravity dominated problem, including the sessile drop test and rising of spherical and Taylor bubbles, as well as the divergent and sinusoidal channels, showing accuracy for modeling two-phase flows in large and periodic domains.},

  abstract     = {Thin-walled shells with cutouts are widely used as primary structures in the aerospace field. The mechanical analysis of shell structures using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method often needs very fine meshes to achieve a high-fidelity simulation. The advent of isogeometric analysis (IGA) method provides an alternative, yet efficient and accurate means to model complex shell structures with cutouts. In this paper, the trimmed surface analysis (TSA) method is applied in IGA to perform the trimmed elements integration of linear buckling analysis of shell structures. In the shape optimization process, the analytical formulae for the design sensitivities of IGA based shell buckling model are derived, and the sensitivity propagation from the design model to the analysis model is computed using a h -refinement method. Moreover, a novel smart design domain (SDD) method is proposed and implemented to reduce the number of design variables and further enhance the shape optimization efficiency, substantially. SDD can provide useful reference information to guide the selection of control points as design variables. Later, the comparison of optimization examples approve that the SDD method can provide a very efficient means to perform the local shape optimization for the complex shells. Finally, a multi-level progressive optimization framework based on the SDD method is developed, in which the design model and the analysis model are separated and implemented independently. In doing so, the design model is able to provide enough parameterization for optimization, and, in the meantime, the analysis model ensures efficiency and accuracy for simulation. Finally, the numerical examples on the buckling analysis and optimization of complex shells with cutouts demonstrate the greatly improved capacity and efficiency of the design framework proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a generic framework to construct 3D structured volumetric meshes of complicated geometry and arbitrary topology. Structured meshes are well-suited for reduced order model applications with geometric parameters . For that purpose, we use the triangulated solid 3D model’s boundary provided from B-Rep CAD (Boundary-Representation in Computer Aided Design) models. The input triangulated mesh is decomposed into a set of cuboids in two steps: pants decomposition and cuboid decomposition. Both segmentations understand the geometry and features of meshes. Cuboid decomposition splits a surface into a set of quadrilateral patches which can define a volumetric layout of the associated boundary surface. Using aligned global parameterization, patches of the cuboid decomposition are re-positioned on the surface in a way to achieve low overall distortion, and alignment to principal curvature directions and sharp features. The optimization process is thought to design cross fields with topological and geometrical constraints. Using the optimized cuboid decomposition, a volumetric layout is extracted. Based on the global parameterization and the structured volumetric layout previously computed, a 3D volumetric parameterization is deducted. For different geometrical instances with the same topology but different geometries, the proposed method allows to have the same representation: 3D volumetric isotopological meshes holding the same connectivity. MEG-IsoHex method is introduced to compare fields on 3D hexahedral meshes. The efficiency and the robustness of the proposed approach are illustrated through a remeshing case for large deformations and reduced order models using isogeometric analysis.},

  abstract     = {Crack initiation and propagation simulation is crucial for the safety and integrity assessment of structures. Though to this problem great efforts have been devoted and great advances have been made in both theory and numerical implementation, challenges still exist. To this end, inspired by the peridynamics and the unified phase-field method, in the present paper a novel nonlocal macro-meso-scale consistent damage model is proposed to simulate fracture process without prescribed initial crack and potential crack path. In this method, a meso-scale damage is firstly defined in terms of the stretch rate of bonds of material points. Then the macro-scale topologic damage is evaluated as the weighted averaging of meso-scale damage over bonds in the influence domain. Through the energetic degradation function, which connects the energy-based damage and the macro-scale topologic damage, the above damage model is inserted into the framework of irreversible thermodynamics consistent continuum damage mechanics . Numerical algorithms by the finite element discretization are elaborated. Three examples, including the Mode I and Mixed-Mode cracking simulation, are studied. It is shown that the proposed method can capture not only the crack pattern but also the load-deformation curves quantitatively. Moreover, there is no mesh sensitivity. Computationally, the proposed method belongs to the smeared crack modeling. The proposed method is presently limited to quasi-static crack modeling of isotropic quasi-brittle materials. The extension to anisotropic materials and dynamic crack modeling is possible and shall be studied in the future.},

  abstract     = {Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental to model different phenomena in science and engineering mathematically. Solving them is a crucial step towards a precise knowledge of the behavior of natural and engineered systems. In general, in order to solve PDEs that represent real systems to an acceptable degree, analytical methods are usually not enough. One has to resort to discretization methods. For engineering problems, probably the best-known option is the finite element method (FEM). However, powerful alternatives such as mesh-free methods and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) are also available. The fundamental idea is to approximate the solution of the PDE by means of functions specifically built to have some desirable properties. In this contribution, we explore Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as an option for approximation. They have shown impressive results in areas such as visual recognition. DNNs are regarded here as function approximation machines. There is great flexibility to define their structure and important advances in the architecture and the efficiency of the algorithms to implement them make DNNs a very interesting alternative to approximate the solution of a PDE. We concentrate on applications that have an interest for Computational Mechanics. Most contributions explore this possibility have adopted a collocation strategy. In this work, we concentrate on mechanical problems and analyze the energetic format of the PDE. The energy of a mechanical system seems to be the natural loss function for a machine learning method to approach a mechanical problem. In order to prove the concepts, we deal with several problems and explore the capabilities of the method for applications in engineering.},

A staggered operator-split solver is used where both the balance of linear momentum and the phase field governing equations are formulated in the periodic domain. The unit phase field of the initial failure region is prescribed by the penalty method to alleviate the sharp material contrast between the initial failure region and the base material. The discrete frequency vectors are generalized to estimate the second and fourth order gradients such that the Gibbs effect near shape interfaces or jump conditions can be suppressed. Furthermore, a preconditioner is adopted to improve the convergence rate of the iterative linear solver. Three numerical experiments are used to systematically compare the performance of the FFT-based method in the multi-phase-field and high-order phase-field frameworks.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a level set-based topology optimization procedure to design compliant mechanisms subject to local stress constraints. A classical technical difficulty related to the design of compliant mechanisms is the emergence of non-realistic flexible joints (hinges) subject to unfeasible strain and stresses. A natural way to overcome this occurrence is the inclusion of stress constraints within the formulation. This approach brings, on the other hand, particular difficulties associated with the local nature of stress constraints. To deal with this issue, stress constraints are included in the present work using an augmented Lagrangian mathematical programming technique. A level set approach defines the design of the mechanical part and a reaction–diffusion equation is used to update the level set function towards the optimized state. A natural extension of the velocity field provided for the reaction–diffusion equation allows for hole nucleation during the design updating. The joining of an augmented Lagrangian approach and level set implicit boundaries to handle local stress constraints in order to obtain hinge-free compliant mechanisms is the novelty of this paper. Several two-dimensional numerical examples show the efficacy of the proposed procedure. In particular, an example analyzes the influence of the weak material in the design of compliant mechanisms. Level set designs enable that final solutions are validated in commercial finite element codes without any post-processing procedure.},

  abstract     = {Hill-top branching (HTB) is an exceptional stability problem in which the bifurcation point (BP) coincides exactly with a limit point (LP). In such cases, snap-through and branching instability occur simultaneously. Then, HTB is often obscured in snap-through behavior and is often overlooked in stability design. The compound instability is in fact not well realized in the community of computational mechanics , when the rank deficiency and number of negative eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix are carelessly examined. No report of the relevant literature has established diagnosis of path branching or proposed a branch-switching procedure. Furthermore, few HTB models are available in the literature. This report proposes a set of asymptotic bifurcation equations to address this academically important and exciting issue. There might be a single or two critical eigenvectors of the singular stiffness matrix . Higher-derivatives of the stiffness matrix with respect to nodal displacements can be computed exactly using hyper-dual numbers (HDNs). The resulting simultaneous equations can be solved visually using graphical tools available in popular mathematical software packages such as MATLAB®. From the locations of existing real roots displayed on a graphic monitor, the crossover situation of path branching is visually clear above and below the hill-top. For the present study, three HTB examples are computed to verify the proposed algorithm strategy using HDNs and graphical tools. The obtained numerical results show excellent agreement with analytical and finite element predictions . The proposed asymptotically expanded and visually solved bifurcation equations reliably diagnose asymmetric and unstable symmetric HTB in structural stability problems and function well in computational engineering problems.},

In this work, we develop stabilized MPM formulations for dynamic and quasi-static poromechanics that permit the use of standard low-order interpolation functions notwithstanding the drainage condition. For the stabilization of both dynamic and quasi-static formulations, we utilize the polynomial pressure projection method whereby a stabilization term is augmented to the balance of mass. The stabilization term can be implemented with both the original and generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) methods, and it is compatible with existing time-integration methods. Here we use fully-implicit methods for both dynamic and quasi-static poromechanical problems, aided by a block-preconditioned Newton–Krylov solver. The stabilized MPMs are verified and investigated through several numerical examples under dynamic and quasi-static conditions. Results show that the proposed MPM formulations allow standard low-order interpolation functions to be used for both the solid displacement and pore pressure fields of poromechanical formulations, from undrained to drained conditions, and from dynamic to quasi-static conditions.},

However, it is very computationally expensive to simulate multi-bead deposition process using existing numerical model to analyze and select appropriate laser scanning strategies. In this paper, we make use of a recently developed and experimentally validated efficient thermal field prediction numerical model for LAAM to generate training data for a physics-based machine learning algorithm . A combined Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Neural Networks (RNN–DNN) model was developed to identify the correlation between laser scanning patterns and their corresponding thermal history distributions. Subsequently, the developed RNN–DNN model is able to make thermal field prediction for an arbitrary geometry with different scanning strategies. Comparison between the numerical simulation results and the RNN–DNN predictions showed good agreement of more than 95%.},

  abstract     = {The Hierarchical Interface-enriched Finite Element Method (HIFEM) is a technique for solving problems containing discontinuities in the field gradient using finite element meshes that do not conform (match) the domain morphology. The method is suitable for analyzing problems with complex geometries or when such geometry is not known a priori . Contrary to the eXtended/Generalized Finite Element Method (X/GFEM), enrichments are placed on nodes created along interfaces, and a recursive enrichment strategy is used to resolve multiple discontinuities crossing single elements . In this manuscript we rigorously study the approximating properties and stability of HIFEM. A study on the enrichments’ polynomial order shows that the formulation does not pass the patch test as long as enrichments do not replicate the approximating properties of partition of unity shape functions. Regarding stability, we show that condition numbers of system matrices grow at the same rate as those of standard FEM— and without requiring a preconditioner . This intrinsic stability is accomplished by means of a proper construction of enrichment functions that are properly scaled as interfaces approach mesh nodes. We further demonstrate that, even without scaling, using a simple preconditioner recovers stability. The method’s stability is further demonstrated on the modeling of challenging thermal and mechanical problems with complex morphologies.},

The model consists of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for the liquids and two extra equations for the charge transport and the electric potential. Three types of linear time-stepping schemes, namely a fully-implicit linear extrapolated Crank–Nicolson scheme and two projection-type schemes, are constructed which differ in their accuracy and efficiency. All the proposed schemes with spatial discretization by finite difference on staggered grids are proved to be unconditionally energy stable, and the associated linear systems are uniquely solvable. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the convergence rates and the energy stability of the schemes.

The proposed nodal Lagrangian method uses a finite element mesh to discretize the computational domain and to define the (linear) shape functions for the unknown nodal variables, as in the standard Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). In this approach, however, the integrals are performed over nodal patches and not over elements, and strains/stresses are defined at nodes and not at Gauss points . This allows to limit the drawbacks associated with the remeshing and leads to a more accurate stress computation than in the classical elemental PFEM. Several numerical tests, in 2D and in 3D, are presented to validate the proposed nodal PFEM. In all cases, the method has shown a very good agreement with analytical solutions and with experimental and numerical results from the literature. A thorough comparison between nodal and elemental PFEMs is also presented, focusing on crucial issues, such as solution accuracy, convergence, mass conservation and sensitivity to mesh distortion .},

In the statistical physics, the continuum percolation model is usually used to study the system-spanning connectivity in the porous composite. It is widely believed that the dimensionless excluded volume V d e x Vdex of discrete pore is of great importance in the evaluation of the global percolation threshold ϕ c ϕc of porous network. The porous networks of composites are normally composed of overlapping symmetrical spheres. However, the actual shape of pores in composite is asymmetrical. In this work, the dimensionless V d e x Vdex of discrete superovoidal pores are theoretically and numerically calculated. Then, the quantitative relationship between components (pore shape) and microstructures (global percolation threshold ϕ c ϕc ) of porous networks comprising superovoids is established by a dimensionless excluded volume based empirical approximation . It is observed that the porous composites comprising symmetrical pores are more difficult to form the system-spanning connected porous path than the composites consisting of non-centrosymmetrical pores. Moreover, the transport properties of composites considering their microstructures (i.e., the thresholds ϕ c ϕc ) are theoretically predicted by the continuum percolation-based generalized effective medium theory (CP-GEMT) and the theoretical values are validated by comparing with the experimental results.},

For regions where cracks are expected to occur, a mesoscopic model based on a mesh fragmentation technique is used to represent the concrete as a heterogeneous three-phase material composed of mortar matrix, coarse aggregates and interfacial transition zone . In this technique, standard finite elements with high aspect ratio are inserted in between all regular finite elements of the mortar matrix and in between the mortar matrix and aggregate elements in order to describe the crack initiation and propagation process by using an appropriate tensile damage constitutive model. Coarse aggregates with regular shapes are generated from a grading curve and placed into the mortar matrix randomly, using the “take-and-place” method. Coupling finite elements are used for connecting the non-matching meshes corresponding to the macro and mesoscale regions, without increasing the total number of degrees of freedom of the problem.

  abstract     = {Different strategies based on rotation vector and exact strain measure have been proposed over the years for analyzing flexible bodies undergoing arbitrary large rotations. To avoid the singularity of the vector-like parametrization , the interpolation of the incremental rotation vector is the most popular approach in this context, even if this leads to path dependence and numerical instability , i.e. error accumulation. It is also non objective, although both objectivity and path independence are recovered with h h and p p refinement. Corotational approaches do not have these drawbacks, even though the geometrically exact model is achieved by mesh refinement. In this work, we develop a novel strategy which uses the incremental nodal rotation vectors to define corotational nodal rotations, which are then interpolated for the evaluation of the nonlinear strains. This choice makes the approach singularity-free, allows for additive updates within each increment and preserves all the features of the theoretical problem for any mesh and interpolation: rotational variables, objectivity, exact strain measure, path independence and symmetric stiffness matrix for conservative loads. This last property is a consequence of the direct differentiation of the relation between local and global rotations, whose compact form also makes a simple and general definition of the internal forces and the tangent stiffness for any order of interpolation possible. In addition, we show how the common approach of interpolating incremental vectors can be made stable by a simple updating procedure based on local rotations carried out at the end of each increment in order to avoid cumulative errors. Geometrically exact 3D beams are considered as a demonstrative example. An iterative strategy based on mixed integration points is used to solve the nonlinear discrete equations efficiently.},

  abstract     = {We present an adaptive h h -refined fourth-order phase field model for studying fracture using a hybrid-staggered solution scheme. The conventional fourth-order phase field model involves the computation of higher-order derivatives of the phase field, which requires continuously differentiable shape functions. The proposed locally-refinable approximation scheme is devised in the framework of isogeometric analysis which provides a smooth C 1 C1 continuous discretization throughout the domain. With the fourth-order model, the cracked surface is captured more accurately with fewer degrees of freedom. The efficiency of the formulation is enhanced by employing an adaptive h h -refinement scheme using polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (PHT-Splines), which allows the hierarchical refinement to resolve the local quantities of interest. The inherent localization property of PHT-splines is exploited to develop an efficient data transfer algorithm for bridging the coarse and fine meshes. To enhance the accuracy of the proposed approach, we use a cubic stress-degradation function instead of the commonly used quadratic stress-degradation function. Moreover, we use a Taylor series expansion to approximate the stress-degradation function which improves the robustness of the non-linear solver. The improvement in the solution and the accuracy of the proposed approach have been presented by comparing the obtained results with the analytical solution available in the literature for a one-dimensional example. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach in capturing complex crack patterns through several two and three-dimensional examples. Code and data necessary for replicating the results of the examples in the article will be made available through a GitHub repository.},

In contrast to flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithms that apply limited antidiffusive corrections to bound-preserving low-order solutions, our new limiting strategy exploits the fact that these solutions can be expressed as convex combinations of bar states belonging to a convex invariant set of physically admissible solutions . Each antidiffusive flux is limited in a way which guarantees that the associated bar state remains in the invariant set and preserves appropriate local bounds. There is no free parameter and no need for limit fluxes associated with the consistent mass matrix of time derivative term separately. Moreover, the steady-state limit of the nonlinear discrete problem is well defined and independent of the pseudo-time step. In the case study for the Euler equations , the components of the bar states are constrained sequentially to satisfy local maximum principles for the density, velocity, and specific total energy in addition to positivity preservation for the density and pressure. The results of numerical experiments for standard test problems illustrate the ability of built-in convex limiters to resolve steep fronts in a sharp and nonoscillatory manner.},

This means only a few spatial variables are needed to represent a design otherwise described using millions of topology design variables. This ability to restate the problem in terms of the spatial variables unlocks new design schemes. Here we use a few spatial variables to address (i) constrained topology design optimization, (ii) to compute the derivatives of the constraints using numerical finite differences, and (iii) to build metamodels to the topology design optimization results. A significant benefit is therefore that complex design problems can be considered: the mechanics can include highly nonlinear events, while the use of metamodels allows a diversity of design optimization studies.

To overcome such drawback which may lead to non-physical oscillations, the adaptive mesh refinement method is considered.

The mesh refinement marking strategies which take into account the large curvatures of the surfaces are developed.

  abstract     = {We present a phase field model to simulate brittle fracture in an initially straight Euler–Bernoulli beam, with generalization to curved beams. We start from formulating the problem with the principle of minimum potential energy in a 3D solid, with the displacement field and the phase field as primary arguments. We then select, for each cross section , representative fields that characterize the said cross section, including the beam deflection and rotation, and two independent ansatz variables within the cross section to represent the phase field. The problem then reduces to a minimization with only one-dimensional field variables . A feature of the proposed method is, without discretizing the phase field within the cross section, it can represent its variation within the cross section, allowing to simulate cracks partially going through the thickness due to bending as well as axial loads .},

  abstract     = {A new finite element (FE) based topology optimization (TO) for turbulent flow was developed using the k − ε k−ε turbulent model, which is one of the Reynolds–Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. Despite many innovative works on the subject of fluidic TO, it remains important to consider the impact of turbulent flow in TO. To consider the effect of complex turbulent fluid motion, this study considered the k − ε k−ε turbulent finite element model. To conduct a successful TO, the modification of the k − ε k−ε turbulent model to account for the topology evolutions during an optimization process is important. Correspondingly, to account for these effects, we proposed the addition of penalization terms to the original k − ε k−ε turbulent model. To validate the present approach and the effect of turbulent flow on optimized layouts, various two-dimensional designs were optimized by minimizing the turbulent kinetic or the turbulent dissipation energies. Numerical optimization results showed that it is possible to conduct the topology optimization for turbulent flow.},

  abstract     = {A new methodology in isogeometric analysis (IGA) is presented. This methodology delivers low-cost variable-scale approximations (surrogates) of the matrices which IGA conventionally requires to be computed from element-scale quadrature formulas. To generate surrogate matrices, quadrature must only be performed on certain elements in the computational domain. This, in turn, determines only a subset of the entries in the final matrix. The remaining matrix entries are computed by a simple B-spline interpolation procedure. Poisson’s equation, membrane vibration, plate bending, and Stokes’ flow problems are studied. In these problems, the use of surrogate matrices has a negligible impact on solution accuracy. Because only a small fraction of the original quadrature must be performed, we are able to report beyond a fifty-fold reduction in overall assembly time in the same software. The capacity for even further speed-ups is clearly demonstrated. The implementation used here was achieved by a small number of modifications to the open-source IGA software library GeoPDEs. Similar modifications could be made to other present-day software libraries.},

Phase field (PF) models can be used to study such scenarios but their application requires suitable models of the properties of the interacting phases: vapor, liquid, and solid. In this work, the PF simulations are linked to molecular models by using an equation of state as well as a correlation for the viscosity, that are both consistent with results determined by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The motion of a nanoscale droplet on a surface with a wettability gradient is studied both by MD simulations and PF simulations and the results are compared. In both methods, the wettability gradient is solely determined by the surface tensions of the liquid–vapor, solid–liquid, and solid–vapor interfaces. Simulations are conducted for two different profiles of the wettability and at two different temperatures. The qualitative and the quantitative behavior such as the shape of the droplet and the velocity of the motion are in good agreement. This validates the PF model for the determination of nanoscale phenomena, and enables an efficient investigation of nanoscale as well as larger scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The human heart beats as a result of multiscale nonlinear dynamics coupling subcellular to whole organ processes, achieving electrophysiologically-driven mechanical contraction. Computational cardiac modelling and simulation have achieved a great degree of maturity, both in terms of mathematical models of underlying biophysical processes and the development of simulation software. In this study, we present the detailed description of a human-based physiologically-based, and fully-coupled ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulation framework, and a sensitivity analysis focused on its mechanical properties. The biophysical detail of the model, from ionic to whole-organ, is crucial to enable future simulations of disease and drug action. Key novelties include the coupling of state-of-the-art human-based electrophysiology membrane kinetics, excitation–contraction and active contraction models, and the incorporation of a pre-stress model to allow for pre-stressing and pre-loading the ventricles in a dynamical regime. Through high performance computing simulations, we demonstrate that 50% to 200% − − 1000% variations in key parameters result in changes in clinically-relevant mechanical biomarkers ranging from diseased to healthy values in clinical studies. Furthermore mechanical biomarkers are primarily affected by only one or two parameters. Specifically, ejection fraction is dominated by the scaling parameter of the active tension model and its scaling parameter in the normal direction ( k ort 2 kort2 ); the end systolic pressure is dominated by the pressure at which the ejection phase is triggered ( P ej Pej ) and the compliance of the Windkessel fluid model ( C C ); and the longitudinal fractional shortening is dominated by the fibre angle ( ϕ ϕ ) and k ort 2 kort2 . The wall thickening does not seem to be clearly dominated by any of the considered input parameters. In summary, this study presents in detail the description and implementation of a human-based coupled electromechanical modelling and simulation framework, and a high performance computing study on the sensitivity of mechanical biomarkers to key model parameters. The tools and knowledge generated enable future investigations into disease and drug action on human ventricles.},

No a-priori assumption of the crack path is needed. Crack propagation under conditions of finite deformation is driven by stored elastic energy that accounts for material anisotropy and tension–compression asymmetry, and defect energy resulting from slip system dislocation glide and hardening. The resulting finite element model is capable of simulating both brittle and ductile crack propagation in material microstructures. A major contribution of this work is the creation of the adaptive, multi-resolution wavelet-based hierarchical enrichment of the FE model. The adapted enrichment follows the path of crack growth and is able to successfully overcome the challenges of high resolution required for the regularized crack in the coupled model. The multi-resolution wavelet basis functions adaptively construct optimal enrichment basis for the high gradients in the phase field order parameter near the crack path. The wavelet-enriched adaptive finite element model is found to be robust with excellent convergence characteristics in multiple validation tests conducted with the polycrystalline Ti–6V–4Al alloy.},

By means of the projection–contraction algorithm for finite-dimensional variational inequalities and the idea of the Gauss–Seidel method, a new projection–contraction algorithm for MiCP is designed and denoted by GSPC. Applying the monotonicity of the mapping of the MiCP, GSPC is proved convergent theoretically for associative plasticity. For non-associative plasticity, the sufficient condition for GSPC to be convergent is also established if the tension part of the Mohr–Coulomb elastic domain is cut off. Typical examples are designed to illustrate GSPC is highly efficient, accurate and stable, some of which cannot be solved by the conventional return-mapping method. In all the cases, the computational efficiency of GSPC is apparently above the mapping return method.},

Using a penalization strategy, this variational inequality system is transformed into a variational equality system, which is the formulation we take as the starting point for our algorithmic developments. The proposed scheme involves a partitioning of this model into two subproblems ; phase field and mechanics , with added stabilization terms to both subproblems for improved efficiency and robustness. We analyze the convergence of the proposed scheme using a fixed point argument, and find that under a natural condition, the elastic mechanical energy remains bounded, and, if the diffusive zone around crack surfaces is sufficiently thick, monotonic convergence is achieved.

  abstract     = {Exploring ultralight sandwich structures with superior load-bearing performance is one of the important topics in structural optimization. This paper proposes a novel multiscale topology optimization method to achieve the design of high-performance sandwich structures with graded cellular cores (SSGCCs). In this method, the thicknesses of two solid face-sheets, the graded distribution of cellular sandwich cores at a single layer and their configurations are optimized to well suit for loading conditions, where the single layer is arrayed periodically at its height direction to obtain sandwich layers. Specifically, at macroscale, the variable thickness sheet (VTS) method with the capacity of generating an overall free material distribution pattern, is applied to optimize the thicknesses of two solid face-sheets and achieve the graded distribution of cellular sandwich cores at a single layer. At microscale, a progressive optimization scheme is employed to topologically optimize multiple representative cellular cores (RCCs) at a single layer, so as to achieve their similar topological configurations. With a shape interpolation method, the configurations of graded cellular cores (GCCs) with essential interconnections can be obtained by interpolating the shapes of these RCCs with similar topological features. In order to reduce the computational burden on evaluating effective properties of GCCs by the homogenization method, a Kriging metamodel is constructed based on some key cellular cores as sample points, and adopted to predict the effective properties of all the GCCs. Both 2D and 3D numerical examples are provided to test the validity and advantages of the proposed method for designing SSGCCs.},

The fluid–fluid interface (air–water interface) is handled by the level set method, while the fluid–structure interface is handled through an immersogeometric approach by immersing structures into non-boundary-fitted meshes and enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions weakly. Residual-based variational multiscale method (RBVMS) is employed to stabilize the coupled Navier–Stokes equations of incompressible flows and level set convection equation. Other level set techniques, including re-distancing and mass balancing, are also incorporated into the immersed formulation. Adaptive quadrature rule is used to better capture the geometry of the immersed structure boundary by accurately integrating the intersected background elements. Generalized- α α method is adopted for time integration, which results in a two-stage predictor multi-corrector algorithm. GMRES solver preconditioned with block Jacobian matrices of individual fluid and level set subproblems is used for solving the coupled linear systems arising from the multi-corrector stage. The capability and accuracy of the proposed method are assessed by simulating three challenging marine engineering problems, which are a solitary wave impacting a stationary platform, dam break with an obstacle, and planing of a DTMB 5415 ship model. A refinement study is performed. The predictions of key quantities of interest by the proposed formulation are in good agreement with experimental results and boundary-fitted simulation results from others.

An Euler–Bernoulli beam is used as an example in order to illustrate the demands on the coupling conditions in the proposed approach. Moreover, the conditions are chosen such that different types of joints , e.g. scissor joints, can be modeled and such that they are easy and fast to implement. The coupling is incorporated by an additional term in the Principle of Virtual Work which is here computed using a penalty approach. The Euler–Bernoulli beam is summarized in order to introduce the notations in this contribution. This is followed by the proposed coupling conditions in the weak form.

  abstract     = {This work addresses an efficient Global–Local approach supplemented with predictor–corrector adaptivity applied to anisotropic phase-field brittle fracture. The phase-field formulation is used to resolve the sharp crack surface topology on the anisotropic/non-uniform local state in the regularized concept. To resolve the crack phase-field by a given single preferred direction, second-order structural tensors are imposed to both the bulk and crack surface density functions Accordingly, a split in tension and compression modes in anisotropic materials is considered. A Global–Local formulation is proposed, in which the full displacement/phase-field problem is solved on a lower (local) scale, while dealing with a purely linear elastic problem on an upper (global) scale. Robin-type boundary conditions are introduced to relax the stiff local response at the global scale and enhancing its stabilization. Another important aspect of this contribution is the development of an adaptive Global–Local approach, where a predictor–corrector scheme is designed in which the local domains are dynamically updated during the computation. To cope with different finite element discretizations at the interface between the two nested scales, a non-matching dual mortar method is formulated. Hence, more regularity is achieved on the interface. Several numerical results substantiate our developments.},

We first formulate a phase-field model from an energetic variational formulation based on the L 2 L2 -gradient flow and add three nonlocal Lagrange multipliers to the system to conserve the volume for each phase. Then, by combining the SAV approach with the stabilization technique, where a crucial linear stabilization term is added to enhance the stability and keep the required accuracy thus allowing large time steps, we arrive at a decoupled, linear, non-iterative, and volume-conserved scheme. This scheme is unconditionally energy stable and requires solving only four linear second-order elliptic equations with constant coefficients . We further prove energy stability and present numerous 2D and 3D numerical simulations to show accuracy and stability.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel spline-based meshing technique that allows for usage of boundary-conforming meshes for unsteady flow and temperature simulations in co-rotating twin-screw extruders. Spline-based descriptions of arbitrary screw geometries are generated using Elliptic Grid Generation . They are evaluated in a number of discrete points to yield a coarse classical mesh. The use of a special control mapping allows to fine-tune properties of the coarse mesh like orthogonality at the boundaries. The coarse mesh is used as a ‘scaffolding’ to generate a boundary-conforming mesh out of a fine background mesh at run-time. Storing only a coarse mesh makes the method cheap in terms of memory storage. Additionally, the adaptation at run-time is extremely cheap compared to computing the flow solution. Furthermore, this method circumvents the need for expensive re-meshing and projections of solutions making it efficient and accurate. It is incorporated into a space–time finite element framework. We present time-dependent test cases of non-Newtonian fluids in 2D and 3D for complex screw designs. They demonstrate the potential of the method also for arbitrarily complex industrial applications.},

This characteristic provides a possible solution to the accurate manipulation of acoustic and elastic waves. For this reason, phononic crystal is of application potentials in vibration and noise reduction, filtering, acoustic lens, acoustic imaging, and acoustic stealth, etc. It is thus of significance in the fields of information, communication, and medical applications. To design phononic crystal with anticipated manipulation characteristic has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, how to accurately manipulate acoustic and mechanical wave is still a major challenge for existing designing approaches. Assisted by image-based finite element analysis and deep learning , a data-driven approach is proposed in this study for designing phononic crystals. An auto-encoder is trained to extract the topological features from sample images. Finite element analysis is employed to study the band gaps of samples. A multi-layer perceptron is trained to establish the inherent relation between band gaps and topological features. The trained models are ultimately employed to design phononic crystals with anticipated band gaps. Not limited to this material, the proposed method could be further extended to design various structured mechanical materials with specific functionalities.},

This work presents level-set based topology optimization of structures undergoing large deformations due to thermal and mechanical loads. The nonlinear analysis model is constructed by multiplicatively decomposing thermal and mechanical effects and introducing an intermediate stress-free state between the undeformed and deformed coordinates. By incorporating the thermoelastic nonlinearity into the level-set topology optimization scheme, wider design spaces can be explored with the consideration of both mechanical and thermal loads . Four numerical examples are presented that demonstrate how temperature changes affect the optimal design of large-deforming structures. In particular, we show how optimization can manipulate the material layout in order to create a counteracting effect between thermal and mechanical loads, even up to a degree that buckling and snap-through are suppressed. Hence the consideration of large deformations in conjunction with thermoelasticity opens many new possibilities for controlling and manipulating the thermo-mechanical response via topology optimization.},

This is particularly so if topology optimization (TO) is to be used, since TO with dynamic analyses can be very computationally expensive. The so-called inertia relief method, which essentially entails computing the rigid body inertia and subtracting it from the given loads to make the system of loads self-equilibrating, can sometimes be used to replace a dynamic analysis with a static, thus enabling the use of high-resolution TO. We derive the inertia relief method for elastic continua and obtain a static variational problem which require that we can suppress (linearized) rigid body motions without affecting the deformation. Three methods for doing this are investigated. Based on the static variational problem we consider maximizing stiffness using TO. Numerical examples show that all three methods for suppressing rigid body motion work, and indicate that optimal designs for freely floating structures undergoing rigid acceleration can differ significantly from designs optimized under static conditions.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations on fluid dynamics problems primarily rely on spatially or/and temporally discretization of the governing equation using polynomials into a finite-dimensional algebraic system. Due to the multi-scale nature of the physics and sensitivity from meshing a complicated geometry, such process can be computational prohibitive for most real-time applications (e.g., clinical diagnosis and surgery planning) and many-query analyses (e.g., optimization design and uncertainty quantification). Therefore, developing a cost-effective surrogate model is of great practical significance . Deep learning (DL) has shown new promises for surrogate modeling due to its capability of handling strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality . However, the off-the-shelf DL architectures, success of which heavily relies on the large amount of training data and interpolatory nature of the problem, fail to operate when the data becomes sparse. Unfortunately, data is often insufficient in most parametric fluid dynamics problems since each data point in the parameter space requires an expensive numerical simulation based on the first principle, e.g., Navier–Stokes equations. In this paper, we provide a physics-constrained DL approach for surrogate modeling of fluid flows without relying on any simulation data. Specifically, a structured deep neural network (DNN) architecture is devised to enforce the initial and boundary conditions , and the governing partial differential equations (i.e., Navier–Stokes equations) are incorporated into the loss of the DNN to drive the training. Numerical experiments are conducted on a number of internal flows relevant to hemodynamics applications, and the forward propagation of uncertainties in fluid properties and domain geometry is studied as well. The results show excellent agreement on the flow field and forward-propagated uncertainties between the DL surrogate approximations and the first-principle numerical simulations.},

Therefore, a modified Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman GTN-type plasticity model is combined with a phase-field fracture approach to account for a temperature-dependent growth of voids on micro-scale followed by crack initiation and propagation on macro-scale.

  abstract     = {We present a new localized boundary knot method (LBKM) for the solution of large-scale partial differential equations based on the non-singular general solutions. The proposed local algorithm only requires several discrete nodes inside the physical domain and along its boundary without any mesh. For every node, a local subdomain with a simple geometry can be firstly determined via Euclidean distance between nodes. And then the unknown variable at every node can be expressed as a linear combination of function values at nodes inside its corresponding local subdomain. Finally, a sparse linear system can be formed by using the governing equation and the corresponding boundary conditions. In our computations, two different-types of LBKM formulations have been proposed for deriving the final sparse linear system . One is based on the inverse matrix calculation and the other is based on the moving least square (MLS) technique. Unlike the traditional boundary knot method (BKM) with the “global” discretization , the present LBKM is a local discretization method and requires less computer time and storage due to its feature of sparse and banded matrix , which makes it more suitable for solving large-scale problems. Preliminary numerical experiments are carried out in the large-scale acoustics models and bimaterial problems. The comparisons of proposed two types of LBKM formulations are also investigated. The results show the accuracy, validity and great promising applications of the proposed LBKM for the simulation of large-scale problems in complicated geometries.},

  abstract     = {A new frame discretization method for treating non-matching discrete interfaces is presented based on the method of localized Lagrange multipliers , which introduces the frame domain lying between the two interfacing parts. The required interface compatibility conditions are then enforced independently between the master domain interface nodes and the frame nodes, and the slave domain interface nodes and the same frame nodes. The frame nodes are determined so as to satisfy the mean coordinates, including the frame node to be determined, of the nearest interface element of the master domain for each of the slave domain interface nodes. The roles of the two domains may interchange, resulting in a unique determination of the frame elements for each case. The interface compatibility conditions thus obtained satisfy energy conservation, especially when the interface gaps are unavoidable while requiring no special treatments for the boundary nodes that are often required in mortar and allied methods. Consequently, the proposed method can effectively deal with the non-matching interface regardless of the geometric complexity and element type. Numerical examples illustrate the simplicity of the proposed method and offer improved accuracy for interfaces with gaps and as good of an accuracy as other methods when there are no gaps, while preserving implementation simplicity.},

We consider standard stabilization procedures over conforming finite element spaces and a nonconforming one that delivers a divergence-free discrete velocity field . The analysis, that is valid for two and three-dimensional domains, relies on a smallness assumption on the solution and is based on a technique that involves the Ritz projection of the residuals. The devised a posteriori error estimators are proven to be globally reliable and locally efficient. Three dimensional numerical experiments reveal a competitive performance of adaptive procedures driven by the designed a posteriori error estimators .},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear finite element methods such as isogeometric analysis and absolute nodal coordinate formulation can be applied to modeling the flexible multibody systems (FMBS) subject to both large rotation and deformation. However, the computational expense is prohibitive for complex systems, especially for a parameterized FMBS. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), nonmodal model order reduction (MOR) technique, has been widely applied to nonlinear problems in order to reduce the computational expense of simulating the dynamic responses of FMBSs. This paper presents a component-level POD method, which applies the singular value decomposition process to snapshots of each component of an FMBS and utilizes constraint equations to satisfy the connecting conditions among the components. Furthermore, the paper provides a systematic study of the parameterized MOR (PMOR) for an FMBS, including the reduction of the constraint equations, energy conserving mesh sampling and weighting (ECSW), and the greedy-POD method. The ECSW method aims to further reducing the computational cost of matrix multiplications for evaluating the reduced stiffness matrix. Greedy-POD is applied to get a robust set of reduced order bases with parametric changes in simulation. Finally, three numerical examples validate the feasibility of the component-level POD as well as the whole PMOR process for an FMBS, thereby demonstrating that the component-level POD performs better numerical simulations in accuracy computational costs than the classical POD.},

  abstract     = {In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in one-dimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem , we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient ∇ ρ ( x , t ) ∇ρ(x,t) , the pressure p ( x ∗ , t ) p(x∗,t) at a specified point x = x ∗ x=x∗ as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x ∗ x∗ plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x ∗ x∗ from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x ∗ x∗ from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time . We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter γ γ in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter γ γ accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.},

  abstract     = {Additive manufacturing provides more freedom for the design of structures but also exhibits prominent local uncertainties of material properties, which bring potential challenges. The performance of structures should depend not only on uncertain variations of material properties but also on the spatial occurrence frequency of the extreme material properties. This paper proposes a non-probabilistic reliability-based topology optimization algorithm by considering local material uncertainties in additive manufacturing. The whole design domain is divided into several uncertainty regions (URs), whose size is proportional to the spatial occurrence frequency of extreme material properties. Within each UR, these uncertain-but-bounded variations of materials are correlated by the multi-dimensional ellipsoid model. Then, the multi-ellipsoid model for all URs is established by considering the overall material uncertainties of the structure. Thereafter, a non-probabilistic reliability-based topology optimization (NRBTO) is proposed for minimizing structural volume against displacement constraints by considering material uncertainties during additive manufacturing. Several 2D and 3D examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with solutions resulting from the deterministic topology optimization (DTO), NRBTO provides conservative designs with a larger volume fraction due to material uncertainties. When smaller URs are assigned to indicate the high occurrence frequency of extreme material properties, the NRBTO design becomes even conservative. The extreme case is equivalent to the deterministic topology optimization using the lower bound material.},

A reduced order model is then built once and for all using these defect shapes and the nominal model information only. A suitable reduced order basis is introduced as well in order to effectively represent the influence of the defects on the dynamics of the structure. In contrast to many nonlinear parametric reduced order models, the one we propose does not need any previous training of the model in the parameter space. In this way, prohibitively expensive full order simulations can be avoided and offline times are greatly reduced. Numerical tests are performed on a MEMS resonator and a silicon micro-beam to study the effect of shape imperfections on the dynamic response of the system.},

  abstract     = {The material point method (MPM) has found successful applications in many engineering problems involving large displacement, large deformation and contacts. The standard MPM formulation, which adopts piece-wise linear basis functions, suffers from the so-called cell-crossing instability, low order of convergence and numerical fracture. Modifications have been made to this standard MPM to mitigate these issues: B-spline MPM (BSMPM), the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) and convected particle domain interpolation (CPDI) all decrease cell-crossing instabilities and increase the order of convergence, but only CPDI effectively suppresses numerical fracture. However, these methods, CPDI in particular, significantly increase the method’s implementation and computational complexity . This paper presents a total Lagrangian MPM, dubbed TLMPM, that overcomes the issues of the conventional MPM while being more efficient and easier to implement than CPDI. The method is used for impact analyses of a cylinder bar made of steel and necking and fracture of cylinder alloy specimens. The numerical solutions are in satisfactory agreement with the experiment data. No numerical fracture occurred for simulations involving very large tensile deformation without special treatment such as done in the CPDI. Convergence analyses using the method of manufactured solutions show that the TLMPM is second-order accurate for problems of which boundary is axis-aligned. For the challenging generalized vortex problem, it also converges quadratically for relatively coarse meshes. Moreover, the model is able to simulate physically based fracture using continuum damage mechanics .},

The associated Galerkin scheme is defined by Raviart–Thomas elements of order k ≥ 0 k≥0 for the pseudostress and discontinuous polynomials of degree k k for the velocity. Provided suitable hypotheses on the mesh near the boundary Γ Γ , we prove well-posedness of the Galerkin scheme by means of the Babuška–Brezzi theory and establish the corresponding optimal convergence of O ( h k + 1 ) O(hk+1) . Moreover, for the case when Γ h Γh is constructed through a piecewise linear interpolation of Γ Γ , we propose a reliable and quasi-efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimator . Its definition makes use of a postprocessed velocity with enhanced accuracy to achieve the same rate of convergence of the method when the solution is smooth enough. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the scheme, show the behavior of the associated adaptive algorithm and validate the theory.},

With the aim of overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional bubble method and retaining all its advantages, the proposed method achieves a comprehensive integration of topological derivative, implicit model and fixed grid. The topological derivative is devoted to the iterative positioning of new holes inside the design domain. Each of the holes is described by smoothly deformable implicit curve (SDIC) characterized by very few parameters and high deformation capacity. Since the structural model could be implicitly constructed using the SDICs, the finite cell method (FCM) is applied to facilitate the mechanical analysis of the implicit model with fixed Eulerian mesh . Two new concepts, i.e., the topological derivative threshold and the total influence region of inserted holes, are further introduced to adaptively control the numbers and positions of new holes so that the numerical stability of topology optimization could be well guaranteed. It is shown that the adaptive bubble method no longer needs the mesh updating process and can perform the merging and separating operations of holes straightforwardly. Numerical examples concerning the stiffest structure design and the compliant mechanism synthesis are tested to demonstrate the universality of the present method, especially its capability of being integrated within CAD systems directly without post-processing.},

  abstract     = {Inter-particle contact force calculation between non-spherical particles is a fundamental problem in discrete element method (DEM) with yet no conclusive solutions. This paper presents a general geometric force model (GFM) to calculate contact forces and contact areas between particles with smooth surfaces. Special attention is paid to accurate calculation of the original geometric parameters defined in Hertz theory instead of using the simplified models currently adopted. In particular, a recently proposed mathematical technique is implemented to reliably calculate the principal curvatures and principal directions. The new model is applied to super-quadric particles. In particular, the prediction of the model is compared to those by the simplified models and the accurate contact force database in a comprehensive way based on orientation discretization. The accurate contact force database is obtained by the sub-particle scale finite element method (FEM), and a script is developed to automate the set-up of the FEM model for different contact scenarios. The comparisons show that the new model is obviously more accurate than the simplified models, and the analysis depicts that the errors of the simplified models result from the simplified geometric parameters. Such errors also affect the prediction of the contact area, which is important to the transport properties of particle assemblies. The new force model can be used in DEM to improve the accuracy of the simulation, and can also be useful to the contact mechanics of non-spherical elements.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays mathematical models and numerical simulations are widely used in the field of hemodynamics, representing a valuable resource to better understand physiological and pathological processes in different medical sectors. The theory behind blood flow modeling is closely related to the study of incompressible flow through compliant thin-walled tubes, starting from the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Furthermore, the mechanical interaction between blood flow and vessels wall must be properly described by the model. Recent works showed the benefits of characterizing the rheology of the vessel wall through a viscoelastic law. Taking into account the viscous contribution of the wall material and not simply the elastic one leads to a more realistic representation of the vessel behavior, which manifests not only an instantaneous elastic strain but also a viscous damping effect on pulse pressure waves, coupled to energy losses. In this context, the aim of this work is to propose an easily extensible one-dimensional mathematical model able to accurately capture fluid–structure interactions. The originality of the model lies in the introduction of a viscoelastic tube law in PDE form, valid for both arterial and venous networks, leading to an augmented fluid–structure interaction system. In contrast to well established mathematical models, the proposed one is natively hyperbolic. The model is solved with an efficient and robust second-order numerical scheme; the time integration is based on an Implicit–Explicit Runge–Kutta scheme conceived for applications to hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation terms. The validation of the proposed model is performed on several different test cases. Results obtained in Riemann problems, adopting a simple elastic tube law for the characterization of the vessel wall, are compared with available exact solutions. To validate the contribution given by the viscoelastic term, the Method of Manufactured Solutions has been applied. Specific tests have been designed to verify the well-balancing with respect to fluid-at-rest condition and the accuracy-preserving property of the scheme. Finally, a specific test case with an inlet pulse pressure wave has been designed to assess the effects of viscoelasticity with respect to a simple elastic behavior of the vessel wall. The complete code, written in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) language, with the implemented test cases, is made available in Mendeley Data repository.},

  abstract     = {Similar to other particle methods, the Weakly-Compressible MPS (WC-MPS) is known to suffer from numerical instabilities and unphysical pressure fluctuations. Here we develop, adapt and evaluate a series of enhancement techniques to improve the stability and accuracy of this numerical approach . This includes a new conservative pressure gradient formulation and its conjugate form of the continuity equation supplied with a new diffusive term to reduce the numerical error related to the false diffusion. As a regularization technique, we have also adapted and modified the particle shifting algorithm (with near-surface special treatment) in combination with the pair-wise particle collision method to avoid particle clustering and associated noises. The impact of each of these enhancement techniques is evaluated and quantified using popular benchmark cases, i.e. hydrostatic pressure tank, elliptical water drops, rotating square patch of fluid, and dam-break problems. While the results confirm the effectiveness of all the enhancement techniques, the additional diffusive term is found to play a key role in increasing stability and eliminating the high-frequency pressure noises. Furthermore, results show that for the cases with large interfacial deformations, the developed particle shifting algorithm is essential for maintaining the smoothness of the free-surface region and avoiding unwanted fragmentation.},

Compared with recurrent networks , temporal convolutional neural network is more effective with fewer parameters. The model reduction method developed here depends only on the solution of flow field. The performance of the new reduced order model is evaluated using numerical case: flow past a cylinder. Experimental results illustrate that time cost is reduced by three orders of magnitude, and convolutional architecture is beneficial to construct reduced order model.

  abstract     = {Analysis-suitable T-splines (ASTS) including both extraordinary points and T-junctions are used to solve Kirchhoff–Love shell problems. Extraordinary points are required to represent surfaces with arbitrary topological genus. T-junctions enable local refinement of regions where increased resolution is needed. The benefits of using ASTS to define shell geometries are at least two-fold: (1) The manual and time-consuming task of building a new mesh from scratch using the CAD geometry as an input is avoided and (2) C 1 C1 or higher inter-element continuity enables the discretization of shell formulations in primal form defined by fourth-order partial differential equations . A complete and state-of-the-art description of the development of ASTS, including extraordinary points and T-junctions, is presented. In particular, we improve the construction of C 1 C1 -continuous non-negative spline basis functions near extraordinary points to obtain optimal convergence rates with respect to the square root of the number of degrees of freedom when solving linear elliptic problems. The applicability of the proposed technology to shell analysis is exemplified by performing geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff–Love shell simulations of a pinched hemisphere, an oil sump of a car, a pipe junction, and a B-pillar of a car with 15 holes. Building ASTS for these examples involves using T-junctions and extraordinary points with valences 3, 5, and 6, which often suffice for the design of free-form surfaces. Our analysis results are compared with data from the literature using either a seven-parameter shell formulation or Kirchhoff–Love shells. We have also imported both finite element meshes and ASTS meshes into the commercial software LS-DYNA, used Reissner–Mindlin shells, and compared the result with our Kirchhoff–Love shell results. Excellent agreement is found in all cases. The complexity of the shell geometries considered in this paper shows that ASTS are applicable to real-world industrial problems.},

  abstract     = {An efficient framework to obtain stochastic models of responses with polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) using an adaptive least-squares approach is presented in this paper. PCE is a high accuracy spectral expansion technique for uncertainty quantification ; however, it is hugely affected by the curse of dimensionality with the increase in stochastic dimensions. To alleviate this effect, the basis polynomials are added in an adaptive manner, unlike selecting basis polynomials from a large predefined set in the traditional approach. Also, a refinement strategy is proposed to cull the unnecessary PCE terms based on their contribution to the variance of the response. Furthermore, a sequential optimal sampling is utilized that is capable of adding new samples based on the most recent basis polynomials and also reutilizes the old set of samples. The additional highlights of the algorithm include the implementation of weighted least-squares to reduce the effect of outliers and Kullback–Leibler Divergence to check the convergence of PCE. The algorithm has been implemented to analytical benchmark problems and a composite laminate problem. The substantial computational savings of the proposed framework compared to traditional PCE approaches and a large number of random simulations to achieve similar accuracy were demonstrated by the results.},

  abstract     = {A two-dimensional micro-potential based Peridynamic (MPPD) formulation is proposed to investigate deformation and fracturing in solid materials. To this end, square measure of the bond length change is applied and a generalized Peridynamic (PD) strain for plane stress and strain problems is developed to decompose the bond length change into two parts, one resulting from the volumetric PD strain and the other from the deviatoric PD strain. The micro-potential generated in the deformed bond is postulated as a function of both length change components. The nonlocal elastic strain energy density (NESED) at a material point is computed by the integral of the bond potential over the horizon. Through the Frechet derivative of the NESED, a general constitutive relation depending on the micro-potential function is well formulated. The model parameters are calibrated through the equivalence of the NESED with the linear elastic strain energy density . Several specific micro-potential functions and their corresponding constitutive force densities are carefully discussed. The discussions reveal that the proposed MPPD model not only can retrieve the well-known bond based PD model, but also allows specific materials with any Poisson ratio to be represented. Moreover, one failure criterion based on the total micro-bond potential is developed for the present model. The reliability and efficiency of the MPPD model is demonstrated through numerical tests. Simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of investigating deformation and cracking in solids.},

The microstructural evolution observed by scanning electron microscopy can be evaluated using the evolution of the maximum resolved shear stress with the creep time. The damage distribution of the simplified models is consistent with the crack initiation location and propagation region of samples. Additionally, the slip system actuation of the simplified models is the same as that of the experimental results.

It is very difficult for finite length porous layers to realize total sound absorption if they are filled only with homogeneous materials. Rigid inclusions inserted in a porous medium will certainly alter the acoustic field, realizing total sound absorption at some frequencies, but finding their optimal distributions by trial and error is intractable, especially for multiple target frequencies. The aim of this study is to develop a finite element-based numerical method to distribute rigid inclusions inside a porous layer having a fixed thickness for the total sound absorption. Without any special treatment for initial layout, multiply divided rigid inclusions are distributed systematically in an optimized porous layer by the present density-based topology optimization formulation. Considering single target frequency problems, we initially assess the effectiveness of the developed formulation with regard to achieving total sound absorption. In these problems, various resonance mechanisms, such as the Helmholtz resonance and the quarter-wavelength resonances, are generated inside the porous layer by the distributed rigid inclusions. Subsequently, we solve problems considering multiple target frequencies. The numerical results show that different types of resonances occur appropriately in the optimized porous–rigid layer to achieve total sound absorption simultaneously for all the different target frequencies considered here.},

  abstract     = {Geological solid modeling has been widely studied and applied in geological analysis relevant to rock engineering, mining, geophysics, geo-hazard assessment, and geographic information systems (GIS). The discontinuities and other faces that may be planes or surfaces need to be fully considered in an attempt to yield solids formed by the mutual intersection and cutting between faces in practical geological modeling. As one kind of geological solid modeling approach, 3D block cutting analysis can simultaneously identify tens of thousands of solids (blocks) from a complicated 3D discontinuity network without user intervention. However, this analysis can only address planes and build flat blocks. In this paper, we propose a method of 3D curved block cutting analysis. The corresponding algorithm is presented completely, with some key processes of analysis thoroughly accounted for, such as solving the surface-to-surface intersection, analyzing the composition of vertices, and analyzing relevant loops. Our proposed method fully exploits the advantages of topology and computational geometry . The 3D curved blocks can be accurately constructed and represented with minor computation and memory. Analysis examples showed that several hundreds of curved blocks can be automatically constructed within one minute using a microcomputer . This method is of significance for the development of geological solid modeling and can provide a reference for related studies.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of crack initiation and propagation in an elastic material is difficult, as crack paths with complex topologies have to be resolved. Phase-field approaches allow to simulate crack behavior without the need to explicitly model crack paths. However, the underlying mathematical model gives rise to a non-convex constrained minimization problem . In this work, we propose a recursive multilevel trust region (RMTR) method to efficiently solve such a minimization problem . The RMTR method combines global convergence properties of trust region methods with the optimality of multilevel methods . The solution process is accelerated by employing level dependent objective functions, minimization of which provides correction to the original/fine-level problem. In the context of the phase-field fracture approach, it is challenging to design efficient level dependent objective functions as a certain mesh resolution is required to resolve fracture bands. We introduce level dependent objective functions that combine fine level description of the crack path with the coarse level discretization . The overall performance and the convergence properties of the proposed RMTR method are investigated by means of several numerical examples in three dimensions .},

  abstract     = {Thermal residual stress and distortion inherent in metal melting and solidification process is the main cause of build failure in metal additive manufacturing (AM) techniques such as laser powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition. To ensure build quality against residual stress/distortion, it is desirable to tailor the scanning path for a given geometry that needs to be built. Since the local deformation introduced by the moving heat source is anisotropic due to non-uniform heat transfer and mechanical constraints, the scanning path can affect residual stress within a part significantly. Aiming at thermal residual stress/distortion mitigation, this paper presents a novel level set-based scanning path optimization method. The method is developed to enable layer-wise continuous scanning path optimization for geometrically well-defined parts. To make the optimization efficient, a fast process simulation method called the inherent strain method is employed to simulate the thermal residual strain. Full sensitivity analysis for the formulated compliance- and stress-minimization problems is provided, where a novel strategy called the adaptive level set adjustment (ALSA) is proposed to remedy the deficiency of ignoring the non-implementable sensitivity terms. The effectiveness of the proposed continuous scanning path optimization method and ALSA strategy has been proved by a few numerical examples. Finally, the concurrent design scenario for simultaneous scanning path and structural optimization is investigated to demonstrate the further residual stress reduction.},

Influences of structural epistemic uncertainties on unknown loads cannot be effectively quantified for now and the interval inversion needs to be furtherly investigated. In this paper, Tikhonov regularized technique for the inverse analysis is integrated into a non-intrusive de/re-uncertainty procedure, i.e. the dimension-wise analysis, to reconstruct unknown loads under structural epistemic uncertainties . The proposed method transforms the interval identification model at zero-cut of fuzzy inputs into a finite number of classical ones with crisp parameters, regularized solutions to which are adopted to construct a polynomial approximation of each slice of the unknown load. The extreme point set of each approximation at zero-cut is derived to calculate its minimum/maximum (min/max) points at any alpha-cut with respect to the corresponding uncertain parameter, from which the min/max input vectors of the unknown load are assembled in a dimension-wise manner. Subsequently, the interval bounds of the unknown load at each alpha-cut can thus be evaluated by Tikhonov regularized inversion, based on which the fuzzy description is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the inclusion of the unknown load in the identified result and a tighter identified interval suggests its accuracy advantage over the IPM if the same regularization method is adopted.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the numerically effective modeling of anisotropic material degradation caused by ductile damage. Although standard local anisotropic damage models are relatively well-developed nowadays, their regularization which is required in order to eliminate their mathematical ill-posedness is far from being straightforward. It bears emphasis that this regularization is not only required from a mathematical point of view, since the aforementioned ill-posedness is known to be the source for the pathological mesh dependence as far as the finite element method is concerned. Within this paper, a general local framework for capturing anisotropic material degradation caused by ductile damage is extended to a non-local model by means of a gradient-enhancement. However, in order to achieve a numerically effective implementation, the gradient-enhancement is not implemented in a direct manner, but by means of a micromorphic approximation . By doing so, the implementation of the underlying local model is almost unaffected. Particularly the inequalities resulting from the yield function can be restricted to the local integration point level. Since a naive micromorphic implementation turns out to be unsuitable for regularizing the underlying local model, a novel adaption of the yield function is proposed. It is shown that the resulting single-surface-model is indeed able to capture anisotropic material degradation caused by ductile damage and, furthermore, that the finite element implementation is mesh objective.},

The direction of PSI is obtained directly by the fractional gradient of yield surface and the need for the construction of plastic potential function is bypassed. The magnitude of PSI is calculated based on the effective hardening function and the yield function, where the effective hardening function corresponding to the undamaged material is derived by both the normal hardening/softening function corresponding to the damaged material and the damage variable.

However, the large amount of information required for construction of precise probability distribution is often difficult to obtain for many practical engineering problems. In this paper, an interval field model is proposed to represent spatial uncertainties with insufficient information, in which the variation of the parameter at any location is quantified by an interval with upper and lower bounds. The spatial dependency is measured by a covariance function or a correlation coefficient function, defined for the interval variables at different locations. An interval Karhunen–Loève expansion is formulated for the proposed interval field model, in which the continuous spatial uncertainty is expressed through a series of deterministic functions with uncorrelated interval coefficients. Furthermore, by incorporating the interval field model into the finite element method, interval finite element analysis with spatially uncertain parameters is carried out. Perturbation-based interval finite element methods are developed to evaluate the upper and lower bounds of structural responses such as displacement and stress. A Monte Carlo simulation method is also presented to provide a reference solution for the structural analysis with interval fields. Finally, two numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the interval field model and the interval finite element methods.},

For this purpose, an isogeometric formulation for linear Euler–Bernoulli beams based on the Euler–Rodriguez transformation rule is implemented. Different case studies and numerical examples are presented and the results are validated against “overkill” solutions computed with a commercial finite element software. The results show that the De Boor’s knot placement algorithm typically leads to better approximation errors and is therefore the suggested strategy for this kind of problems.},

  abstract     = {Despite the popularity in modeling complex and arbitrary crack configurations in solids, phase-field damage models suffer from burdensome computational cost. This issue arises largely due to the robust but inefficient alternating minimization (AM) or staggered algorithm usually employed to solve the coupled damage–displacement governing equations. Aiming to tackle this difficulty, we propose in this work, for the first time , to use the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm to solve in a monolithic manner the system of coupled governing equations, rather than the standard Newton one which is notoriously poor for problems involving non-convex energy functional. It is found that, the BFGS algorithm yields identical results to the AM/staggered solver, and is also robust for both brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure with a single or multiple cracks. However, much less iterations are needed to achieve convergence. Furthermore, as the system matrix is less reformed per increment, the quasi-Newton monolithic algorithm is much more efficient than the AM/staggered solver. Representative numerical examples show that the saving in CPU time is about factor 3 ∼ 7 3∼7 , and the larger the problem is, the more saving it gains. As the BFGS monolithic algorithm has been incorporated in many commercial software packages , it can be easily implemented and is thus attractive in the phase-field damage modeling of localized failure in solids.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating inertia forces is a central and complicated task for dynamic analysis of flexible multibody systems (FMS) involving large displacements and rotations. In a number of co-rotational approaches, cubic interpolations are adopted to formulate both inertia and internal forces, where the inertia term may be complicated in derivation and several Gauss points are needed in the numerical integration. The paper presents a high-precision co-rotational formulation of 3D beam elements for dynamic analysis of FMS. The method of switching the rotation vector and its complement is adopted to avoid the singularity problem in spatial finite rotations. In contrast to the traditional co-rotational formulation, the governing equations in the paper are formulated based on the principle of virtual power, without requiring the variation of rotation matrix . In the framework of the proposed co-rotational formulation, the stiffness matrix of small-deformation beam element can be used directly, including the Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko–Reissner beam elements. More essentially, the inertia terms of the beam element are formulated by discretizing the beam element into three lumped masses at the left and right end nodes, and an auxiliary node at the middle point of the beam element, resulting in a lumped mass matrix . The equivalence ensures that the total mass is completely accurate and the moment of inertia is high-precision if the beam element undergoes small elastic deformation in the local coordinate system . In the local coordinate system of co-rotational formulations, small elastic deformation can be guaranteed so that the inertia forces are formulated analytically without needing the Gauss integration. Finally, four numerical examples are considered to evaluate the accuracy of the formulation against to the geometrically exact beam theory and the previous co-rotational beam formulations. The proposed method can give high-precision numerical results from the comparison, even if using a small number of elements.},

  abstract     = {Linking individual cell behavior to changes on the cell population and ultimately tissue scale is a key step towards connecting in vitro laboratory experiments to clinically relevant organ-scale behavior. For example, understanding how an individual tumor cell’s response to drug treatments propagates to the macroscale could help guide clinical decision making when tumors are located in high stakes regions. Based on how dying cells interact, macroscale tumor response can be dominated by tumor shrinkage, tumor damage, change in tumor porosity, or some combination of these phenomena. Here we focus on methods of modeling collective cell behavior with the overall goal of understanding how stochastic cell behavior will ultimately manifest on the cell population scale. To do this, we define and implement an agent-based model problem, introduce novel methods for interpreting simulation results, implement a recently developed technique for conducting a variance-based sensitivity analysis, and investigate key model parameters. Operating within an in silico framework allows us to compare our proposed methods with and without reproducible stochastic variations. This is critical because methods that will be functional for interpreting experimental data must also be able to function when aspects of stochastic variation are not reproducible. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods, we identify important simulation parameters for our agent-based model, show that two-dimensional and three-dimensional results are not directly equivalent, and highlight the macroscale implications of cell shrinkage. Looking forward, we anticipate that the methods and results presented here will contribute to significant future research in modeling stochastic cell behavior in the multiscale setting.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a hierarchical spline based isogeometric topology optimization using moving morphable components (HITO-MMC). In this work, the adaptive isogeometric analysis implemented by hierarchical B-spline is adopted to efficiently and accurately assess the structural performance. An ersatz material model is derived from the Gaussian points of the hierarchy computational mesh to relate the geometric design variables with the objective and constraint of TO. To determine the iterative steps performing local refinement and the elements to be locally refined, a mark strategy is put forward based on the relative error of objective function and the value of topological description function (TDF). The mathematic model of HITO-MMC is reformulated by mapping the global displacement vector into the local displacement vector of the active elements on each level of the hierarchy computational mesh. The proposed HITO-MMC approach has twofold merits: (a) the optimization can be started from a relative coarse computational mesh and the mesh is locally refined during the course of TO, which result into a highly computational efficiency; (b) more accurate results are obtained due to the use of high continuous hierarchical basis functions and denser mesh on structural boundary. Besides, continuous refinement is more effective to generate the optimal design than fixed NURBS mesh, and hierarchical local refinement is superior to continuous global refinement. The effectiveness of the proposed HITO-MMC is validated by a series of 2D and 3D numerical benchmarks.},

The main focus of the paper is creep in shale and how this time-dependent deformation behavior may be quantified across the scales, from nanometers to millimeters. Recognizing the highly heterogeneous nature of shale, we adopt a simplified representation of this material as a mixture of softer matter representing organics and clay, and harder matter representing the inorganic rock matrix . Due to the presence of bedding planes in the rock matrix , anisotropy in both the elastic and inelastic responses is assumed; however, the superimposed softer matter may be taken to be isotropic unless experimental evidence indicates otherwise. Viscoplasticity is considered for the first time in this series of work, in which both the Duvaut–Lions and Perzyna formulations are utilized. The two viscoplastic formulations are shown to predict very similar time-dependent deformation responses . The framework is used to interpret the results of multiscale triaxial laboratory creep tests in organic-rich Barnett shale . Time-dependent strain localization in the form of dilative shear bands is also shown to result from loading with varying strain rates, as well as from creep processes that accommodate the multiscale heterogeneity of shale.},

  abstract     = {FE 2 methods can be used for the analysis of heterogeneous materials at the continuum macroscale while simultaneously accounting for the microstructural details. FE 2 analyses typically comprise two levels of Finite Element (FE) simulations that are performed concurrently. At the macroscale level, the entire heterogeneous material or structure is discretized into homogenized continuum finite elements . Homogenized constitutive relations are not required for the macroscale calculations. Instead they are obtained from microscale level FE simulations on representative volume elements (RVE) of the material where the different phases of the heterogeneous material are explicitly modelled. The paper presents how the two levels of simulations can be collapsed into one by combining the equations governing both levels of FE analyses. The result is a single system of equations in terms of only the microscale level degrees of freedom, d ̃ d̃ . The equations take the familiar form of K d ̃ = f ̃ Kd̃=f̃ . It is shown that K K comprises the stiffness contributions from the RVE meshes scaled by an amount that is dependent on the relative sizes of the macroscale finite element and the RVE mesh, and the geometry of and choice of shape functions for the macroscale finite element. The derived force vector, f ̃ f̃ , is a direct outcome of the usual kinematic relations used to bridge the nodal displacements across the macroscale and microscale. We also show how this Direct FE 2 can be carried out as a single simulation on any commercial FE software that supports multipoint constraints (MPC). The Direct FE 2 2 models are shown to give similar results to full FE meshes of heterogeneities throughout the entire domain with significantly less degrees of freedom. We further demonstrate that in-built capabilities of the commercial codes are naturally available with Direct FE 2 through examples involving large deformation , plasticity and viscoelasticity .},

  abstract     = {The spectral stochastic FEM with local basis functions in the stochastic domain (SL-FEM) is one of the most flexible and accurate stochastic methods, however, also the most computationally expensive. These expenses are traditionally associated with the extra large tangent stiffness matrix and a huge number of elements which need to be re-integrated in every iteration. In this work we incorporate the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) into the SL-FEM, thus performing a drastic reduction of the stiffness matrix . In order to reduce the integration costs by hyperreduction, a novel element-based modification of the discrete empirical interpolation, the so-called element-based empirical approximation method (EDEAM), is developed and combined with the POD. Particular advantages of the SL-FEM for order reduction and hyperreduction compared to other stochastic techniques are discussed. The new reduced-order SL-FEM is applied to the computational homogenization of materials with random geometry of the microstructure, i.e. to a general class of problems exhibiting strongly nonlinear, non-smooth and sometimes discontinuous dependency of the solution on some random parameters. The reduced-order SL-FEM demonstrates a high accuracy and a high solution speed, whereby the solution time for the reduced-order SL-FEM is comparable to the solution time of only one single Monte-Carlo sample.},

  abstract     = {Many physical phenomena, such as mass transport and heat transfer, are modeled by systems of partial differential equations with time-varying and nonlinear boundary conditions. Control inputs and disturbances typically affect the system dynamics at the boundaries and a correct numerical implementation of boundary conditions is therefore crucial. However, numerical simulations of high-order discretized partial differential equations are often too computationally expensive for real-time and many-query analysis. For this reason, model complexity reduction is essential. In this paper, it is shown that the classical reduced basis method is unable to incorporate time-varying and nonlinear boundary conditions. To address this issue, it is shown that, by using a modified surrogate formulation of the reduced basis ansatz combined with a feedback interconnection and a input-related term, the effects of the boundary conditions are accurately described in the reduced-order model. The results are compared with the classical reduced basis method. Unlike the classical method, the modified ansatz incorporates boundary conditions without generating unphysical results at the boundaries. Moreover, a new approximation of the bound and a new estimate for the error induced by model reduction are introduced. The effectiveness of the error measures is studied through simulation case studies and a comparison with existing error bounds and estimates is provided. The proposed approximate error bound gives a finite bound of the actual error, unlike existing error bounds that grow exponentially over time. Finally, the proposed error estimate is more accurate than existing error estimates.},

The newly developed method is also applied to topology optimization of shell structures , which are widely used in engineering applications .

The basis of the C 2 C2 -smooth space can be described as the span of three different types of locally supported functions corresponding to the single patches, edges and vertices of the multi-patch domain. For the selection of the collocation points, which is important for the stability and convergence of the collocation problem, two different choices are numerically investigated. The first approach employs the tensor-product Greville abscissae as collocation points, and shows for the multi-patch case the same convergence behavior as for the one-patch case [1] , which is suboptimal in particular for odd spline degree. The second approach generalizes the concept of superconvergent points from the one-patch case (cf. [2] , [3] , [4] ) to the multi-patch case.

In this fully coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical framework, the skeleton of unsaturated geomaterials is represented by a mesoscale thermo-plastic constitutive model which can capture the spatial heterogeneity of density, suction and the degree of saturation, temperature at the Gauss or integration point level. We implement a monolithic numerical solution for the mathematical framework through the stabilized mixed finite element. The final set of nonlinear equations is solved by Newton’s method with an implicit monolithic approach. The numerical model is first validated against the experimental data of thermal unsaturated geomaterials. Then through several numerical examples, we study the triggering role of material heterogeneity coupled with thermal loads on strain localization in unsaturated geomaterials as boundary value problems. The numerical results demonstrate that material heterogeneity coupled with thermal loads can facilitate the inception of strain localization and dramatically decrease the loading capacity of unsaturated soils.},

In this paper, we propose a collocation-based approach for constructing volumetric parameterization with good quality. Firstly, a harmonic map is computed between a unit cube and the computational domain. Then the task of finding a good parameterization is modeled as a max–min optimization problem with a collocation-based formulation of the bijectivity condition of a map, and an algorithm based on the coarse-to-fine and divide-and-conquer strategy is proposed to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Finally, to further improve the quality of the parameterization, the MIPS (Most Isometric Parameterizations) method is adopted to reduce the conformal distortion of the solved map. We provide several examples to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and to compare our approach with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that our algorithm can produce parameterizations with higher quality than previous approaches especially for complex domains.},

For the first time, forced resonate vibration of the nanoshells including four different geometries of the shells namely spherical, elliptical, hyperbolic and cylindrical has been studied here. The Halpin–Tasi model and a rule of mixture are adopted to estimate the effective material properties due to distribution patterns of GNPs (UD, FG-O and FG-X) The governing equations are obtained through the Hamiltonian principle for general third-order shear deformation shell theory in conjunction with the nonlocal strain gradient theory, and then solved for simply-supported boundaries. Using this work, it is possible to accurately analyze the roles of weight fraction, total number of layers as well as distribution pattern of GNPs, nonlocal parameter, strain gradient parameter, type of doubly-curved nanoshell and geometrical parameters on the resonant phenomena of GNPs reinforced FG-PC nanoshells. The results indicate that resonant phenomenon will occur firstly in the hyperbolic type of the nanoshell, followed by cylindrical, elliptical and spherical ones. In addition, the resonant phenomenon will occur sooner in flat structures compared to curved ones.},

  abstract     = {Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) is taken a step further to render node-dependent kinematics (NDK) capabilities to new layerwise finite elements based on Reissner’s Mixed Variational Theorem (RMVT), especially suited for global–local stress analysis of multilayered plates, ensuring high numerical accuracy and computational efficiency, all together. In the framework of CUF, as introduced originally for multilayered structures, any degree of kinematic refinement can be considered in agreement with Equivalent Single-Layer (ESL) or Layer-Wise (LW) theories to develop advanced finite element models, whether based on the Principle of Virtual Displacements (PVD) or RMVT. The degree of kinematic refinement, which usually holds equally for the entire element, can be taken a step further, by being assigned locally to each of its nodes, making full use of CUF to render NDK capabilities to the elements. Besides, even though the elements can adopt any type of nodal shape functions, high p p -order hierarchical Legendre expansions (HLE) can also be combined with NDK, achieving excellent convergence rates. These capabilities combined, explored first under the PVD, are for once integrated in the proposed elements under RMVT to further benefit accurate stress analysis. These elements can be applied throughout the entire mesh, adapting to local, transitional and global regions straightforwardly, providing high numerical accuracy, locally, with minimal computational efforts, globally. The numerical results focus on stress analysis of multilayered composite plates, including local effects, to demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the proposed RMVT-based LW elements with NDK and HLE combined, considering well-known benchmark three-dimensional exact solutions for assessment.},

The basis of the multiscale approach is the variational multiscale enrichment method that permits analysis of wave propagation in the scale-inseparable condition, i.e., short wave propagation. A spectral coarse-scale representation is proposed to capture the salient transient wave phenomena, such as wave dispersion and band gaps that occur in the short wavelength regime. A material-phase-based model basis reduction strategy is devised at the fine scale to achieve computational efficiency. An important feature of the proposed method is that it does not rely on the classical assumption of separation of scales, which permits its application to a broad range of architectured composites including phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials. Transient elastic wave propagation in two-dimensional periodic structures is investigated. The proposed multiscale approach is verified against direct numerical simulations . The accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach are demonstrated for both phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials.},

This methodology is formulated as a topology optimization problem and is implemented using a level-set approach jointly with topological derivative. The most salient characteristic of this methodology is the imposition of preestablished crystal symmetries to the designed topologies; we integrate a topological optimization formulation with crystal symmetries to design mechanical metamaterials. The computational homogenization of the composite elastic properties is determined using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique. Due to the design domains are the primitive cells of Bravais lattices compatible with the space group imposed to the material layout, we have adapted the FFT technique to compute the effective properties in 3D parallelepiped domains. In this work, to find the topologies satisfying the proposed targets, we test four space groups of the cubic crystal system. Thus, the achievement of composites with effective elasticity tensor having cubic symmetry is guaranteed, and the isotropic response is then enforced by adding only one scalar constraint to the topology optimization problem . To assess the methodology, the following microarchitectures are designed and reported: two auxetic composites, three pentamode materials, and one maximum stiffness composite. With only one exception, all the remaining topologies display effective elastic properties with Zener coefficients approximating to 1.},

  abstract     = {Boundary Element Method frequency sweep analyses in acoustics are usually accompanied by a vast numerical cost of assembling and solving numerous linear systems. In that context, this work proposes a model order reduction technique to mitigate the resulting computational cost of such analyses. First, a series expansion of the Green’s function BEM kernel is leveraged to construct a series of frequency independent matrices. Next, in a model order reduction way, the arising matrices are projected on a reduced basis utilizing a Galerkin projection. By this off-line matrix projection, both the assembly and the solution of the BEM full-size linear systems degenerate into assembling and solving a reduced system for all frequencies. Significant speed-up factors can, thus, be achieved for both operations. The projection basis employed in this model reduction scheme is developed through an Arnoldi algorithm for the BEM systems on a grid of master frequencies. The method is based on Krylov subspaces recycling, as the subspaces produced at master frequencies are recycled to approximate the surface distribution of the acoustic variables on the whole frequency range of interest. Utilizing Krylov subspaces facilitates as well the definition of a robust error estimator that indicates the quality of the reduced system. The performance of the proposed method is assessed for both an exterior and an interior problem for a simple and more complicated geometry respectively.},

  abstract     = {After space discretization employing traditional dynamic isogeometric analysis of structures (composite type) with/without dissimilar materials, the issues that persist include either using numerically non-dissipative time integration algorithms that induces the high frequency participation (oscillations) in solution, or using dissipative algorithms that can dampen the high frequency participation but simultaneously induce significant loss of total energy of the system. To circumvent this dilemma, we instead develop a novel approach via a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based dynamic isogeometric methodology/framework that eliminates (significantly reduces) high-frequency oscillations whilst conserving the physics (e.g., total energy) for dynamic analysis of (composite or hybrid) structures comprising of dissimilar materials. This proposed framework and contributions therein are comprised of three phases, namely, (1) it successfully filters the high-frequency part via first simulating the original IGA semi-discretized structure with dissimilar materials for a few time steps using numerically dissipative type integration schemes, and then obtain the reduced IGA system via POD. (2) We then simulate the reduced IGA system (high-frequency oscillations being eliminated) with instead a numerically non-dissipative algorithm to conserve the underlying physics. As consequence, we successfully preserve the physics (energy) associated with the low frequency modes whilst eliminating/reducing the high-frequency oscillations. (3) Three illustrative examples, with/without dissimilar materials demonstrate the advantages of IGA for applications to structures with dissimilar materials over FEM, in particular, in modeling complex geometries and providing more accurate dynamic solutions with less number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in further advancing the dynamic isogeometric analyses for both linear, and material and/or geometrically nonlinear cases .},

  abstract     = {Landslides and subsequent impulse waves could result in destructive hazards, while most of the existing simulation methods are dependent on over simplifications or excessive hypothesis due to the numerical difficulties. In order to elaborately present the phenomenon of the strong coupling and the mechanism of the energy transfer between the fluid phases and the landslides, a novel resolved computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD–DEM) is proposed in this paper. The fluid phases, including the water and the air, are governed by the full Navier–Stokes equations in the Eulerian framework, whereas the landslide motion is modeled by the discrete element method using the Lagrangian description. The key challenge, namely the representation of the moving interfaces between the fluid and the landslides in different frameworks, is handled by the immersed boundary method. Meanwhile, the free surface of the impulse waves between the water and the air is captured by the conservative Level Set method, and the coupled system is solved by the partitioned method in an iterative way to obtain the strong coupling effect. Compared with the unresolved CFD–DEM method, the proposed approach calculates the fluid field with high resolution and reflects the mutual interaction precisely. After the verification of the overall performance by two benchmark cases, the resolved CFD–DEM method is applied to simulate the landslide movement and the subsequent generated waves in the Lituya Bay.},

The procedure incorporates the advection of a phase function to couple fluids motion and the contact discontinuity, and a modified continuity equation preserving mass conservation by considering the parametric definition of density. Limiting bounds comprise information of interface location, improving responses for flows with low density ratio between fluids. A simple conservative postprocessing restores interface resolution by means of an anisotropic streamlined diffusion equation . Strategies to decrease transition thickness between two fluids are examined, using as background the stability of artificial stratified flows and mass error estimation due to density interpolation. To decrease transition thickness, a novel inexpensive nested-grid refinement is proposed. The method is founded in flux-correction principles, ensuring conservation and monotonicity of the variables during dynamical adaptation. Numerical experiments explore the efficacy of the procedure for demanding tests of phase transport and of the equations of motion for interface problems. The main target of this work is to model the genesis and propagation of air cavities in water pipe flows , thus a substantial part of testing focuses on these challenging phenomena. Weakly compressible fluid assumption is essential for proper momentum transfer between phases in the aforementioned dynamics, particularly for bubble rising process.

  abstract     = {A key feature of living tissues is their capacity to remodel and grow in response to environmental cues. Within continuum mechanics, this process can be captured with the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into growth and elastic contributions. The mechanical and biological response during tissue adaptation is characterized by inherent variability. Accounting for this uncertainty is critical to better understand tissue mechanobiology, and, moreover, it is of practical importance if we aim to develop predictive models for clinical use. However, the current gold standard in computational models of growth and remodeling remains the use of deterministic finite element (FE) simulations. Here we focus on tissue expansion, a popular technique in which skin is stretched by a balloon-like device inducing its growth. We construct FE models of tissue expansion with various levels of detail, and show that a sufficiently broad set of FE simulations from these models can be used to train an accurate and efficient multi-fidelity Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. The approach is not limited to simulation data, rather, it can fuse different kinds of data, including from experiments. The main appeal of the framework relies on the common experience that highly detailed models (or experiments) are more accurate but also more costly, while simpler models (or experiments) can be easily evaluated but are bound to have some error. In these situations, doing uncertainty analysis tasks with the high fidelity models alone is not feasible and, conversely, relying solely on low fidelity approximations is also undesirable. We show that a multi-fidelity GP outperforms the high fidelity GP and low fidelity GP when tested against the most detailed FE model. In turn, having trained the multi-fidelity GP model, we showcase the propagation of uncertainty from the mechanical and biological response parameters to the spatio-temporal growth outcomes. We expect that the methods and applications in this paper will enable future research in parameter calibration under uncertainty and uncertainty propagation in real clinical scenarios involving tissue growth and remodeling.},

  abstract     = {Bone plates have been widely used for the treatment of bone defects and trauma. These fixation plates can stabilize or replace bone tissue to restore appropriate load-bearing functionality. Nevertheless, the use of bone plates may lead to the stress shielding, thereby weakening prosthetic bone substitutes (e.g. bone graft or scaffolds) due to significant change in the biomechanical environment after implantation. To address this issue, we propose a time-dependent topology optimization procedure for the design of bone plates by taking into account bone remodeling . A solid isotropic material penalization (SIMP) model is used to interpolate design variables. The objective is to maximize total bone density within a reconstruction area at the final stage of bone remodeling, subject to a volume constraint of the bone plate and maximum allowable compliance of the prosthetic system. The sensitivity of bone density at the final stage is derived with respect to the topological variables of the plate in a step-wise manner. To facilitate sensitivity analysis, a bone remodeling rule is formulated in two different ways to accommodate a C 1 1 continuity. A jaw reconstruction problem is exemplified in this study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Through this specific case, the non-differentiability issue due to the lazy zone of a remodeling rule is smoothed; and the proposed approach is also compared with that of a time-independent design. The effects of volume fraction and compliance constraints are also investigated to gain further insights into the design of prosthetic substitutes. Together with additive manufacturing technology , the proposed time-dependent topology optimization procedure is expected to form a useful tool for the design of implantable devices ensuring favorable long-term treatment outcomes.},

  abstract     = {As a typical method for hybrid uncertainty analysis, imprecise probability theory recently plays an increasing important role in many engineering systems. To extend its application, this paper proposes a new imprecise probability model and a more efficient numerical method for hybrid uncertainty propagation. Instead of crisp real values, fuzzy sets with membership functions are utilized to describe the epistemic uncertainty in the distribution parameters of input random variables. In the presence of fuzzy distribution parameters, the conventional random moments of output response will include certain fuzzy characteristic. Based on the cut-set operation and fuzzy decomposition theorem, the calculation of fuzzy random moment can be transformed into a series of λ λ -cut interval random moments. To further decrease the huge computational cost caused by the original complex computational model, a relatively simple metamodel with explicit expression is constructed by the radial basis functions. Meanwhile, the bisection points with nestedness property are adopted as the experimental design strategy. Finally, two examples are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method in practical application.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an n-sided polygonal smoothed finite element method (nSFEM) based on gradient smoothing technique is presented for phase field fracture modelling. The phase field approach approximates the crack topology in a diffuse way through an exponential function. A coupled elastic displacement and phase field variational formulation is established by using a Smoothed Galerkin Weak form. Meanwhile, non-matching meshes for local refinement are considered in brittle fracture problems. Non-matching meshes at their interfaces are automatically converted to matching meshes by using present arbitrary sided polygonal elements. In other words, no interface constraint is needed here. In order to validate the feasibility of present nSFEM for brittle fracture problem with non-matching meshes, several numerical examples are employed. The nSFEM can discretize the computational domain in a very flexible manner. Arbitrary sided polygonal elements and non-matching meshes are adopted for comparison. Numerical results validate that the nSFEM shows great potential for phase field fracture problems due to its flexibility in dealing with complex elements shape and non-matching meshes.},

We limit our attention to the standard test problem of minimizing the compliance of a linearly elastic structure subject to a constant forcing. First order tensor product Finite Elements discretize the problem. An elementwise constant material indicator function defines the discretized, elementwise constant, physical density by using filtering and penalization. To alleviate the ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix , due to the variation of the elementwise constant physical density, we precondition the system. We provide a specific spectral analysis for large matrix sizes for the one-dimensional problem with Dirichlet–Neumann conditions in detail, even if most of the mathematical tools apply also in a d d -dimensional setting, d ≥ 2 d≥2 . It is easy to find an elementwise constant material indicator function so that the resulting preconditioned system matrix is singular when allowing the vanishing physical densities. However, for a large class of material indicator functions, the corresponding preconditioned system matrix has a condition number of the same order as the system matrix for the case when the physical density is one in all elements. Finally, we critically report and illustrate results from numerical experiments: as a conclusion, it is indeed possible to solve large-scale topology optimization problems , allowing a vanishing physical density, without encountering ill-conditioned system matrices during the optimization.},

Here, we use the advantages of isogeometric analysis (IGA) and develop a three-dimensional higher-order continuous solid-like shell (SLS) model. Since the continuity of material orientation is crucial in numerical analysis of anisotropic shells , non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) are used to establish a smooth interpolation through the thickness and on the middle surface of the shell for both the geometry and displacement fields. The developed isogeometric SLS is coupled with Bézier extraction operators to represent continuity between multi-patch anisotropic domains. Numerical solutions for composite laminated shells with different boundary conditions are compared with analytical solutions or other solutions from the literature. In this context, we study the influence of span-to-thickness ratios, different shapes, modulus ratios, member aspect ratios and various layouts on the mechanical response. With the presented model, we were able to obtain the twisting mode shapes, which are not frequently observed in orthotropic and isotropic ones.

  abstract     = {In this article, we present a 3D adaptive method for thermoelastic problems based on goal-oriented error estimation where the error is measured with respect to a pointwise quantity of interest. We developed a method for a posteriori error estimation and mesh adaptation based on dual weighted residual (DWR) method relying on the duality principles and consisting of an adjoint problem solution. Here, we consider the application of the derived estimator and mesh refinement to two-/three dimensional (2D/3D) thermo-mechanical multifield problems. In this study, the goal is considered to be given by singular pointwise functions, such as the point value or point value derivative at a specific point of interest (PoI). An adaptive algorithm has been adopted to refine the mesh to minimize the goal in the quantity of interest. The mesh adaptivity procedure based on the DWR method is performed by adaptive local h h -refinement/coarsening with allowed hanging nodes. According to the proposed DWR method, the error contribution of each element is evaluated. In the refinement process, the contribution of each element to the goal error is considered as the mesh refinement criterion. In this study, we substantiate the accuracy and performance of this method by several numerical examples with available analytical solutions. Here, 2D and 3D problems under thermo-mechanical loadings are considered as benchmark problems. To show how accurately the derived estimator captures the exact error in the evaluation of the pointwise quantity of interest, in all examples, considering the analytical solutions, the goal error effectivity index as a standard measure of the quality of an estimator is calculated. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and show the optimal behavior of the employed refinement method, the results of different conventional error estimators and refinement techniques (e.g., global uniform refinement, Kelly, and weighted Kelly techniques) are used for comparison.},

  abstract     = {Many mathematical models of computational fluid dynamics involve transport of conserved quantities, which must lie in a certain range to be physically meaningful. The analytical or numerical solution u u of a scalar conservation law is said to be bound-preserving if global bounds u ∗ u∗ and u ∗ u∗ exist such that u ∗ ≤ u ≤ u ∗ u∗≤u≤u∗ holds in the domain of definition. These bounds must be known a priori. To enforce such inequality constraints at least for element averages in the context of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, the numerical fluxes must be defined and constrained in an appropriate manner. In this work, we introduce a general framework for calculating fluxes that produce non-oscillatory DG approximations and preserve relevant global bounds for element averages even if the analytical solution of the PDE violates them due to modeling errors. The proposed methodology is based on a combination of flux and slope limiting. The (optional) slope limiter adjusts the gradients to impose local bounds on pointwise values of the high-order DG solution, which is used to calculate the fluxes. The flux limiter constrains changes of element averages so as to prevent violations of global bounds. Since manipulations of the target flux may introduce a consistency error, it is essential to guarantee that physically admissible fluxes remain unchanged. We propose two kinds of flux limiters, which meet this requirement. The first one is of monolithic type and its time-implicit version requires the iterative solution of a nonlinear problem. Only a fully converged solution is provably bound-preserving. The time-explicit version of this limiter is subject to a time step restriction, which we derive in this article. The second limiter is an iterative version of the multidimensional flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm and works as postprocessed correction scheme. This fractional step limiting approach guarantees that each iterate is bound-preserving but avoidable consistency errors may occur if the iterative process is terminated too early. Each iterate depends only on local information of the previous iterate. This concept of limiting the numerical fluxes is also applicable to finite volume methods. Practical applicability of the proposed flux limiters as well as the benefits of using an optional slope limiter are demonstrated by numerical studies for the advection equation (hyperbolic, linear) and the Cahn–Hilliard equation (parabolic, nonlinear) for first-order polynomials. While both flux limiters work for arbitrary order polynomials, we discuss the construction of bound-preserving slope limiters, and show numerical studies only for first-order polynomials.},

Hence, the method is suitable for modeling deformation of both block and truly (self) periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). The primal displacement field and macro-strain are the only unknowns because the method eliminates the Lagrange multiplier (LM) enforcement of the kinematic constraint. Rigorous derivation of the method provides a framework to accommodate either the macro-stress or macro-strain as the driver of the microscale boundary value problem. The method is developed first for finite deformations and then specialized to small deformation kinematics. Algorithmic modifications to the method are also studied for their effects on tangent symmetry and convergence rate. The results from numerical studies for isotropic and anisotropic materials show that the proposed method is robust, accurate, stable and variationally consistent for modeling complicated conforming and nonconforming RVEs.},

An effective optimization algorithm is developed for dealing with various issues and difficulties involved in the solution. The Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (K–S) aggregation function is introduced to approximate the maximum von Mises stress together with a stability transformation method (STM) based correction scheme to reduce the approximation error. A smooth buckling aggregation function is constructed with a number of low-order buckling load factors to replace the original possibly non-smooth buckling constraints. To improve the robustness of the algorithm and achieve better designs, a continuation strategy for several optimization parameters is employed. With all these techniques, stable convergence of the iterative solution process is achieved. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {We introduce manifold-based basis functions for isogeometric analysis of surfaces with arbitrary smoothness, prescribed C 0 C0 continuous creases and boundaries. The utility of the manifold-based surface construction techniques in isogeometric analysis was demonstrated in Majeed and Cirak (CMAME, 2017). The respective basis functions are derived by combining differential–geometric manifold techniques with conformal parametrisations and the partition of unity method. The connectivity of a given unstructured quadrilateral control mesh in R 3 R3 is used to define a set of overlapping charts. Each vertex with its attached elements is assigned a corresponding conformally parametrised planar chart domain in R 2 R2 so that a quadrilateral element is present on four different charts. On the collection of unconnected chart domains, the partition of unity method is used for approximation . The transition functions required for navigating between the chart domains are composed out of conformal maps . The necessary smooth partition of unity, or blending, functions for the charts are assembled from tensor-product B-spline pieces and require in contrast to earlier constructions no normalisation. Creases are introduced across user tagged edges of the control mesh. Planar chart domains that include creased edges or are adjacent to the domain boundary require special local polynomial approximants in the partition of unity method. Three different types of chart domain geometries are necessary to consider boundaries and arbitrary number and arrangement of creases. The new chart domain geometries are chosen so that it becomes trivial to establish local polynomial approximants that are always C 0 C0 continuous across the tagged edges. The derived non-rational manifold-based basis functions correspond to the vertices of the mesh and may have an arbitrary number of creases and prescribed smoothness. This makes them particularly well suited for isogeometric analysis of Kirchhoff–Love thin shells with kinks, which require C 1 C1 continuous basis functions that are C 0 C0 continuous across the kinks. We demonstrate the convergence and utility of the new basis functions with linear and nonlinear beam, plate and shell examples.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we introduce a new residual distribution (RD) framework for the design of bound-preserving high-resolution finite element schemes. The continuous and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of the linear advection equation are modified to construct local extremum diminishing (LED) approximations. To that end, we perform mass lumping and redistribute the element residuals in a manner which guarantees the LED property. The hierarchical correction procedure for high-order Bernstein finite element discretizations involves localization to subcells and definition of bound-preserving weights for subcell contributions. Using strong stability preserving (SSP) Runge–Kutta methods for time integration, we prove the validity of discrete maximum principles under CFL-like time step restrictions. The low-order version of our method has roughly the same accuracy as the one derived from a piecewise (multi)-linear approximation on a submesh with the same nodal points. In high-order extensions, we use an element-based flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm which can be interpreted as a nonlinear RD scheme. The proposed LED corrections are tailor-made for matrix-free implementations which avoid the rapidly growing cost of matrix assembly for high-order Bernstein elements. The results for 1D, 2D, and 3D test problems compare favorably to those obtained with the best matrix-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Developing an accurate nonlinear reduced order model from simulation data has been an outstanding research topic for many years. For many physical systems , data collection is very expensive and the optimal data distribution is not known in advance. Thus, maximizing the information gain remains a grand challenge . In a recent paper, Bhattacharjee and Matouš (2016) proposed a manifold-based nonlinear reduced order model for multiscale problems in mechanics of materials . Expanding this work here, we develop a novel sampling strategy based on the physics/pattern-guided data distribution. Our adaptive sampling strategy relies on enrichment of sub-manifolds based on the principal stretches and rotational sensitivity analysis. This novel sampling strategy substantially decreases the number of snapshots needed for accurate reduced order model construction (i.e., ∼ 5 × ∼5× reduction of snapshots over Bhattacharjee and Matouš (2016)). Moreover, we build the nonlinear manifold using the displacement rather than deformation gradient data. We provide rigorous verification and error assessment. Finally, we demonstrate both localization and homogenization of the multiscale solution on a large particulate composite unit cell.},

The formulation concurrently achieves mesh size objectivity and multiscale consistency by establishing analytical relationships between the microstructure size and the macroscale element size.

  abstract     = {One of the recent fields of interest in computational homogenisation is the development of model order reduction frameworks to address the significant computational costs enabling fast and accurate evaluation of the microstructural volume element. Model order reduction techniques are applied to computationally challenging analyses of detailed micro- and or macro-structural problems to reduce both computational time and memory usage. In order to alleviate the costly integration, a wavelet-reduced order model for one-dimensional microstructural problems was presented in van Tuijl et al. (2019). This novel approach addresses both the large number of degrees of freedom and integration costs and provides control on errors in the microstructural fields. In this work, this wavelet reduced order model is extended to a multi-dimensional framework and benchmarked for more realistic multi-scale problems. The Wavelet-Reduced Order Model consists of two reduction steps. First, a Reduced Order Model is constructed to reduce the dimensionality of the microstructural model. Second, a wavelet representation is applied to reduce the integration costs of the microstructural model, whilst maintaining control over the local integration error. The multi-dimensional Wavelet-Reduced Order Model is demonstrated for a set of two-dimensional path-dependent microstructural models, evaluating their accuracy and reduction with respect to the full order models on the microstructural and homogenised fields.},

In this work, the attention is focused on those formulations approximating mode II fractures (shear fractures). In these models, only the deviatoric part of the strain elastic energy, penalized by the phase-field, drives the crack onset and evolution, whereas the elastic hydrostatic energetic contribution has no influence on the failure process. Consequently, cracks evolves according to the von Mises–Hencky–Hüber, also known as J2, failure criterion. Unfortunately, volumetric locking problem arises in the damaged zones if classical numerical solution strategies are adopted. As a consequence, damage localization bands appear with an excessive thickness, thus overestimating the fracture energy. In addition, the crack path geometry may be erroneously described because of the loss of precision of the displacement field in damaged zones. To circumvent these drawbacks, two numerical techniques are proposed, namely selective reduced integration and mixed displacement/pressure formulation, and their effectiveness evidenced by a numerical investigation.},

Two new learning functions are developed as guidelines for selecting new training samples at each iteration. The proposed learning functions and corresponding stopping criteria are directly linked to system probability of failure; this allows the proposed method to select new training samples efficiently To determine the lower and upper bounds of system probability of failure, the limit-state functions in the entire uncertainty space of interest are accurately constructed while avoiding complicated nested optimizations. The proposed method has the following advantages: (1) the learning functions and stopping criteria are directly linked to system probability of failure, and the structure importance of components is also considered; (2) it requires fewer samples to achieve accurate results, and can be applied to small system probability of failure; (3) it is easy to use for extremely complex systems (e.g., bridge systems); (4) it can be applied to a system with multiple failure modes and mixed variables (e.g., mixture of random and p-box variables). The capabilities and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through four numerical examples ; results show that it has high applicability and accuracy.},

The model emphasizes three-dimensional geometry of the vascular network and integration with in vivo imaging techniques by use of the phase-field approach. We show that our method allows computing directly on the photoacoustic imaging raw data, avoiding the mesh generation process, which is the usual bottleneck for integration of computational methods and imaging data.

  abstract     = {This manuscript introduces a unified mathematical framework to replicate both desiccation-induced and hydraulic fracturing in low-permeable unsaturated porous materials observed in experiments. The unsaturated porous medium is considered as a three-phase solid–liquid–gas effective medium of which each constituent occupies a fraction of the representative elementary volume. As such, an energy-minimization-based phase-field model (PFM) is formulated along with the Biot’s poroelasticity theory to replicate the sub-critical crack growth in the brittle regime . Unlike hydraulic fracturing where the excess pore liquid pressure plays an important role at the onset and propagation of cracks, desiccation cracks are mainly driven by deformation induced by water retention. Therefore, the wettability of the solid skeleton may affect the evolution of the capillary pressure (suction) and change the path-dependent responses of the porous media. This air–water–solid interaction may either hinder or enhance the cracking occurrence. This difference of capillary effect on crack growth during wetting and drying is replicated by introducing retention-sensitive degradation mechanisms in our phase field fracture approach. To replicate the hydraulic behaviors of the pore space inside the host matrix and that of the cracks, the path-dependent changes of the intrinsic permeability due to crack growth and porosity changes are introduced to model the flow conduit in open and closed cracks. Numerical examples of drying-induced and hydraulic fracturing demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to capture different fracture patterns, which qualitatively agrees with the fracture mechanisms of related experiments documented in the literature.},

However, distorted polyhedral elements cannot be effectively used in standard finite element methods (FEM) without extra complicated treatments, due to the hanging nodes on the element edges and complex shape of polyhedral elements. On the contrary, the hanging nodes and complex shape of the elements can be naturally dealt with in the smoothed finite element method (S-FEM). This paper, utilizes the octree method to automatically and efficiently generate unstructured polyhedral meshes, using the standard tessellation language (STL). We develop three S-FEM models for octree meshes, using all existing node-based, edge-based and face-based smoothing domains. A subdomain smoothing technique is developed to re-cut the smoothing domain (SD), which simplifies the process of smoothing domain formation. The shapes of the subdomains have some common geometries that are much easier to handle, making use of the good features offered by the S-FEM formulation. The introduction of subdomains does not affect the results of the calculations, and the properties of the three S-FEMs are still preserved. Several demonstration examples are presented to verify the efficiency of the present S-FEM models.},

  abstract     = {In this work we extend our recently proposed adaptive refinement strategy for h p hp -finite element approximations of elliptic problems by taking into account an inexact algebraic solver. Namely, on each level of refinement and on each iteration of an (arbitrary) iterative algebraic solver, we compute guaranteed a posteriori error bounds on the algebraic and the total errors in energy norm. The algebraic error is the difference between the inexact discrete solution obtained by an iterative algebraic solver and the (unavailable) exact discrete solution. On the other hand, the total error stands for the difference between the inexact discrete solution and the (unavailable) exact solution of the partial differential equation . For the algebraic error upper bound, we crucially exploit the whole nested hierarchy of h p hp -finite element spaces created by the adaptive algorithm, whereas the remaining parts of the total error upper and lower bounds are computed using the finest space only. These error bounds allow us to formulate adaptive stopping criteria for the algebraic solver ensuring that the algebraic error does not significantly contribute to the total error. Next, we use the total error bound to mark mesh vertices for refinement via Dörfler’s bulk-chasing criterion. On patches associated with marked vertices only, we solve two separate primal finite element problems with homogeneous Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary conditions, which serve to decide between h h -, p p -, or h p hp -refinement. Altogether, we show that these ingredients lead to a computable guaranteed bound on the ratio of the total errors of the inexact approximations between successive refinements (the error reduction factor), when the stopping criteria are satisfied. Finally, in a series of numerical experiments, we investigate the practicality of the proposed adaptive solver, the accuracy of our bound on the reduction factor, and show that exponential convergence rates are achieved even in the presence of an inexact algebraic solver.},

  abstract     = {Numerical solution of the equations governing multiphase porous media flow is challenging. A common approach to improve the performance of iterative non-linear solvers for these problems is to introduce artificial diffusion. Here, we present a mass conservative artificial diffusion that accelerates the non-linear solver but vanishes when the solution is converged. The vanishing artificial diffusion term is saturation dependent and is larger in regions of the solution domain where there are steep saturation gradients. The non-linear solver converges more slowly in these regions because of the highly non-linear nature of the solution. The new method provides accurate results while significantly reducing the number of iterations required by the non-linear solver. It is particularly valuable in reducing the computational cost of highly challenging numerical simulations, such as those where physical capillary pressure effects are dominant. Moreover, the method allows converged solutions to be obtained for Courant numbers that are at least two orders of magnitude larger than would otherwise be possible.},

This paper develops an efficient and rapid computational method to simulate fast flash-type single-pulse Lidar, based on decomposition of a Lidar pulse into a group of rays, which are then tracked and processed. This allows one to quickly quantify the uncertainty in the response by identifying regions where the return signal will be erroneous due to multiple reflections.},

  abstract     = {A second-order face-centred finite volume method (FCFV) is proposed. Contrary to the more popular cell-centred and vertex-centred finite volume (FV) techniques, the proposed method defines the solution on the faces of the mesh (edges in two dimensions). The method is based on a mixed formulation and therefore considers the solution and its gradient as independent unknowns. They are computed solving a cell-by-cell problem after the solution at the faces is determined. The proposed approach avoids the need of reconstructing the solution gradient, as required by cell-centred and vertex-centred FV methods. This strategy leads to a method that is insensitive to mesh distortion and stretching. The current method is second-order and requires the solution of a global system of equations of identical size and identical number of non-zero elements when compared to the recently proposed first-order FCFV. The formulation is presented for Poisson and Stokes problems . Numerical examples are used to illustrate the approximation properties of the method as well as to demonstrate its potential in three dimensional problems with complex geometries . The integration of a mesh adaptive procedure in the FCFV solution algorithm is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Commercial finite element modeling packages do not have the tools necessary to effectively incorporate the complex anisotropic and heterogeneous material properties typical of the biological tissues of the eye. We propose a mesh-free approach to incorporate realistic material properties into finite element models of individual human eyes. The method is based on the idea that material parameters can be estimated or measured at so called control points, which are arbitrary and independent of the finite element mesh. The mesh-free approach approximates the heterogeneous material parameters at the Gauss points of each finite element while the boundary value problem is solved using the standard finite element method. The proposed method was applied to an eye-specific model a human posterior pole and optic nerve head. We demonstrate that the method can be used to effectively incorporate experimental measurements of the lamina cribrosa micro-structure into the eye-specific model. It was convenient to define characteristic material orientations at the anterior and posterior scleral surface based on the eye-specific geometry of each sclera. The mesh-free approach was effective in approximating these characteristic material directions with smooth transitions across the sclera. For the first time, the method enabled the incorporation of the complex collagen architecture of the peripapillary sclera into an eye-specific model including the recently discovered meridional fibers at the anterior surface and the depth dependent width of circumferential fibers around the scleral canal. The model results suggest that disregarding the meridional fiber region may lead to an underestimation of local strain concentrations in the retina. The proposed approach should simplify future studies that aim to investigate collagen remodeling in the sclera and optic nerve head or in other biological tissues with similar challenges.},

  abstract     = {A finite element framework is presented in which grains within a polycrystalline microstructure are pre-discretized into lamellar regions that become candidates to deform by twinning. This enables the mapping of the motion due to twinning on geometrically proper regions. At some point in the loading of the polycrystal , a twin is triggered, at which point the nodes within a twin region are rapidly mapped to their twinned location, the region’s crystal lattice is reoriented, and the remainder of the body deforms by means of crystallographic slip to enforce mechanical equilibrium. The framework allows for both the onset of twinning and twin growth, and is intended to serve as a test bed for investigating models proposed for these phenomena. In this paper, the framework is described and simulations are performed to demonstrate its ability to handle the large, fast deformation of twinning within a targeted grain of a polycrystalline aggregate. Various simulations are performed, where the initial twin width and the point of twin activation in the loading history are parameterized. Deformation fields in and around the twinned region are inspected after a twinning event, and changes in local stress states are discussed in light of global and local energetic metrics.},

Elements belonging to the remaining clusters are subjected to a hyper-reduction step using the Empirical Cubature Method (ECM).

Firstly, ε ε -relaxed stress criterion and global stress aggregation approach are involved to circumvent the stress singularity and multi-constrained problems. Combined the orthogonal polynomial expansion with the set allocation theorem, an interval dimension-by-dimension method (IDDM) is proposed to determine feasible bounds of structural responses under unknown-but-bounded load and material uncertainties. The interval reliability (IR) is then applied to handle the limited reliability constraints of concerned displacements and the global stress measure. Meanwhile, the adjoint-vector based sensitivity analysis of presented IR indexes to design variables is further discussed to avoid expensive computational cost from the large-scale nature of variable updating. The usage, rationality, and superiority of the developed methodology are demonstrated by several case applications.},

Third, fracture in an HCP bicrystal was simulated and the impact of crystal orientation on the crack paths and stress–strain curves was studied.

The key idea is to enclose the inhomogeneity of the media by well separated artificial boundaries and then apply purely outgoing wave decomposition for the scattering field outside the enclosed region. As a result, the original multiple scattering problem can be decomposed into a finite number of single scattering problems, where each of them communicates with the other scattering problems only through its surrounding artificial boundary. Accordingly, they can be solved in a parallel manner at each iteration. This framework enjoys a great flexibility in using different combinations of iterative algorithms and single scattering problem solvers. The spectral element method seamlessly integrated with the non-reflecting boundary condition and the GMRES iteration is advocated and implemented in this work. The convergence of the proposed method is proved by using the compactness of involved integral operators. Ample numerical examples are presented to show its high accuracy and efficiency.},

Theoretical energy absorption capacity is a key concept to describe damping properties of architectured metamaterials, which reflects the maximum energy absorption per element if a bi-stable chain contains infinite buckling elements. To achieve extreme damping design, topology optimization algorithm is formulated to achieve extreme theoretical energy absorption capacity within a prescribed design domain. An approximate mathematical expression for the energy absorption capacity is formulated with rigorous derivation of sensitivities. Element strain energy in P-norm formulation is constrained at limit points to alleviate material softening failure under large strain. Four design cases are presented and discussed in detail.

  abstract     = {Latest developments in high-strength Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners with in-built high resolution, have dramatically enhanced the ability of clinicians to diagnose tumours and rare illnesses. However, their high-strength transient magnetic fields induce unwanted eddy currents in shielding components, which result in fast vibrations, noise, imaging artefacts and, ultimately, heat dissipation, boiling off the helium used to super-cool the magnets. Optimum MRI scanner design requires the capturing of complex electro-magneto-mechanical interactions with high fidelity computational tools. During production cycles, this is known to be extremely expensive due to the large number of configurations that need to be tested. There is an urgent need for the development of new cost-effective methods whereby previously performed computations can be assimilated as training solutions of a surrogate digital twin model to allow for real-time simulations. In this paper, a Reduced Order Modelling technique based on the Proper Generalised Decomposition method is presented for the first time in the context of MRI scanning design, with two distinct novelties. First, the paper derives from scratch the offline higher dimensional parametrised solution process of the coupled electro-magneto-mechanical problem at hand and, second, a regularised adaptive methodology is proposed for the circumvention of numerical singularities associated with the ill-conditioning of the discrete system in the vicinity of resonant modes. A series of numerical examples are presented in order to illustrate, motivate and demonstrate the validity and flexibility of the considered approach.},

To evaluate the residual of the momentum balance equation , one requires the divergence of the Cauchy stress. Solid constitutive models used in simulations of extreme events involving shocks typically specify the Cauchy stress in terms of a local rate equation rather than an explicit formula involving the current deformation gradient and/or strain rate; unlike in widely-used models for fluid mechanics, there is usually no closed-form expression for spatial derivatives of the solid Cauchy stress. We therefore investigate the evolution of stress gradients given rate-form models involving various objective rates of Cauchy stress. The rate equations we derive for the stress gradient are then integrated numerically to furnish the stress divergence needed to define the shock viscosity. The properties of this shock viscosity are demonstrated in benchmark problems using Lagrangian isogeometric analysis and an immersed isogeometric–meshfree simulation framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient and highly-parallelizable preconditioning technique for Newton–Krylov solvers. The proposed method can be viewed as a generalization of the implicit line smoothing technique by extending the groups of implicitly-solved unknowns from lines to blocks. The blocks are formed by partitioning the computational domain such that the strong connections between unknowns are not broken by the partition boundaries. The ILU algorithm is used to obtain an approximate (or exact) factorization for each block. Then, a block-Jacobi iteration is formulated in which the degrees of freedom within the blocks are solved implicitly. To stabilize the iterations for high-CFL systems, a dual-CFL strategy, with a lower CFL in the preconditioner matrix, is developed. The performance of the proposed method as a linear preconditioner is demonstrated for second- and third-order steady-state solutions of Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations on the NASA Common Research Model (CRM), including the high-lift configuration. For the studied test cases, it is shown that in comparison with the traditional ILU(k) method, the proposed preconditioner requires significantly less memory and it can result in notably faster solutions.},

  abstract     = {The Peridynamic Petrov–Galerkin (PPG) method is a meshfree approach based on the peridynamic integro-differential form of the momentum equation. The spurious oscillations in the common peridynamic correspondence formulation are investigated. They occur due to an inadmissible linearized mapping of the family deformation field. This leads to a generalized correspondence formulation, which contains the common formulation as a special case. It is based on the weak form of the peridynamic momentum equation. Test and trial function requirements are examined which ensure an exact imposition of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and Weighted Least Square (WLS) shape functions as well as Local Maximum Entropy (LME) approximants are utilized to examine the PPG Method. A consistent linearization is provided, which can also be used to speed up common implicit peridynamic correspondence codes. It is used in an implicit quasistatic framework to investigate the impact of different shape function combinations. Test cases show that low-energy modes can be prevented by the PPG Method and highlight the fast convergence and stability.},

  abstract     = {This work discusses an efficient formulation of a geometrically exact three-dimensional beam which can be used in dynamical simulations involving large displacements, collisions and non-linear materials. To this end, we base our model on the shear-flexible Cosserat rod theory and we implement it in the context of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). According to the IGA approach, the centerline of the beam is parameterized using splines; in our work the rotation of the section is parameterized by a spline interpolation of quaternions, and time integration of rotations is performed using the exponential map of quaternions. Aiming at an efficient and robust simulation of contacts, we propose the adoption of a non-smooth dynamics formulation based on differential-variational inequalities. The model has been implemented in an open-source physics simulation library that can simulate actuators, finite elements , rigid bodies , constraints, collisions and frictional contacts . This beam model has been tested on various benchmarks in order to assess its validity in non-linear static and dynamic analysis; in all cases the model behaved consistently with theoretical results and experimental data .},

  abstract     = {Cohesive fracture is among the few techniques able to model complex fracture nucleation and propagation with a sharp (nonsmeared) representation of the crack. Implicit time-stepping schemes are often favored in mechanics due to their ability to take larger time steps in quasistatic and moderate dynamic problems . Furthermore, initially rigid cohesive models are typically preferred when the location of the crack is not known in advance, since initially elastic models artificially lower the material stiffness . It is challenging to include an initially rigid cohesive model in an implicit scheme because the initiation of fracture corresponds to a nondifferentiability of the underlying potential. In this work, an interior-point method is proposed for implicit time stepping of initially rigid cohesive fracture. It uses techniques developed for convex second-order cone programming for the nonconvex problem at hand. The underlying cohesive model is taken from Papoulia (2017) and is based on a nondifferentiable energy function. That previous work proposed an algorithm based on successive smooth approximations to the nondifferential objective for solving the resulting optimization problem . It is argued herein that cone programming can capture the nondifferentiability without smoothing, and the resulting cone formulation is amenable to interior-point algorithms. A further benefit of the formulation is that other conic inequality constraints are straightforward to incorporate. Computational results are provided showing that certain contact constraints can be easily handled and that the method is practical.},

  abstract     = {The integration of data into engineering models involving uncertain and spatially varying parameters is oftentimes key to obtaining accurate predictions. Bayesian inference is effective in achieving such an integration. Uncertainties related to spatially varying parameters are typically represented through random fields discretized into a finite number of random variables. The prior correlation length and variance of the field, as well as the number of terms in the random field discretization, have a considerable impact on the outcome of the Bayesian inference, which has received little attention in the literature. Here, we investigate the implications of different choices in the prior random field model on the solution of Bayesian inverse problems. We employ the Karhunen–Loève expansion for the representation of random fields. We show that a higher-order Karhunen–Loève discretization is required in Bayesian inverse problems as compared to standard prior random field representations, since the updated fields are non-homogeneous. Furthermore, the smoothing effect of the forward operator has a large influence on the posterior solution, particularly if we are analyzing quantities of interest that are sensitive to local random fluctuations of the inverse quantity. This is also reflected in posterior predictions, such as the estimation of rare event probabilities. We illustrate these effects analytically through a 1D cantilever beam with spatially varying flexibility, and numerically using a 2D linear elasticity example where the Young’s modulus is spatially variable.},

The approach proposed here, valid for 2D and 3D scenarios, allows a seamless integration with CAD preprocessors .

  abstract     = {In the phase-field modeling of fracture in brittle and quasi-brittle solids, it is crucial to represent the asymmetric tensile/compressive material behavior . Existing phase-field models generally adopt either an intuitive split of the free energy density without capturing the crack boundary conditions properly or an ad hoc hybrid formulation at the loss of variational consistency. To address this issue, this work presents a variationally consistent phase-field anisotropic damage model within the framework of the unified phase-field theory for brittle fracture and quasi-brittle failure Wu [1] , [2] . Consistent with the variational approach to fracture, the positive/negative projection of the effective stress in energy norm Wu and Cervera [3] is adopted, minimizing the tensile part of the stored energy that drives crack evolution. A rounded-Rankine criterion naturally emerges to realistically characterize localized failure of brittle and quasi-brittle solids, with no need of ad hoc assumptions. A mixed-mode cohesive zone model is recovered upon strain localization , with the involved parameters determined from the analytical solution of a softening bar under constrained stretching. Representative numerical examples show that the proposed model can capture arbitrary cracks propagation in solids independently of the mesh discretization and length scale parameter. Remarkably, the spurious stress locking, which is notoriously accompanied with classical anisotropic damage models, is not exhibited.},

The PISA method, based on Color Doppler echocardiography, is widely used in the clinical setting to estimate various relevant quantities related to the severity of the disease. In this paper, the use of a pipeline to quickly generate image-based numerical simulation of intracardiac hemodynamics is investigated. The pipeline capabilities are evaluated on a database of twelve volunteers. Full pre-processing is achieved completely automatically in 55 min, on average, with small registration errors compared to the image spatial resolution. This pipeline is then used to study the intracardiac hemodynamics in the presence of diseased mitral valve. A strong variability among the simulated cases, mainly due to the valve geometry and regurgitation specifics, is found. The results from those numerical simulations are used to assess the potential limitations of the PISA method with respect to different MR types. While the PISA method provides reasonable estimates in the case of a simple circular regurgitation, it is shown that unsatisfying estimates are obtained in the case of non-circular leakage. Moreover, it is shown that the choice of high aliasing velocities can lead to difficulties in quantifying MR.},

The key is to formulate the relative displacement between particles in terms of the strain tensor approximated locally rather than the direct use of displacements at peridynamic particles. It is critically proved that bond stretch is independent of the rigid rotation tensor . Local strain is thus required only for approximating local shear deformation . The model is currently implemented for static problems in a hybrid manner and in a finite element/peridynamics coupling framework, the latter allowing direct and correct imposition of boundary conditions. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method in numerical accuracy and computational efficiency, various examples are performed with varying Poisson’s ratio and comparisons with the results from finite element analysis are presented.},

This study is focused on the treatment of solid wall boundary conditions for one of those schemes, namely the least squares MPS (LSMPS) scheme, and proposes a new technique to deal with no-slip and free-slip wall boundary conditions. With the proposed treatment, wall geometries are expressed by surface meshes, i.e. polygons in 3D and line segments in 2D. Thus, complicated geometries can be handled easily. Based on a Taylor series expansion , wall boundary conditions are incorporated into the differential operators acting on fluid particles located in the vicinity of a wall, through a least squares approach. As a consequence, Neumann boundary conditions can be treated quite efficiently. To verify consistency of the proposed discretization scheme, a convergence study was carried out. As numerical examples , Couette flow , plane Poiseuille flow , gravity-driven flow in a 3D square duct , a rigid rotation problem, Taylor–Green vortices and lid-driven cavity flow have been calculated using the proposed boundary treatment, with both no-slip and free-slip conditions applied. As a result, the present method agreed well with the reference solutions, which verified its computational accuracy .},

  abstract     = {Advances in computational science offer a principled pipeline for predictive modeling of cardiovascular flows and aspire to provide a valuable tool for monitoring, diagnostics and surgical planning. Such models can be nowadays deployed on large patient-specific topologies of systemic arterial networks and return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse wave propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious pre-processing and calibration procedures that typically induce a significant computational cost, thus hampering their clinical applicability. In this work we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless synthesis of non-invasive in-vivo measurement techniques and computational flow dynamics models derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm by showing how one-dimensional models of pulsatile flow can be used to constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their predictions satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy and scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can return physically consistent predictions for velocity, pressure and wall displacement pulse wave propagation, all without the need to employ conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also provide a relatively cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters that are required for the calibration of traditional computational models. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a series of prototype benchmarks, as well as a realistic clinical case involving in-vivo measurements near the aorta/carotid bifurcation of a healthy human subject.},

  abstract     = {The material point method is ideally suited to modelling problems involving large deformations where conventional mesh-based methods would struggle. However, total and updated Lagrangian approaches are unsuitable and non-ideal, respectively, in terms of formulating equilibrium for the method. This is due to the basis functions, and particularly the derivatives of the basis functions, of material point methods normally being defined on an unformed, and sometimes regular, background mesh. It is possible to map the basis function spatial derivatives using the deformation at a material point but this introduces additional algorithm complexity and computational expense. This paper presents a new Lagrangian statement of equilibrium which is ideal for material point methods as it satisfies equilibrium on the undeformed background mesh at the start of a load step. The formulation is implemented using a quasi-static implicit algorithm which includes the derivation of the consistent tangent to achieve optimum convergence of the global equilibrium iterations. The method is applied to a number of large deformation elasto-plastic problems, with a specific focus of the convergence of the method towards analytical solutions with the standard, generalised interpolation and CPDI2 material point methods. For the generalised interpolation method, different domain updating methods are investigated and it is shown that all of the current methods are degenerative under certain simple deformation fields. A new domain updating approach is proposed that overcomes these issues. The proposed material point method framework can be applied to all existing material point methods and adopted for implicit and explicit analysis, however its advantages are mainly associated with the former.},

  abstract     = {A nonlocal operator method is proposed which is generally applicable for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) of mechanical problems. The nonlocal operator can be regarded as the integral form “equivalent” to the differential form in the sense of a nonlocal interaction model for solving the unknown field. The variation of a nonlocal operator plays an equivalent role as the derivatives of the shape functions in the meshless methods or those of the finite element method, thus it circumvents many difficulties in the calculation of shape functions and their derivatives. The nonlocal operator method can consistently applied with common procedure leading to the weak forms, i.e. the variational principle and the weighted residual method. Based on these, the residual and the tangent stiffness matrix can be obtained with ease. The nonlocal operator method is enhanced here also with an operator energy functional to satisfy the linear consistency of the field. Higher order nonlocal operators and higher order operator energy functional are hereby generalized. A highlighted of the present method is the functional derived based on the nonlocal operator can convert the construction of residual and stiffness matrix into a series of matrix multiplications using the predefined nonlocal operators. The nonlocal strong forms of different functionals can be obtained easily via the concept of support and dual-support, the two basic elements introduced in the paper. Several numerical examples of different types of PDEs are presented in the end to show the effectiveness of the present method and also serve for validation.},

In this article, we follow the implicit boundary method that uses approximate step functions (the step boundary method) developed by Kumar et al. and provide modifications that have several advantages. Roller boundary conditions have wide practical applications in engineering, however, the step boundary method for roller boundary conditions with inclinations has yet to be fully formulated through to the final linear system of equations. Thus we provide a complete derivation that leads to simplified stiffness matrices compared to the original approach, which can be implemented directly in fictitious domain finite element analysis. The approach is then extended, we believe for the first time, to the nonlinear cases of frictional boundary conditions and elasto-plastic material behaviour .

  abstract     = {The progressive damage analysis of fiber-reinforced composite materials is a challenging task, especially when complicated cracking scenarios arise due to the onset and progression of several damage mechanisms. From a modeling point of view, a particularly complex failure scenario is the interaction between intralaminar and interlaminar cracks. This work proposes a novel framework accounting for this interaction through the coupling of a nonlocal damage model based on the phase field approach for the intralaminar failure with a cohesive zone model for the interlaminar one. The modular variational formalism of the method presented leads to a very compact and efficient numerical strategy, which endows the fulfillment of the thermodynamic consistency restrictions and provides a relatively simple basis for its finite element implementation due to the preclusion of complex crack tracking procedures with standard element architectures. After addressing its implementation in the context of the finite element method in a high performance computing environment, the capabilities of the proposed formulation are explored through a numerical investigation of a cross-ply laminate subjected to a 4-point bending configuration. The comparison of the numerical predictions against the experimental observations demonstrates the reliability of the proposed framework for capturing the delamination induced by matrix cracking failure scenario.},

The robust mixed finite element method developed here does not require any Lagrange multiplier but a mesh dependent stabilization term with a relaxation parameter is introduced essentially to ensure the numerical stability of the algorithm. The well-posedness and the optimal error estimate of the finite element scheme are derived. Furthermore, an iterative scheme is developed based on the traditional coupled algorithm. We prove that the iterative scheme converges to the coupled scheme, and the rate of convergence is estimated.

Different methods of data assimilation are available for calibrating parameters from measures and an accurate assessment of their reliability in realistic scenarios is not trivial. In this paper, we consider the estimation of cardiac space-dependent conductivities for the Monodomain modeling of the propagation of the excitation potential in the heart with a variational deterministic approach. We perform an extensive validation of our method based on experimental data obtained by fluorescence optical mapping recordings on animal models. The results demonstrate that our procedure provides reliable results when coupled with phenomenological ionic models like the Fenton–Karma and the Mitchell–Schaeffer ones. These promising results give confidence that our approach could be used in clinical scenarios for applying computational techniques to support the decision-making process of medical doctors, like, e.g., the optimal placement of pacemakers.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports an isogeometric-meshfree moving least-squares approach for the adaptive analysis of crack propagation in thin-shell structures within the context of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The present approach is developed based on the equivalence of the moving least-squares meshfree shape functions and the isogeometric basis functions, which provides an effective strategy of adaptive mesh refinement for isogeometric analysis (IGA) in a straightforward meshfree manner. The adaptivity of the mesh refinement is achieved by utilizing a gradient-based error estimator to identify the meshes that need to be refined by adding linear reproducing points. The Kirchhoff–Love theory is further applied in the isogeometric-meshfree moving least-squares formulation to simplify the modeling of cracked thin-shell structures by neglecting the rotational degrees of freedom. In this way, the singularity of stress fields near the crack tip and the discontinuity of displacement fields around the crack surface can be efficiently captured by the adaptive mesh refinement to generate accurate results. A series of two-dimensional static and quasi-static crack propagation problems of thin-shell structures are investigated. It is found that the adaptive refinement strategy makes the present approach achieve higher convergence rate and computational efficiency than IGA and the meshfree method. The predicted propagation paths obtained by the present approach are in good agreement with the previously reported results.},

Recently, a smooth approximation of the saturation-dependent flux coefficients based on Implicit Hybrid Upwinding (IHU) has been proposed to improve the nonlinear convergence in fully implicit simulations with buoyancy. Here, we design a truly multidimensional extension of this approach that retains the simplicity and robustness of IHU while reducing the sensitivity of the results to the orientation of the computational (Cartesian) grid. This is achieved with the introduction of an adaptive, local coupling between the fluxes that takes the flow pattern into account. We analyze the mathematical properties of the proposed methodology to show that the scheme is monotone in the presence of competing viscous and buoyancy forces and yields saturations remaining between physical bounds. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the scheme on challenging two-dimensional two-phase examples with buoyancy, with an emphasis on the reduction of the grid orientation effect.},

Further, we address a tessellation-free formulation of contour integrals that allows to apply Neumann boundary conditions on point clouds without having to recover the underlying surface. Two-dimensional linear elastic benchmark examples demonstrate that the method is able to provide the same accuracy as those computed with conventional, continuous surface descriptions, because the associated error can be controlled by the density of the cloud. Three-dimensional examples computed on point clouds of historical structures show how the method can be employed to establish seamless connections between digital shape measurement techniques and numerical analyses.},
