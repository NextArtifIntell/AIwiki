  abstract     = {In the restricted Santa Claus problem we are given resources R R and players P P . Every resource j ∈ R j∈R has a value v j vj and every player i ∈ P i∈P desires a set of resources R ( i ) R(i) . We are interested in distributing the resources to players that desire them. The quality of a solution is measured by the least happy player, i.e., the lowest sum of resource values. This value should be maximized. The local search algorithm by Asadpour et al. [1] and its connection to the configuration LP has proved itself to be a very influential technique for this and related problems. Asadpour et al. used a local search to obtain a bound of 4 for the ratio of the fractional to the integral optimum of the configuration LP (the integrality gap). This bound is non-constructive, since the local search has not been shown to terminate in polynomial time. On the negative side, the worst instance known has an integrality gap of 2. Although much progress was made in this area, neither bound has been improved since. We present a better analysis that shows the integrality gap is not worse than 3 + 5 / 6 ≈ 3.8333 3+5/6≈3.8333 .},

An open problem suggested by Jean Berstel in 2006 is to find a formula for a ( n ) a(n) . In this paper we prove new lower bounds on a ( n ) a(n) by explicitly constructing a common subsequence between the Thue-Morse words and their bitwise complement. We obtain the lower bound a ( n ) = 2 n ( 1 − o ( 1 ) ) a(n)=2n(1−o(1)) , saying that when n grows large, the fraction of omitted symbols in the longest common subsequence of the n th Thue-Morse word and its bitwise complement goes to 0. We further generalize to any prefix of the Thue-Morse sequence, where we prove similar lower bounds.},

  abstract     = {A secret sharing scheme is a cryptographic technique to protect a secret from loss and leakage by dividing it into shares. A ramp secret sharing scheme can improve efficiency in terms of the information ratio by allowing partial information about the secret which is composed of several sub-secrets to leak out. The notion of strong security has been introduced to control the amount of information on every subset of the sub-secrets that unauthorized sets can obtain. However, there have been proposed few methods to construct strongly secure schemes for general access structures. Furthermore, all existing methods need strong assumptions, which lead to a loss of efficiency and a limitation of access structures. In this paper, we show that any ramp secret sharing scheme which is linear over a sufficiently large field can be transformed into a strongly secure scheme with the same access structure preserving the information ratio. Since our method only requires linearity, our strongly secure schemes can realize arbitrary access structures and achieve smaller information ratio than the previous schemes.},

A proper k -coloring c of G is called a Grundy k-coloring of G if every vertex is a Grundy vertex with respect to c and the largest integer k such that G admits a Grundy k -coloring is called the Grundy number of G which is denoted as Γ ( G ) Γ(G) . Given a graph G and an integer k , the Grundy number decision problem is to decide whether Γ ( G ) ≥ k Γ(G)≥k . The Grundy number decision problem is known to be NP-complete for bipartite graphs and complement of bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this result by showing that this problem remains NP-complete for perfect elimination bipartite graphs as well as for complement of perfect elimination bipartite graphs. Further, we give a linear-time algorithm to find the Grundy number of chain graphs, which is a proper subclass of the class of perfect elimination bipartite graphs. We also give a linear-time algorithm to find the Grundy number in complements of chain graphs. A partial Grundy coloring of a graph G is a proper k -coloring of G such that there is at least one Grundy vertex with each color i , 1 ≤ i ≤ k 1≤i≤k and the partial Grundy number of G , ∂ Γ ( G ) ∂Γ(G) , is the largest integer k such that G admits a partial Grundy k -coloring.

  abstract     = {A dealer-free and non-interactive dynamic threshold secret sharing scheme has been proposed by Harn and Hsu in Information Processing Letters in 2015. In this scheme, a ( t , n ) (t,n) secret sharing scheme in secret sharing phase can turn into a ( m , n ) (m,n) scheme in secret reconstruction phase, where m is the number of participating shareholders. It has been claimed that the secrecy of shares and the secrecy of the secret are unconditionally preserved if m ∈ ( t , 1 + t ( t + 1 ) / 2 ] m∈(t,1+t(t+1)/2] . This paper provides a security analysis of this scheme by introducing two attacks. In the first attack, we show that this scheme does not have the dynamic threshold property. In more details, any t + 1 t+1 released values are sufficient to reconstruct the secret, while the updated threshold has any larger value. In the second attack, we show that any t + 1 t+1 released values are sufficient to forge the released value of a non-participating shareholder. The technique enjoyed for these attacks is the linear subspace cryptanalysis. It basically measures the information leaked by the known parameters of the scheme by computing the dimension of the linear subspace spanned by these parameters. This method has shown to be capable of cryptanalysis of some secret sharing based schemes, whose security relies on keeping the coefficients of the underlying polynomial(s) secret.},

Thus, opportunity cost is an important factor to consider in the leasing problem. Accounting for opportunity cost, this paper extends the online leasing strategy for depreciable equipment. By applying competitive analysis, the optimal competitive ratios of the deterministic and randomized strategies are obtained. The results of numerical examples show that a smaller competitive ratio can be obtained when considering opportunity cost, which illustrates that the introduction of the opportunity cost has a significant influence on both the deterministic and randomized strategies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the all best swap edges problem in a distributed environment. We are given a 2-edge connected positively weighted network X , where all communication is routed through a rooted spanning tree T of X . If a tree edge e = { x , y } e={x,y} fails, the communication network will be disconnected. However, since X is 2-edge connected, communication can be restored by replacing e by non-tree edge e ′ e′ , called a swap edge of e , whose ends lie in different components of T ∖ { e } T∖{e} . Of all possible swap edges of e , we would like to choose the best , according to four different objective functions. Overall, the problem is to identify the best swap edge for every tree edge, so that in case of any edge failure, the best swap edge can be activated quickly. There are solutions to this problem for a number of cases in the literature. A major concern for all these solutions is to minimize the number of messages. However, especially in fault-transient environments, time is a crucial factor. In this paper we present a novel technique that addresses this problem from a time perspective; in fact, we present a distributed solution that works in linear time with respect to the height h of T for a number of different criteria, while retaining the optimal number of messages and O ( δ x ) O(δx) space per each processor x of degree δ x δx . To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior algorithm for the all best swap edges problem whose asymptotic complexity matches ours in all three measures: time, space, and number of messages.},

However, it might be of interest to make two different blockchains interoperable, i.e., to allow one to transmit information from one blockchain to another blockchain. In this paper, we give a formalisation of this problem, and we prove that blockchain interoperability is impossible according to the classical definition of a blockchain. Under a weaker definition of blockchain, we demonstrate that two blockchains are interoperable is equivalent to creating a ‘2-in-1’ blockchain containing both ledgers, thus limiting the theoretical interest of making interoperable blockchains in the first place. We also observe that all practical existing interoperable blockchain frameworks work indeed by exchanging already created tokens between two blockchains and not by offering the possibility to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another one, which implies a modification of the balance of total created tokens on both blockchains. It confirms that having interoperability is only possible by creating a ‘2-in-1’ blockchain containing both ledgers.},

Chou and Orlandi claimed that their protocol is universally composable secure (UC-secure) in the random oracle model under dynamic corruptions. UC-security is a very strong security guarantee that assures that, not only the protocol in itself is secure, but can be also used safely in larger protocols. Unfortunately, in this work we point out a flaw in their security proof for the case of a corrupt sender. In more detail, we define a decisional problem and we prove that, if a correct security proof for the Chou and Orlandi&#39;s protocol is provided, then this problem can be solved correctly with overwhelming probability. Therefore, the protocol of Chou and Orlandi cannot be instantiated securely with groups for which our decisional problem cannot be solved correctly with overwhelming probability. Consequently, the protocol of Chou and Orlandi cannot be instantiated with all groups G G in which the CDH problem is intractable, but only with groups in which both the CDH problem is intractable and our decisional problem can be solved with overwhelming probability. After the appearance of our work, Chou and Orlandi acknowledged the problems we pointed out in their security proof and subsequent works showed additional issues, removing the claims of UC security of their protocol.},

The adaptive, offline adversary is the strongest adversary among the ones usually considered, so the result states that if one has to be competitive against such a strong adversary, then randomization does not help. This implies that researchers do not consider randomization against an adaptive, offline adversary. We prove that in a distributed setting, this result does not necessarily hold, so randomization against an adaptive, offline adversary becomes interesting again.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce an a priori variant of the capacitated vehicle routing problem and provide a constant factor approximation algorithm, when the demands of customers are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli experiments. In the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) a vehicle, starting at a depot, must visit a set of customers to deliver the requested quantity of some item. The vehicle has capacity k , which is the maximum number of items that the vehicle can carry at any time, but it can always return to the depot to restock. The objective is to find the shortest tour subject to these constraints. In the a priori CVRP with unit demands the vehicle has to visit a set of active customers, drawn from some distribution. Every active customer has a demand of one. The goal is to find a master tour, which is a feasible solution to the deterministic CVRP, i.e. where all customers are active. Then, given a set of active customers, the tour is shortcut to only visit those customers. The cost of the tour is the expected cost with respect to the distribution of active customers. We consider the model, where every customer is independently active with the same probability. Let N be the number of customers. We provide an algorithm, which takes as input an a priori TSP solution with approximation factor γ , and gives a solution to the a priori CVRP with unit demands, whose cost is at most ( 1 + k / N + γ ) (1+k/N+γ) times the value of the optimal solution. Specifically, this gives an expected 5.5−approximation by using the 3.5−approximation to the a priori TSP from Van Ee and Sitters [17] and a deterministic 8.5−approximation by using the deterministic 6.5−approximation from Van Zuylen [18] .},

The LD algorithm is an extension of a very well-known list scheduling algorithm , Longest Processing Time (LPT) list scheduling, to this bicriteria scheduling problem. Coffman and Sethi conjectured (in 1976) that the LD algorithm has the following precise worst-case performance bound: 5 4 − 3 4 ( 4 m − 1 ) 54−34(4m−1) , where m is the number of machines. In this paper, utilizing some recent work by the authors and Huang (2016), which exposed some very strong combinatorial properties of various presumed minimal counterexamples to the conjecture, we provide a proof of this conjecture. The problem and the LD algorithm have connections to some other fundamental problems (such as the assembly line-balancing problem) and algorithms.},

To the best of our knowledge, in the context of nondeterministic probabilistic processes, no proof of probabilistic branching bisimilarity being an equivalence has been provided so far. Since, as happened in the fully nondeterministic case, some researchers are using such a result by taking it for granted, we decided to dedicate this note to a formal proof of it. More precisely, we extend and adapt the proof strategy used by Basten in the fully nondeterministic case. Thus, we introduce the probabilistic analogue to the notion of semi-branching bisimilarity and to van Glabbeek and Weijland&#39;s Stuttering Lemma to prove that probabilistic branching bisimilarity is indeed an equivalence relation.},

This means that it provides an efficient randomized algorithm for the following task: given a set of Boolean random variables whose sum is not concentrated around its expectation, find a subset of statistically dependent variables. However, the algorithm of Impagliazzo and Kabanets is given only for the Boolean case. On the other hand, the general proof technique works also for real-valued random variables, even though for this case, Impagliazzo and Kabanets obtain a concentration bound that is slightly suboptimal. Herein, we revisit both these issues and show that in fact it is relatively easy to extend the Impagliazzo-Kabanets algorithm to real-valued random variables and to improve the corresponding concentration bound by a constant factor.},

The connected maximum coverage problem is NP-hard and therefore approximation algorithms are of interest. We provide here an approximation algorithm for the problem with an approximation bound that strictly improves on previous results. A second approximation algorithm with faster run time, though worse approximation factor, is presented as well. The two algorithms are then applied to submodular maximization over a connected subgraph, with a monotone submodular set function, delivering the same approximation bounds as for the coverage maximization case.},

  abstract     = {Process anonymity has been studied for a long time. Memory anonymity is more recent. In an anonymous memory system, there is no a priori agreement among the processes on the names of the shared registers. As an example, a shared register named A by a process p and a shared register named B by another process q may correspond to the very same register X , while the same name C may correspond to different register names for the processes p and q , and this remains unknown to the processes. This article introduces the full anonymous model, namely a model in which both the processes and the registers are anonymous. A fundamental question is then “is this model meaningful?”, which can be translated as “can non-trivial fundamental problems be solved in such a very weak computing model?” This article answers this question positively. More precisely, it presents a deadlock-free mutual exclusion algorithm in such a fully anonymous model where the anonymous registers are read/modify/write registers. This algorithm assumes that m (the number of shared registers) and n (the number of processes) are such that m is relatively prime with all the integers ℓ ∈ { 1 , . . . , n } ℓ∈{1,...,n} . Combined with a previous result (PODC 2019) on mutual exclusion in memory anonymous (but not process anonymous) systems, it follows that this condition is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of such an algorithm in fully anonymous systems. As far as we know, this is the first time full anonymity is considered, and where a non-trivial concurrency-related problem is solved in such a very strong anonymity context.},

The least value k for which G admits such labeling is called additive chromatic number of G . This problem was first presented by Czerwiński, Grytczuk and Żelazny who also proposed a conjecture that for every graph G , the additive chromatic number never exceeds the classic chromatic number. Up to date, the conjecture has been proved for complete graphs, trees, non-3-colorable planar graphs with girth at least 13 and non-bipartite planar graphs with girth at least 26. In this work, we show that the conjecture holds for split graphs. We also present exact formulas for computing the additive chromatic number for some subfamilies of split graphs (complete split, headless spiders and complete sun), regular bipartite, complete multipartite, fan, windmill, circuit, wheel, cycle sun and wheel sun.},

However, if an illegal participant, without any valid share, impersonates a shareholder to recover the secret with m ( m ≥ t m≥t ) legal shareholders in a traditional ( t , n ) (t,n) threshold SS scheme, it may obtain the secret. Therefore, this paper utilizes a bivariate symmetry polynomial to propose a basic threshold changeable secret sharing (TCSS) scheme which is cheating immune and thwarts the above illegal participant attack. In the basic TCSS scheme, threshold is allowed to increase from t to the exact number of all participants during secret reconstruction. In this way, the secret can be recovered only if all the participants have valid shares. However, each shareholder has to keep t coefficients of its share. Then, an improved TCSS scheme based on both univariate polynomial and bivariate symmetry polynomial is proposed to reduce coefficients of shares for each shareholder.},

For example, the mathematical and computational properties of metrics that can be realized by trees have been well-studied and such research has laid the foundation of the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from evolutionary distances. However, as trees may be too restrictive to accurately represent real-world data or phenomena, it is important to understand the relationship between more general graphs and distances. In this paper, we introduce a new type of metric called a cactus metric, that is, a metric that can be realized by a cactus graph. We show that, just as with tree metrics, a cactus metric has a unique optimal realization. In addition, we describe an algorithm that can recognize whether or not a metric is a cactus metric and, if so, compute its optimal realization in O ( n 3 ) O(n3) time, where n is the number of points in the space.},

Second, we strengthen polynomial-time solvability of the unweighted version in the class of P 2 + P 3 P2+P3 -free graphs to the weighted case. This result is tight in the sense that both versions are NP-hard in the class of P 3 + P 3 P3+P3 -free graphs, i.e. P 3 + P 3 P3+P3 is a minimal graph forbidding of which produces an NP-hard case for both versions of the problem.},

GOST R hash function can compress any message up to 2 512 bits into 256 bits and 512 bits, which are called GOST R-256 and GOST R-512 respectively. In this paper, we present distinguishers for the compression function and its internal permutation of GOST R hash function by exploiting the integral cryptanalysis. Firstly, we propose an 8.75-round known-key distinguisher for the internal permutation with the time complexity of 2 128 . Then by extending the distinguisher, we propose the known-key distinguisher for 12-round internal permutation with the time complexity of 2 192.4 , and the memory is about 2 129 bytes. Since the compression function is designed by the Miyaguchi-Preneel mode, we can transform the distinguishers for permutation to ones for the compression function. As a result, we present the 8.75-round and full 12-round distinguishers for the GOST R compression function. This is the first publish to propose distinguishers for full-round GOST R compression function and its internal permutation.},

  abstract     = {Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018), showed that any bounded-depth homogeneous formula of bounded individual degree (bounded by r ) that computes an explicit polynomial over n variables must have size exp ⁡ ( Ω ( 1 r ( n 4 ) 1 / Δ ) ) exp⁡(Ω(1r(n4)1/Δ)) for all depths Δ ≤ O ( log ⁡ n log ⁡ r + log ⁡ log ⁡ n ) Δ≤O(log⁡nlog⁡r+log⁡log⁡n) . In this article we show an improved size lower bound of exp ⁡ ( Ω ( Δ r ( n r 2 ) 1 / Δ ) ) exp⁡(Ω(Δr(nr2)1/Δ)) for all depths Δ ≤ O ( log ⁡ n log ⁡ r ) Δ≤O(log⁡nlog⁡r) , and for the same explicit polynomial. In comparison to Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018) (1) our results give superpolynomial lower bounds in a wider regime of depth Δ, and (2) for all Δ ∈ [ ω ( 1 ) , o ( log ⁡ n log ⁡ r ) ] Δ∈[ω(1),o(log⁡nlog⁡r)] our lower bound is asymptotically better. This improvement is due to a finer product decomposition of general homogeneous formulas of bounded-depth. This follows from an adaptation of a new product decomposition for bounded-depth multilinear formulas shown by Chillara, Limaye and Srinivasan (SIAM Journal of Computing, 2019).},

  abstract     = {A set of k ( ⩾ 2 ) (⩾2) spanning trees in a graph is called completely independent spanning trees (CISTs for short) if they are pairwise edge-disjoint and internally vertex-disjoint. Although the problem of determining whether a graph G admits k CISTs is NP-complete even for k = 2 k=2 , there exists a characterization called k -CIST partition for which the instances can easily be verified. A k -CIST partition of a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is a partition of V into V 1 , V 2 , … , V k V1,V2,…,Vk such that the subgraph of G induced by V i Vi , denoted by G [ V i ] G[Vi] , is connected for i ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , k } i∈{1,2,…,k} , and the bipartite graph induced by the edge set { ( x , y ) ∈ E : x ∈ V i , y ∈ V j } {(x,y)∈E:x∈Vi,y∈Vj} , denoted by B ( V i , V j , G ) B(Vi,Vj,G) , has no tree component for i , j ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , k } i,j∈{1,2,…,k} with i ≠ j i≠j . Moreover, a k -CIST partition is well-equalized provided all G [ V i ] G[Vi] are isomorphic for i ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , k } i∈{1,2,…,k} and all B ( V i , V j , G ) B(Vi,Vj,G) are isomorphic for distinct i , j ∈ { 1 , 2 , … , k } i,j∈{1,2,…,k} . The class of alternating group graphs is a kind of well-studied interconnection networks , which forms a famous subclass of Cayley graphs and possesses a large number of desirable properties of networks. Let A G n AGn denote the n -dimensional alternating group graph. In this paper, we show that A G n AGn admits a well-equalized 3-CIST partition. As a by-product, we obtain a constructing scheme of three CISTs for A G n AGn .},

The OG serves to assemble DNA fragments or to compute shortest superstrings, which are a compressed representation of the input. The OG requires space that is quadratic in the number of words, which limits its scalability. The Hierarchical Overlap Graph (HOG) is an alternative graph that also encodes all maximal overlaps, but uses space that is linear in the sum of the lengths of the input words.

But, one of the major issues with non-preemptive scheduling is that no known polynomial time schedulability condition exists. The general problem of schedulability of a set of tasks on a single processor under such scheme is known to be NP-Hard [1] . People have attempted to propose different sufficient or necessary conditions for schedulability of a set of tasks under various constrained scenarios. In this work, we explore schedulability condition for 2-task systems when the tasks are scheduled non-preemptively and periodically using work conserving model of execution. We assume that the tasks are released at the same point of time initially. We show that the proposed condition for 2-task systems can be evaluated in polynomial time.},

PSMF2 takes as user intent examples and a soft sketch : a new kind of user intent defined as a set of commands that must appear in the synthesized program (and that are in no particular order of execution). The output of PSMF2 is a general purpose imperative program. The combination of inductive synthesis and genetic programming has allowed PSMF2 to synthesize 7 programs (IntSQRT, Majority of 5, Majority of 8, Max of 4, Modulo, Factorial, and Fibonacci) found in the SyGuS competition, the iJava and IntroClass, and the Genetic programming communities. We carried out an empirical evaluation on the synthesis time of these 7 programs and the mean time varied from 56.4 seconds (Majority of 5) to 15.9 minutes (Fibonacci).},

Compared with the traditional randomized public-key encryptions, D-PKE has advantages in searching encrypted values across the database thanks to its lower computational overheads. In the literature, Bellare et al. gave the “strongest possible” notion of security for this primitive, called PRIV, and they also showed how this notion can be achieved in the random oracle model. Afterwards, Boldyreva, Fehr, and O&#39;Neill (CRYPTO&#39;08), followed by many other researchers, designed chosen ciphertext attack (CCA) secure D-PKE schemes in the standard model. These works are all based on lossy trapdoor functions and all-but-one trapdoor functions. In this paper, we present an alternative paradigm to design CCA-secure D-PKE. Our approach is a generic construction based on the identity-based lossy trapdoor functions (IB-LTDF), and it also can be extended to design CCA secure deterministic identity-based encryption schemes (D-IBE). To the best of our knowledge, this gives the first efficient construction of CCA-secure D-IBE schemes. Moreover, our approach can be considered as another application of the CHK transformation.},

  abstract     = {Given a positive integer k and a graph G , a k-limited packing in G is a subset B of its vertex set such that each closed vertex neighborhood of G has at most k vertices of B (Gallant et al., 2010). A first generalization of this concept deals with a subset of vertices that cannot be in the set B and also, the number k is not a constant but it depends on the vertex neighborhood (Dobson et al., 2010). As another variation, a { k } {k} -packing function f of G assigns a non-negative integer to the vertices of G in such a way that the sum of the values of f over each closed vertex neighborhood is at most k (Hinrichsen et al., 2014). The three associated decision problems are NP-complete in the general case. We introduce L-packing functions as a unified notion that generalizes all limited packing concepts introduced up to now. We present a linear time algorithm that solves the problem of finding the maximum weight of an L -packing function in strongly chordal graphs when a strong elimination ordering is given that includes the linear algorithm for { k } {k} -packing functions in strongly chordal graphs (2014). Besides, we show how the algorithm can be used to solve the known clique-independence problem on strongly chordal graphs in linear time (G. Chang et al., 1993).},

  abstract     = {Recently, Guruganesh et al. [1] proposed the Fractionally Subadditive Network Design (f-SAND) problem. In this problem, we are given a weighted graph G with a special root vertex r together with k subsets of its vertices called scenarios. We need to assign capacities to the edges of G so that for every scenario, the assigned capacities support a unit flow from the root to all vertices in the scenario, simultaneously. The goal is to minimize the total cost of the solution. f-SAND is a fairly natural problem and it generalizes several well-studied problems, such as the Steiner Tree problem. The added interest to this problem stems from the fact that standard tools used for approximating network design problems do not seem to apply to f-SAND. Despite this, Guruganesh et al. conjecture the existence of an algorithm with an approximation ratio bounded by a constant, i.e. independent of k . They make a step towards this goal by giving a 3 2 32 -approximation algorithm for k = 2 k=2 . In this paper, we present an algorithm similar to that of [1] , together with an analysis that not only yields an improved approximation ratio of 4 3 43 , but is also significantly simpler. We also generalize it to arbitrary k , giving a 2 3 k 23k -approximation. On the negative side, we argue that without additional insights, the techniques used are not likely to produce a constant factor approximation algorithm .},

  abstract     = {A graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) with a vertex set V and an edge set E is called a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG, for short) if there are a tree T whose leaf set is V , a non-negative edge weight w in T , and two non-negative reals d min ≤ d max dmin≤dmax such that G has an edge u v ∈ E uv∈E if and only if the sum of the edge weights in the unique path between u and v in the weighted tree ( T , w ) (T,w) is in the interval [ d min , d max ] [dmin,dmax] . PCG is a relatively new graph class motivated from bioinformatics. In this paper, we give some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for a graph to be in PCG based on cut-vertices and twins, which provide reductions among PCGs. Our results imply that complete k -partite graphs, cacti, and some other graph classes are subsets of PCG.},

  abstract     = {Two vertices in a graph are said to 2-step dominate each other if they are at distance 2 apart. A set S of vertices in a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is a hop dominating set of G if every vertex outside S is 2-step dominated by some vertex of S . Given a graph G , Min-HDS is the problem of finding a hop dominating set of G of minimum cardinality. The decision version of Min-HDS is known to be NP -complete for planar bipartite graphs and planar chordal graphs, and hence for bipartite graphs and chordal graphs. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm for computing a minimum hop dominating set in bipartite permutation graphs, which is a subclass of bipartite graphs. We also show that Min-HDS cannot be approximated within a factor of ( 1 − ε ) ln ⁡ | V | (1−ε)ln⁡|V| , unless P=NP and can be approximated within a factor of 1 + ln ⁡ ( Δ ( Δ − 1 ) + 1 ) 1+ln⁡(Δ(Δ−1)+1) , where Δ denotes the maximum degree in the graph G . Finally, we show that Min-HDS is APX -complete for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3.},

  abstract     = {Approximate computing is a research area which investigates a wide spectrum of techniques to trade off computation time for better accuracy. This paper models the accuracy of the computation as a concave, possibly non-differentiable function of job size to decide the accuracy of each job as well as the scheduling decision of the jobs on heterogeneous servers. The two metrics of interest are the makespan of the completion time of the jobs and the weighted accuracy of the different jobs. For a given makespan, an algorithm is provided that achieves the optimal weighted accuracy of computations, thus providing an optimal tradeoff between the two objectives for preemptive scheduling of approximate computing jobs on multiple servers. The proposed algorithm decides the task sizes of each of the jobs, which gives the accuracy of the jobs in addition to the schedule of these partial jobs on the servers.},

We answer the following question in the affirmative: does 9 - G G 9-GG contain any Euclidean bottleneck matching of P ? Thereby, we close the gap for the containment problem of Euclidean bottleneck matchings in Gabriel graphs. It is also known that 10 - G G 10-GG contains a Euclidean bottleneck Hamiltonian cycle of P , while 5 - G G 5-GG may not contain such a cycle.
