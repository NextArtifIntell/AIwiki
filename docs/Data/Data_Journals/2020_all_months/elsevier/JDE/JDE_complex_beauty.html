  abstract     = {In this work we consider several semilinear damped wave equations with “subcritical” nonlinearities , focusing on studying lifespan estimates for energy solutions. Our main concern is on equations with scale-invariant damping and mass. By imposing different assumptions on the initial data , we prove lifespan estimates from above, distinguishing between “wave-like” and “heat-like” behaviours. Furthermore, we conjecture logarithmic improvements for the estimates on the “transition surfaces” separating the two behaviours. As a direct consequence, we reorganize the blow-up results and lifespan estimates for the massless case, and we obtain in particular improved lifespan estimates for the one dimensional case, compared to the known results. We also study semilinear wave equations with scattering damping and negative mass term, finding that if the decay rate of the mass term equals to 2, the lifespan estimate coincides with the one in a special case of scale-invariant damped equation. The main tool employed in the proof is a Kato&#39;s type lemma, established by iteration argument.},

Several useful time-uniform estimates and stability/instability conditions are presented. We state and prove optimality conditions for the inverse deep learning problem, using standard variational calculus , the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann equation and the Pontryagin maximum principle.

Here we focus our analysis on the study of the stationary states. We first discuss the existence of nontrivial equilibria using dynamical system arguments. Then we introduce a small parameter 0 &lt; ε ≪ 1 0&amp;lt;ε≪1 that characterises the width of the mutation kernel, and we describe the asymptotic shape of steady states with respect to ε . In particular, for ε → 0 ε→0 we show that the distribution of the pathogen approaches a singular measure concentrated on the maxima of fitness in each plant population. This asymptotic description allows us to show the local stability of each of the positive steady states for ε ≪ 1 ε≪1 , from which we deduce a uniqueness result for the nontrivial stationary states by means of a topological degree argument. These analyses rely on a careful investigation of the spectral properties of some nonlocal operators .},

In this paper we examine some critical cases that were left open by the previous literature, and we show that they fall into the pathological regime.

The solution method consists in reducing the ODE to a certain canonical homogeneous quadratic ODE, named driver-type Riccati equation with a larger number of indeterminates, whose solutions include, as sub-solutions, the original solutions, and for which a recursive formula is shown, giving all coefficients of the solution power series directly from the ODE parameters. The reduction method is named exact quadratization and was formerly introduced in another our article, where we considered explicit ODEs only. In the present paper, which is self-contained to a large extent, we review and complete the theory of exact quadratization by solving issues, such as for instance the existence of a piecewise-quadratization, that had remained open, and also extend it to the more general case of an implicitly defined ODE. Finally, we argue that the result can be seen as a partial solution of a differential version of the 22nd Hilbert&#39;s problem .},

We address initial data lying in L p Lp ( 1 &lt; p &lt; ∞ 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ ) and BMO ( p = ∞ p=∞ ) spaces and work with weak solutions. Our main result is the identification of a new well-posedness class, given for p ∈ ( 1 , ∞ ] p∈(1,∞] by distributions satisfying ∇ m u ∈ T m p , 2 ∇mu∈Tmp,2 , where T m p , 2 Tmp,2 is a parabolic version of the tent space of Coifman–Meyer–Stein. In the range p ∈ [ 2 , ∞ ] p∈[2,∞] , this holds without any further constraints on the operator and for p = ∞ p=∞ it provides a Carleson measure characterization of BMO with non-autonomous operators. We also prove higher order L p Lp well-posedness, previously only known for the case m = 1 m=1 . The uniform L p Lp boundedness of propagators of energy solutions plays an important role in the well-posedness theory and we discover that such bounds hold for p close to 2. This is a consequence of local weak solutions being locally Hölder continuous with values in spatial L l o c p Llocp for some p &gt; 2 p&amp;gt;2 , what is also new for the case m &gt; 1 m&amp;gt;1 .},

Under different assumptions on the linear operator and the nonhomogeneous function, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence of mild periodic solutions in the abstract semilinear equations. When the semigroup generated by the linear operator is not compact, Banach fixed point theorem is used whereas when the semigroup generated by the linear operator is compact, Schauder fixed point theorem is employed. In applications, we apply the main results to establish the existence of periodic solutions in delayed red-blood cell models, age-structured models with periodic harvesting, and the diffusive logistic equation with periodic coefficients.},

We show the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the SIRS model defined on weighed graph. By the approach of upper and lower solutions, we show that the disease-free equilibrium is asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is lower than 1. By constructing Lyapunov function, we show that the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable for the model with the same diffusion rates if the basic reproduction number is greater than 1. With numerical simulations, we apply our generalized weighed graph to Watts-Strogatz network, where the degree of node is illustrated to determine the peak number of infectious population. It also indicates that the network has an impact on small-time behavior of epidemic transmission.},

We derive threshold conditions for the global asymptotic stability of biologically important equilibria, and give a general geometric criterion for the appearance of Hopf bifurcations in the delay differential system with delay-dependent parameters. By choosing the normal development time delay as a bifurcation parameter, we analyze the stability switches of the positive equilibrium, and examine the onset and termination of Hopf bifurcations of periodic solutions from the positive equilibrium. Under some technical conditions, we show that global Hopf branches are bounded and connected by a pair of Hopf bifurcation values. This allows us to show that diapause can lead to the occurrence of multiple stability switches, coexistence of two stable limit cycles, among other rich dynamical behaviours.},

We prove the existence of some entire solutions that are asymptotic, as t → − ∞ t→−∞ , to a traveling wave consisting of a single species . Depending on system parameters, these entire solutions evolve into two ore more stacked invasion waves as t → + ∞ t→+∞ . Our results cover both the weak and strong competition case. In the weak competition case, the existence of a class of entire solutions that forms a 4-dimensional manifold is proved.},

In this scope we introduce a dynamical system for which we prove that its trajectories asymptotically converge to a saddle point of the Lagrangian of the underlying convex minimization problem as time tends to infinity. In addition, we provide rates for both the violation of the feasibility condition by the ergodic trajectories and the convergence of the objective function along these ergodic trajectories to its minimal value. Explicit time discretization of the dynamical system results in a numerical algorithm which is a combination of the linearized proximal method of multipliers and the proximal ADMM algorithm.},

We prove that in one or two dimensions , the system has a unique global classical solution, while the existence of a global weak solution is shown in three dimensions . In the latter case, we show that the energy is bounded uniformly in time. A key idea is to introduce and utilise a boundary energy to derive suitable a priori estimates.

The analysis of the limit is carried out using the relative entropy techniques in the framework of weak, finite energy solutions of the relaxation models converging toward smooth solutions of the equilibrium. The results proved here take advantage of the enlarged formulation of the models in terms of the drift velocity introduced in [6] , generalizing in this way the ones proved in [15] for the Euler–Korteweg model.},

Such problems arise, for example, in the study of classical questions concerning the stability of Mach stems and compressible vortex sheets. For such applications one seeks to prove energy estimates that are in an appropriate sense “uniform” with respect to the small wavelength ϵ , but the large oscillatory coefficients are a formidable obstacle to obtaining such estimates. In this paper we analyze a simplified form of the linearized problems that are relevant to the above stability questions, and obtain results that are both positive and negative. On the one hand we identify favorable structural conditions under which it is possible to prove uniform estimates, and then do so by a new approach. We also construct examples showing that large oscillatory coefficients can give rise to an instantaneous multiple amplification of the amplitude of solutions relative to data; for example, oscillatory boundary data of a given amplitude O ( 1 ) O(1) can immediately give rise to a solution of amplitude O ( 1 ϵ K ) O(1ϵK) , where K ≥ 2 K≥2 . 1 We use the examples of multiple amplification to confirm the optimality of our uniform estimates when the favorable structural conditions hold. When those conditions do not hold, we explain how multiple amplification of infinite order may rule out useful estimates.},

These spaces consist of functions that are ‘large at infinity’, and L 0 1 ( R d ) L01(Rd) is the maximal space in which one can use the heat kernel to obtain globally-defined solutions of the heat equation. We prove suitable estimates from L 0 p ( R d ) L0p(Rd) into L 0 q ( R d ) L0q(Rd) , q ≥ p q≥p , for these semigroups. We then consider the heat semigroup posed in spaces that are dual to these spaces of functions, namely the spaces L − ε p ( R d ) L−εp(Rd) of very-rapidly decreasing functions such that ∫ R d e ε | x | 2 | f ( x ) | p d x &lt; ∞ ∫Rdeε|x|2|f(x)|pdx&amp;lt;∞ .

More precisely, we optimize the first eigenvalue λ ( V ) λ(V) of the operator L v : = − Δ − V Lv:=−Δ−V with Dirichlet boundary conditions with respect to the potential V , under L 1 L1 and L ∞ L∞ constraints on V . The solution has been known to be the characteristic function of a centered ball, but this article aims at proving a sharp growth rate of the following form: if ⁎ V ⁎ V⁎ is a minimizer, then ⁎ ⁎ λ ( V ) − λ ( V ⁎ ) ⩾ C | | V − V ⁎ | | L 1 ( Ω ) 2 λ(V)−λ(V⁎)⩾C||V−V⁎||L1(Ω)2 for some C &gt; 0 C&amp;gt;0 . The proof relies on two notions of derivatives for shape optimization: parametric derivatives and shape derivatives. We use parametric derivatives to handle radial competitors, and shape derivatives to deal with normal deformation of the ball. A dichotomy is then established to extend the result to all other potentials. We develop a new method to handle radial distributions and a comparison principle to handle second order shape derivatives at the ball. Finally, we add some remarks regarding the coercivity norm of the second order shape derivative in this context.},

We first obtain the Hölder continuity and Malliavin differentiability of the solution of the stochastic Cahn–Hilliard equation by using the strong convergence of the spectral Gakerkin approximation. Then we prove the existence and strict positivity of the density function of the law of the exact solution for the stochastic Cahn–Hilliard equation with sublinear growth diffusion coefficient , which fills a gap for the existed result when the diffusion coefficient satisfies a growth condition of order 1 / 3 &lt; α &lt; 1 1/3&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;1 . To approximate the density function of the exact solution, we propose a full discretization based on the spatial spectral Galerkin approximation and the temporal drift implicit Euler scheme . Furthermore, a general framework for deriving the strong convergence rate of the full discretization is developed based on the variation approach and the factorization method . Consequently, we obtain the sharp mean square convergence rates in both time and space via Sobolev interpolation inequalities and semigroup theories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the convergence rate of full discretizations for the considered equation.},

For some embeddings – like standard convex relaxations or impulsive extensions – the normality of an extended minimizer has been shown to be sufficient for the avoidance of infimum gaps. A natural issue is then the search of a general hypothesis under which the criterium “normality implies no gap” holds true. We prove that this criterium is actually valid as soon as V V is abundant in W W , without any convexity assumption on the extended dynamics. Abundance , which was introduced by J. Warga in a convex context and was later generalized by B. Kaskosz, strengthens density, the latter being not sufficient for the mentioned criterium to hold true.},

Moreover, without any symmetry assumption, the global existence of smooth solutions near a given constant steady state for both compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson and Euler-Poisson equations on an exterior domain in R 3 R3 with physical boundary conditions is also established with the exponential stability. A key issue addressed in this paper is on the global-in-time regularity of solutions near physical boundaries.

However, the effects of temporal periodicity on the dynamics of general periodic-parabolic reaction-diffusion systems remain largely unexplored. As a first attempt to understand such effects, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue for linear cooperative periodic-parabolic systems with small diffusion rates. As an application, we show that if a cooperative system of periodic ordinary differential equations has a unique positive periodic solution which is globally asymptotically stable , then the corresponding reaction-diffusion system with either the Neumann or regular oblique derivative boundary condition also has a unique positive periodic solution which is globally asymptotically stable, provided that the diffusion coefficients are sufficiently small. The role of temporal periodicity, spatial heterogeneity and their combined effects with diffusion will be studied in subsequent papers for further understanding and illustration.},

For maps on general Banach spaces we demonstrate that the slightly stronger, but also widely used concept of exponential stability allows a complete characterization in terms of the spectral radius. Moreover, under a spectral gap condition valid for compact and finite-dimensional linearizations these two stability notions are shown to be equivalent.},

Since the independence is a sufficient condition, in this paper we give a method to judge the reachability without the independence. Our main idea is to consider how the number of zeros for derivative of the period function changes as a curve in the parameter space scans near a specific point and choose an appropriate curve to find the largest number of zeros. We apply this method to two polynomial differential systems, having zero-dimensional isochronicity variety and nonzero-dimensional one separately, to show that the maximal number is reached and obtain greater numbers than those obtained by classical independence separately. With our method, the two examples give the possibility that more critical periods arise from an isochronous center than a finite order weak center, an opposite fact to many known results.},

We provide an explicit expansion of the solution at each point of the real line using decorated planar forests. The notion of planarly branched rough path is developed, following Gubinelli&#39;s branched rough paths. The main difference being the replacement of the Butcher–Connes–Kreimer Hopf algebra of non-planar rooted trees by the Munthe-Kaas–Wright Hopf algebra of planar rooted forests. The latter underlies the extension of Butcher&#39;s B -series to Lie–Butcher series known in Lie group integration theory. Planarly branched rough paths admit the study of RDEs on homogeneous spaces, the same way Gubinelli&#39;s branched rough paths are used for RDEs on finite-dimensional vector spaces. An analogue of Lyons&#39; extension theorem is proven. Under analyticity assumptions on the coefficients and when the Hölder index of the driving path is one, we show convergence of the planar forest expansion in a small time interval .},

The model is a generalization of the nonlinear Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic solid under the assumption that the strain and the strain rate are small. We define an initial-value problem for the stress variable and then, under the assumption that the nonlinear constitutive function is strictly increasing, we convert the problem to a new form for the sum of the strain and the strain rate. Using the theory of variable coefficient heat equation together with a fixed point argument we prove local existence of solutions. Finally, for several constitutive functions widely used in the literature we show that the assumption on which the proof of existence is based is not violated.},

In the inviscid limit, due to the prescribed no-slip boundary conditions, vorticity becomes unbounded near the boundary. The novelty of this paper is to introduce boundary layer norms that capture the unbounded vorticity and to derive sharp estimates on this vorticity that are uniform in the inviscid limit.},

Even if, in general, blow-up can occur, these models share the property that mass control is essential. In many circumstances, it is known that this L 1 L1 control is enough to prove the global existence of weak solutions. The theory is based on basic estimates initiated by M. Pierre and collaborators, who have introduced methods to prove L 2 L2 a priori estimates for the solution. Here, we establish such a key estimate with initial data in L 1 L1 while the usual theory uses L 2 L2 . This allows us to greatly simplify the proof of some results. We also establish new existence results of semilinearity which are super-quadratic as they occur in complex chemical reactions. Our method can be extended to semi-linear porous medium equations.},

The undamped system is hyper-elliptic, non-symmetric with a degenerate heteroclinic loop, which connects a hyperbolic saddle to a nilpotent saddle. We rigorously prove that the cyclicity is 3 for periodic annulus when the weak damping term has the same degree as that of the associated Hamiltonian system . This result provides a positive answer to the open question whether the annulus cyclicity is 3 or 4. When the smooth polynomial damping term has degree n , first, a transformation based on the involution of the Hamiltonian is introduced, and then we analyze the coefficients involved in the bifurcation function to show that the Hopf cyclicity is [ 2 n + 1 3 ] [2n+13] . Further, for piecewise smooth polynomial damping with a switching manifold at the y -axis, we consider the damping terms to have degrees l and n , respectively, and prove that the Hopf cyclicity of the origin is [ 3 l + 2 n + 4 3 ] [3l+2n+43] ( [ 3 n + 2 l + 4 3 ] [3n+2l+43] ) when l ≥ n l≥n ( n ≥ l n≥l ).},

Using asymptotic and numerical methods it is shown that by perturbing δ the problem in the limit μ → 0 μ→0 changes from a homogeneous problem with symmetric solutions (including outer solutions) of a simplified equation, to a non-homogeneous problem which, in general, does not have a non-zero outer limit solution (with boundary layers). By studying the bifurcation diagrams as μ and δ vary it is shown that the main branch of solutions will ‘tear’ for μ = n − 2 μ=n−2 where n is an even integer. Blow-up regions, isolated islands of solution, and for μ ≪ 1 μ≪1 “exponentially small” regions, all occur: a structure that is difficult for conventional path following algorithms to find.},

More precisely, it deals in determine whether regularity of the initial data on the right hand side of the real line is propagated to the left hand side by the flow solution. This property was found originally in solutions of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and it has been also verified in other dispersive equations as the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation. Recently, it has been shown that the solutions of the dispersive generalized Benjamin-Ono (DGBO) equation, this is α ∈ ( 2 , 3 ) α∈(2,3) in (0.1) ; also satisfy the propagation of regularity phenomena. This is achieved by introducing a commutator decomposition to handle the dispersive part in the equation.

In particular, the estimate of the admissible wave speed is highly nontrivial. We employ a new phase transform method coupled with the detailed analysis of phase energy. Furthermore, we give a complete characterization of the dynamical behaviors of various kinds of waves.

Building on the recently developed result by Yousept (2020) [30] , we prove an existence result and study the uniqueness through a local H(curl)-regularity analysis with respect to the constraint set. More precisely, every solution is shown to locally satisfy the Maxwell-Ampère equation (resp. Faraday equation) in the region where no obstacle is applied to the electric field (resp. magnetic field). By this property, along with a structural assumption on the feasible set , we are able to localize the obstacle problem to the underlying constraint regions. In particular, the resulting localized problem does not employ the electric test function (resp. magnetic test function) in the area where the L 2 L2 -regularity of the rotation of the electric field (resp. magnetic field) is not a priori guaranteed. This localization strategy is the main ingredient for our uniqueness proof. After establishing the well-posedness, we consider the case where the electric permittivity is negligibly small in the electric constraint region and investigate the corresponding eddy current obstacle problem. Invoking the localization strategy, we derive an existence result under an L 2 L2 -boundedness assumption for the electric constraint region along with a compatibility assumption on the initial data . The developed theoretical results find applications in electromagnetic shielding.},

Their rigorous analytic proof shows that if the lowest slope of flows can be controlled by its highest slope initially, then the wave-breaking occur for the Whitham-type equation. Since this breakthrough, there have been numerous refined wave-breaking results established by generalizing the kernel which describes the dispersion relation of water waves. In this work, from a rich class of non-local conservation laws, a Riccati-type system that governs the flow&#39;s gradient is extracted and investigated. The system&#39;s leading coefficient functions are allowed to change their values and signs over time as opposed to the ones in many of other previous works are fixed constants. The blow-up analysis is illustrated via the Whitham-type equation with nonlinear drift.},

This solution is obtained as the vanishing viscosity limit of classical solutions of the one-dimensional, isentropic, compressible Navier–Stokes equations. Our approach relies on the method of compensated compactness to pass to the limit rigorously in the nonlinear terms . Key to our strategy is the derivation of hyperbolic representation formulas for the entropy kernel and related quantities; among others, a special entropy pair used to obtain higher uniform integrability estimates on the approximate solutions . Intricate bounding procedures relying on these representation formulas then yield the required compactness of the entropy dissipation measures. In turn, we prove that the Young measure generated by the classical solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations reduces to a Dirac mass, from which we deduce the required convergence to a solution of the Euler equations.},

It may possess various solutions like subsonic/supersonic/transonic flows. In this paper, we consider a more challenging case where the doping profile is transonic, which is categorized into two types: subsonic-dominated and supersonic-dominated. In the subsonic-dominated case, we show that the system has a unique interior subsonic solution, at least one interior supersonic solution and infinitely many transonic solutions under the suitable assumptions. However, the difference with the case of subsonic doping profile is that the interior subsonic solution and interior supersonic solution may not exist in special cases when the relaxation time is small. In the supersonic-dominated case, the non-existence and existence of all types of solutions are also obtained. The approach adopted is the technical compactness analysis combining the Green&#39;s function method. Here, the results obtained perfectly develop the existing studies.},

The well-posedness results are proved by considering an appropriate energy functional in the appropriate functional spaces and introduced by Haraux in [A. Haraux, Int. J. Math. Modelling Num.

The asymptotic behavior analysis is based on an attractivity result of a trajectory of an infinite-dimensional linear time-varying system with a special structure, which relies on the introduction of a suitable Lyapunov functional.

  abstract     = {We investigate the quasi-neutral limit (the zero Debye length limit) for the Euler-Poisson system with radial symmetry in an annular domain. Under physically relevant conditions at the boundary, referred to as the Bohm criterion, we first construct the approximate solutions by the method of asymptotic expansion in the limit parameter, the square of the rescaled Debye length, whose detailed derivation and analysis are carried out in our companion paper [8] . By establishing H m Hm -norm, ( m ≥ 2 ) (m≥2) , estimate of the difference between the original and approximation solutions, provided that the well-prepared initial data is given, we show that the local-in-time solution exists in the time interval , uniform in the quasi-neutral limit, and we prove the difference converges to zero with a certain convergence rate validating the formal expansion order. Our results mathematically justify the quasi-neutrality of a plasma in the regime of plasma sheath, indicating that a plasma is electrically neutral in bulk, whereas the neutrality may break down in a scale of the Debye length.},

  abstract     = {A conjecture on the nature of the simultaneous binary collision is explored in the collinear 4-body problem. It is known that any attempt to remove the singularity via block regularisation will result in a regularised flow that is no more than C 8 / 3 C8/3 differentiable with respect to initial conditions. Through a blow-up of the singularity, this loss of differentiability is investigated and a new proof of the C 8 / 3 C8/3 regularity is provided. In the process, it is revealed that the collision manifold consists of two manifolds of normally hyperbolic saddle singularities which are connected by a manifold of heteroclinics. By utilising recent work on transitions near such objects and their normal forms, an asymptotic series of the transition past the singularity is explicitly computed. It becomes remarkably apparent that the finite differentiability at 8/3 is due to the inability to construct a set of integrals local to the simultaneous binary collision. The finite differentiability is shown to be independent of the value of the masses.},

These matrix-valued Nevanlinna–Herglotz m -functions are, to the best knowledge of the author, the first explicit examples to stem from singular higher-order differential equations. The creation of the boundary triples involves taking pieces, determined in [26] , of the principal and non-principal solutions of the differential equation and putting them into the sesquilinear form to yield maps from the maximal domain to the boundary space. These maps act like quasi-derivatives, which are usually not well-defined for all functions in the maximal domain of singular expressions. However, well-defined regularizations of quasi-derivatives are produced by putting the pieces of the non-principal solutions through a modified Gram–Schmidt process.},

All of the previous estimates containing Huygens&#39; waves on wave behaviors for compressible flow models rely heavily on the conservative structure, for instance, the Navier-Stokes system and even the isentropic bipolar Navier-Stokes-Poisson system. The reason is that the Huygens&#39; waves decay slower than diffusion waves in L p ( R 3 ) Lp(R3) -space when 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;2 . However, the non-isentropic case here is not conservative due to two energy equations, and moreover, it is not yet conservative even if one reformulates the original system as the isentropic case in [26] . The main contribution is that we first solve the nonlinear problem when there exists the Huygens&#39; wave in the Green&#39;s function but the nonlinear system is not conservative, which is achieved by establishing refined pointwise estimates for the Green&#39;s function and nonlinear convolution estimates.},

Then we prove that these semigroups are analytic, despite the fact that the semigroup generated by the mechanical equation alone does not share the same property. This means that the coupling with the heat equation produces a regularizing effect on the dynamics, implying in particular the impossibility of the localization of solutions. As a byproduct of our main result, the exponential stability of the semigroups is established.},

This paper aims to prove the asymptotic stability of peakon solutions under H 1 ( R ) H1(R) -perturbations satisfying that their associated momentum density defines a non-negative Radon measure . Motivated by Molinet&#39;s work [24] , [25] , [26] , we shall first prove a Liouville property for H 1 ( R ) H1(R) global solutions belonging to a certain class of almost localized functions. More precisely, we show that such solutions have to be a peakon. The main novelty in our analysis in comparison to the Camassa-Holm equation comes from the fact that in our present case the momentum is not a conserved quantity and may be unbounded along the trajectory. In this regard, to prove the Liouville property, we used a new Lyapunov functional not related to the (not conserved) momentum of the equation.},

  abstract     = {We generalize two results in the Navier-Stokes regularity theory whose proofs rely on ‘zooming in’ on a presumed singularity to the local setting near a curved portion Γ ⊂ ∂ Ω Γ⊂∂Ω of the boundary. Suppose that u is a boundary suitable weak solution with singularity z ⁎ = ( x ⁎ , T ⁎ ) z⁎=(x⁎,T⁎) , where x ⁎ ∈ Ω ∪ Γ x⁎∈Ω∪Γ . Then, under weak background assumptions, the L 3 L3 norm of u tends to infinity in every ball centered at x ⁎ x⁎ : lim t → T − ⁎ ⁡ ‖ u ( ⋅ , t ) ‖ L 3 ( Ω ∩ B ( x ⁎ , r ) ) = ∞ ∀ r &gt; 0 . limt→T−⁎⁡‖u(⋅,t)‖L3(Ω∩B(x⁎,r))=∞∀r&amp;gt;0. Additionally, u generates a non-trivial ‘mild bounded ancient solution’ in R 3 R3 or R + 3 R+3 through a rescaling procedure that ‘zooms in’ on the singularity. Our proofs rely on a truncation procedure for boundary suitable weak solutions. The former result is based on energy estimates for L 3 L3 initial data and a Liouville theorem . For the latter result, we apply perturbation theory for L ∞ L∞ initial data based on linear estimates due to K. Abe and Y. Giga.},

A conjecture proposed firstly by Chern (1977) [6] for entire graph and then extended by Trudinger-Wang (2000) [14] to its fully generality asserts that any Euclidean complete, affine maximal type, locally uniformly convex C 4 C4 -hypersurface in R N + 1 RN+1 must be an elliptic paraboloid . At the same time, this conjecture was solved completely by Trudinger-Wang for dimension N = 2 N=2 and θ = 3 / 4 θ=3/4 , and later extended by Jia-Li (2009) [12] to N = 2 , θ ∈ ( 3 / 4 , 1 ] N=2,θ∈(3/4,1] (see also Zhou (2012) [16] for a different proof). On the past twenty years, many efforts were done toward higher dimensional issues but not really successful yet, even for the case of dimension N = 3 N=3 . In this paper, we will construct non-quadratic affine maximal type hypersurfaces which are Euclidean compete for N ≥ 3 , θ ∈ ( 1 / 2 , ( N − 1 ) / N ) . N≥3,θ∈(1/2,(N−1)/N).},

It is proved that if the periodic measure is PS-ergodic, then it is ergodic. Moreover, if the infinitesimal generator of the Markov semigroup only has equally placed simple eigenvalues including 0 on the imaginary axis, then the periodic measure is PS-ergodic and has positive minimum period. Conversely if the periodic measure with the positive minimum period is PS-mixing, then the infinitesimal generator only has equally placed simple eigenvalues (infinitely many) including 0 on the imaginary axis. Moreover, under the spectral gap condition, PS-mixing of the periodic measure is proved. The “equivalence” of random periodic processes and periodic measures is established. This is a new class of ergodic random processes. Random periodic paths of stochastic perturbation of the periodic motion of an ODE is obtained.},

Our main result establishes the emergence of a rate-independent hysteresis for suitable randomly distributed obstacles, i.e., interfaces are pinned by the obstacles until a certain critical applied driving force is exceeded. The treatment of such a model in the context of pinning and depinning requires a comparison principle. We prove this property and hence the existence of viscosity solutions .

Such model arises when two waves propagate simultaneously in nonisotropic media. The change of degree argument is used to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of asymptotic bifurcation points with respect to the matrix spectrum. The results we get are also valid for uncoupled systems. By changing one of our assumptions on the nonlinear term , we also obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the standard bifurcation points.},

  abstract     = {In this work we consider a multilayered heat-wave system where a 3-D heat equation is coupled with a 3-D wave equation via a 2-D interface whose dynamics is described by a 2-D wave equation. This system can be viewed as a simplification of a certain fluid-structure interaction (FSI) PDE model where the structure is of composite-type; namely it consists of a “thin” layer and a “thick” layer. We associate the wellposedness of the system with a strongly continuous semigroup and establish its asymptotic decay. Our first result is semigroup well-posedness for the (FSI) PDE dynamics. Utilizing here a Lumer-Phillips approach, we show that the fluid-structure system generates a C 0 C0 -semigroup on a chosen finite energy space of data. As our second result, we prove that the solution to the (FSI) dynamics generated by the C 0 C0 -semigroup tends asymptotically to the zero state for all initial data . That is, the semigroup of the (FSI) system is strongly stable. For this stability work, we analyze the spectrum of the generator A and show that the spectrum of A does not intersect the imaginary axis.},

In this paper, rigorous stability estimates are derived when the frequency takes value in a bounded interval . It is showed that the ill-posedness of the inverse medium problem decreases as the width of the frequency interval becomes larger. More precisely, under certain regularity assumptions on the refractive index, the estimates indicate that the power in Hölder stability is an increasing function of the largest value in the frequency band. Finally, a Lipschitz stability estimate is obtained for the observable part of the medium function defined through a truncated trace formula.},

In this model, activated macrophages stimulated by a cytokine move along the concentration of cytokine gradient, which is termed chemotaxis. Our first purpose is to rigorously prove the boundedness and global existence of the classical solution to this model by applying heat operator semigroup theory and establishing some a priori estimates . The another purpose is to study the global asymptotic stability of a unique positive equilibrium, which together with the Turing instability are two aspects characteristic of mutual complement.},

In particular, we discuss possibly infinite networks in which the edge lengths can accumulate zero and port-Hamiltonian operators with Hamiltonians that neither are bounded nor bounded away from zero. We achieve this, by first providing a new description for maximal dissipative extensions of skew-symmetric operators. The main technical tool used for this is the notion of boundary systems. The latter generalizes the classical notion of boundary triple(t)s and allows to treat skew-symmetric operators with unequal deficiency indices. In order to deal with fairly general variable coefficients , we develop a theory of possibly unbounded, non-negative, injective weights on an abstract Hilbert space .},

  abstract     = {We study cocycles (non-autonomous dynamical systems) satisfying a certain squeezing condition with respect to the quadratic form of a bounded self-adjoint operator acting in a Hilbert space . We prove that (under additional assumptions) the orthogonal projector maps the fibres of some invariant set , containing bounded trajectories, in a one-to-one manner onto the negative subspace of the operator. This allows to reduce interesting dynamics onto this invariant set, which in some cases can be considered as a kind of inertial manifold for the cocycle. We consider applications of the reduction principle for periodic cocycles. For such cocycles we give an extension of the Massera second theorem, obtain the conditions for the existence of a Lyapunov stable periodic trajectory and prove convergence-type results, which we apply to study nonlinear periodic in time delayed-feedback equations posed in a proper Hilbert space and parabolic problems with a nonlinear periodic in time boundary control. The required operator is obtained as a solution to certain operator inequalities with the use of Yakubovich-Likhtarnikov frequency theorem for C 0 C0 -semigroups and its properties are established from the Lyapunov inequality and dichotomy of the linear part of the problem.},

It is shown that singular functions exist if and only if the complement of the domain has positive capacity, and that they satisfy very precise capacitary identities for superlevel sets. Suitably normalized singular functions are called Green functions. Uniqueness of Green functions is largely an open problem beyond unweighted R n Rn , but we show that all Green functions (in a given domain and with the same singularity) are comparable. As a consequence, for p -harmonic functions with a given pole we obtain a similar comparison result near the pole. Various characterizations of singular functions are also given. Our results hold in complete metric spaces with a doubling measure supporting a p -Poincaré inequality, or under similar local assumptions.},

First, the well-posedness of BDSVIEs in the sense of introduced M-solutions is established. Second, a comparison theorem of BDSVIEs is proved. As an application of the comparison theorem, we derive the existence of solutions of BDSVIEs with continuous coefficients. Third, a duality principle between linear forward doubly stochastic Volterra integral equations (FDSVIEs, for short) and BDSVIEs is obtained. Moreover, by virtue of the duality principle, a maximum principle of Pontryagin type is established for an optimal control problem of FDSVIEs.},

We also recall the well-known fact that the analog of the boundary values in (0.1) characterizes all self-adjoint extensions of T m i n Tmin in the singular case in a manner familiar from the regular case. We briefly discuss the singular Weyl–Titchmarsh–Kodaira m -function and finally illustrate the theory in some detail with the examples of the Bessel , Legendre, and Kummer (resp., Laguerre) operators.},

The threshold dynamics is rigorously investigated in terms of the basic reproduction number , for the cases of the 1-D whole space Ω = R Ω=R and general bounded spatial domain Ω with homogeneous Neumann and Direchlet boundary conditions. However, the minimal wave speed and spread speed of the model, which are the motivation of this model and thus most important, are only explored numerically. In the present paper, we offer a rigorous theoretical confirmation of what are numerically observed in [1] , concluding that if the basic reproduction number is larger than one, the model allows a spread speed which is also the minimal speed of traveling wave fronts , and this speed is linearly deterministic.},

We define the basic reproduction number R 0 R0 by the spectral radius of a compact positive linear operator and show that if R 0 &lt; 1 R0&amp;lt;1 , then the disease-free steady state is globally attractive, whereas if R 0 &gt; 1 R0&amp;gt;1 , then a positive endemic steady state exists and the system is uniformly persistent. By numerical simulation for the 2-dimensional case, we show that R 0 R0 depends on the shape of the spatial domain. This result is in contrast with the case of the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition , in which R 0 R0 is independent of the spatial domain.},

This mean exit time solves the boundary value problem ( − ε 2 Δ + ∇ V ⋅ ∇ ) u ε = 1 in Ω , u ε = 0 on ∂ Ω , ε → 0 . (−ε2Δ+∇V⋅∇)uε=1inΩ,uε=0on∂Ω,ε→0. The function V is smooth enough and has the only minimum at the origin contained in Ω; the minimum can be degenerate. At other points of Ω, the gradient of V is non-zero and the normal derivative of V at the boundary ∂Ω does not vanish. Our main result is a complete asymptotic expansion for u ε uε . The asymptotics for u ε uε involves an exponentially large term, which we find in a closed form. We also construct a power in ε asymptotic expansion such that this expansion and a mentioned exponentially large term approximate u ε uε up to arbitrary power of ε .},

For a C 1 C1 -partially hyperbolic endomorphism on a closed Riemannian manifold , a notion of stable pressure via the preimages of local stable manifolds is introduced and a corresponding variational principle is established. Moreover, equilibrium states and tangent functionals for pointwise preimage pressures and stable pressures are also considered. By describing the set of equilibrium states and tangent functionals and a sense of continuous dependence of equilibrium states with respect to the potential, we prove that the continuous potentials with unique equilibrium state form a dense G δ Gδ set.

As a first application we use these new approaches to prove that all star-like reversible limit cycles are algebraic. As a second application we introduce a function whose zeroes control the periodic orbits that persist as limit cycles when we perturb a star-like reversible center. As far as we know this is the first time that this question is solved in full generality.

For a few special cases, optimal orders are confirmed. We also study the synchronization of the model with viscous damping on the transversal displacement. Our results reveal that the order of the polynomial decay rate is sensitive to various boundary conditions and to the damping locations.},

Most of available results in this direction are based on microscopic approaches, where ODEs describe the evolution of regular cars and AVs. In this paper, we propose a multiscale approach, based on recently developed models for moving bottlenecks. Our main result is the proof of existence of solutions for time-varying bottleneck speed, which corresponds to open-loop controls with bounded variation .},

The main purpose of the present study is to solve a basic question on the theoretical side, i.e. the local well-posedness issue. The problem is formulated by the full Euler equations (without the assumption of irrotationality) for fluids, combined with the Plotnikov-Toland model for the elastic sheet. Based on geometric considerations, we derive energy estimates and prove the local existence and uniqueness of solution for this system in n ( ⩾ 2 ) n(⩾2) dimensions even if velocity fields are rotational.},

This model falls into the general class of Gelfand-type problems and constitutes a boundary value problem for a certain semi-linear elliptic equation that depends on two parameters: α characterizing the flow rate and λ (Frank-Kamenetskii parameter) characterizing the strength of the reaction. Similarly to the classical Gelfand problem, this equation admits a solution when the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter λ does not exceed some critical value ⁎ λ ⁎ ( α ) λ⁎(α) and admits no solutions for larger values of λ . We obtain the sharp asymptotic behavior of the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter in the strong flow limit ( α ≫ 1 α≫1 ).

We assume that the climate is shifting with speed c and obtain a complete classification of the long-time dynamical behaviour of the species. The model is similar to that in [9] with a slight refinement in the free boundary condition. While [9] , like many other works in the literature, investigates the case that unfavourable environment is shifting into the favourable habitat of the concerned species, here we examine the situation that the unfavourable habitat of an invasive species is replaced by a favourable environment with a shifting speed c . We show that a spreading-vanishing dichotomy holds, and there exists a critical speed c 0 c0 such that when spreading happens in the case c &lt; c 0 c&amp;lt;c0 , the spreading profile is determined by a semi-wave with forced speed c , but when c ≥ c 0 c≥c0 , the spreading profile is determined by the usual semi-wave with speed c 0 c0 .},

Complicated dynamical patterns, naturally depending on the velocity of the shifting resource and the propagation velocities of the limiting systems at both ∞ and −∞, emerge, and our focus is to characterize these patterns. We first characterize the persistence and extinction of an asymptotical Fisher-KPP type equation and then establish a key relationship between the asymptotical Fisher-KPP type and the asymptotical monostable type equations. These, together with comparison principles, enable us 1). to obtain asymptotic propagation behaviours of asymptotical monostable type equations and 2). to analyze and describe the influence of the velocity of the shifting resource and the propagation velocity of the limiting systems on the asymptotic propagations of the reaction-diffusion equation with an asymptotical monostable type nonlinearity.},

  abstract     = {The paper focuses on a nonlocal Dirichlet problem with asymmetric nonlinearities . The equation is driven by the fractional Laplacian ( − Δ ) s (−Δ)s for s ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) s∈(0,1) and exhibits a sublinear term containing a parameter λ , a linear term interfering with the spectrum of ( − Δ ) s (−Δ)s and a superlinear term with fractional critical growth. The corresponding local problem governed by the standard Laplacian operator was investigated by F. O. de Paiva and A. E. Presoto. It can be recovered by letting s ↑ 1 s↑1 . The statement given here in the nonlocal setting is also related to extensively studied topics for local elliptic operators as the Brezis-Nirenberg problem and asymmetric nonlinearities. We go beyond the case of the standard Laplacian taking advantage of recent contributions on nonlocal fractional equations. Our main result establishes the existence of at least three nontrivial solutions , with one nonnegative and one nonpositive, provided the parameter λ &gt; 0 λ&amp;gt;0 is sufficiently small. In order to overcome the difficulties in the nonlocal setting we develop new arguments that are substantially different from those used in previous works.},

Of the original models presented by Holling it is the only model for which the possible asymptotic behaviour of the prey and predator densities has not been determined yet. We extend the work of Liu who showed that for certain values of parameters of the Holling I system at least two nested limit cycles will occur surrounding a focus. His case corresponds to a bifurcation problem where limit cycles are created from a system with a continuum of singularities, i.e. a singular perturbation problem with slow-fast solutions.

Here, μ ≥ 0 μ≥0 is any given constant. The function γ ( ⋅ ) γ(⋅) represents a signal-dependent diffusion motility and is decreasing in v which models a density-suppressed motility in the process of stripe pattern formation through the self-trapping mechanism [9] , [20] . The major difficulty in analysis lies in the possible degeneracy of diffusion as v ↗ + ∞ v↗+∞ . In the present contribution, based on a subtle observation of the nonlinear structure, we develop a new method to rule out finite-time degeneracy in any spatial dimension for all smooth motility functions satisfying γ ( v ) &gt; 0 γ(v)&amp;gt;0 and γ ′ ( v ) ≤ 0 γ′(v)≤0 for v ≥ 0 v≥0 . Then we prove global existence of classical solution for (0.1) in the two-dimensional setting with any μ ≥ 0 μ≥0 . Moreover, the global solution is proven to be uniform-in-time bounded if either 1 / γ 1/γ satisfies certain polynomial growth condition or μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 . Besides, we pay particular attention to the specific case γ ( v ) = e − v γ(v)=e−v with μ = 0 μ=0 . Under the circumstances, system (0.1) becomes of great interest because it shares the same set of equilibria as well as the Lyapunov functional with the classical Keller–Segel model. A novel critical phenomenon in the two-dimensional setting is observed that with any initial datum of sub-critical mass, the global solution is proved to be uniform-in-time bounded, while with certain initial datum of super-critical mass, the global solution will become unbounded as time goes to infinity. Namely, blowup takes place in infinite time rather than finite time in our model which is distinct from the well-known fact that certain initial data of super-critical mass will enforce a finite-time blowup for the classical Keller–Segel system.}}},

Toward a rigorous validation of these computations, in this paper we analytically construct self-similar solutions (i) on an outer domain of the form { | x | &gt; R } {|x|&amp;gt;R} , and (ii) in a neighborhood of the points where the solution exhibits a spiraling vortex singularity. The outer solution is obtained as the fixed point of a contractive transformation, based on the Biot-Savart formula and integration along characteristics. The inner solution is constructed using a system of adapted coordinates, following the approach of V. Elling (2016) [17] .},

The parameter ϵ can actually be large or even any real number in the practical application of this model. When | ϵ | is not small, we cannot apply the averaging method because the system is not near-Hamiltonian. For general ϵ ∈ R , we present complete dynamics and more complex bifurcations of the Josephson equation in T S 1 , including saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation , Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, homoclinic loop bifurcation, two-saddle heteroclinic loop bifurcation, upper saddle connection bifurcation and lower saddle connection bifurcation. Moreover, we prove the monotonicity of bifurcation functions with respect to parameters and the nonexistence of a two-saddle heteroclinic loop for all a ≠ 0 .},

As an application, we apply the developed theory to an almost periodic SEIR model with an incubation period and obtain a threshold result on its global dynamics in terms of R 0 R0 . Finally, we present some numerical simulations. Numerical simulations indicate that prolonging the length of incubation period is beneficial for the control of the disease.

We study the dynamics near this bifurcation. First, we show that stationary, periodic solutions bifurcate from a homogeneous ground state . Second, we construct modulating traveling fronts which model an invasion of the unstable ground state by the periodic solutions. This provides a mechanism of pattern formation for the studied system. The existence proof uses center manifold theory for a reduction to a finite-dimensional problem. This is possible despite the presence of infinitely many imaginary eigenvalues for vanishing bifurcation parameter since the eigenvalues leave the imaginary axis with different velocities if the parameter increases. Furthermore, compared to non-conservative systems, we address new difficulties arising from an additional neutral mode at Fourier wave number k = 0 k=0 by exploiting that the amplitude of the conserved variable is small compared to the other variables.},

We show that the solution of the chemical system converges to an equilibrium exponentially in time. In addition, a resonance broadening modification of the acoustic wave kinetic equation is also studied with the same technique. For the near-resonance equation, if the resonance broadening frequency is larger than a threshold, the solution of the system goes to infinity as time evolves.},

This property is usually called nonlinear smoothing . We employ the method of infinite iterations of normal form reductions to obtain a very general theorem yielding existence of nonlinear smoothing for dispersive PDEs, contingent only on establishing two particular bounds. We then apply this theorem to show that the nonlinear smoothing property holds, depending on the regularity of the initial data, for five classical dispersive equations: in R R , the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger , the Korteweg-de Vries, the modified Korteweg-de Vries and the derivative Schrödinger equations ; in R 2 R2 , the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. For the aforementioned one-dimensional equations, this unifying methodology matches or improves the existing nonlinear smoothing results, while enlarging the ranges of Sobolev regularities where the property holds.},

  abstract     = {There are few examples of non-autonomous vector fields exhibiting complex dynamics that may be proven analytically. We analyse a family of periodic perturbations of a weakly attracting robust heteroclinic network defined on the two-sphere. We derive the first return map near the heteroclinic cycle for small amplitude of the perturbing term, and we reduce the analysis of the non-autonomous system to that of a two-dimensional map on a cylinder. Interesting dynamical features arise from a discrete-time Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. When the perturbation strength is small the first return map has an attracting invariant closed curve that is not contractible on the cylinder. Near the centre of frequency locking there are parameter values with bistability : the invariant curve coexists with an attracting fixed point. Increasing the perturbation strength there are periodic solutions that bifurcate into a closed contractible invariant curve and into a region where the dynamics is conjugate to a full shift on two symbols.},

Moreover, the existence of compact global and exponential attractors is proved through a stabilizability estimate. This estimate which is established under restrictions on γ 1 γ1 and γ 2 γ2 and independently of the rotational inertia parameter ϖ , provides bounds on the attractors&#39; fractal dimension .

In the case of flat surfaces with local perturbations, an equivalent variational formulation is deduced in a truncated bounded domain and the existence of solutions are shown for general incoming waves.

In our approach, we reduce the model to a cooperative planar periodic system .

Then, using the theory of asymptotically periodic semiflows, we extend the results on the reduced system to the original model.

  abstract     = {The paper is concerned with the propagation of ion-acoustic shock waves in a collision dominated plasma whose equations of motion are described by the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes-Poisson system for ions with the electron density determined by the Boltzmann relation. The main results include three parts: (a) We establish the existence and uniqueness of a small-amplitude smooth traveling wave by solving a 3-D ODE in terms of the center manifold theorem. (b) We study the shock structure in a specific asymptotic regime where the viscosity coefficient and the shock strength are proportional to ε and the Debye length is proportional to ( δ ε ) 1 / 2 (δε)1/2 with two parameters ε and δ , and show that in the limit ε → 0 ε→0 , shock profiles obtained in (a) can be approximated by the profiles of KdV-Burgers uniformly for 0 &lt; δ ≤ δ 0 0&amp;lt;δ≤δ0 with some δ 0 &gt; 0 δ0&amp;gt;0 . The proof is based on the suitable construction of the KdV-Burgers shock profiles together with the delicate analysis of a linearized variable coefficient system in exponentially weighted Sobolev spaces involving parameters ε and δ . (c) We also prove the large time asymptotic stability of traveling waves under suitably small smooth zero-mass perturbations. Note that the ions&#39; temperature is allowed to be zero in parts (a) and (b), but necessarily required to be strictly positive in the proof of part (c).},

We consider a transport equation describing the time-evolution of a conservative “mass” (probability measure), which represents an infinite ensemble of interacting particles. The driving vector field contains nonlocal terms and it is affine in the control variable. The control is assumed to be common for all the agents, i.e., it is a function of time variable only. The main feature of the addressed model is the admittance of “shock” impacts, i.e. controls, whose influence on each agent can be arbitrary close to Dirac-type distributions. We construct an impulsive relaxation of this system and of the corresponding optimal control problem . For the latter we establish a necessary optimality condition in the form of Pontryagin&#39;s Maximum Principle.},

If the invariant manifolds of the bifocus satisfy a non-degeneracy condition, a sequence of hyperbolic suspended horseshoes arises near the cycle, with one expanding and two contracting directions. We extend previous results on the field and we show that the first return map to a given cross section may be approximated by a map exhibiting heteroclinic tangencies associated to two periodic orbits. Under an additional hypothesis about the coexistence of two heteroclinically related periodic points (one without dominated splitting into one-dimensional sub-bundles), the heteroclinic tangencies can be slightly modified in order to satisfy Tatjer&#39;s conditions for a generalized tangency of codimension two. This configuration may be seen as the organizing center, by which one can obtain Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations and therefore, strange attractors , infinitely many sinks and non-trivial contracting wandering domains.},

  abstract     = {We consider the non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with hyperbolic heat conduction and a law for the stress tensor which is modified correspondingly by Maxwell&#39;s law. These two relaxations, turning the whole system into a hyperbolic one, are not only treated simultaneously, but are also considered in a version having Galilean invariance. For this more complicated relaxed system, the global well-posedness is proved for small data. Moreover, for vanishing relaxation parameters the solutions are shown to converge to solutions of the classical system.},

  abstract     = {The vanishing viscosity limit for the multi-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations to the corresponding Euler equations is a difficult and challenging problem in the mathematics. Recently, L.Li, D.Wang and Y.Wang [17] verified that the solutions for the 2D compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations converge to the planar rarefaction wave solution for the corresponding 2D Euler equations as viscosity vanishes with a convergence rate ϵ 1 / 6 | ln ⁡ ϵ | ϵ1/6|ln⁡ϵ| . In this paper, the vanishing viscosity limit of 2D non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations is studied. In contrast to the work [17] , the convergence rate for the 2D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations is improved to ϵ 2 / 7 | ln ⁡ ϵ | 2 ϵ2/7|ln⁡ϵ|2 by choosing a different scaling argument and performing more detailed energy estimates.},

Hyper-viscosity is applied in many numerical schemes , and in particular horizontal hyper-viscosity appears in meteorological models. A classical result by Lions states that for the Navier-Stokes equations uniqueness of global weak Leray-Hopf solutions for initial data in L 2 L2 holds if −Δ is replaced by ( − Δ ) 5 / 4 (−Δ)5/4 . Here, for the primitive equations the corresponding result is proven for ( − Δ ) 8 / 5 (−Δ)8/5 . For the case of horizontal hyper-viscosity l = 2 l=2 is sufficient in both cases. Strong convergence for ε → 0 ε→0 of hyper-viscous solutions to a weak solution of the Navier-Stokes and primitive equations, respectively, is proven as well. The approach presented here is based on the construction of strong solutions via an evolution equation approach for initial data in L 2 L2 and weak-strong uniqueness.},

In this paper precise quantitative estimates for such enhancement are derived when the given field is the one excited by an emitter of a dipole type and inclusions are spheres of the same radii in three dimensions . Derived estimates reveal the difference, as well as the similarity, between enhancement of the field excited by the emitter and that of the smooth back-ground field. In particular, an estimate shows that when the enhancement occurs, the factor of enhancement is ( ϵ | log ⁡ ϵ | ) − 1 (ϵ|log⁡ϵ|)−1 , which is different from that for the smooth background field, which is known to be ( ϵ | log ⁡ ϵ | ) − 1 (ϵ|log⁡ϵ|)−1 ( ϵ is the distance between two inclusions).},

The main idea is based on an application of new transformation theorems for principal and antiprincipal solutions at infinity and on new limit properties of the comparative index involving these solutions. This work generalizes the recently obtained Sturmian separation theorems on unbounded intervals for one system by the authors (2019), as well as the Sturmian comparison theorems and transformation theorems on compact intervals by J.

While the spectrum in the blunted domain Ω ε Ωε consists for a fixed ε of an unbounded positive sequence { λ j ε } j = 1 ∞ {λjε}j=1∞ of eigenvalues, we single out different types of behavior of some eigenvalues as ε → + 0 ε→+0 : in particular, stable, blinking, and gliding families of eigenvalues are found. We also describe a mechanism which transforms the family of the eigenvalue sequences into the continuous spectrum of the problem in Ω, when ε → + 0 ε→+0 .},

Passing to suitable re-scaled variables, we show the existence of a travelling wave solution in logarithmic time that connects the level u = 0 u=0 and the unique nonnegative steady state associated to the re-scaled problem posed in a lower dimension, i.e. in D ⊂ R N D⊂RN . We then employ this special wave to show that a wide class of solutions converge to the universal stationary profile in the middle of the tube and at the same time they spread in both axial tube directions, miming the behaviour of the travelling wave (and its reflection) for large times. The first main feature of our analysis is that wave fronts are constructed through a (nonstandard) combination of diffusion and absorbing boundary conditions, which gives rise to a sort of Fisher-KPP long-time behaviour. The second one is that the nonlinear diffusion term plays a crucial role in our analysis. Actually, in the linear diffusion framework p = 2 p=2 solutions behave quite differently.},

We focus in particular on bounded perturbations, arising as the Weyl quantization of suitable time-dependent symbols, as well as on quadratic and sub-quadratic non-smooth functions, hence generalizing the results in [40] . We then prove local well-posedness on the same function spaces for the nonlinear Dirac equation with a general nonlinearity , including power-type terms and the Thirring model. For this study we adopt the unifying framework of vector-valued time-frequency analysis [56] ; most of the preliminary results are stated under general assumptions and hence they may be of independent interest.},

We provide a rigorous justification of the effective equations. The estimate of the asymptotic error is carried out in an L 1 L1 -norm in the Bloch variables. This translates to a supremum norm estimate in the physical variables . In order to investigate the existence of gap solitons of the d -dimensional CMEs, we discuss spectral gaps of the CMEs. For N = 4 N=4 and d = 2 d=2 a family of time harmonic gap solitons is constructed formally asymptotically and numerically. Moving gap solitons have not been found for d &gt; 1 d&amp;gt;1 and for the considered values of N due to the absence of a spectral gap in the standard moving frame variables.},

Among other things, this work answers the question about necessity of safe-load conditions in case of viscoplasticity, which arise in the paper of K. Chełmiński (2001) [11] . We proved that solutions can be obtained without assuming any kind of safe-load conditions. Moreover, in the manuscript we consider much more general model than in the above mentioned paper. Namely, we consider the model with mixed boundary conditions and we allow a possible disturbance of the inelastic constitutive function by a globally Lipschitz function. Presented approach shows that via the same methods one can prove existence of pointwise solutions for: coercive models, self-controlling models, models with polynomial growth (not necessary of single valued) and monotone-gradient type models of viscoplasticity.},

  abstract     = {We investigate an optimal control problem with a large number of agents (possibly infinitely many). Although the dynamical system (a controlled ordinary differential equation) is of the same type for every agent, each agent may have a different control. So, the multi-agent dynamical system has two levels: a microscopic one, which concerns the control system of each agent, and a macroscopic level, which describes the evolution of the crowd of all agents. The state variable of the macroscopic system is the set of positions of the agents. In the present paper we define and study the evolution of such a global dynamical system whose solutions are called solution tubes . We also consider a minimization problem associated with the multi-agent system and we give a new characterization of the corresponding value function as the unique solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation stated on the space of compact subsets of R d Rd .},

  abstract     = {Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) have become a key modeling tool in applications. Yet, there are many classes of SPDEs, where the existence and regularity theory for solutions is not completely developed. Here we contribute to this aspect and prove the existence of mild solutions for a broad class of quasilinear Cauchy problems, including - among others - cross-diffusion systems as a key application. Our solutions are local-in-time and are derived via a fixed point argument in suitable function spaces. The key idea is to combine in a suitable way the classical theory of deterministic quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with recent theory of evolution semigroups. We also show, how to apply our theory to the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto (SKT) model. Furthermore, we provide examples of blow-up and ill-posed operators, which can occur after finite-time showing that solutions can only be local-in-time for general quasilinear SPDEs, while they might be global-in-time for special subclasses of problems.},

The limit is in the Hölder space and is unique. Moreover, the convergence rate is of order ε 2 ε2 including the pressure. And, for the compressible case, the extra force influences the asymptotic behaver to the open end, while the effect vanishes in the limiting process from compressible flows to the incompressible ones.

The properties include asymptotic behavior , stability, bifurcation analysis, etc. In this paper we study a tumor model with a time-delay, and establish a bifurcation result for all even mode n ≥ 2 n≥2 . The time delay represents the time taken for cells to undergo replication (approximately 24 hours). In contrast to some results in the literature where bifurcation is established for sufficiently large bifurcation parameter, our result includes the smallest bifurcation point , which is crucial as this is the point of stability changes under certain conditions as we have shown in [40] . The inclusion of a time delay, although biologically very reasonable, introduces two significant mathematical challenges: (a) the explicit solution utilized to verify the bifurcation theorem is no longer available; (b) the system becomes non-local because of the time-delay, which in term produces technical difficulties for the PDE estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first paper on the study of bifurcation for tumor models with a time delay.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider the asymptotic stability of rarefaction wave to the equilibrium diffusion limit equations without viscosity from radiation hydrodynamic. The present pressure includes a fourth order term about the absolute temperature from radiation effect as well as the ideal polytropic part, which brings the main difficulty to prove the asymptotic stability of the rarefaction wave. To overcome it, we impose an additional restriction condition on the density and the temperature at the far field, see (1.14) . This condition is sufficient to achieve the a priori estimates of the solutions.},

The shape of each stem, and the density of leaves, are designed in order to maximize the captured sunlight, subject to a cost for transporting water and nutrients from the root to all the leaves. Given the intensity of light, depending on the height above ground, we first solve the optimization problem determining the best possible shape for a single stem. We then study a competitive equilibrium among a large number of similar plants, where the shape of each stem is optimal given the shade produced by all others. Uniqueness of equilibria is proved by analyzing the two-point boundary value problem for a system of ODEs derived from the necessary conditions for optimality .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we mainly study a two-species competition model in a one-dimensional advective homogeneous environment, where the two species are identical except their diffusion rates. One interesting feature of the model is that the boundary condition at the downstream end represents a net loss of individuals, which is tuned by a parameter b to measure the magnitude of the loss. When the upstream end has the no-flux condition, Lou and Zhou (2015) [11] have confirmed that large diffusion rate is more favorable when 0 ≤ b &lt; 1 0≤b&amp;lt;1 . Here we consider the case where the upstream end has the free-flow condition, which means that the upstream end is linked to a lake. We firstly investigate the corresponding single species model. Here we establish the existence and uniqueness of positive steady states. Then for the two-species model, we find that the parameter b can be regarded as a bifurcation parameter. Precisely, when 0 ≤ b &lt; 1 0≤b&amp;lt;1 , large diffusion rate is more favorable while when b &gt; 1 b&amp;gt;1 , small diffusion rate is selected (if exists). When b = 1 b=1 , the system is degenerate in the sense that there is a compact global attractor consisting of a continuum of steady states.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study the near-field refractor problem with point source at the origin and prescribed target on the given receiver surface Σ. This nonvariational problem can be studied in the framework of prescribed Jacobian equations. We construct the corresponding generating function and show that the Aleksandrov and the Brenier type solutions are equivalent. Our main result establishes local smoothness of Aleksandrov&#39;s solutions when the data is smooth and when the medium containing the source has smaller refractive index than the medium containing the target. This is done by deriving the Monge-Ampère type equation that smooth solutions satisfy and establishing the validity of the MTW condition for a large class of receiver surfaces, which in turn implies the local C 2 C2 regularity of the refractor.},

Moreover, our estimate is stronger than Zhang and Zhang&#39;s estimate (see Remark 2 in Section 4 ). Those results are generalizations of Li-Yau, Hamilton, Li-Xu type gradient estimates under the integral Ricci curvature bounds.

First, we construct approximate solutions by a vector-valued BGK model with a kinetic coupling function. Introducing so-called kinetic invariant domains and using the method of compensated compactness justifies the relaxation towards the isentropic gas equations. We will prove that certain entropy flux inequalities for the kinetic coupling function remain true for the traces of the macroscopic solution. These inequalities define the macroscopic coupling condition. Our techniques are also applicable to networks with arbitrary many junctions which may possibly contain circles. We give several examples for coupling functions and prove corresponding entropy flux inequalities.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the hydrodynamic limit for the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes/Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations in a two or three dimensional bounded domain when the initial density is bounded away from zero. The proof relies on the relative entropy argument to obtain the strong convergence of macroscopic density of the particles n ϵ nϵ in L ∞ ( 0 , T ; L 1 ( Ω ) ) L∞(0,T;L1(Ω)) , which extends the works of Goudon-Jabin-Vasseur [15] and Mellt-Vasseur [26] to inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes/Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. Precisely, the relative entropy estimates in [15] and [26] give the strong convergence of u ϵ uϵ and n ϵ nϵ , ρ ϵ ρϵ and n ϵ nϵ , respectively. However, we only obtain the strong convergence of n ϵ nϵ and u ϵ uϵ from the relative entropy estimate, and we use another way to obtain the strong convergence of ρ ϵ ρϵ via the convergence of u ϵ uϵ . Furthermore, when the initial density may vanish, taking advantage of compactness result L M ↪ ↪ H − 1 LM↪↪H−1 of Orlicz spaces in 2D, we obtain the convergence of n ϵ nϵ in L ∞ ( 0 , T ; H − 1 ( Ω ) ) L∞(0,T;H−1(Ω)) , which is used to obtain the relative entropy estimate, thus we also show the hydrodynamic limit for 2D inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes/Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations when there is initial vacuum.},

Dupire recently developed a functional Itô formula, which has changed the landscape of the study of stochastic functional differential equations and encouraged a reconsideration of many problems and applications. Based on the new development, this work examines functional diffusions with two-time scales in which the slow-varying process includes path-dependent functionals and the fast-varying process is a rapidly-changing diffusion. The gene expression of biochemical reactions occurring in living cells in the introduction of this paper is such a motivating example. This paper establishes mixed functional Itô formulas and the corresponding martingale representation. Then it develops an averaging principle using weak convergence methods. By treating the fast-varying process as a random “noise”, under appropriate conditions, it is shown that the slow-varying process converges weakly to a stochastic functional differential equation whose coefficients are averages of that of the original slow-varying process with respect to the invariant measure of the fast-varying process.},

By the means of a multi-scale asymptotic expansion we construct a controlled solution to the “Navier-Stokes+rigid body” system thanks to some controlled solutions to “Euler+rigid body”-type systems and by using that the influence of the boundary layer on the solid motion turns out to be sufficiently small.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we first introduce a new function space M H θ , p MHθ,p whose norm is given by the ℓ p ℓp -sum of modulated H θ Hθ -norms of a given function. In particular, when θ &lt; − 1 2 θ&amp;lt;−12 , we show that the space M H θ , p MHθ,p agrees with the modulation space M 2 , p ( R ) M2,p(R) on the real line and the Fourier-Lebesgue space F L p ( T ) FLp(T) on the circle. We use this equivalence of the norms and the Galilean symmetry to adapt the conserved quantities constructed by Killip-Vişan-Zhang to the modulation space and Fourier-Lebesgue space setting. By applying the scaling symmetry, we then prove global well-posedness of the one-dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) in almost critical spaces. More precisely, we show that the cubic NLS on R R is globally well-posed in M 2 , p ( R ) M2,p(R) for any p &lt; ∞ p&amp;lt;∞ , while the renormalized cubic NLS on T T is globally well-posed in F L p ( T ) FLp(T) for any p &lt; ∞ p&amp;lt;∞ . In Appendix, we also establish analogous global-in-time bounds for the modified KdV equation (mKdV) in the modulation spaces on the real line and in the Fourier-Lebesgue spaces on the circle. An additional key ingredient of the proof in this case is a Galilean transform which converts the mKdV to the mKdV-NLS equation.},

The construction of a measure solution with density containing Dirac measures supported on the surface of the cone is reduced to find a regular periodic solution of highly nonlinear and singular ordinary differential equations (ODE).

  abstract     = {A stationary boundary-value problem for the Boltzmann equation in a half space is considered for a binary mixture of gases when the indata on the boundary are given for the both species. Under the assumption that one of the species is dominant and close to equilibrium but the density of the other is small, the problem is decomposed into two half-space problems: the so-called Milne problem for the linearized Boltzmann equation with a source term for the dominant species and that for the linear Boltzmann equation for the low-density species. The two problems are coupled in such a way that the source term in the former is specified by the solution of the latter. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the two problems are proved, and their accurate asymptotic behavior in the far field is obtained. In particular, the precise rate of approach of the solution to the state at infinity is expressed in terms of the decay rate in the molecular velocity of the boundary data for both species.},

In particular, we show existence of a viscosity solution to the switching system by a novel construction of sub- and supersolutions and application of Perron&#39;s method. Error bounds for monotone schemes for the HJB equation are then derived from estimates near the boundary, where the standard regularisation procedure for viscosity solutions is not applicable, and are found to be of the same order as known results for the whole space. We deduce error bounds for some common finite difference and truncated semi-Lagrangian schemes.},

We show that in the opposite case , when M lies below N , the uniqueness can fail in the following strong sense: for the same boundary data, there are two solutions that differ at points arbitrarily close to the origin. In the latter case, we also establish existence of a local solution (under a Lipschitz condition on the function f ).

A flow force function formulation of the irrotational water wave problem is developed. Variational approach is used to prove the existence of small amplitude irrotational traveling wave solutions . Local bifurcation results have been proved relying on Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we characterize global regularity in the sense of Shubin of twisted partial differential operators of second order in dimension 2. These operators form a class containing the twisted Laplacian, and in bi-unique correspondence with second order ordinary differential operators with polynomial coefficients and symbol of degree 2. This correspondence is established by a transformation of Wigner type. In this way the global regularity of twisted partial differential operators turns out to be equivalent to global regularity and injectivity of the corresponding ordinary differential operators, which can be completely characterized in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the Weyl symbol. In conclusion we observe that we have obtained a new class of globally regular partial differential operators which is disjoint from the class of hypo-elliptic operators in the sense of Shubin.},

We show, that if the problem is stabilizable and detectable, the solution of the extremal equation can be bounded by the right-hand side including initial data with the bound being independent of the time horizon. Consequently, the influence of perturbations of the extremal equations decays exponentially in time. This property can for example be used to construct efficient space and time discretizations for a Model Predictive Control scheme. Furthermore, a turnpike property for unbounded but admissible control of general semigroups can be deduced.},

The general existing proofs of this theorem depend on Fenichel&#39;s geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up techniques. In this work, we give a short and elementary proof of the entry-exit theorem based on a direct study of asymptotic formulas of the underlying solutions. We employ this theorem to a broad class of slow-fast planar systems to obtain existence, global uniqueness and asymptotic orbital stability of relaxation oscillations. The results are then applied to a diffusive predator-prey model with Holling type II functional response to establish periodic traveling wave solutions . Furthermore, we extend our work to another class of slow-fast systems that can have multiple orbits exhibiting relaxation oscillations, and subsequently apply the results to a two time-scale Holling-Tanner predator-prey model with Holling type IV functional response. It is generally assumed in the literature that the non-trivial equilibrium points exist uniquely in the interior of the domains bounded by the relaxation oscillations; we do not make this assumption in this paper.},

Necessary conditions for the integrability of such systems are deduced from integrability of dominate term of the potential which usually is appropriately chosen homogeneous term of V . We show that introducing weights compatible with the canonical structure one can find new dominant terms which can give new necessary conditions for integrability. To deduce them we investigate integrability of a family of bi-homogeneous potentials which depend on two integer parameters. Unexpectedly systems with these potentials can be reduced to the Lotka–Volterra quadratic planar vector field. Then theorem of Jean Moulin Ollagnier, allows us to make complete classification of integrable cases. Moreover, the reduction is used for explicit integration of an exceptional case with a polynomial first integral of degree 4 in momenta.},

The aim is to present some classes of problems on an annulus with classical solutions. The first class is a single state equation problem with a constant right-hand side and homogenous Dirichlet boundary condition . By analyzing the optimality conditions, we are able to show that there exists a unique (classical) solution. We prove that, depending on the amounts of given materials, only two optimal configurations in both two- and three-dimensional case are possible. The second class of problems deals with a two-state optimal design problem. A numerical method based on shape derivative is presented, showing good results when applied to described problems with classical solutions on annulus.},

For any positive integer k we obtain a solution with exactly k -zeroes yielding solutions to the Yamabe equation with exactly k connected isoparametric hypersurfaces as nodal set. The idea of the proof is to consider the initial value problems on the singularities, and then to solve the corresponding double shooting problem, matching the values of w and w ′ w′ at the unique zero of h . In particular we obtain solutions with exactly one zero, providing solutions of the Yamabe equation with low energy.},

Despite being the equation of an idealistic model, its study is justified as a way of understanding mean field games in which the individual players&#39; randomness is negligible; in this sense it can be compared to the study of ideal fluids. We restrict ourselves to mean field games with smooth coefficients but do not impose any monotonicity conditions on the running and initial costs, and we do not require convexity of the Hamiltonian , thus extending the result of Gangbo and Swiech to a considerably broader class of Hamiltonians.},

A solution x ( t ) is called a periodic solution if x ( 0 ) = x ( 1 ) . In order to estimate the number of isolated periodic solutions of the equation, we propose a hypothesis (H) which is only concerned with S ( x , t ) on m straight lines: There exist m real numbers λ 1 &lt; ⋯ &lt; λ m such that either ( − 1 ) i ⋅ S ( λ i , t ) ≥ 0 for i = 1 , ⋯ , m , or ( − 1 ) i ⋅ S ( λ i , t ) ≤ 0 for i = 1 , ⋯ , m . By means of Lagrange interpolation formula, we prove that the equation has at most m isolated periodic solutions (counted with multiplicities) if hypothesis (H) holds, and the upper bound is sharp. Furthermore, this conclusion is also valid under some weaker geometric hypotheses. Applying our main result for the trigonometrical generalized Abel equation with coefficients of degree one, we give a criterion to obtain the upper bound for the number of isolated periodic solutions. This criterion is “almost equivalent” to hypothesis (H) and can be much more effectively checked.},

  abstract     = {We consider the so called combined energy of a deformation between two concentric annuli and minimize it, provided that it keep order of the boundaries. It is an extension of the corresponding result of Euclidean energy. It is interesting that the minimizers are certain radial mappings and they exist if and only if the annulus on the image domain is not too thin, provided that the original annulus is fixed. This in turn implies a Nitsche type phenomenon. Next we consider the combined distortion and obtain certain related results which are dual to the results for combined energy, which also involve some Nitsche type phenomenon. The main part of the paper is concerned with the total combined energy, a certain integral operator, defined as a convex linear combination of the combined energy and combined distortion, of diffeomorphisms between two concentric annuli A ( 1 , r ) A(1,r) and B ( 1 , R ) B(1,R) . First we construct radial minimizers of total combined energy, then we prove that those radial minimizers are absolute minimizers on the class of all mappings between the annuli under certain constraint. This extends the main result obtained by Iwaniec and Onninen in [9] .},

  abstract     = {Turing-Hopf bifurcation is considered as an important mechanism for generating complex spatio-temporal patterns in dynamical systems . In this work, the normal form up to the third order for the Hopf-steady state bifurcation, which includes the Turing-Hopf bifurcation, of a general system of partial functional differential equations (PFDEs) in a bounded spatial region of any dimension, is derived based on the center manifold and the normal form theories of PFDEs. The explicit formula for the coefficients in the normal form of Hopf-steady state bifurcation are presented concisely in a matrix form, which makes it more convenient in not only symbolic derivation but also numerical implementation. This provides an approach of showing the existence and stability of stationary and time-periodic solutions with spatial heterogeneity. The derived formulas are also applicable to partial differential equations and functional differential equations.},

Indeed we exhibit some sequences of exact solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with vanishing viscosity which are given by multi-scale asymptotic expansions involving some characteristic boundary layers given by some linear PDEs .

  abstract     = {In this paper, we build up an output feedback law to stabilize a sampled-data controlled heat equation (with a potential) in a bounded domain Ω. The feedback law abides the following rules: First, we divide equally the time interval [ 0 , + ∞ ) [0,+∞) into infinitely many disjoint time periods, and divide each time period into three disjoint subintervals . Second, for each time period, we observe a solution over an open subset of Ω in the first subinterval; take sample from outputs at one time point of the first subinterval; add a time-invariant output feedback control over another open subset of Ω in the second subinterval; let the equation evolve free in the last subinterval. Thus, the corresponding feedback control is of sampled-data. Our feedback law has the following advantages: the sampling period (which is the length of the above time period) can be arbitrarily taken; the feedback law has an explicit expression in terms of the sampling period; the behaviors of the norm of the feedback law, when the sampling period goes to zero or infinity, are clear. The construction of the feedback law is based on two kinds of approximate null-controllability for heat equations. One has time-invariant controls, while another has impulse controls. The studies of the aforementioned controllability with time-invariant controls need a new observability inequality for heat equations built up in the current work.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate multiple existence of homoclinic solutions for a periodically perturbed N -dimensional autonomous differential equation with a degenerate homoclinic solution of degeneracy degree d . Known results were obtained with a functional perturbation, which is regarded as an infinite-dimensional parameter. In this paper we consider a single parameter perturbation, a special form of former&#39;s functional perturbation, and prove that the single parameter is enough to unfold all possibilities of linearly independent homoclinic solutions bifurcated from the unperturbed degenerate homoclinic one, which actually improves the known results. Furthermore, we prove that those homoclinic solutions are all transversal , showing co-existence of multiple chaotic motions.},

The novelty of this work is that we allow f s ( x , 0 ) fs(x,0) to be sign-changing and to decay fast up to a Hardy potential near infinity. First, we introduce a weighted generalized principal eigenvalue and use it to characterize the Liouville type result for Eq. ( S S ) that was proposed by H. Berestycki. Secondly, if ( a i j ) (aij) is the identity matrix and q is a compactly supported divergence-free vector field, we find a condition that Eq. ( S S ) admits no positive solution for K &gt; K ⋆ K&amp;gt;K⋆ , where K ⋆ K⋆ is a certain positive threshold. To achieve this, we derive some new techniques, thanks to the recent results on the principal spectral theory for elliptic operators [14] , to overcome some fundamental difficulties arising from the lack of compactness in the domain. This extends a nice result of Berestycki-Hamel-Nadirashvili [5] on the limit of eigenvalues with large drift to the case without periodic condition. Lastly, the well-posedness and long time behavior of the evolution equation corresponding to ( S S ) are further investigated. The main tool of our work is based on the maximum principle for elliptic and parabolic equations however it is far from being obvious to see if the comparison principle for ( S S ) holds or not.},

The parametrization method relies on a suitable approximate solution of a functional equation. In the case of parabolic points, if the manifolds have dimension two or higher, in general this approximation cannot be obtained in the ring of polynomials but as a sum of homogeneous functions and it is given in [4] . Assuming a sufficiently good approximation is found, here we provide an “a posteriori” result which gives a true invariant manifold close to the approximate one. In the differentiable case, in some cases, there is a loss of regularity. We also consider the case of parabolic periodic orbits of periodic vector fields and the dependence of the manifolds on parameters. Examples are provided. We apply our method to prove that in several situations, namely, related to the parabolic infinity in the elliptic spatial three body problem, these invariant manifolds exist and do have polynomial approximations .},

We study in detail the existence of dissonant points of the flow, which play a key role in the description of the region of influence of a non-saddle set. These points are responsible for much of the dynamical and topological complexity of the system. We also study non-saddle sets from the point of view of the Conley index theory and consider, among other things, the case of flows on manifolds with trivial first cohomology group . For flows on these manifolds, dynamical robustness is equivalent to topological robustness. We carry out a particular study of 2-dimensional flows and give a topological condition which detects the existence of dissonant points for flows on surfaces. We also prove that isolated invariant continua of planar flows with global region of influence are necessarily attractors or repellers.},

Our results include Rellich&#39;s theorem, the limiting absorption principle, radiation condition bounds and Sommerfeld&#39;s uniqueness, and most of these are stated and proved in sharp form employing Besov-type spaces. For the proofs we adopt a commutator scheme by Ito–Skibsted [13] . A feature of the paper is a special choice of an escape function related to parabolic coordinates, which conforms well with classical mechanics for the Stark Hamiltonian. The whole setting of the paper, such as the conjugate operator and the Besov-type spaces, is generated by this single escape function. We apply our results in the sequel paper [5] .},

  abstract     = {By proving the existence of non-monotone and non-oscillating wavefronts for the Nicholson&#39;s blowflies diffusive equation (the NDE), we answer an open question from [16] . Surprisingly, wavefronts of such a kind can be observed even for arbitrarily small delays. Similarly to the pushed fronts, obtained waves are not linearly determined. In contrast, a broader family of eventually monotone wavefronts for the NDE is indeed determined by properties of the spectra of the linearized equations. Our proofs use essentially several specific characteristics of the blowflies birth function (its unimodal form and the negativity of its Schwarz derivative, among others). One of the key auxiliary results of the paper shows that the Mallet-Paret–Cao–Arino theory of super-exponential solutions for scalar equations can be extended for some classes of second order delay differential equations . For the new type of non-monotone waves to the NDE, our numerical simulations also confirm their stability properties established by Mei et al.},

For 0 &lt; λ &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;λ&amp;lt;1 and μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 , or λ = 1 λ=1 but μ &gt; 2 μ&amp;gt;2 , the solutions are proved to exist globally in time, when the derivatives of the initial data are small, but the initial data themselves can be arbitrarily large. This is the so-called challenging case of global solutions with large initial data; while, when the initial Riemann invariants are monotonic and their derivatives with absolute value are large at least at one point, then the solutions are still bounded, but their derivatives will blow up at finite time , somewhat like the singularity formed by shock waves. For λ &gt; 1 λ&amp;gt;1 and μ &gt; 0 μ&amp;gt;0 , or λ = 1 λ=1 but 0 &lt; μ ≤ 1 0&amp;lt;μ≤1 , the derivatives of solutions will blow up even for all initial data, including the interesting case of blow-up solutions with small initial data. Here the initial Riemann invariants are monotonic. In fact, such a blow-up phenomenon is determined by the mechanism of the dynamic system itself. In order to prove the global existence of solutions with large initial data, we introduce a new energy functional related to the Riemann invariants, which crucially enables us to build up the maximum principle for the corresponding Riemann invariants, and the uniform boundedness for the local solutions. Finally, numerical simulations in different cases are carried out, which further confirm our theoretical results.},

The main results assert global classical solvability in an associated initial-boundary value problem posed in one- or two-dimensional domains with any given suitably regular initial data . This is achieved by discovering a quasi-Lyapunov functional structure that allows to appropriately cope with the presence of nonlinear zero-order interaction terms which apparently form the most significant additional mathematical challenge of the considered system in comparison to previously studied haptotaxis models.},

  abstract     = {We prove several results establishing existence and regularity of stable manifolds for different classes of special solutions for evolution equations (these equations may be ill-posed): a single specific solution, an invariant torus filled with quasiperiodic orbits or more general manifolds of solutions. In the later cases, which include several orbits, we also establish the invariant manifolds of an orbit depend smoothly on the orbit (analytically in the case of quasi-periodic orbits and finitely differentiably in the case of more general families). We first establish a general abstract theorem which, under suitable (spectral, non-degeneracy, analyticity) assumptions on the linearized equation, establishes the existence of the desired manifold. Related results appear in the literature, but our results allow that the nonlinearity is unbounded and we obtain smoothness of the invariant manifolds. This makes the results in this paper applicable to some several models of current interest that could not be treated otherwise. We discuss in detail the Boussinesq equation of water waves (similar phenomena happen in other long wave approximations) and complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. More recently, we observed [11] that our results also apply to Mean Field Games. Since the equations we consider may be ill-posed, part of the requirements for the stable manifold is that one can define the (forward) dynamics on them. Note also that the methods that are based in the existence of dynamics (such as graph transform) do not apply to ill-posed equation. We use the methods based on integral equations (Perron method) associated with the partial dynamics, but we need to take advantage of smoothing properties of the partial dynamics. Note that, even if the families of solutions we started with are finite dimensional, the stable manifolds may be infinite dimensional.},

We introduce some input-output conditions relative to ergodic measures and we show that certain nonuniform admissibility properties imply the existence of the uniform asymptotic behaviors . First, we obtain characterizations for uniform exponential stability. As an application, we prove that in order to preserve the uniform exponential stability subject to perturbations it is sufficient for the perturbed system to be close enough to the initial system on a measurable set . Next, we deduce criteria for uniform exponential expansiveness based on some exact admissibilities relative to ergodic measures.

The proof relies on a correct definition of the relative energy, to use this tool we then have to introduce a change of coordinates to transform the strong solution to the domain of the weak solution in order to use it as a test function in the relative energy inequality. Estimating all arising terms we prove that the weak solution has to coincide with the transformed strong solution and finally that the transformation has to be in fact an identity.},

  abstract     = {The main purpose of this paper is to investigate mathematically gas discharge. Townsend discovered α - and γ -mechanisms which are essential for ionization of gas, and then derived a threshold of voltage at which gas discharge can happen. In this derivation, he used some simplification such as discretization of time. Therefore, it is an interesting problem to analyze the threshold by using the Degond–Lucquin-Desreux–Morrow model and also to compare the results of analysis with Townsend&#39;s theory. Note that gas discharge never happens in Townsend&#39;s theory if γ -mechanism is not taken into account. In this paper, we study an initial–boundary value problem to the model with α -mechanism but no γ -mechanism. This problem has a trivial stationary solution of which the electron and ion densities are zero. It is shown that there exists a threshold of voltage at which the trivial solution becomes unstable from stable. Then we conclude that gas discharge can happen for a voltage greater than this threshold even if γ -mechanism is not taken into account. It is also of interest to know the asymptotic behavior of solutions to this initial–boundary value problem for the case that the trivial solution is unstable. To this end, we establish bifurcation of non-trivial stationary solutions by applying Crandall and Rabinowitz&#39;s Theorem, and show the linear stability and instability of those non-trivial solutions.},

It is shown that, as time tends to infinity, the Cauchy problem with large-amplitude discontinuous data admit global weak solutions which converge to a constant state (resp. a viscous shock wave) if the asymptotic states of initial values at far field are equal (resp. unequal). Our results improve the previous results where initial value was required to be continuous and have small amplitude.

We prove the global existence and uniform boundedness of solutions to the model for general functional responses in any spatial dimensions. Moreover, through linear stability analysis, it turns out that prey-taxis is an essential factor in generating pattern formations. This result differs in that the destabilizing effect of taxis does not occur in the direct prey-taxis case. In addition, we show the global stability of the semi-trivial steady state and coexistence steady state for some specific functional responses.

The contribution of the current paper is to provide sharp conditions for existence of forced traveling waves with speed c . We show the existence of traveling waves with zero value at ∞ or −∞ for c in different value ranges determined by the spreading speeds. We also show the existence of a traveling wave with any speed c for the case that the species can grow everywhere.

This leads to a coupled system where one component solves a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) and the other one an ordinary differential equation (ODE). We analyze these shadow systems from a controllability perspective and prove two types of results. First, by employing Carleman inequalities and ODE arguments, we prove that the null controllability of the shadow model holds. This result, together with the effectiveness of the controls to control the original dynamics, is illustrated by numerical simulations. We also obtain a uniform Carleman estimate for the reaction-diffusion equations which allows to obtain the null control for the shadow system as a limit when the diffusivity tends to infinity in one of the equations.},

The dependence of the constants on the analyticity widths of the complex hamiltonian is carefully taken into account. This allows for a deep analytical understanding of the limits of such techniques in insuring Nekhoroshev stability for high magnitudes of the perturbation and suggests hints on how to overcome such obstructions in some cases.

The primary tool for this well-posedness proof is an energy estimate. The time of existence for these solutions will, in general, go to zero with the surface tension parameter. However, in the case that a stability condition is satisfied by the initial data , we prove an additional energy estimate, establishing that the time of existence can be made uniform in the surface tension parameter. Then, an additional estimate allows the limit to be taken as surface tension vanishes, demonstrating that three-dimensional interfacial Darcy flow without surface tension is the limit of three-dimensional interfacial Darcy flow with surface tension as surface tension vanishes. This provides a new proof of existence of solutions for the problem without surface tension.},

The assumptions are satisfied for a large class of parabolic PDEs, including the 2D Navier–Stokes and complex Ginzburg–Landau equations perturbed by a non-degenerate bounded random kick force. As a consequence of this ergodic theorem, we derive some new results on the statistical properties of the trajectories of the underlying random dynamical system. In particular, we obtain large deviations principle for the occupation measures and the analyticity of the pressure function in a setting where the system is not irreducible. The proof relies on a refined version of the uniform Feller property combined with some contraction and bootstrap arguments.},

We show that the solution of the FHN equation fails to be globally approximate controllable in a given time. But it is possible to move from any steady state to any other steady state arbitrarily close after some appropriate time by a localized interior control, provided that both steady states are in the same connected component of the set of steady states. Finally we make some additional remarks and comments and we mention some open questions for our system.

We show that, if the components exhibit different velocities, then quadratic or cubic mixed-terms, i.e. terms with nontrivial contributions from both components, are harmless. We establish global existence and diffusive Gaussian-like decay for exponentially and algebraically localized initial conditions allowing for quadratic and cubic mixed-terms. Our proof relies on a nonlinear iteration scheme that employs pointwise estimates. The situation becomes very delicate if other quadratic or cubic terms are present in the system.

This population is facing an environmental gradient: the optimal trait for survival depends linearly on the spatial variable. The survival or extinction depends on the sign of an underlying principal eigenvalue . We investigate the survival case when the initial data satisfies a so-called heavy tail condition in the space-trait plane. Under these assumptions, we show that the solution propagates in the favorable direction of survival by accelerating. We derive some precise estimates on the location of the level sets corresponding to the total population in the space variable, regardless of their traits. Our analysis also reveals that the orientation of the initial heavy tail is of crucial importance.},

  abstract     = {In this manuscript we consider the stability of periodic solutions to Lambda-Omega lattice dynamical systems. In particular, we show that an appropriate ansatz casts the lattice dynamical system as an infinite-dimensional fast-slow differential equation. In a neighborhood of the periodic solution an invariant slow manifold is proven to exist, and that this slow manifold is uniformly exponentially attracting. The dynamics of solutions on the slow manifold become significantly more complicated and require a more delicate treatment. We present sufficient conditions to guarantee convergence on the slow manifold which is algebraic, as opposed to exponential, in the slow-time variable. Of particular interest to our work in this manuscript is the stability of a rotating wave solution, recently found to exist in the Lambda-Omega systems studied herein.},

The nonlocal operator L i is given by L i ( f ( x ) ) : = lim ϵ → 0 ⁡ ∫ R n ∖ B ϵ ( x ) [ f ( x ) − f ( z ) ] J i ( z − x ) d z , for a sequence of even, nonnegative and measurable jump kernels J i . We prove a Poincaré inequality for stable solutions of the above system for a general jump kernel J i . In particular, for the case of scalar equations, that is when m = 1 , it reads ∬ R 2 n A y ( ∇ x u ) [ η 2 ( x ) + η 2 ( x + y ) ] J ( y ) d x d y ≤ ∬ R 2 n B y ( ∇ x u ) [ η ( x ) − η ( x + y ) ] 2 J ( y ) d x d y , for any η ∈ C c 1 ( R n ) and for some nonnegative A y ( ∇ x u ) and B y ( ∇ x u ) . This is a counterpart of the celebrated inequality derived by Sternberg and Zumbrun in [46] for semilinear elliptic equations that is used extensively in the literature to establish De Giorgi type results, to study phase transitions and to prove regularity properties. We then apply this inequality to finite range jump processes and to jump processes with decays to prove De Giorgi type results in two dimensions. In addition, we show that whenever H i ( u ) ≥ 0 or ∑ i = 1 m u i H i ( u ) ≤ 0 then Liouville theorems hold for each u i in one and two dimensions. Lastly, we provide certain energy estimates under various assumptions on the jump kernel J i and a Liouville theorem for the quotient of partial derivatives of u .},

Homeomorphisms satisfying the L-shadowing property have a spectral decomposition where the basic sets are either expansive or contain arbitrarily small topological semi-horseshoes (periodic sets where the restriction is semiconjugate to a shift). To this end, we characterize the L-shadowing property using local stable and unstable sets and the classical shadowing property. We exhibit homeomorphisms with the L-shadowing property and arbitrarily small topological semi-horseshoes without periodic points. At the end, we show that positive finite-expansivity jointly with the shadowing property imply that the space is finite.},

We have a closer look at the special cases when the endpoints of the interval ( a , b ) (a,b) are regular as well as the case of a 2 × 2 2×2 system. Two appendices provide necessary details on distributions of order zero and the abstract spectral theory for relations.},

A nonlinear nonhomogeneous second-order partial differential equation for the solution of the flow stream function is derived in terms of the inlet flow specifying the horizontal velocity. We first construct a subsonic solution to the impinging flow problem with special horizontal velocity and specific effluent fluxes in the outlets. Moreover, we showed that such a subsonic impinging flow with the same asymptotic behavior in the upstream and downstreams is unique. Furthermore, the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the interface separating the two fluids with different outlets are obtained. This result extends the recent result on the compressible subsonic irrotational impinging flows in [5] . Finally, as a byproduct, we obtain the existence of subsonic-sonic impinging flows.},

Both the specific volume and the temperature are proved to be bounded from below and above independently of time. Moreover, it is shown that the global solution is nonlinearly exponentially stable as time tends to infinity. Note that the conditions imposed on the initial data are the same as those of the constant heat conductivity case (Kazhikhov-Shelukhin (1977) [18] ; Kazhikhov (1981) [17] ) and can be arbitrarily large. Therefore, our result can be regarded as a natural generalization of the Kazhikhov&#39;s ones for the constant heat conductivity case to the degenerate and nonlinear one.},

Without the latter condition, only almost global existence may be guaranteed. The first author and Sogge considered the analog exterior to a star-shaped obstacle. Both results relied on writing the lowest order terms u ∂ α u = 1 2 ∂ α u 2 u∂αu=12∂αu2 and as such do not immediately generalize to systems. The current study remedies such and extends both results to the case of multiple speed systems.},

  abstract     = {We consider the first eigenvalue λ 1 ( Ω , σ ) λ1(Ω,σ) of the Laplacian with Robin boundary conditions on a compact Riemannian manifold Ω with smooth boundary, σ ∈ R σ∈R being the Robin boundary parameter. When σ &gt; 0 σ&amp;gt;0 we give a positive, sharp lower bound of λ 1 ( Ω , σ ) λ1(Ω,σ) in terms of an associated one-dimensional problem depending on the geometry through a lower bound of the Ricci curvature of Ω, a lower bound of the mean curvature of ∂Ω and the inradius. When the boundary parameter is negative, the lower bound becomes an upper bound. In particular, explicit bounds for mean-convex Euclidean domains are obtained, which improve known estimates. Then, we extend a monotonicity result for λ 1 ( Ω , σ ) λ1(Ω,σ) obtained in Euclidean space by Giorgi and Smits [10] , to a class of manifolds of revolution which include all space forms of constant sectional curvature . As an application, we prove that λ 1 ( Ω , σ ) λ1(Ω,σ) is uniformly bounded below by ( n − 1 ) 2 4 (n−1)24 for all bounded domains in the hyperbolic space of dimension n , provided that the boundary parameter σ ≥ n − 1 2 σ≥n−12 (McKean-type inequality).

The nonlinearity that we consider is rather general, allowing for supercritical growth (in the sense of Sobolev embedding). The consequent lack of compactness can be overcome, by working in the cone of non-negative and non-decreasing radial functions. Within this cone, we establish some a priori estimates which allow, via a truncation argument, to use variational methods for proving existence of solutions. As a side result, we prove a strong maximum principle for nonlocal Neumann problems, which is of independent interest.},

The key step is to derive the degree formula of the shadow system, which arises from the bubbling solutions as ρ 1 tends to 4 π . In order to compute the topological degree of the shadow system, we need to find some suitable deformation. During this deformation, we shall deal with new difficulty arising from the phenomenon: blow up does not necessarily imply concentration of mass. This phenomenon occurs due to the collapsing of singularities. This is a continuation of the previous work [25] .},

For Hölder coefficients we derive the well-posedness in the spaces of ultradistributions associated to Rockland operators on graded groups. In the case when the propagation speed is a distribution, we employ the notion of “very weak solutions” to the Cauchy problem, that was already successfully used in similar contexts in [12] and [20] . We show that the Cauchy problem for the wave equation with the distributional coefficient has a unique “very weak solution” in an appropriate sense, which coincides with classical or distributional solutions when the latter exist. Examples include the time dependent wave equation for the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group or on general stratified Lie groups, or p -evolution equations for higher order operators on R n Rn or on groups, the results already being new in all these cases.},

  abstract     = {This work intends to understand the stability and large-time behavior of perturbations near a stationary solution of the 2D resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equation. The stationary solution is taken to be a background magnetic field parallel to the horizontal axis. We obtain three main results. The first result assesses the stability and the precise large-time asymptotic behavior for solutions to the linearzied system satisfied by the perturbation. Due to the lack of viscosity, the standard energy estimates do not work and the proof is achieved by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. The second result makes use of the special wave structure of the linearization to establish the linear stability and decay rates. The third result obtains the H 1 H1 -stability for the full nonlinear system and shows that the L q Lq -norm ( q ∈ ( 2 , ∞ ) q∈(2,∞) ) of the magnetic field perturbation b ˜ b˜ and the L 2 L2 -norm of the gradient of b ˜ b˜ approach zero as t → ∞ t→∞ .},

To this end, we construct a separable solution and we show that the long-time behavior of u is precisely described by this special solution. Further, we initiate the study of that equation on the entire space, providing a new class of explicit and radially symmetric self-similar solutions that we call k - Barenblatt solutions .

One of the important features of this model system is that it does have the translational-invariance. By linking the non-translational-invariant solution map for this equation to travelling wave maps for another related 1-D spatial homogeneous delay reaction-diffusion equation, we obtain some traveling-like a priori estimates for nontrivial solutions . We then establish the existence, uniqueness, and attractivity of heterogeneous steady states. As a result, we are able to describe the traveling-like asymptotic behaviours of nontrivial solutions in space-time region. These enable us to develop a new method for exploring the spreading speeds and asymptotic propagation phenomena for a class of non-translation-invariant delay reaction-diffusion equations on R R . As a corollary, we also recover some results on the asymptotic spreading speeds and traveling waves for monostable and spatial homogeneous delay reaction-diffusion equations in R R .},

In this paper, based on a Lotka-Volterra competition-diffusion-advection system, we try to reveal the combined effect of movement and spatial variations on the outcome of competition. For the purpose of comparison, we suppose that the total resources for two populations are fixed at the same level, but one distribution is even across space while the other one not. Our main results suggest that the contest between heterogeneous and homogeneous distribution is very complex, either one of the two competitors becomes the final single winner (exclusion) or both populations coexist eventually (coexistence), depending closely on the movement rates and the shape of the given resource.},

The fluid and the structure are fully coupled via kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions. The existence of a weak solution is obtained by designing a hybrid approximation scheme that successfully deals with the nonlinearities of the system. We combine time-discretization and operator splitting to create two sub-problems, one piece-wise stationary for the fluid and one in the Galerkin basis for the plate. To guarantee the convergence of approximate solutions to a weak solution, a sufficient condition is given on the number of time discretization sub-intervals in every step in a form of dependence with number of the Galerkin basis functions and nonlinearity order of the plate equation.},

We study Cauchy problem for the original system and its transformed system, which is one of hyperbolic-parabolic balance laws. Our initial data are generic perturbations of a constant ground state , i.e. the initial mass of perturbation is non-zero. In the case of non-diffusive chemical, we obtain optimal L 2 time decay rates for the solution with finite initial data. In the case of diffusive chemical, optimal L 2 rates are also obtained with additional assumption on the smallness of the initial amplitude but still allowing large oscillation.},

More precisely we prove that an initial interface with angled crests remains angled crested, the Euler equation holds point-wise even on the boundary, the particle at the tip stays at the tip, the acceleration at the tip is the one due to gravity and the angle of the crest does not change nor does it tilt. We also show that the local well-posedness result of Wu [27] , [28] and our rigidity results are applicable not only to interfaces with angled crests, but also to certain types of cusps.},

As an application, we consider three evolution equations, namely the linear convection-diffusion equation, the two velocity BGK model and the Fokker–Planck equation. Adding an uncertainty parameter to the equations and analyzing its linear sensitivity leads to defective ODE systems. By applying the Lyapunov functional construction, we prove sharp long time behavior of order ( 1 + t M ) e − μ t (1+tM)e−μt , where M is the defect and μ is the spectral gap of the system. The appearance of the uncertainty parameter in the three applications makes it important to have decay estimates that are uniform in the non-defective limit .},

It is well-known that the solution of a monostable nonlocal dispersal scalar equation spreads at a finite speed when the kernel is thin-tailed and propagates by accelerating when the kernel has a heavy tail (the fat-tailed). However, in such systems, we find that one species can propagate by accelerating although its dispersal kernel is thin-tailed, which is a new and interesting phenomenon. More precisely, we show that the spatial propagation of every species at large time is mainly determined by the tail of the maximum of their dispersal kernels, which further implies that their spatial propagation is accelerated by each other because of the cooperation relation between them. This gives us a new understanding of the cooperation relation in the spatial propagation of nonlocal dispersal cooperative systems.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we study the order of vanishing and a quantitative form of Landis&#39; conjecture in the plane for solutions to second-order elliptic equations with variable coefficients and singular lower order terms. Precisely, we let A be real-valued, bounded and elliptic, but not necessary symmetric or continuous, and we assume that V and W i Wi are real-valued and belong to L p Lp and L q i Lqi , respectively. We prove that if u is a real-valued, bounded and normalized solution to an equation of the form − div ( A ∇ u + W 1 u ) + W 2 ⋅ ∇ u + V u = 0 −div(A∇u+W1u)+W2⋅∇u+Vu=0 in B d Bd , then under suitable conditions on the lower order terms, for any r sufficiently small, the following order of vanishing estimate holds | | u | | L ∞ ( B r ) ≥ r C M , ||u||L∞(Br)≥rCM, where M depends on the Lebesgue norms of the lower order terms. In a number of settings, a scaling argument gives rise to a quantitative form of Landis&#39; conjecture, inf | z 0 | = R ⁡ | | u | | L ∞ ( B 1 ( z 0 ) ) ≥ exp ⁡ ( − C R β log ⁡ R ) , inf|z0|=R⁡||u||L∞(B1(z0))≥exp⁡(−CRβlog⁡R), where β depends on p , q 1 q1 , and q 2 q2 . The integrability assumptions that we impose on V and W i Wi are nearly optimal in view of a scaling argument. We use the theory of elliptic boundary value problems to establish the existence of positive multipliers associated to the elliptic equation. Then the proofs rely on transforming the equations to Beltrami systems and applying a generalization of Hadamard&#39;s three-circle theorem.},

  abstract     = {This paper establishes the global regularity of the two-dimensional (2D) Boussinesq equations and micropolar equations with partial dissipation. Our first result is the global regularity of the 2D Boussinesq equations with fractional vertical dissipation in the horizontal velocity, horizontal dissipation in the vertical velocity and zero thermal diffusion, which is shown by taking advantage of the nice structure of the 2D Boussinesq equations and several refined commutator estimates. The second goal of this paper is to consider a system of the 2D incompressible micropolar equations with vertical dissipation in the horizontal velocity equation, horizontal dissipation in the vertical velocity equation and the fractional Λ α Λα dissipation in the micro-rotation velocity. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the lack of full Laplacian diffusion in the velocity equations, we fully exploit the nice structure of the corresponding equations to show that this equations with arbitrarily small α &gt; 0 α&amp;gt;0 always possesses a unique global classical solution.},

In the present article, we prove constructively the existence of type II blow-up solutions for p = 1 + 6 / ( N − 10 ) p=1+6/(N−10) , so called Lepin exponent. Their blow-up mechanisms are strongly influenced on space dimensions . For lower dimensions the mechanisms are determined by Dirac δ type approximations of nonlinear term and, on the other hand, dominated by classical Taylor approximation for high dimensions . On the threshold dimension, the both approximations are balanced. Consequently, the blow-up exhibits a new blow-up profile. Classification of radial blow-up solutions in terms of blow-up rates is also presented.},

Imposing usual smallness assumptions in addition to standard regularity and compatibility conditions, a nonlinear stabilizability inequality is obtained by showing nonlinear dissipativity and observability-like estimates enhanced by an intricate regularity analysis. With the stabilizability inequality at hand, the classic nonlinear barrier method is employed to prove that small initial data admit unique classical solutions that exist globally and decay to zero at an exponential rate . Our approach is based on a recently established local well-posedness theory in a class of H 3 H3 -valued functions.},

  abstract     = {For the 2-D nonlinear wave equations □ u = F ( ∂ u , ∂ 2 u ) □u=F(∂u,∂2u) with initial data ( u ( 0 , x ) , ∂ t u ( 0 , x ) ) (u(0,x),∂tu(0,x)) = ( ε u 0 ( x ) , ε u 1 ( x ) ) =(εu0(x),εu1(x)) , where x = ( x 1 , x 2 ) x=(x1,x2) , x 0 = t x0=t , ∂ = ( ∂ 0 , ∂ 1 , ∂ 2 ) ∂=(∂0,∂1,∂2) , ε &gt; 0 ε&amp;gt;0 is small enough, u 0 ( x ) , u 1 ( x ) ∈ C 0 ∞ ( R 2 ) u0(x),u1(x)∈C0∞(R2) , and the smooth nonlinearity F ( ∂ u , ∂ 2 u ) = O ( | ∂ u | 2 + | ∂ 2 u | 2 ) F(∂u,∂2u)=O(|∂u|2+|∂2u|2) , when F ( ∂ u , ∂ 2 u ) F(∂u,∂2u) satisfies the null conditions, S. Alinhac in [2] shows that the smooth solution u exists globally. The proof relies on the compactness of the support of ( u 0 ( x ) , u 1 ( x ) ) (u0(x),u1(x)) . Recently, for a class of quasilinear wave equations □ u = N α β μ ν ∂ α β 2 u ∂ μ ν 2 u □u=Nαβμν∂αβ2u∂μν2u or □ u = A α ∂ α ( | ∂ t u | 2 − | ∇ u | 2 ) □u=Aα∂α(|∂tu|2−|∇u|2) with small and non-compactly supported initial data, where N α β μ ν Nαβμν and A α Aα are constants ( 0 ≤ α , β , μ , ν ≤ 2 0≤α,β,μ,ν≤2 ), when the related null condition hold, the authors in [6] prove the global existence of solution u . In this paper, we will prove the global existence for the general 2-D null-form wave equations □ u = F ( ∂ u , ∂ 2 u ) □u=F(∂u,∂2u) with non-compactly supported initial data. The new key ingredient is to establish a class of weighted L ∞ L∞ - L ∞ L∞ estimates of solution w to the 2-D linear wave equation □ w = f ( t , x ) □w=f(t,x) instead of the usual L ∞ L∞ - L 2 L2 estimates used in [2] , [6] and so on. From this, we also get a better time-decay rate for the “good derivatives” of solution u of nonlinear wave equations.},

  abstract     = {We consider a strongly coupled Klein-Gordon system posed in an inhomogeneous medium Ω with smooth boundary ∂Ω subject to a local damping distributed around a neighborhood ω of the boundary according to the Geometric Control Condition. We show that the energy of the system goes uniformly and exponentially to zero for all initial data of finite energy taken in bounded sets of finite energy phase-space. For this purpose, refined microlocal analysis arguments are considered by exploiting ideas due to Burq and Gérard [16] . By using sharp L p − L q -Carleman estimates we prove a unique continuation property for coupled systems. We also consider a strongly coupled system of wave equations with localized nonlinear damping acting only on one equation. Considering a compact Riemannian manifold, we show that the energy of the coupled system goes uniformly to zero.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the propagating profiles of a degenerate chemotaxis model describing the bacteria chemotaxis and consumption of oxygen by aerobic bacteria, in particular, the effect of the initial attractant distribution on bacterial clustering. We prove that the compact support of solutions may shrink if the signal concentration satisfies a special structure, and show the finite speed propagating property without assuming the special structure on attractant concentration, and obtain an explicit formula of the population spreading speed in terms of model parameters. The presented results suggest that bacterial cluster formation can be affected by chemotactic attractants and density-dependent dispersal.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are concerned with well-posedness of an anisotropic parabolic equation with the convection term. When some diffusion coefficients are degenerate on the boundary ∂Ω and the others are positive on Ω ‾ Ω‾ , we propose a novel partial boundary value condition to study the stability of the solutions for the anisotropic parabolic equation. A new concept, the general characteristic function of the domain Ω, is introduced and applied. The existence and stability of the solutions is established under the given partial boundary value conditions.},
