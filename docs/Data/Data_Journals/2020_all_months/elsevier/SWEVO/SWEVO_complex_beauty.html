  abstract     = {For the realization of complex renewable energy systems (such as nano-fluids based direct absorption solar collector), an evolutionary system identification method such as genetic programming (GP) can be applied to develop mathematical models/functional relationships between the process parameters. The system complexity is attributed to interaction among the design variables influencing the outputs. There are also uncertainties in the system due to random and unknown variations in the design and response variables. GP suffers from the higher complexity structure of its solutions and non-optimal convergence, which leads to poor fitness values. Therefore, to address these uncertainties and problems, the framework based on the model selection criteria approximated genetic programming (MSC-GP) is proposed for the formulation of geometry design based thermal efficiency and entropy generation optimization function for direct absorption solar collector (DASC) system. In this proposed method, the four mathematical model selection criteria are used as an approximation for objective functions in GP framework for the evaluation of fitting degree and structure of the model. The results based on statistical measures (best fitness, mean fitness, standard deviation of fitness, number of nodes) show that models obtained from the mathematical selection criteria, Predicted Residual error sum of squares (PRESS), have performed the best. Based on Pareto front analysis of PRESS function, it is found that the best objective values and the number of nodes of models (complexity) follows more or less gradually slow increasing trend which is a good symbolic desirable sign of minimal increase of complexity of model with a decrease in objective values as the values of generation increases. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the main factor affecting the efficiency of DASC is its geometry of the structure. 3-D interaction analysis shows that increasing the thickness, length and reducing the width of the collector can make the system maintain its higher thermal efficiency and a smaller entropy generation , which is useful for the optimized operation of DASC. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is applied in the acquisition of the optimal geometric settings of DASC system based on the selected models. The optimal settings achieved is 5 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 2 cm in thickness. Systems when operated using these settings results in a satisfactory performance with 77.8117\% in thermal efficiency and 6.0004E+3 in entropy generation).},

  abstract     = {Many dynamic multi-objective optimization problems have been widely developed to track the changing optima quickly and effectively in dynamic environments. Prediction-based methods can be used to predict future changes by learning past experience. This paper employed a new prediction strategy combining Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy nonlinear regression prediction and multi-step prediction named TSMP to estimate the new initial Pareto solutions whenever the environment changes. In TSMP, when environmental changes occur, the next initial center of Pareto solutions (PS) is predicted by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy nonlinear regression prediction model and then one trail population is generated by combining the predicted center and an approximate manifold of PS. Moreover, the other trail population is generated by a linear multi-step prediction model. Furthermore, the next initial PS is reinitialized by a random hybridization of these two trail populations. The proposed TSMP strategy is systematically compared with re-initialization strategy (RIS), feed-forward prediction strategy (FPS) and population prediction strategy (FPS) under different multi-objective optimizers on benchmark test problems with different features. Experimental results and performance comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms indicate that TSMP is effective and promising for solving dynamic multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Optimization problems arise nowadays in all disciplines, not only in the scientific area but also in the field of engineering or economics, and in many others. Currently, challenging optimization problems require solution methods that consume a significant amount of computational resources. The application of High-Performance Computing techniques is a common approach to obtain efficient implementations in traditional parallel computing systems. However, more recent approaches are exploring distributed programming frameworks developed in recent years to achieve efficient computations on clusters and cloud systems . In this paper we present a parallel implementation of the enhanced Scatter Search metaheuristic using Spark. The parallel program was obtained as a particularization of a general software framework we developed to support different realisations of the Scatter Search metaheuristic . The aim of this paper is to provide helpful guidance to readers interested in applying, or developing their own, parallel metaheuristics to solve challenging problems in the Cloud. With the twofold objective of demonstrating the potential of the parallelization with Spark and also of studying the factors that influence the performance of the solution, the proposal has been thoroughly evaluated on two different platforms, a cluster and a cloud platform, using a representative set of parameter estimation problems in the field of Computational Systems Biology .},

  abstract     = {In consideration of the uncertainty of manufacturing system , this paper investigates a distributed fuzzy blocking flow-shop scheduling problem (DFBFSP) in which there are multiple homogeneous factories and each one is set as a flow shop with no intermediate buffers between any consecutive machines. The processing time is uncertain and represented by the fuzzy number. The objective is to minimize the fuzzy makespan among all factories. To address this problem, two constructive heuristics (i.e., INEH and DPFNEH) are firstly proposed based on the problem-specific knowledge and the NEH heuristic. The INEH employs the spread value of fuzzy processing time to generate the initial job sequence. The DPFNEH assigns the partial jobs to factories by reducing the total expected idle time and blocking time. Afterwards, two iterated greedy (IG) methods are presented in which the proposed constructive heuristic is employed to generate the initial solution with high quality. A novel plateau exploration-based local search is incorporated to enhance the quality of solutions. To keep the search vitality, an improved acceptance criterion based on the fuzzy characteristic is designed to avoid falling into the local optimum. Finally, a comprehensive computational experiment and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods in the literature are conducted based on an extended benchmark set and a new evaluation indicator. The results show that the proposed constructive heuristics and IG methods can effectively and efficiently solve the considered problem.},

  abstract     = {The Bees Algorithm has been successfully applied for over a decade to a large number of optimisation problems . However, a mathematical analysis of its search capabilities, the effects of different parameters used, and various design choices has not been carried out. As a consequence, optimisation of the Bees Algorithm has so far relied on trial-and-error experimentation. This paper formalises the Bees Algorithm in a rigorous mathematical description , beyond the qualitative biological metaphor. A review of the literature is presented, highlighting the main variants of the Bees Algorithm, and its analogies and differences compared with other optimisation methods. The local search procedure of the Bees Algorithm is analysed, and the results experimentally checked. The analysis shows that the progress of local search is mainly influenced by the size of the neighbourhood and the stagnation limit in the site abandonment procedure, rather than the number of recruited foragers. In particular, the analysis underlines the trade-off between the step size of local search (a large neighbourhood size favours quick progress) and the likelihood of stagnation (a small neighbourhood size prevents premature site abandonment). For the first time, the implications of the choice of neighbourhood shape on the character of the local search are clarified. The paper reveals that, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, hyperspherical neighbourhoods allow greater search intensification than hypercubic neighbourhoods. The theoretical results obtained in this paper are in good agreement with the findings of several experimental studies. It is hoped that the new mathematical formalism here introduced will foster further understanding and analysis of the Bees Algorithm, and that the theoretical results obtained will provide useful parameterisation guidelines for applied studies.},

  abstract     = {Renewable energy will play a pivotal role in meeting future global energy demand. Of current renewable sources, wave energy offers enormous potential for growth. This research investigates the optimisation of the placement of oscillating buoy-type wave energy converters (WECs). This work explores the design of a wave farm consisting of an array of fully submerged three-tether buoys. In a wave farm, buoy positions strongly determine the farm&#39;s output. Optimising the buoy positions is a challenging research problem due to complex and extensive interactions (constructive and destructive) between buoys. This research focuses on maximising the power output of the farm through the placement of buoys in a size-constrained environment, and we propose a new hybrid approach mixing local search, using a surrogate power model, and numerical optimisation methods. The proposed hybrid method is compared with other state-of-the-art search methods in five different wave scenarios – one simplified irregular wave model and four real wave regimes. The new hybrid methods outperform well-known previous heuristic methods in terms of both quality of achieved solutions and the convergence-rate of search in all tested wave regimes. The best performing method in real-wave scenarios uses the active set non-linear optimisation method to tune final placements. The effectiveness of this method seems to stem for its capacity to search over a larger area than other compared tuning methods.},

In the IGR, we discard the simulated annealing-like acceptance criterion commonly used in traditional iterated greedy algorithms. A restart scheme with six different operators is proposed to ensure the diversity of the solutions and help the algorithm to escape from local optimizations . Furthermore, to achieve a balance between the exploitation and exploration, we introduce an algorithmic control parameter in the IG stage. Additionally, to further improve the performance of the algorithm, we propose two local search methods based on a job block which is built in the evolution process. A detailed design experiment is carried out to calibrate the parameters for the presented IGR algorithm. The IGR is assessed through comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed IGR algorithm is the best-performing one among all the algorithms in comparison.},

In PE, there is no mating selection, and the calculation of the evolution path is simple. Moreover, a new gene-sharing operation is proposed. The effectiveness of PE is validated by comparing it with three widely used reproduction operators and two state-of-the-art path-based reproduction operators.

Motivated by the challenge that this NP-hard problem represents, it has captured the attention of the optimization community for decades. As a result, a large number of algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Among these, exact methods are only able to solve instances of size n &lt; 40. To overcome this limitation, many metaheuristic methods have been applied to the QAP. In this work, we follow this direction by approaching the QAP through Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). Particularly, a non-parametric distance-based exponential probabilistic model is used. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the QAP, and previous work in the area, we introduce Kernels of Mallows Model under the Hamming distance to the context of EDAs. Conducted experiments point out that the performance of the proposed algorithm in the QAP is superior to (i) the classical EDAs adapted to deal with the QAP, and also (ii) to the specific EDAs proposed in the literature to deal with permutation problems.},

Overall, a uniform framework of multi-objective sparse span array is proposed. Specially, two objectives, number of selected antenna and peak side lobe level, are established for exploring the optimal array distribution in the framework. Based on the framework, for the problem of global-optimum array distribution, we propose a multi-objective particle swarm optimization searching pattern and design a MOSSA algorithm; Furthermore, for the problem of flexibly-adjusted self-organizing array structure, we present a multi-objective genetic programming searching pattern and design a MOSSA-gp algorithm. Moreover, a limited-region mode supplements to the framework. Finally, combination decision strategy assists users to screen out suitable solutions under the guidance of fuzzy-range indexes and then select the optimal solution by a triangle-approximating approach based on minimum Manhattan distance. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the proposed MOSSA outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both antenna elements’ number and maximum side lobe level.},

  abstract     = {Production scheduling is one of the most critical issues in manufacturing and production systems and has markedly positive impact on the performances of manufacturing. In the past decades, various scheduling problems have been extensively solved by multi-population meta-heuristics, which are artificial bee colony (ABC), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA); however, the related works of multi-population meta-heuristics to scheduling are hardly reviewed. In this paper, we provide an extensive recall on solving production scheduling based on ABC, ICA or SFLA. A new classification on scheduling problems is first given, then three algorithms are described and their applications to scheduling are summarized in a systematic way; finally, the main conclusions are drawn and some future research directions are presented.},

  abstract     = {Existing a lot of unlabeled data and few labeled data is one of the most common problems in real datasets. Semi-supervised classification methods can well handle such a problem and have a desirable performance. Among them, one of the most successful methods in dealing with shortage of labeled data is self-labeled technique. One of the difficulties of this technique is wrong data labeling in iterative process of self-labeling. The main reasons are 1) existing outlier and noisy data, 2) inappropriate distribution of labeled data in problem space, and 3) shortage of labeled data in order to make diversity in learning hypotheses. In this paper, a method is developed so as to generate synthetic labeled using decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm as synthetic example optimization for self-labeling called DMSS. In DMSS, the synthetic labeled datasets with high diversity and high classification accuracy are generated and then added to the labeled datasets for better training of the algorithm. In already conducted researches, the diversity of the generated data and their distribution in problem space have not been well investigated. The proposed method is a data preparation method which can be employed in all self-labeled techniques. To do so, the proposed method is applied over four self-labeled algorithms having different features and their performances are then evaluated using 25 pattern datasets. The obtained results show high performance of the DMSS with regard to the classification accuracy compared to the existing methods in the literature. Also, the outcomes of conducted non-parametric statistical tests show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other existing methods in the literature, as well.},

  abstract     = {The heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints (2L- HFVRP) is a complex variant of the classical vehicle routing problem . 2L-HFVRP seeks for minimal cost set of routes to serve a set of customers using a fleet of vehicles of different capacities, fixed and variable operating costs, different dimensions, and restricted loading constraints. To effectively deal with the 2L-HFVRP, we propose a two-stage method that successively calls the routing stage and the packing stage. For the routing stage, we propose an adaptive memetic approach that integrates new multi-parent crossover operators with multi-local search algorithms in an adaptive manner. A time-varying fitness function is proposed to avoid prematurity and improve search performance. An adaptive quality-and-diversity selection mechanism is devised to control the application of the memetic operators and the local search algorithms . In the packing stage, five heuristics are adopted and hybridised to perform the packing process. Experiments on a set of 36 2L-HFVRP benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed method provides highly competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the proposed method obtains the best results for several instances.},

  abstract     = {Code bloat is a phenomenon in Genetic Programming (GP) characterized by the increase in individual size during the evolutionary process without a corresponding improvement in fitness. Bloat negatively affects GP performance, since large individuals are more time consuming to evaluate and harder to interpret. In this paper, we propose two approaches for reducing GP code bloat based on a semantic approximation technique. The first approach replaces a random subtree in an individual by a smaller tree of approximate semantics. The second approach replaces a random subtree by a smaller tree that is semantically approximate to the desired semantics. We evaluated the proposed methods on a large number of regression problems . The experimental results showed that our methods help to significantly reduce code bloat and improve the performance of GP compared to standard GP and some recent bloat control methods in GP. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approaches is competitive with the best machine learning technique among the four tested machine learning algorithms .},

Various optimizations methods have been proposed to accelerate transformations, as well as techniques to engineer the shape itself, such as scaffolding which creates an internal object structure filled with holes for easing the motion of modules. In this paper, we propose a novel deterministic and distributed method for rapidly constructing the scaffold of an object from an organized reserve of modules placed underneath the reconfiguration scene. This innovative scaffold design is parameterizable and has a face-centered-cubic lattice structure made from our rotating-only micro-modules. Our method operates at two levels of planning, scheduling the construction of components of the scaffold to avoid deadlocks at one level, and handling the navigation of modules and their coordination to avoid collisions in the other. We provide an analysis of the method and perform simulations on shapes with an increasing level of intricacy to show that our method has a reconfiguration time complexity of O ( N 3 ) O(N3) time steps for a subclass of convex shapes, with N the number of modules in the shape. We then proceed to explain how our solution can be further extended to any shape.},

  abstract     = {Cellular evolutionary algorithms (cEAs) are a particular type of EAs in which a communication structure is imposed to the population and mating restricted to topographically nearby individuals. In general, these algorithms have longer takeover times than panmictic EAs and previous investigations argue that they are more efficient in escaping local optima of multimodal and deceptive functions. However, most of those studies are not primarily concerned with population size, despite being one of the design decisions with a greater impact in the accuracy and convergence speed of population-based metaheuristics . In this paper, optimal population size for cEAs structured by regular and random graphs with different degree is estimated. Selecto-recombinative cEAs and standard cEAs with mutation and different types of crossover were tested on a class of functions with tunable degrees of difficulty. Results and statistical tests demonstrate the importance of setting an appropriate population size. Event Takeover Values (ETV) were also studied and previous assumptions on their distribution were not confirmed: although ETV distributions of panmictic EAs are heavy-tailed, log-log plots of complementary cumulative distribution functions display no linearity. Furthermore, statistical tests on ETVs generated by several instances of the problems conclude that power law models cannot be favored over log-normal. On the other hand, results confirm that cEAs impose deviations to distribution tails and that large ETVs are less probable when the population is structured by graphs with low connectivity degree . Finally, results suggest that for panmictic EAs the ETVs’ upper bounds are approximately equal to the optimal population size.},

  abstract     = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is among the most universally applied population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms . PSO has been successfully used in various scientific fields, ranging from humanities, engineering, chemistry, medicine, to advanced physics. Since its introduction in 1995, the method has been widely investigated, which led to the development of hundreds of PSO versions and numerous theoretical and empirical findings on their convergence and parameterization. However, so far there is no detailed study on the proper choice of PSO swarm size, although it is widely known that population size crucially affects the performance of metaheuristics . In most applications, authors follow the initial suggestion from 1995 and restrict the population size to 20–50 particles. In this study, we relate the performance of eight PSO variants to swarm sizes that range from 3 up to 1000 particles. Tests are performed on sixty 10- to 100-dimensional scalable benchmarks and twenty-two 1- to 216-dimensional real-world problems. Although results do differ for the specific PSO variants, for the majority of considered PSO algorithms the best performance is obtained with swarms composed of 70–500 particles, indicating that the classical choice is often too small. Larger swarms frequently improve efficiency of the method for more difficult problems and practical applications. For unimodal problems slightly lower swarm sizes are recommended for the majority of PSO variants, but some would still perform best with hundreds of particles.},

In the AB off-lattice model, the protein sequence is labeled as ‘A’ or ‘B’ according to the amino acid classification of being hydrophobic or hydrophilic . It has been widely explored in the literature because polarity is one of the main driving forces behind protein structure definition. This work provides a high-performance hybrid algorithm to approach the 3D-AB off-lattice model through Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The proposed hybrid algorithm, named cuHjDE–3D, is a self-adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) that uses the jDE mechanism to self-adapt the DE parameters and employs the Hooke-Jeeves Direct Search (HJDS) as the exploitation routine. The experiments were conducted on real protein sequences from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and compared against state-of-the-art algorithms from the related literature concerning the 3D-AB off-lattice model. Moreover, we provide a methodology to compare a 3D-AB predicted conformation with its native conformation from the PDB repository using the RMSD metric. The obtained results highlight the optimization potential of the proposed method. Also, the GPU running time analysis reports the positive impact of using a massively parallel architecture , with speedups up to 277× , promoting the necessary scalability to handle the 3D-AB model.},

In this paper, a PSO variant based on multiple adaptive strategies (MAPSO) is proposed. To efficiently maintain the population diversity, the entire population is split into multiple swarms, which can be regrouped during the evolutionary process. In each generation, different particles in a swarm adaptively select their learning exemplars (ALE) according to the performance of the particles. Thus, different particles in the same swarm can perform distinct search behaviors in each generation, as well as the same particle can conduct various search behaviors in different generations. In addition, aiming to rationally utilize computational resource, an adaptive strategy for population size (APS) is introduced. In APS, the population can adaptively delete unfavorable particles and add promising particles during the evolutionary process. Extensive experiments based on CEC2013 and CEC2017 test suites verify the superior performance of the multiple adaptive strategies on balancing the exploration and exploitation abilities. Furthermore, the performance of the newly introduced strategies is also testified by a set of experiments.},

To accomplish this objective, three productivity-aware languages (Chapel, Julia, and Python) are compared in terms of performance, scalability and productivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a comparison is performed in the context of parallel metaheuristics . As a test-case, we implement two parallel metaheuristics in three languages for solving the 3D Quadratic Assignment Problem (Q3AP), using thread-based parallelism on a multi-core shared-memory computer. We also evaluate and compare the performance of the three languages for a parallel fitness evaluation loop, using four different test-functions with different computational characteristics.

  abstract     = {Surrogate-based optimization is widely used to deal with long-running black-box simulation-based objective functions. Actually, the use of a surrogate model such as Kriging or Artificial Neural Network allows to reduce the number of calls to the CPU time-intensive simulator. Bayesian optimization uses the ability of surrogates to provide useful information to help guiding effectively the optimization process. In this paper, the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) reference framework is challenged by a Bayesian Neural Network-assisted Genetic Algorithm , namely BNN-GA. The Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) surrogate is chosen for its ability to provide an uncertainty measure of the prediction that allows to compute the Expected Improvement of a candidate solution in order to improve the exploration of the objective space. BNN is also more reliable than Kriging models for high-dimensional problems and faster to set up thanks to its incremental training. In addition, we propose a batch-based approach for the parallelization of BNN-GA that is challenged by a parallel version of EGO, called q-EGO. Parallel computing is a highly important complementary way (to surrogates) to deal with the computational burden of simulation-based optimization. The comparison of the two parallel approaches is experimentally performed through several benchmark functions and two real-world problems within the scope of Tuberculosis Transmission Control (TBTC). The study presented in this paper proves that parallel batched BNN-GA is a viable alternative to q-EGO approaches being more suitable for high-dimensional problems, parallelization impact, bigger data-bases and moderate search budgets. Moreover, a significant improvement of the solutions is obtained for the two TBTC problems tackled.},

  abstract     = {Production scheduling is of great significance in improving production effectiveness while the energy-efficient problem is one of most concerned problems for researchers and manufacturers. Thus, this study investigates the energy-efficient distributed permutation flow shop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with the objectives of makespan and energy consumption. The DPFSP is an extension of permutation flow shop problem (PFSP) considering a set of identical factories. This paper presents a multi-objective mixed integer programming model based on the three sub-problems: allocating jobs among factories, scheduling the jobs in each factory and determining speed upon each job. A multi-objective whale swarm algorithm (MOWSA) is proposed to solve this energy-efficient DPFSP. A new problem-dependent local search is developed to improve the exploitation capability of MOWSA. Moreover, the updating exploitation mechanism is presented to enhance energy efficiency without affecting production efficiency. Finally, the extensive comparison experiments are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed MOWSA, problem-dependent local search and updating exploitation mechanism. The results indicate the effectiveness of MOWSA and the superior performance over NSGA-II, SPEA2, PAES and MDEA, and also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the energy consumption compared with other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Collective behaviours such as swarm formations of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. This paper proposes a developmental approach to evolving collective behaviours whereby the evolutionary process is guided by a novel value system. A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.},

  abstract     = {Crude oil operations in refineries are characterized as a hybrid system since it contains both discrete-event and continuous processes, and it is extremely difficult to schedule such a system. For scheduling such a system, initially the discrete tasks to be performed during the scheduling horizon is unknown such that heuristics and meta-heuristics are not directly applicable, which further complicates its scheduling problem. Moreover, there are large number of objectives to be optimized, including the minimization of energy consumption due to that crude oil operations consume large amount of energy and therefore lead to large amount of emissions. Furthermore, the energy optimization problem is characterized as highly non-linearity. Hence, the scheduling problem of crude oil operations in refineries belongs to the many-objective optimization problems and it is extremely challenging. This paper addresses this challenging scheduling problem of crude oil operations. This scheduling problem is first converted to a discrete dynamic resource allocation problem such that meta-heuristics can be applicable. Then, with the results of large number of experiments, this work innovatively proposes an NSGA-Ⅲ-based optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the problem for Pareto-optimal solutions. By the proposed method, the genes in a chromosome are generated one by one and, when generating a gene, safeness check is done according to the derived safeness conditions such that each gene is feasible. In this way, the schedule feasibility can be ensured. An industrial case study is given to test its performance and comparison is made with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms for many-objective optimization problems. The results show its good performance in terms of convergence, solution diversity, time efficiency, and its applicability to real-life refinery scheduling problems.},

In the initial exploration, the Design of Experiments is carried out to generate a group of well-distributed samples based on which the original wolf pack and wolf leaders are sequentially identified to approximate the high-dimensional space roughly. The knowledge mining on RBF includes a global search that is carried out using the grey wolf optimization and a local search that is performed over a focused local region using a search strategy combining global and multi-start local exploration. In the proposed SAGWO, knowledge gained from the RBF model assists the generation of new wolf leaders in each cycle, and the positions of the wolf pack are iteratively changed following the wolf leaders, thus reaching balanced exploitation and exploration. The new SAGWO algorithm presents superior computation efficiency and robustness as demonstrated by comparison tests with ten representative global optimization algorithms on 30, 50 and 100 design variables.},

The E-PCVRP is a selective routing problem that focuses on the maximization of the aggregated prize values collected from the visited nodes while minimizing the fixed and variable cost of the formed routes. In terms of variable cost, the CO2 emissions of the vehicles performing the routes are considered as a load-distance function. The presented solution approach is based on the Firefly Algorithm (FA). The FA is an optimization algorithm , designed for the solution of continuous problems, while the proposed E-PCVRP, requires a discrete solution approach. Addressing the above discrepancy, the Firefly Algorithm based on Coordinates (FAC) is introduced, which incorporates the proposed “Coordinates Related” (CR) encoding/decoding process in the original FA scheme. The CR is a novel process that allows for algorithms designed for continuous optimization to by employed in the solution of discrete problems, such as the VRP. Specifically, the CR utilizes auxiliary vectors for solution representation, containing the Cartesian coordinates of each node, that allows for the original movement equation of the FA to be applied directly. The effectiveness of the FAC algorithm is showed over computational experiments and statistical analysis, in comparison to the performance of other bio-inspired algorithms and a mathematical solver.},

It is essentially a completely inseparable multimodal global optimization problem , and using the traditional particle swarm algorithm to solve it often results in local convergence, which means that the solution accuracy of the algorithm is not high. Thus, in this study, we develop a LJ algorithm using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and a physical approach to improve the solution accuracy. In this quasi-physical strategy (QPS), the particle swarm algorithm is used to simulate the real atomic structure and incorporates the interatomic force to construct a convergence model so that the algorithm performs well in both global and local space. The potential energy functions of a variety of LJ cluster systems are selected as test functions, and the improved PSO algorithm (QPS-PSO) is analyzed and compared with a competitive swarm optimizer, cooperative coevolution PSO, and differential-group cooperative coevolution , variable-length PSO for feature selection, heterogeneous comprehensive learning PSO, ensemble PSO and cooperative coevolution with differential optimization. The results show that the PSO algorithm for LJ clusters using the proposed QPS has noticeably superior solution accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective GA with setting accuracy and diversity as two objectives. To further promote diversity in an ensemble, a new individual structure is designed to accommodate heterogeneous dichotomizers. Three multi-objective ranking strategies are deployed to balance two objectives respectively. A novel genetic operator is designed to produce ECOC-compatible offspring in the evolutionary process, and a local improvement algorithm is designed to promote individuals’ fitness values. To verify the performance of our GA, a single objective ranking strategy and the design of homogeneous learner based GA are also adopted. Ten widely used ECOC algorithms and three famous ensemble algorithms are deployed for performance comparisons based on a set of the UCI data and microarray data sets. Results show that compared with other algorithms, our GA obtains higher performance in most cases due to the trade-off between performance and diversity. Besides, the accommodation of heterogeneous dichotomizers in an ensemble provides higher generalization ability compared with homogeneous ensembles.},

These conformations are forwarded to the second phase, where an accurate search is performed with the aim of locating conformations with the best energy value . The optimization process switches between these two phases until the stopping condition is satisfied. An auxiliary fitness function was designed for the first phase, while the original fitness function is used in the second phase. The auxiliary fitness function includes an expression about the quality of the hydrophobic core. This expression is crucial for leading the search process to the promising solutions that have a good hydrophobic core and, consequently, improves the efficiency of the whole optimization process. Our differential evolution algorithm was used for demonstrating the efficiency of two-phase optimization. It was analyzed on well-known amino acid sequences that are used frequently in the literature. The obtained experimental results show that the employed two-phase optimization improves the efficiency of our algorithm significantly and that the proposed algorithm is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Therefore, the research in this paper, which focuses on combining quantum mechanics with multiobjective large-scale optimization algorithms, will be beneficial to the study of quantum-based evolutionary algorithms . In traditional quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), particle position uncertainty prevents the algorithm from easily falling into local optima. Inspired by the uncertainty principle of position, the authors propose quantum-enhanced multiobjective large-scale algorithms, which are parallel multiobjective large-scale evolutionary algorithms (PMLEAs). Specifically, PMLEA-QDE, PMLEA-QjDE and PMLEA-QJADE are proposed by introducing the search mechanism of the individual particle from QPSO into differential evolution (DE), differential evolution with self-adapting control parameters (jDE) and adaptive differential evolution with optional external archive (JADE). Moreover, the proposed algorithms are implemented with parallelism to improve the optimization efficiency. Verifications performed on several test suites indicate that the proposed quantum-enhanced algorithms are superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

In this paper, an improved version of SAPSO, named rotationally invariant SAPSO (RI-SAPSO), is proposed, which still holds the same property, but now it incorporates a rotation matrix generated by an exponential map to maintain directional diversity. A mathematical proof to prove that the RI-SAPSO algorithm is rotationally invariant is given. RI-SAPSO was evaluated on test functions extracted from CEC 2017 benchmark problems with six other PSO-like algorithms, along with its previous version. The comparative study was strengthened with a non-parametric Friedman&#39;s hypothesis test for 1 × k comparisons and p-values were adjusted in the post-hoc procedure. Simulation results showed that the proposed RI-SAPSO, in most problems, was able to find much better solutions and statistical significances were also observed.},

Therefore, this study develops a novel NUT, termed self-organizing neighborhood (SON), with three features: 1) the neighborhood relationships between individuals are incrementally learned and extracted by self-organizing map with the cosine similarity; 2) the neighborhood sizes for different individuals are adaptively adjusted according to their distinct roles in the search; 3) the evolution direction constructed with the neighborhood of each individual is incorporated into the mutation process to guide the search. By combining SON with DE, a SON-based DE (SON-DE) framework is proposed for global optimization. Experimental results on 58 real-parameter functions and 17 real-world problems have demonstrated the superiority of SON-DE in comparison with several state-of-the-art DE algorithms and evolutionary algorithms (EAs).},

However, the number of iterations needed to reach the optimal solution, or close to it, may be very high, and the computational cost can hamper compliance with time requirements. In this work, a chaotic two-dimensional (2D) map is used to accelerate convergence, and parallel algorithms are developed to alleviate the computational cost. Coarse- and fine-grained parallel algorithms are developed, the former based on multi-populations and the latter at the individual level, and in both cases these are accelerated by an improved (computational) use of the chaos map.},

  abstract     = {Achieving better exploitation and exploration capabilities (EEC) have always been an important yet challenging issue in the design of evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA). The difficulties lie in obtaining a good balance in EEC, which is determined cooperatively by operations and parameters in an EOA. When deficiencies in exploitation or exploration are observed, most existing works consider a piecemeal approach, either by designing new operations or by altering the parameters. Unfortunately, when different situations are encountered, these proposals may fail to be the winner. To address these problems, this paper proposes an explicit EEC control method named selective-candidate framework with similarity selection rule (SCSS). M (M ​&gt; ​1) candidates are first generated from each current solution with independent operations and parameters to enrich the search. Then, a similarity selection rule is designed to determine the final candidate by considering the fitness ranking of the current solution and its Euclidian distance to each of these M candidates. Superior current solutions will prefer the closest candidates for efficient local exploitation while inferior ones will favor the farthest for exploration purpose. In this way, the rule could synthesize exploitation and exploration, making the evolution more effective. When applied to three classic, four state-of-the-art and four up-to-date EOAs from branches of differential evolution, evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, significant enhancement in performance is achieved.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) usually involve multiple conflicting objectives that change over time. A good evolutionary algorithm should be able to quickly track the moving Pareto optimal front (POF) and Pareto optimal set (POS) over time. To solve DMOPs, a predictive method is proposed herein based on grey prediction model, which is composed of three essential ingredients. The first one is that the population is divided into multiple clusters, which can help the population to preserve diversity throughout the evolutionary process. The second one is that the individuals used to detect environmental changes are taken from different clusters, which in turn help the proposed algorithm to detect environmental changes more promptly and accurately. The third one is to build the grey prediction model by using the centroid point of each cluster when detecting the environmental change, and then generate the initial population. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm can deal with dynamic environments and track the varying POS and POF effectively and efficiently, and achieve better performances on most test problems than several selected state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Real-world optimization problems have been comparatively difficult to solve due to the complex nature of the objective function with a substantial number of constraints. To deal with such problems, several metaheuristics as well as constraint handling approaches have been suggested. To validate the effectiveness and strength, performance of a newly designed approach should be benchmarked by using some complex real-world problems, instead of only the toy problems with synthetic objective functions, mostly arising from the area of numerical analysis. A list of standard real-life problems appears to be the need of the time for benchmarking new algorithms in an efficient and unbiased manner. In this study, a set of 57 real-world Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs) are described and presented as a benchmark suite to validate the COPs. These problems are shown to capture a wide range of difficulties and challenges that arise from the real life optimization scenarios. Three state-of-the-art constrained optimization methods are exhaustively tested on these problems to analyze their hardness. The experimental outcomes reveal that the selected problems are indeed challenging to these algorithms, which have been shown to solve many synthetic benchmark problems easily.},

  abstract     = {Optimization arises everywhere in industrial and engineering fields, with complex and time-consuming problems to be solved. Exact search techniques cannot afford practical solutions for most of the real-life problems in reasonable time-bound. Metaheuristics proved to be numerically efficient solvers for such problems in terms of solution quality, however, they could require large time and energy to get the optimal solution. Parallelization (i.e., distributed) is a promising approach for overcoming the overwhelming energy and time consumption values of these methods. Despite recent approaches in running metaheuristics in parallel, the community still lacks for novel studies comparing and benchmarking the canonical optimization techniques while being running in parallel. In this work, we present two extensive studies to the solution quality, energy consumption, and execution time for three different metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithm, Variable Neighborhood Search , and Simulated Annealing) and their distributed counterparts. The main aim of our studies is exploring the efficiency of parallel execution of the metaheuristics while being running in new computing environments. Here, we want to identify the combinatorics between metaheuristics and solving optimization problems while being run in parallel. For our studies, we consider a multicore machine with 32 cores. This choice to a recent and commonly used system shall enrich the existing literature for multicore systems against the enormous existing studies over cluster systems. The analyses and discussions for the results of the different algorithms exhibit the combinatorics between the different metaheuristics and the parallel execution using a different number of cores. The outcome of these studies builds a guide for future designs of efficient and energy-aware optimization techniques.},

Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), which determines k value adaptively, have been widely adopted for clustering. However, when the range of k becomes increasingly large, Pareto Front (PF) approximations obtained by an MOEA may not be uniformly distributed, leading to the difficulty of obtaining the optimal k value for clustering. For this reason, an MOEA base on constrained decomposition with grids (CCDG-K) is designed for clustering and better identify the optimal k value. CCDG-K adopts a grid system for decomposition. The grid system has an inherent property of reserving diversely populated solutions, which is very desirable for clustering. The experimental studies show that CCDG-K can deliver solutions of all k values which is of great help for obtaining the optimal k value. The experimental results also indicate that CCDG-K outperforms other algorithms in clustering.},

  abstract     = {As an efficient data mining technique , data clustering has been widely-used for data analysis and extracting valuable hidden information. Leveraging the simplicity and effectiveness, the evolutionary optimization-driven clustering algorithms have exhibited promising performance and attracted tremendous attention. Up to the present, how to enable these algorithms to escape from local optima and accelerate convergence rates is an ongoing challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive Differential Evolution (DE) variant to deal with the above challenge when clustering data. In the improved DE algorithm , the four interdependent components, including mutation strategy, crossover strategy, scaling factor value, and crossover rate, are adaptively configured in an integrated manner via ant colony optimization (ACO) during the problem-solving process. To be specific, the relationships of four components in the DE algorithm are modeled as a directed acyclic graph, and a path in the graph exactly corresponds to a configuration for DE. During the optimization process, ant colony optimization is employed to search for a reasonable path for each individual of DE in terms of pheromones on arcs. In this manner, the configuration of the four interdependent components of DE will be generated dynamically, which is then used to guide the successive search behaviors of individuals in DE. Each individual has a path, representing a configuration for each component. After each iteration, individuals that generate promising solutions are allowed to deposit pheromone on the paths, resulting in more pheromones on the arcs appearing in better algorithm configurations (paths) more frequently. Through this manner, the search strategies and parameters of DE are comprehensively adapted by ACO. The proposed algorithm is named ACODE for short. To verify its effectiveness, the proposed ACODE is compared with four representative data clustering algorithms on eight widely-used benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of ACODE over half of the datasets.},

In the mixed no-idle flowshop environment, machines that allow idleness, and also those that do not, coexist. In this paper, an extension of this problem in which dependent setup times are included in machines that permit idleness is studied. In order to do so, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed. Furthermore, a method to assess the total tardiness of a permutation sequence is provided. Moreover, a partial acceleration method is devised so as to compute the total tardiness in an insertion neighbourhood . Since this problem has not yet been studied in the literature, this research adapted the best known heuristics and metaheuristics available from related problems. Moreover, a new heuristic was developed in order to provide an efficient solving mechanism for the problem. The proposed heuristic was incorporated in the best metaheuristics found in the literature. The adapted methods, as well as our proposal, were tested and compared through statistical and computational experimentation in an extensive benchmark. The MILP was also evaluated and the optimal solutions were compared to those found by the new proposed heuristic. The results show that the proposed heuristic perform extremely well in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, providing near optimal solutions in some cases.},

The algorithm implementation is explained in detail, including the way of jointly considering quantitative and qualitative aspects in the fitness function of the problem.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new class of optimization problems , called Mixed Pareto-Lexicographic Multi-objective Optimization Problems (MPL-MOPs), to provide a suitable model for scenarios where some objectives have priority over some others. Specifically, this work focuses on a relevant subclass of MPL-MOPs, namely problems involving Pareto optimization of two or more priority chains . A priority chain (PC) is a sequence of objectives lexicographically ordered by importance. After examining the main features of those problems, named PC-MPL-MOPs, we propose an innovative approach to deal with them, built upon the Grossone Methodology, a recent theory which enables handling the priority in an elegant and powerful way. The most interesting aspect of this technique is the possibility to seamlessly embed it in any existing evolutionary algorithm , without altering its logical structure. In order to provide concrete examples, we implemented it on top of the well-known NSGA-II and MOEA/D algorithms, calling these new generalized versions PC-NSGA-II and PC-MOEA/D , respectively. In the second part of this article, we test the strength of our strategy in solving multi- and even many-objective problems with priority chains, comparing it against the results achieved by standard priority-based and non-priority-based approaches. Experiments show that our algorithms are generally able to produce more solutions and of higher quality.},

The proposed ( 1 + α ) (1+α) and ( 2 + α ) (2+α) order models, where α ∈ ( 0 , ​ 1 ) , α∈(0, ​1), are optimally approximated as an integer-order transfer function by using the magnitude-frequency information of the ideal FLBF. Comparisons regarding the solution quality and robustness reveal an improved accuracy for the DE variants and CMA-ES-RIS over all the PSO variants. Results from the pair-wise Wilcoxon rank-sum test demonstrate the superiority of enhanced fitness-adaptive differential evolution (EFADE) algorithm as the most efficient optimization tool for solving this problem. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches also confirm the superior modelling accuracy of the proposed FLBFs. The canonical structure circuit realization of the FLBFs using current feedback operational amplifiers is presented. Simulations carried out in OrCAD PSPICE platform suggest proximity in the magnitude responses between the proposed and the theoretical models.

In this paper, a weighted optimization framework with random dynamic grouping is proposed for large-scale problems. A weight optimization framework utilizes a problem transformation scheme in which weights are chosen to be optimized instead of the decision variables in order to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Random dynamic grouping is used to determine sizes of each group adaptively. And multi-objective particle swarm optimization with multiple search strategies (MMOPSO) is employed as an optimizer for both original variables and weight variables. The proposed algorithm is performed on 28 benchmark test problems with 1000 dimensions, and the experimental results show that it can get better performance than some the-state-of-art algorithms in fewer function evaluations. In addition, it can be extended to solve LSMOPs with 5000 dimensions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a knowledge-based memetic algorithm to tackle the three-dimensional protein structure prediction problem without the explicit use of experimentally determined protein structures&#39; templates. Our algorithm proposal was divided into two main prediction steps: ( i ) solutions sampling and initialization; and ( ii ) structural models’ optimization coming from the previous stage. The first step generates and classifies several structural models for a given target protein, through the Angle Probability List strategy, to identify distinct structural patterns and consider reasonable solutions in the memetic algorithm initialization. The Angle Probability List takes advantage of structural knowledge stored in the Protein Data Bank to reduce the size and, consequently, the conformational search space complexity. The second step of the method consists in the optimization of the structures generated in the first stage by the proposed memetic algorithm. It uses a tree-based population where each node can be seen as an independent subpopulation that interacts with each other over global search operations, aiming at knowledge sharing , population diversity, and better exploration of the multimodal search space. The method also encompasses ad hoc global search operators, whose objective is to increase the method exploration ability focusing on specific characteristics of the protein structure prediction problem, combined with the artificial bee colony algorithm used as an exploitation technique applied to each node of the tree. The proposed algorithm was tested on a set of 24 amino acid sequences , as well as compared to the reference method in the protein structure prediction area, the method of Rosetta. The obtained results show the ability of our method to predict three-dimensional protein structures with similar folding to the experimentally determined ones, regarding the structural metrics Root-Mean-Square Deviation and Global Distance Total Score Test. We also show that our method was able to reach comparable results to Rosetta, and in some cases, it outperformed Rosetta, corroborating the effectiveness of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {Despite the successful application of an extension of the Multi-Objective Evolution Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D-M2M) to solve unbalanced multi-objective optimization problems (UMOPs), its use in constrained unbalanced multi-objective optimization problems has not been fully explored. In an earlier paper, a definition of UMOPs was suggested that had two necessary conditions: 1) finding a favored subset of the Pareto set is easier than finding an unfavored subset, and 2) the favored subset of the Pareto set dominates a large part of the feasible space. The second condition strongly reduces the fraction of MOPs that are considered UMOPs. In this paper, we eliminate that second condition and consider a broader class of UMOPs. We design an unbalanced constrained multi-objective test suite with three different types of biased constraints, yielding three different types of constrained test problems in which the degree of imbalance is scalable via a set of parameters introduced for each problem. We analyse the characteristics of three types of constraints and the difficulties they present for potential solution algorithms–i.e., NSGA-II, MOEA/D and MOEA/D-M2M, with four constraint-handling techniques. MOEA/D-M2M is shown to significantly outperform the other algorithms on these problems due to its decomposition strategy.},

Establishing and improving emergency disposal mechanisms for water contamination incidents is an important issue that has become a foremost concern globally. In this study, we first perform a theoretical analysis on an optimal scheduling problem and then prove that the scheduling of the valve and hydrant is NP-complete. Subsequently, we propose a multi-objective optimization model for contaminant response and primarily investigate two conflicting objectives: first, to minimize the volume of contaminated water exposed to the public; and second, to minimize the operational costs of the hydrant and valves. Finally, a customized multi-objective non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) coupling with an EPANET simulation is proposed and two different sizes of water distribution networks are employed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and methodology. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different parameters on the performance of our proposed algorithm.},

The strong mathematical foundations upon which the framework is built allow to redefine numerical evolutionary operators in such a way that their original movements in the continuous space are simulated in the discrete space.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a study of various population partitioning techniques and their effect on the efficiency of swarm algorithms. Population partitioning techniques based on different concepts have been studied. Prominent amongst them is self-adaptive multi-population (SAMP) technique where populations are added and deleted dynamically based on their diversity. This techniques start with a single randomly initialised population, called free population. After evolution, if the distance between solutions drops below a limit, it is considered to have converged. If all existing populations have converged, a new randomly generated population is added. SAMP keeps at least one free population at all times, hence ensuring the algorithm doesn’t get trapped in local optima. Another promising population partitioning technique studied is random partitioning, where a single population is divided into many smaller sub-populations randomly. Few extensions to the studied techniques are proposed, like an adaptive hierarchical partitioning technique, seed based partitioning with fixed seeds, random partitioning with master population, SAMP with random partitioning etc. All the studied and proposed techniques are compared over a set of benchmark functions . The strongest amongst all techniques was found to be SAMPR. SAMPR is a hybrid of self-adaptive multi-population (SAMP) technique and random partitioning where after every few generations all populations are combined together and re-partitioned randomly. Efficiency of SAMPR is validated over seven well-known swarm algorithms. Extensive comparisons are conducted over multiple benchmark functions , CEC′14 function set and 800 GKLS generated functions. Results establish the efficiency of the proposed technique for improving performance of swarm algorithms.},

In MODE-ASP, the objective space is split into several subspaces based on angle, and the optimal direction in each subspace is extracted to accelerate the convergence. A probability model is also built to achieve adaption of the parameters along with the evolution of the population. Compared with 5 state-of-the-art algorithms with 20 benchmark functions , MODE-ASP is shown to give a better performance. Moreover, the operating conditions of the sodium gluconate fermentation process are optimized with three proposed objective functions, to improve the utilization rates of equipment and conversion rates effectively.

In the calculation of some indicators, the reference points as sampled points on Pareto fronts are very important for their calculation. However, it is difficult to obtain good reference points on various types of Pareto fronts . To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced-indicator based many-objective evolutionary algorithm with adaptive reference point, termed EIEA. The algorithm proposes a reference point adaptation method to dynamically adapt the reference points for the calculation of indicators. Moreover, the calculation of IGD-NS is enhanced by employing the modified distance calculation to introduce the Pareto compliant which can further comprehensively measure the convergence and diversity. The proposed EIEA adopts Pareto dominance and the enhanced IGD-NS as the first selection criterion and the secondary selection criterion in environmental selection, respectively. The intensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good performance in solving problems with various types of Pareto fronts, surpassing several representative many-objective evolutionary algorithms for many-objective optimization.},

There are now hundreds of different algorithms that can be used to solve any problem. To produce a good performance, every metaheuristic method needs to address a satisfactory equilibrium between exploration and exploitation of the search space. Although exploration and exploitation represent two fundamental concepts in metaheuristics, the main questions about their combination and balance have not been yet completely understood. Most of the existent analyzes conducted on metaheuristic techniques consider only the comparison of their final results which cannot evaluate the nature of a good or bad balance. This paper presents an experimental analysis that quantitatively evaluates the balance between exploration and exploitation of several of the most important and better-known metaheuristic algorithms . In the study, a dimension-wise diversity measurement is used to assess the balance of each scheme considering a representative set of 42 benchmark problems that involve multimodal, unimodal, composite and shifted functions. As a result, the analysis provides several observations that allow understanding how this balance affects the results in each type of functions, and which balance is producing better solutions.},

Although there are few studies on detecting dynamic overlapping communities, all those studies only consider a single optimization objective . In practice, it is necessary to evaluate the community detection by multiple metrics to reflect different aspects of a community structure and those metrics may conflict with each other. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective approach based on decomposition for the problem of dynamic overlapping community detection, with consideration of three optimization objectives: partition density ( D ), extended modularity ( EQ ), and improved mutual information ( NMI LFK ). The dynamic overlapping network can be regarded as a set of network snapshots. The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is used to detect the communities for each snapshot. To improve the search efficiency, the dynamic optimization technique and a dynamic resource allocation strategy are introduced into the approach. Experiments show that our approach can find uniformly distributed Pareto solutions for the problem and outperforms those comparative approaches.},

Many big cities face the problem of traffic congestion, which leads to the planed vehicle scheduling scheme becoming infeasible. It is significant to study bus vehicle scheduling approaches under uncertain environments, such as traffic congestion. In this paper, a bus vehicle scheduling approach is proposed to handle the traffic congestion. It consists of three phases: firstly, a set of candidate vehicle blocks is generated once traffic congestion happens. Secondly, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is adopted to select a subset of vehicle blocks from the set of candidate blocks to generate a set of Non-dominated solutions. Finally, a departure time adjustment procedure is applied to the Non-dominated solutions to further improve the quality of solutions. Experiments on a real-world bus line show that the proposed approach is able to dynamically generate scheduling schemes and significantly improve the quality of service compared to the comparative approaches.},

Most of existing researches only consider the processing time of each operation, however, jobs often require transporting to another machine for the next operation while machines often require setup to process the next job. In addition, the times associated with these steps increase the complexity of this problem. In this paper, the flexible job scheduling problem is solved that incorporates not only processing time but setup time and transportation time as well. After presenting the problem, an improved genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the problem, with the aim of minimizing the makespan time, minimizing total setup time, and minimizing total transportation time. In the improved genetic algorithm , initial solutions are generated through three different methods to improve the quality and diversity of the initial population. Then, a crossover method with artificial pairing is adopted to preserve good solutions and improve poor solutions effectively. In addition, an adaptive weight mechanism is applied to alter mutation probability and search ranges dynamically for individuals in the population.

Feature selection is an important technique which selects small and informative feature subsets to improve the learning performance. Feature selection is not an easy task due to its large and complex search space. Recently, swarm intelligence techniques have gained much attention from the feature selection community because of their simplicity and potential global search ability. However, there has been no comprehensive surveys on swarm intelligence for feature selection in classification which is the most widely investigated area in feature selection. Only a few short surveys is this area are still lack of in-depth discussions on the state-of-the-art methods, and the strengths and limitations of existing methods, particularly in terms of the representation and search mechanisms, which are two key components in adapting swarm intelligence to address feature selection problems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art works applying swarm intelligence to achieve feature selection in classification, with a focus on the representation and search mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Portfolio optimization with cardinality constraints turns out to be a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem which is proven to be NP-Complete that limits the efficiency of exact solution approaches, often because of the long-running times. Therefore, particular attention has been given to approximate approaches such as metaheuristics which do not guarantee optimality , yet may expeditiously provide near-optimal solutions. The purpose of this study is to present an efficient hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that combines critical components from continuous ant colony optimization , artificial bee colony optimization and genetic algorithms for solving cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem . Computational results on seven publicly available benchmark problems confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid integration mechanism. Moreover, comparisons against other methods’ results in the literature reveal that the proposed solution approach is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of microarray technology, gene expression profiling has shown remarkable effort to predict the different types of malignancy and their subtypes. In microarrays, predicting highly discriminative genes is a challenging task and existing hybrid methods fail to deal with efficiently. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality problem and to improve the interpretability of discriminative genes, in this study, we developed a new hybrid wrapper approach which integrates the characteristics of teaching learning-based algorithm (TLBO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA), called TLBOGSA. A new encoding strategy is also integrated into TLBOGSA to transmute the continuous search space to binary search space and form binary TLBOGSA. In the proposed method, firstly, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection is employed to select relevant genes from the gene expression datasets. Then, wrapper method is applied to select the informative genes from the reduced data produced by mRMR. To improve the search capability during the evolution process, we have incorporated the gravitational search mechanism in the teaching phase. The proposed method uses naive bayes classifier as a fitness function to select the extremely judicious genes which can help to classify cancer accurately. The efficiency of proposed method is tested on ten biological datasets and compared with state-of-art computational intelligence approaches for tumor prediction. Experimental results and statistical analysis demonstrate that proposed method is significantly outperforms existing metaheuristic approaches regarding convergence rate, classification accuracy and optimal number of feature sets. The proposed method reaches above 98\% classification accuracy in six datasets and maximum accuracy is achieved as 99.62\% in DLBCL dataset.},

  abstract     = {Due to its practical relevance, the hybrid flowshop scheduling problem (HFSP) has been widely studied in the literature with the objectives related to production efficiency. However, studies regarding energy consumption and environmental effects have rather been limited. This paper addresses the trade-off between makespan and total energy consumption in hybrid flowshops, where machines can operate at varying speed levels. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and a bi-objective constraint programming (CP) model are proposed for the problem employing speed scaling. Since the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption are conflicting with each other, the augmented epsilon (ε)-constraint approach is used for obtaining the Pareto-optimal solutions. While close approximations for the Pareto-optimal frontier are obtained for small-sized instances, sets of non-dominated solutions are obtained for large instances by solving the MILP and CP models under a time limit. As the problem is NP-hard, two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm , a variable block insertion heuristic and four variants of ensemble of metaheuristic algorithms are also proposed, as well as a novel constructive heuristic. The performances of the proposed seven bi-objective metaheuristics are compared with each other as well as the MILP and CP solutions on a set of well-known HFSP benchmarks in terms of cardinality, closeness, and diversity of the solutions. Initially, the performances of the algorithms are tested on small-sized instances with respect to the Pareto-optimal solutions. Then, it is shown that the proposed algorithms are very effective for solving large instances in terms of both solution quality and CPU time.},

First, constraints in form of elliptical manifolds are considered. For those constraints, an algorithm is proposed that evolves itself on that manifold while optimizing the objective function. The specialty about the approach is that it is possible to ensure that the population evolves on the manifold with closed-form expressions. Second, an algorithm design for general nonlinear equality constraints is presented. For those constraints considered, an iterative repair approach is presented. This allows the evolution to happen on the nonlinear manifold defined by the equality constraints for this more general case as well. For both cases, the algorithms are interior point methods , i.e., the objective function is only evaluated at feasible points in the parameter space, which is often required in the area of simulation-based optimization. For the experimental evaluation, different test problems are introduced. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on those providing insights into the working principles of the different approaches. It is experimentally shown that correcting the mutation vectors after the repair step is important for an effective evolution strategy. Additional experiments are conducted for providing a comparison to other evolutionary black-box optimization methods, which show that the developed algorithms are competitive.},

  abstract     = {A large number of real-world problems require optimising several objective functions at the same time, which are generally in conflict. Many of these problems have been addressed through multi-objective evolutionary algorithms . In this paper, we propose a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm whose main feature is the incorporation of the Decision Maker’s (DM’s) preferences through multi-criteria ordinal classification methods in early stages of the optimisation process, being progressively updated. This increases the selective pressure towards the privileged zone of the Pareto front more in agreement with the DM’s preferences. An extensive experimental research was conducted to answer three main questions: i) to what extent the proposal improves the convergence towards the region of interest for the DM; ii) to what extent the proposal becomes more relevant as the number of objectives increases, and iii) to what extent the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm depends on the particular multi-criteria method used to assign solutions to ordered classes. The issues used to evaluate our proposal and answer the questions were seven scalable test problems from the DTLZ test suite and some instances of project portfolio optimisation problems , with three and eight objectives. Compared to MOEA/D and MOEA/D-DE, the results showed that the proposed strategy obtains a better convergence towards the region of interest for the DM and also performs better characterisation of that zone on a wide range of objective functions.},

  abstract     = {In dealing with constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs), a key issue of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is to balance the convergence and diversity of working populations. However, most state-of-the-art MOEAs show poor performance in balancing them, and can cause the working populations to concentrate on part of the Pareto fronts , leading to serious imbalanced searching between preserving diversity and achieving convergence. This paper proposes a method which combines a multi-objective to multi-objective (M2M) decomposition approach with the push and pull search (PPS) framework, namely PPS-M2M. To be more specific, the proposed algorithm decomposes a CMOP into a set of simple CMOPs. Each simple CMOP corresponds to a sub-population and is solved in a collaborative manner. When dealing with constraints, each sub-population follows a procedure of “ignore the constraints in the push stage and consider the constraints in the pull stage”, which helps each working sub-population get across infeasible regions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed PPS-M2M, it is compared with the other nine algorithms, including CM2M, MOEA/D-Epsilon, MOEA/D-SR, MOEA/D-CDP, C-MOEA/D, NSGA-II-CDP, MODE-ECHM, CM2M2 and MODE-SaE on a set of benchmark CMOPs. The experimental results show that the proposed PPS-M2M is significantly better than the other nine algorithms. In addition, a set of constrained and imbalanced multi-objective optimization problems (CIMOPs) are suggested to compare PPS-M2M and PPS-MOEA/D. The experimental results show that the proposed PPS-M2M outperforms PPS-MOEA/D on CIMOPs.},

However, they have not been yet fully applied for pattern classification tasks in time series data within the digital industry. In this paper, a novel approach based on an evolutionary algorithm for optimizing the networks hyperparameters and on the resulting deep learning model for pattern classification is proposed. In order to demonstrate the applicability of this method, a test scenario that involves a process related to blind fastener installation in the aeronautical industry is provided. The results achieved with the proposed approach are compared with shallow models and it is demonstrated that the proposed method obtains better results with an accuracy value of 95\%.},

Consequently, some imprecision , ill-determination and arbitrariness are unavoidable. Moreover, such elicitation cannot be performed by traditional optimization techniques in a reasonable time. Therefore, we present here a novel elicitation method guided by a genetic algorithm whose main contribution is coping with imperfect knowledge. The latter is done by using interval numbers representing all the possible values that the parameters can attain. The assessment of the method showed its high ability to reproduce the decision maker’s preferences. Finally, as the method proposed in this paper is the complement of the authors’ previous work regarding the optimization of stock portfolios, we provide a case study in such a field. We use differential evolution to obtain the most satisfactory portfolio. The results reported here show that the best portfolio returns are obtained when the elicitation method is exploited, and we conclude that the new overall approach might be an interesting alternative to the already-existing methods.},

  abstract     = {For multi-objective optimization problems, obtaining a uniformly distributed approximation set is among the most important issues. During the past decades, various diversity mechanisms have been proposed to address this challenge. However, the existing diversity mechanisms tend to be problem-specific, and may not generalize well over different problem domains. Inspired by the idea of utilizing multiple low-level heuristics to achieve better diversity performance in multi-discipline problem solving, we focus on efficient algorithm design based on the methodology of selection hyper-heuristics. This study proposes a novel selection hyper-heuristic operating over multiple diversity mechanisms. The unique feature of the proposed approach lies in its ability to intelligently learn, select, and combine different diversity mechanisms with the purpose of taking advantages of them to obtain well-distributed approximation sets. Moreover, this work develops a new learning mechanism, the perturbation adaptive pursuit strategy, which is incorporated into the proposed hyper-heuristic to improve the decision-making process of selecting suitable diversity mechanisms for the problem at hand. The performance of the proposed hyper-heuristic is tested on 2-objective ZDT, 3-objective DTLZ, and 5-objective WFG test suites. Additionally, experiments are also conducted to investigate the ability of the novel hyper-heuristic to integrate existing multi-objective meta-heuristics on MaOP test suite from 3- to 10-objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed selection hyper-heuristic for cross-domain capacity, particularly in producing well distributed approximation set with respect to Spacing metric and Hypervolume metric.},

For this reason, several works in the literature tackling these optimization problems with Genetic Algorithms (GA) introduced new balanced crossover operators which ensure that the offspring has the same balancedness characteristics of the parents. However, the use of such operators has never been thoroughly motivated, except for some generic considerations about search space reduction. In this paper, we undertake a rigorous statistical investigation on the effect of balanced and unbalanced crossover operators against three optimization problems from the area of cryptography and coding theory: nonlinear balanced Boolean functions , binary Orthogonal Arrays (OA) and bent functions. In particular, we consider three different balanced crossover operators (each with two variants: “left-to-right” and “shuffled”), two of which have never been published before, and compare their performances with classic one-point crossover. We are able to confirm that the balanced crossover operators perform better than one-point crossover. Furthermore, in two out of three crossovers, the “left-to-right” version performs better than the “shuffled” version.},

  abstract     = {Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis (MDO) is a common clinical procedure to correct mandibular retrognathia. However, since there is not a gold standard for determining the screw positions for current MDO operations, deviation of distraction direction and malocclusion increases. This case results in need of additional operations that affect the callus stability. In these cases, relapse risk increases and remodelling period gets longer. On the other hand, large volume of the distractor plates results in more invasive treatment and negatively affects the patients’ comfort. To overcome these problems, this study offers a new method including; virtual surgery simulation, determining the optimum screw configuration using particle swarm optimization loop linked between MATLAB-PYTHON-ANSYS programs and the design of distractor plate geometry with topology optimization . In order to test the proposed method, two different Finite Element (FE) models, CM and OM, were established based on conventional and optimum method, respectively. FEA results of the current study reveals that OM has 33.56\% less displacement compared to CM, and the most critical screw in terms of screw loosening for OM has 35.29\% less strain value than CM. These outcomes show OM shows superior callus stability in comparison with CM. On the other hand, redesign of the distractor plates using topology optimization according to the best screw positions provides 43.32\% reduction in the total implant volume which means reduced cost and a less invasive MDO operation. Therefore, the clinical use of this protocol is expected to increase the success of the operation by shortening the recovery period.},

  abstract     = {Grouping problems are a special type of combinatorial optimization problems that have gained great relevance because of their numerous real-world applications. The solution process required by some grouping problems represents a high complexity, and currently, there is no algorithm to find the optimal solution efficiently in the worst case. Consequently, the scientific community has classified such problems as NP-hard. For the solution of grouping problems, numerous elaborate procedures have been designed incorporating different techniques. The specialized literature includes enumerative methods, neighborhood searches, evolutionary algorithms as well as swarm intelligence algorithms. In this study, a review of twenty-two NP-hard grouping problems is carried out, considering seventeen metaheuristics . The state-of-the-art suggests that Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have shown the best performance in most of the cases, and the group-based representation scheme can be used to improve the performance of different metaheuristics designed to solve grouping problems. Finally, a case study is presented to compare the performance of three metaheuristic algorithms with different representation schemes for the Parallel-Machine Scheduling problem with unrelated machines, including the GA with extended permutation encoding, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with machine-based encoding, and the GA with group-based encoding. Experimental results suggest that the GA with the group-based encoding is the best option to address this problem.},

  abstract     = {The use of unmanned airborne agents as relays for ground agents to ensure ground network survivability is gaining traction at both theoretical and practical levels, in research that targets contexts like search and rescue in disaster areas, farming with autonomous equipment, surveillance, internet of things , military operations, autonomous transportation systems, and many others. This comes with some challenges, which include the dynamics of the ground unit behaviors, the scalability of the system, the mobility model of the airborne agents, and the integration between ground and air agents. This paper contributes to addressing the above challenges by using a bio-inspired approach that combines swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation for providing ground network survivability for a wide range of ground movement patterns. The proposed approach models ground and airborne agents as a dual air-ground swarm that uses boids-like rules, and optimizes the movement of the airborne agents using an on-line real-time genetic algorithm with shadow simulation and prediction. Arguably, the proposed approach provides system scalability both size-wise and context-wise, while also offering a certain amount of integration between the ground and air swarms of agents. The results of the investigation demonstrate that the methods employed endow the airborne agents with the needed capability to ensure network survivability for complex ground activity, including resilience to changes in the ground movement pattern and good responsiveness to activities that have no pattern at all, such as uniform random walks.},

When the many-objective optimization problem has a complicated Pareto front , this selection strategy can easily miss the promising areas and converge into a subregion of the Pareto front . To address this issue, we propose a many-objective evolutionary algorithm with diversity-first based environmental selection. Different from the existing selection strategies, the environmental selection procedure in the proposed algorithm adopts a diversity-first-and-convergence-second principle, which first selects the representative solutions that having better diversity and then considers using the well-converged solutions to replace them in subregions. This selection-replacement strategy can maintain the diversity and make contribution to the convergence. In addition, a selection criterion, termed adaptive angle penalized distance, is designed to judge whether the replacement is implemented or not. The proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art many-objective evolutionary algorithms on a large number of test problems with various characteristics. Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has competitive performance on many-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Feature construction can substantially improve the accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Genetic Programming (GP) has been proven to be effective at this task by evolving non-linear combinations of input features. GP additionally has the potential to improve ML explainability since explicit expressions are evolved. Yet, in most GP works the complexity of evolved features is not explicitly bound or minimized though this is arguably key for explainability . In this article, we assess to what extent GP still performs favorably at feature construction when constructing features that are (1) Of small-enough number, to enable visualization of the behavior of the ML model; (2) Of small-enough size, to enable interpretability of the features themselves; (3) Of sufficient informative power, to retain or even improve the performance of the ML algorithm. We consider a simple feature construction scheme using three different GP algorithms, as well as random search, to evolve features for five ML algorithms, including support vector machines and random forest . Our results on 21 datasets pertaining to classification and regression problems show that constructing only two compact features can be sufficient to rival the use of the entire original feature set. We further find that a modern GP algorithm, GP-GOMEA, performs best overall. These results, combined with examples that we provide of readable constructed features and of 2D visualizations of ML behavior, lead us to positively conclude that GP-based feature construction still works well when explicitly searching for compact features, making it extremely helpful to explain ML models.},

The algorithm is implemented for shared-memory architectures, and among its main features, it incorporates a grid representation of the solution space, and a concurrent priority queue to store and dispatch the pending sub-problems to be solved. We report the optimal Pareto front of thirteen well-known instances from the literature, which were unknown before. They will be very useful for the scientific community to provide more accuracy in the performance measurement of their algorithms. Indeed, we carefully analyze the performance of NSGA-II on these instances, comparing the results against the optimal ones computed in this work.

  abstract     = {Scalarization refers to a generic class of methods to combine multiple conflicting objectives into one in order to find a Pareto optimal solution to the original problem. Augmented achievement scalarizing function (AASF) is one such method used popularly in the multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) field. In evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) literature, scalarization methods such as penalty boundary intersection (PBI) are commonly used to compare similar solutions within a population. Both AASF and PBI methods require a reference point and a reference direction for their calculation. In this paper, we aim to analytically derive and understand the commonalities between these two metrics and gain insights into the limitations of their standard parametric forms. We show that it is possible to find an equivalent modified AASF formulation for a given PBI parameter and vice versa for bi-objective problems. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the theory developed. We further discuss the challenges in extending this to higher objectives and show that it is still possible to achieve limited equivalence along symmetric reference vectors. The study connects the two philosophies of solving multi-objective optimization problems , provides a means to gain a deeper understanding of both these measures, and expands their parametric range to provide more flexibility of controlling the search behavior of the EMO algorithms.},

Optimization based on variable grouping and cooperative coevolution is a good way to address MOLSOPs, but few attempts have been made to decompose the variables in MOLSOPs. In this paper, we propose multiobjective graph-based differential grouping with shift (mogDG-shift) to decompose the large number of variables in an MOLSOP. We analyze the variable properties, then detect the interactions among variables, and finally group the variables based on their properties and interactions. We modify the decision variable analyses (DVA) in the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decision variable analyses (MOEA/DVA), extend graph-based differential grouping (gDG) to MOLSOPs, and test the method on many MOLSOPs. The experimental results show that mogDG-shift can achieve 100\% grouping accuracy for LSMOP and DTLZ as well as almost all WFG instances, which are much better than DVA. We further combine mogDG-shift with two representative multiobjective evolutionary algorithms: the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Compared with the original algorithms, the algorithms combined with mogDG-shift show improved optimization performance .},

Existing works need to pre-set weight parameters to control the different emphasis on the objective function, and cannot automatically identify the number of communities. In the process of optimization, there will be some challenges, such as premature and inefficiency. This paper presents a multi-objective adaptive fast evolutionary algorithm (F-SGCD) for community detection in complex networks. Firstly, it transforms the problem of community detection into a multi-objective optimization problem and constructs two objective functions of community score and community fitness. Secondly, an external elite gene pool is introduced to store non-inferior solutions with high fitness. At the same time, an adaptive genetic operator is executed to return a set of non-dominant solutions compromised between the two objective functions. Finally, a Pareto optimal solution with the highest modularity is selected and decoded to generate a set of independent subnetworks . Experiments show that the multi-objective adaptive fast evolutionary algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of community detection in complex networks, and can discover the hierarchical structure of complex networks better.},

The second stratagem is proposed to estimate the effective fitness measure from multiple fitness samples of a trial solution, resulting from sampling. The novelty of the second policy lies in considering the distribution of noisy samples during effective fitness evaluation, instead of their direct averaging. The third strategy deals with amelioration of the DE/current-to-best/1 mutation scheme to judiciously direct the search in promising region, even in prevailing existence of noise in the objective surface. Finally, the greedy selection policy of the traditional DE is modified by introducing the principle of probabilistic crowding induced niching to ensure both the population quality and the population diversity.

  abstract     = {Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) is certainly a story of great success considering the numerous contributions and their applications to different problems and fields during the last two decades. One issue, however, that has been almost neglected so far is the consideration of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) that contain equality constraints. Such constraints play a special role as the inclusion of each equality constraint typically reduces the dimension of the search space by one. Consequently, the probability for a randomly chosen candidate solution of an equality constrained MOP to be feasible is zero, which makes the treatment of such problems very hard for EMO algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark of equality constrained MOPs. The problems are derived from the well-known DTLZ and IDTLZ problems and hence inherit their properties. The new benchmarks, Eq-DTLZ and Eq-IDTLZ, are scalable both in decision and objective space as well as in the number of equality constraints. Furthermore, all Pareto sets differ from the solution sets of the unconstrained problems and can be expressed analytically which make them good candidates for testing EMO algorithms on this important problem class. Based on the new benchmark, we investigate the performance of some state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms . The results show that the new problems are indeed hard to solve for all considered algorithms and that further investigation has to be done for the reliable treatment of equality constrained MOPs.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the scientific community has witnessed an explosion in the use of pattern recognition algorithms . However, little attention has been paid to the tasks preceding the execution of these algorithms, the preprocessing activities. One of these tasks is dimensionality reduction, in which a subset of features that improves the performance of the mining algorithm is located and algorithm&#39;s runtime is reduced. Although there are many methods that address the problems in pattern recognition algorithms , effective solutions still need to be researched and explored. Hence, this paper aims to address three of the issues surrounding these algorithms. First, we propose adapting a promising meta-heuristic called biased random-key genetic algorithm , which considers a random initial population construction. We call this algorithm as unsupervised feature selection by biased random-key genetic algorithm I. Next, we propose an approach for building the initial population partly in a deterministic way. Thus, we applied this idea in two algorithms, named unsupervised feature selection by particle swarm optimization and unsupervised feature selection by biased random-key genetic algorithm II. Finally, we simulated different datasets to study the effects of relevant and irrelevant attributes, and of noisy and missing data on the performance of the algorithms. After the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we can state that the proposed algorithms outperform all other methods in different datasets. It was also observed that the construction of the initial population in a partially deterministic way contributed to the better performance. It should be noted that some methods are more sensitive to noisy and missing data than others, as well as to relevant and irrelevant attributes.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are a widely accepted choice for the numerical treatment of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For constrained problems, however, these methods still have room for improvement to compute satisfactory approximations of the solution sets. A possible remedy is the hybridization of MOEAs with specialized local search mechanisms; which is not a simple task due to their high cost. In this work, we consider the information of the constraints when performing the local search, and propose a new and effective way to compute descent directions for constrained bi-objective optimization problems . Since the directions are computed via neighborhood sampling, the method is perfectly suited for the use within MOEAs or any other population based algorithm as the samples can be taken precisely from the populations. The new method can be used as local search engine within, in principle, any MOEA. As demonstrator, we will consider two particular hybrids. Numerical results on some benchmark problems support the benefits of the novel approach. Though this work focuses on the bi-objective case, this represents an important step to formalize gradient-free multi-objective descent directions and its efficient interleaving into MOEAs.},

  abstract     = {The plant disease classification based on using digital images is very challenging. In the last decade, machine learning techniques and plant images classification tools such as deep learning can be used for recognizing, detecting and diagnosing plant diseases. Currently, deep learning technology has been used for plant disease detection and classification. In this paper, an ensemble model of two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) namely VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the task plant disease diagnosis by classifying the leaves images of healthy and unhealthy. In this context, CNNs are used due to its capability of overcoming the technical problems which are associated with the classification problem of plant diseases. However, CNNs suffer from a great variety of hyperparameters with specific architectures which is considered as a challenge to identify manually the optimal hyperparameters. Therefore, orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) algorithm is utilized in this paper to optimize a number of these hyperparameters by finding optimal values for these hyperparameters rather than using traditional methods such as the manual trial and error method. In this paper, to prevent CNNs from falling into the local minimum and to train efficiently, an exponentially decaying learning rate (EDLR) schema is used. In this paper, the problem of the imbalanced used dataset has been solved by using random minority oversampling and random majority undersampling methods, and some restrictions in terms of both the number and diversity of samples have been overcome. The obtained results of this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model is very competitive. The experimental results are compared with the performance of other pre-trained CNN models namely InceptionV3 and Xception, whose hyperparameters were selected using a non-evolutionary method. The comparison results demonstrated that the proposed diagnostic approach has achieved higher performance than the other models.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a systematic design of evolutionary optimization , namely Multimodal Memetic Framework (MMF), to effectively search the vast complex energy landscape. Our proposed memetic framework is implemented in hierarchical stages with the optimization of each stage performed in parallel in three different states: Exploratory, Exploitative and Central. Each state, with its own set of sub-populations, either explores or exploits by beneficial mixing of potential solutions to direct the search towards a global solution. Instead of implementing identical genetic operators, the proposed approach employs different selection and survival criteria in each state according to their designated task. The Exploratory state employs a knowledge-based initial population generation technique with appropriately tuned genetic operators to guide the search to the “nearest peak”. The Exploitative state fine-tunes the individuals representing different regions by applying a building block based local search. Finally, by utilizing the imbibed knowledge from different peaks, the Central state carries out information-exchange among the highly fit solutions for exploring the undiscovered regions. The information exchange employs a novel non-random parental selection technique to distribute the reproduction opportunity intelligently among the individuals for making cross-over more effective. The method has been tested on a set of various benchmark protein sequences for 2D and 3D lattice models. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Differential evolution is one of the most powerful and popular evolutionary algorithms , which is primarily used to solve continuous-based optimization problems . Although differential evolution has been considered unsuitable for solving many permutation-based real-world combinatorial problems , several efforts for designing an efficient discrete version of the differential evolution algorithm have occurred in recent years. This paper introduces a novel discrete differential evolution algorithm for improving the performance of the standard differential evolution algorithm when it is used to solve complex discrete traveling salesman problems . In this approach, we propose to use a combination of, 1) an improved mapping mechanism to map continuous variables to discrete ones and vice versa, 2) a k -means clustering-based repairing method for enhancing the solutions in the initial population, 3) an ensemble of mutation strategies for increasing the exploration capability of the algorithm. Finally, for improving the local capability of the proposed algorithm when solving discrete problems, two well-known local searches have also been adapted. To judge its performance, the proposed algorithm is compared with those of 27 state-of-the-art algorithms, for solving 45 instances of traveling salesman problems , with different numbers of cities. The experimental results demonstrated that our technique significantly outperforms most of the comparative methods , in terms of the average errors from the best-known solutions, and achieved very competitive results with better computational time than others.},

Most of the models of PSO algorithms are time-invariant linear models with the assumption the local and global best solutions do not change, i.e., the stagnation assumption. However, in this paper, a discrete-time switched linear model is introduced to study the stability and convergence of the PSO algorithm without the stagnation assumption. By considering the updates of local best positions and global best solutions, a sequence of state transform matrixes is generated during the searching process. The semistability of the proposed switched linear system is studied. The conditions of the convergence in mean and convergence in probability are derived by using the recently developed results in paracontraction. Moreover, numerical examples are provided to verify the results proposed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a family of interactive evolutionary algorithms for Multiple Objective Optimization (MOO). In the phase of preference elicitation, a Decision Maker (DM) is asked to compare some pairs of solutions from the current population. Such holistic information is represented by a set of compatible instances of achievement scalarizing or quasi-convex preference functions, which contribute to the construction of preference cones in the objective space. These cones are systematically contracted during the evolutionary search, because an incremental specification of the DM&#39;s pairwise comparisons is progressively reducing the DM&#39;s most preferred region in the objective space. An inclusion of evolved solutions in this region is used along with the dominance relation to revise an elitism principle of the employed optimization algorithm . In this way, the evolutionary search is focused on a subset of Pareto optimal solutions that are particularly interesting to the DM. We investigate, moreover, how the convergence is influenced by the use of some pre-defined and newly proposed self-adjusting (dynamic) interaction patterns. We also propose a new way for visualizing the progress of an evolutionary search. It supports understanding the differences between effects of a selection pressure imposed by various optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recent years, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has been researched and applied for numerous optimization problems . In this study, we propose an improved version of MOEA/D with problem-specific heuristics, named PH-MOEAD, to solve the hybrid flowshop scheduling (HFS) lot-streaming problems, where the variable sub-lots constraint is considered to minimize four objectives, i.e., the penalty caused by the average sojourn time , the energy consumption in the last stage, as well as the earliness and the tardiness values. For solving this complex scheduling problem, each solution is coded by a two-vector-based solution representation, i.e., a sub-lot vector and a scheduling vector. Then, a novel mutation heuristic considering the permutations in the sub-lots is proposed, which can improve the exploitation abilities. Next, a problem-specific crossover heuristic is developed, which considered solutions with different sub-lot size, and therefore can make a solution feasible and enhance the exploration abilities of the algorithm as well. Moreover, several problem-specific lemmas are proposed and a right-shift heuristic based on them is subsequently developed, which can further improve the performance of the algorithm. Lastly, a population initialization mechanism is embedded that can assign a fit reference vector for each solution. Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analysis, the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several presented algorithms, both in solution quality and population diversity.},

  abstract     = {For the classification of motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG), appropriate features are crucial to obtain a high classification accuracy . Considering the characteristics of the EEG signals, the time-frequency-space three-dimensional features are extracted. Due to a considerable number of the extracted features, the performance of a classifier will degrade. Therefore, it is necessary to implement feature selection. However, existing feature selection methods are easy to fall into a local optimum of a high-dimensional feature selection problem. In this paper, a dimensionality reduction mechanism (called DimReM) is proposed, which gradually reduces the dimension of the search space by removing some unimportant features. In principle, DimReM transforms a high-dimensional feature selection problem into a low-dimensional one. DimReM does not introduce any additional parameters and its implementation is simple. To verify its effectiveness, DimReM is combined with different evolutionary algorithms and different classifiers to select features on various kinds of datasets. Compared with evolutionary algorithms without dimensionality reduction, their augmented versions equipped with DimReM can find feature subsets with higher classification accuracies while smaller numbers of selected features.},
