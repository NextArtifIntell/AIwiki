Models based on fractional order Bloch–Torrey equations are known to provide insights into tissue structures and the microenvironment . In this paper, we consider new two-dimensional multi-term time and space fractional Bloch–Torrey equations with variable coefficients on irregular convex domains , which involve the Caputo time fractional derivative and the Riemann–Liouville space fractional derivative. An unstructured-mesh Galerkin finite element method is used to discretize the spatial fractional derivative, while for each time fractional derivative we use the L 1 L1 scheme on a temporal graded mesh. The stability and convergence of the fully discrete scheme are proved. Numerical examples are given to verify the efficiency of our method.},

  abstract     = {This work is motivated by the difficulty in assembling the Galerkin matrix when solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) using B-splines of moderate-to-high polynomial degree . To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel methodology named CossIGA (COmpreSSive IsoGeometric Analysis), which combines the IGA principle with CORSING, a recently introduced sparse recovery approach for PDEs based on compressive sensing . CossIGA assembles only a small portion of a suitable IGA Petrov–Galerkin discretization and is effective whenever the PDE solution is sufficiently sparse or compressible, i.e., when most of its coefficients are zero or negligible. The sparsity of the solution is promoted by employing a multilevel dictionary of B-splines as opposed to a basis. Thanks to sparsity and the fact that only a fraction of the full discretization matrix is assembled, the proposed technique has the potential to lead to significant computational savings. We show the effectiveness of CossIGA for the solution of the 2D and 3D Poisson equation over nontrivial geometries by means of an extensive numerical investigation.},

Then, the Newton iterative method is studied for solving the nonlinear discrete system generated from the finite element approximation , including the stability and the optimal error estimates regarding the spatial mesh size and the iterative factor. The analysis indicates that the viscosity coefficient has more impact on the numerical algorithm than the thermal conductivity and the mass diffusivity coefficients.

Therefore, the identification of boundary condition of two-dimensional nonlinear PDE is considered. This paper transforms the identification of boundary condition into a PDE optimization problem. The Lipchitz continuous of the gradient of cost function is proved based on the dual equation. In order to solve this optimization problem, this paper presents a modified conjugate gradient algorithm, and the global convergence of which is analyzed. The results of the simulation experiment show that the modified conjugate gradient algorithm obviously reduces the iterative number and running time. Due to the ill-posedness of the identification of boundary condition, this paper combines regularization method with the modified conjugate gradient algorithm. The simulation experiment illustrates that regularization method can eliminate the ill-posedness of this problem. Finally, the experimental data of a steel plant illustrate the validity of this paper’s method.},

In this method, a two-stage time-accurate discretization approach is applied to construct time marching scheme, and the spatial gradient operator is discretized by a mixed difference scheme to maintain a second-order accuracy in space. It is shown that the previous finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method (FDLBM) (Guo and Zhao, 2003) is a special case of the T2S2-FDLBM. Through the von Neumann analysis, the stability of the method is analyzed and two specific T2S2-FDLBMs are discussed. The two T2S2-FDLBMs are applied to simulate some incompressible flows with the non-uniform grids. Compared with other high order FDLBMs, this two T2S2-FDLBMs keep the simplicity of standard lattice Boltzmann method. Compared with the previous FDLBM and lattice Boltzmann method, the two T2S2-FDLBMs are more accurate and more stable. The value of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition number in our method can be up to 0.9, which also significantly improves the computational efficiency.},

The AVS-FE method is a Petrov–Galerkin method in which the test space is broken, whereas the trial space consists of classical FE basis functions, e.g., C 0 C0 or Raviart–Thomas functions. We employ the concept of optimal test functions of the discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin (DPG) method by Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan (Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, 2010; Carstensen et al., 2014; Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, 2011a; Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, 2011b; Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, 2012), leading to unconditionally stable FE approximations . Remarkably, by using C 0 C0 or Raviart–Thomas trial spaces, the optimal discontinuous test functions can be computed in a completely decoupled element-by-element fashion. To establish the error estimators we present two approaches: ( i ) following the classical approach of Becker and Rannacher (Becker and Rannacher, 2001), i.e., the dual solution is sought in the (broken) test space, and ( ii ) introducing an alternative approach in which we seek C 0 C0 , or Raviart–Thomas, AVS-FE approximations of the dual solution by using the underlying strong form of the dual boundary value problem (BVP). Various numerical verifications for 2D convection-dominated diffusion BVPs show that the estimates of the approximation error by the new alternative method are highly accurate, while the classical approach leads to error estimates of poor quality. Lastly, we present an algorithm for h h -adaptive processes based on control of the numerical approximation error via the new alternative approach. Numerical verifications show that the estimator maintains high accuracy as the error converges to zero.},

Its aim is to respect the physical bounds on the computed solution independently of the used mesh and the involved anisotropy. To achieve that, two main terms referred to as convection and diffusion are carefully approximated. The transport contribution is discretized using a product of centered and upstream schemes. The discretization of the oscillatory diffusive fluxes is treated by means of an upwind scheme. Based on the established a priori estimates, we demonstrate the convergence of the approximate solutions thanks to compactness arguments adapted to degenerate parabolic problems. Numerical experiments are performed in two dimensions.

We adopt a perturbation approach, expanding the solution in Taylor series around the nominal value of the coefficient, and approximating the expected value of the stochastic solution of the PDE by the expected value of its Taylor polynomial. The recursive deterministic equation satisfied by the expected value of the Taylor polynomial (first moment equation) is formally derived. Well-posedness and regularity results for the recursion are proved to hold in Sobolev space-valued Hölder spaces with mixed regularity. The recursive first moment equation is then discretized by means of a sparse approximation technique, and the convergence rates are derived.},

Such functions typically are used in various meshfree methods , as well as methods based on the isogeometric paradigm. The present paper analyses a model problem consisting of the Poisson equation subject to non-standard boundary conditions. Namely, instead of classical boundary conditions , the model problem involves Dirichlet- and Neumann-type nonlocal boundary conditions. Variational formulations with strongly and weakly imposed inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type nonlocal conditions are derived and compared within an extensive numerical study in the isogeometric framework based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). The attention in the numerical study is paid mainly to the influence of the nonlocal boundary conditions on the properties of the considered discretisation methods.},

The fluid evolution is obtained on a three-dimensional lattice with 19 reticular velocities (D3Q19 computational molecule) while the immersed body surface is modeled as a collection of Lagrangian points responding to an elastic potential and a bending resistance. A moving least squares reconstruction is used to accurately interpolate flow quantities and the forcing field needed to enforce the boundary condition on immersed bodies. The proposed model is widely validated against well known benchmark data for rigid and deformable objects . Rigid transport is validated by computing the settling of a sphere under gravity for five different conditions. Then, the tumbling of inertial particles with different shape is considered, recovering the Jefferey orbit for a prolate spheroid . Moreover, the revolution period for an oblate spheroid and for a disk-like particle is obtained as a function of the Reynolds number . The existence of a critical Reynolds number is demonstrated for both cases above which revolution is inhibited. The transport of deformable objects is also considered. The steady deformation of a membrane under shear for three different values of the mechanical stiffness is assessed. Then, the tumbling of a weakly-deformable spheroid under shear is systematically analyzed as a function strain stiffness, bending resistance and membrane mass.},

A generalized continuous surface tension force formulation is deduced by using the virtual work method. The wetting boundary condition is derived based on mass conservation law . The proposed model for ternary fluids is consistent with the binary-fluid models in the absence of one fluid. A lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is developed to solve the phase-field equations and hydrodynamic equations , and this model can deal with problems involving high density and viscosity contrasts. The proposed method is examined through several test cases. A layered Poiseuille flow and droplet coalescence problems are carried out to validate the present LB model. Several dynamic problems in ternary fluid problems involving a solid are simulated, including the wetting of two droplets on a circular cylinder and impacting of a multiphase droplet on a fixed particle. Finally, we apply the model to a three-dimensional multi-bubbles rising problem to access its numerical accuracy and stability.},

A series of typical two- and three-dimensional test cases, including transonic flows over an aerofoil, a wing or a CRM wing-body combination, were carried out to verify the developed method. The computed results agreed well with experimental data and other numerical solutions reported in literature.

  abstract     = {We present a three-dimensional (3D) partitioned aeroelastic formulation for a flexible multibody system interacting with incompressible turbulent fluid flow. While the incompressible Navier–Stokes system is discretized using a stabilized Petrov–Galerkin procedure, the multibody structural system consists of a generic interaction of multiple components such as rigid body, beams and flexible thin shells along with various types of joints and connections among them. A co-rotational framework is utilized for the category of small strain problems where the displacement of the body is decomposed into a rigid body rotation and a small strain component. This assumption simplifies the structural equations and allows for the incorporation of multiple bodies (rigid as well as flexible) in the system. The displacement and rotation constraints at the joints are imposed by a Lagrange multiplier method. The equilibrium conditions at the fluid–structure interface are satisfied by the transfer of tractions and structural displacements via the radial basis function approach, a scattered data interpolation technique, which is globally conservative. For the coupled stability in low structure-to-fluid mass ratio regimes, a nonlinear iterative force correction scheme is employed in the partitioned staggered predictor–corrector scheme. The convergence and generality of the radial basis function mapping are analyzed by carrying out systematic error analysis of the transfer of fluid traction across the non-matching fluid–structure interface where a third-order of convergence is observed. The proposed aeroelastic framework is then validated by considering a flow across a flexible pitching plate configuration with serration at the trailing edge. Finally, we demonstrate the flow across a flexible flapping wing of a bat modeling the bone fingers as beams and the flexible membrane as thin shells in the multibody system along with the joints.},

The main results of this article are an error bound in a norm suited to the problem and in the L 2 L2 -norm. Those bounds are quasi-optimal for the h h -convergence and the p p -convergence. Various formulation choices and penalty functions are theoretically discussed. In particular we show that a penalty function of the shape h 2 p h2p leads to a quasi-optimal convergence of the scheme.

  abstract     = {In this paper we introduce a C 1 C1 spline space over mixed meshes composed of triangles and quadrilaterals, suitable for FEM-based or isogeometric analysis. In this context, a mesh is considered to be a partition of a planar polygonal domain into triangles and/or quadrilaterals. The proposed space combines the Argyris triangle, cf. Argyris et al. (1968), with the C 1 C1 quadrilateral element introduced in Brenner and Sung (2005), Kapl et al. (2020) for polynomial degrees p ≥ 5 p≥5 . The space is assumed to be C 2 C2 at all vertices and C 1 C1 across edges, and the splines are uniquely determined by C 2 C2 -data at the vertices, values and normal derivatives at chosen points on the edges, and values at some additional points in the interior of the elements. The motivation for combining the Argyris triangle element with a recent C 1 C1 quadrilateral construction, inspired by isogeometric analysis, is two-fold: on one hand, the ability to connect triangle and quadrilateral finite elements in a C 1 C1 fashion is non-trivial and of theoretical interest. We provide not only approximation error bounds but also numerical tests verifying the results. On the other hand, the construction facilitates the meshing process by allowing more flexibility while remaining C 1 C1 everywhere. This is for instance relevant when trimming of tensor-product B-splines is performed. In the presented construction we assume to have (bi)linear element mappings and piecewise polynomial function spaces of arbitrary degree p ≥ 5 p≥5 . The basis is simple to implement and the obtained results are optimal with respect to the mesh size for L ∞ L∞ , L 2 L2 as well as Sobolev norms H 1 H1 and H 2 H2 .},

We construct then a preconditioner for the whole system and prove its quasi-robustness with respect to the local mesh-size h h and patch-size H H : precisely the condition number of the preconditioned system is bounded by the square of the logarithm of H ∕ h H∕h .

  abstract     = {We present a displacement-based and a mixed isogeometric collocation (IGA-C) formulation for free-form, three-dimensional, shear-deformable beams with high and rapidly-varying curvature and torsion. When such complex shapes are concerned, the approach used to build the IGA geometric model becomes relevant. Although IGA-C has been so far successfully applied to a wide range of problems, the effects that different parameterization and knot placement techniques may have on the accuracy of collocation-based formulations is still an unexplored field. To fill this gap, primal and mixed formulations are used combining two parameterization methods (chord-length and equally spaced) with two knot placement techniques (uniformly spaced and De Boor). With respect to the space-varying Frenet local frame, we derive the strong form of the governing equations in a compact form through the definition of two matrix operators conveniently used to perform first and second order derivatives of the vector fields involved in the formulations. This approach is very efficient and easy to implement within a collocation-based scheme. Several challenging numerical experiments allow to test the different considered parameterizations and knot placement techniques, revealing in particular that with the primal formulation an equally spaced parameterization is definitively the most recommended choice and it should always be used with an approximation degree of, at least, p = 6 p=6 , although some caution must be adopted when very high Jacobians and small curvatures occur. The same holds for the mixed formulation, with the difference that p = 4 p=4 is enough to yield accurate results.},

A simple and efficient way to obtain these spaces is to apply the multi-level construction of hierarchical splines, that can be used on single-patch domains or in multi-patch domains with C 0 C0 continuity across the patch interfaces. Due to the benefits of higher continuity in isogeometric methods, recent works investigated the construction of spline spaces with global C 1 C1 continuity on two or more patches. In this paper, we show how these approaches can be combined with the hierarchical construction to obtain global C 1 C1 continuous hierarchical splines on two-patch domains.

We show energetic stability for the full Navier–Stokes problem, and we prove convergence and robustness for a linearized model (Oseen flow), under the assumption of a divergence-conforming discretization .

In particular in three-dimensional simulations the computational effort associated with integration can be the critical component of a simulation. A myriad of integration strategies has been proposed over the past years to ameliorate the difficulties associated with integration, but a general optimal integration framework that suits a broad class of engineering problems is not yet available. In this contribution we provide a thorough investigation of the accuracy and computational effort of the octree integration scheme. We quantify the contribution of the integration error using the theoretical basis provided by Strang’s first lemma. Based on this study we propose an error-estimate-based adaptive integration procedure for immersed isogeometric analysis. Additionally, we present a detailed numerical investigation of the proposed optimal integration algorithm and its application to immersed isogeometric analysis using two- and three-dimensional linear elasticity problems.},

Computed tomographic images of 3D printed components provide extensive information about these microstructural variations, such as process-induced porosity, surface roughness, and other undesired morphological discrepancies. Yet, techniques to incorporate these imperfect AM geometries into the numerical material characterization analysis are computationally demanding. In this contribution, an efficient image-to-material-characterization framework using the high-order parallel Finite Cell Method is proposed.

The required expertise and labor efforts have precluded the use of FEA in daily medical practice by orthopedic surgeons for example. Patient-specific analyses of the mechanical response of human bones may have a tremendous impact in clinical practice should they be easily accessible by orthopedic surgeons. Recent scientific advancements such as low dose CT scans, machine learning, and high order FEA which facilitates an inherent methodology for assessing numerical accuracy allow a fully autonomous process for assessing bone strength and fracture risk. This autonomous process, that we shall refer to here as “Autonomous Finite Element” (AFE) analysis, introduces a paradigm shift in the use of FEA. We shall describe herein a novel process that utilizes AFE to produce a patient-specific assessment of bone strength. The process consists of an automatic segmentation of femurs from CT-scans by convolution neural networks, an automatic mesh generation and application of boundary conditions based on anatomical points, a high-order FE analysis with numerical error control, and finally an automatic report with a clear assessment of bone fracture risk. One specific application of AFE is the determination of the risk of fracture for patients with tumors of the femur and whether a prophylactic surgery is needed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first CE accredited AFE application being used by orthopedic surgeons in clinical practice.},

For problems in computational fluid dynamics, the lack of inf–sup stability is reflected by the inability to accurately approximate the pressure field. In this context, inf–sup stability is usually recovered through the enrichment of the velocity space with suitable supremizer functions. The main goal of this work is to propose an alternative approach, which relies on the residual based stabilization techniques customarily employed in the Finite Element literature, such as Brezzi–Pitkaranta, Franca–Hughes, streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin, Galerkin Least Square. In the spirit of offline–online reduced basis computational splitting, two such options are proposed, namely offline-only stabilization and offline–online stabilization . These approaches are then compared to (and combined with) the state of the art supremizer enrichment approach. Numerical results are discussed, highlighting that the proposed methodology allows to obtain smaller reduced basis spaces (i.e., neglecting supremizer enrichment) for which a modified inf–sup stability is still preserved at the reduced order level.},

  abstract     = {The simulation of large structural deformations with the finite element method poses several challenges. The severe distortion of elements may deteriorate the accuracy and robustness of the method and restrict it to smaller deformations than desired. This issue is especially present in the finite cell method (FCM), where complex geometries are discretized with a non-conforming Cartesian grid introducing a fictitious material with very low stiffness. The remeshing strategy presented here improves the robustness at the cost of generating a new Cartesian grid of the deformed geometry at load steps where the element distortion becomes critical. This allows us to use larger load steps and to further deform the structure under consideration. We use radial basis functions to transfer the displacements and the displacement gradients from one mesh to the next one. The method is investigated in combination with a hyperelastic material and exemplary applied to simulate a pore of a foam.},

Note that only problems in linear elasticity are considered in the analysis. It is well-known that the condition number is one factor strongly influencing the number of significant digits for direct solvers or the required iteration count for iterative solution schemes. Therefore, it is important to investigate the effect of the choice of the shape functions and the element distortion on κ ( K ) κ(K) . Based on numerous one- and two-, and three-dimensional examples, these influences are comprehensively studied, and the numerical results are compared with condition number estimates extracted from the literature. Overall, a good agreement is observed for p -FEM, SEM and two-dimensional IGA, while discrepancies are noted for three-dimensional isogeometric elements. These are important findings as theoretical results may be only available for very restricted scenarios, where one-element geometries, constant Jacobi matrices of the element maps, etc. are considered.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, lattice Boltzmann simulation for unsteady shock wave/boundary layer interaction in a shock tube is presented. This kind of problem, which contains the typical characteristics of supersonic viscous flows with shock wave and boundary layer, has rarely been well validated in the lattice Boltzmann community. This leads to few application of lattice Boltzmann method in supersonic flows with boundary layer. Some problems related to numerical dissipation and stability are exposed when simulating shock wave/boundary layer interaction using the conventional compressible lattice Boltzmann approach. The implementations of lattice Boltzmann for this kind of flow are investigated. As a novel problem for the lattice Boltzmann method, three main issues need to be addressed carefully, i.e., lattice Boltzmann model , solving scheme, and boundary treatment. For the first issue, a double-distribution-function compressible lattice Boltzmann model, in which the lattice velocity is studied for the stability in the simulation, is employed since we have demonstrated its feasibility in supersonic viscous flow previously. For the solving scheme, various space discretization methods are tested to enhance numerical performance. Meanwhile, the boundary treatment for the ghost layer is studied. The simulation result by the improved lattice Boltzmann implementation agrees well with the results through Navier–Stokes equations and gas-kinetic scheme reported in previous literatures. This work probes the numerical implementations of lattice Boltzmann method for unsteady shock wave/boundary layer interaction, providing important theoretical support for lattice Boltzmann application in supersonic viscous flows with shock wave and boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we study from a mathematical point of view the drug release and the degradation process in the context of biodegradable intravitreal implants. In particular, two different clinical situations are considered: non-vitrectomized and vitrectomized eyes. In the former case we assume that the vitreous humor is replaced by a saline solution or a silicone oil. In intravitreal space, the intravitreal liquid enters the implant by non-Fickian diffusion causing the degradation of the poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) based implant. Then, drug in the implant dissolves and diffuses out of the polymeric matrix. The transport of drug in the vitreous chamber and retina is modeled by Fickian diffusion and convection generated by the flow of the vitreous humor. In order to numerically solve the system of partial differential equations that define the model, we propose an Implicit–Explicit finite element method that allows for the decoupling of the solution reducing the computational cost of the simulations. Several numerical experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed numerical schemes are also included. The proposed mathematical model may be useful to optimize patient specific treatments in clinical practice.},

It is pointed out that the original free-surface model may encounter some conflicting situations when dealing with some extreme cases, such as adjacent filled/empty interface cells, isolated interface cells, and how to reconstruct distribution functions if too few non-gas cells are available in the neighbourhood region. An alternative reconstruction method based on the extrapolation and the gradient of macroscopic variables is then proposed to tackle these problems. The proposed numerical framework is validated through several test-cases, from which it is shown that the regularization can largely improve the stability of LB simulations of violent free-surface flows such as dam-break flows. In addition, the proposed reconstruction method can help further reduce the spurious pressure noises in regularized LBM. Nevertheless, a more dissipative behaviour has been observed in the viscous standing wave test-case.},

In this paper, we propose a new method that opens a door to solve nonlinear inverse problems for parabolic equations without any initial guess of the true coefficient. This claim is confirmed numerically. The key point of the method is to derive a system of nonlinear elliptic equations for the Fourier coefficients of the solution to the governing equation with respect to a special basis of L 2 L2 . We then solve this system by a predictor–corrector process, in which our computation to obtain the first and second predictors is effective.

The variational method, which constructs the data fidelity term involving the Cauchy distribution by MAP estimator, has been proven to be a successful approach. In this paper, a nonlinear diffusion equation is proposed to deal with it. The main ingredients of the proposed equation are a gray level based diffusivity that estimates the amplitude of the noise and a classical gradient based diffusivity that controls the anisotropic diffusion according to the image’s local structure. The proposed equation has the nondivergence form, and its properties, including the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions, are established by the notion of viscosity solution. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed equation over variational methods in restoring small details of images.},

Both methods are Galerkin methods on polygonal and polyhedral grids for the numerical solution of partial differential equations . Thus, they are highly flexible and particularly efficient in combination with adaptive refinement. Our error estimator computes the distance between the finite element gradient and its post-processed version to obtain an accurate approximation of the true error. The post-processing is realised by local averaging and is therefore easy to implement and fast. Furthermore, we have found points of extraordinary accuracy, so called stress points, on specific regular elements for the BEM-based FEM. We demonstrate that, when sampling these stress points, the recovered gradient becomes superconvergent, which means that it converges at a greater rate than the unprocessed gradient.},

Water balance dynamics of the reservoir are piece-wise deterministic and are driven by a stochastic regime-switching inflow process. The system is controlled to balance among the operation purpose and the internal and downstream environmental conditions. Finding the optimal operation policy of the system reduces to solving an optimality equation with a discontinuous Hamiltonian , which is a system of nonlinear degenerate parabolic (or hyperbolic) equations. We show that the optimality equation has at most one constrained viscosity solution and find the solution explicitly under certain conditions. The model is applied to numerical computation of the operation policy of an existing dam–reservoir system using a high-order finite difference scheme.

  abstract     = {An eigenvalue problem is introduced for the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Stokes equations describing the flow of a viscous and electrically conducting fluid in a duct under the influence of a uniform magnetic field . The solution of the eigenproblem is approximated by using a spectral collocation method that is based on vanishing the residual equation at the collocation points on the physical domain which are chosen to be the Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto points. As the solutions are sought in the physical space , the approximations to the derivatives of the unknowns are directly evaluated. The equations are formulated in the primitive variables , and hence with inclusion of the continuity equation , the discretization of the operator results in a generalized eigenproblem with zero diagonal entries . Therefore, a penalty method is applied to circumvent the degeneracy where a perturbed form of the problem is considered, and a zero mean pressure value is introduced. The numerical prospects of the algorithm are investigated and demonstrated by a number of characteristic tests. The key features of interest are the effects of introducing a magnetic field on the eigenspectrum focusing mainly on the change of the fundamental eigenpairs , and the consequential variation of the eigenstructure with the magnetic field. The mechanisms that underlie these effects are examined by the numerical model proposed, the implications of these effects are presented, and it is shown that the flow field is considerably affected with the introduction of a magnetic field into the physical model.},

Here we apply ESFR schemes to elliptic problems and derive the associated bilinear form for the Poisson equation .

  abstract     = {This paper concerns monolithic and splitting-based iterative procedures for the coupled nonlinear thermo-poroelasticity model problem. The thermo-poroelastic model problem we consider is formulated as a three-field system of PDE’s, consisting of an energy balance equation , a mass balance equation and a momentum balance equation , where the primary variables are temperature, fluid pressure, and elastic displacement. Due to the presence of a nonlinear convective transport term in the energy balance equation, it is convenient to have access to both the pressure and temperature gradients. Hence, we introduce these as two additional variables and extend the original three-field model to a five-field model. For the numerical solution of this five-field formulation, we compare six approaches that differ by how we treat the coupling/decoupling between the flow and/from heat and/from the mechanics, suitable for varying coupling strength between the three physical processes. The approaches have in common a simultaneous application of the so-called L L -scheme, which works both to stabilize iterative splitting as well as to linearize nonlinear problems , and can be seen as a generalization of the Undrained and Fixed-Stress Split algorithms. More precisely, the derived procedures transform a nonlinear and fully coupled problem into a set of simpler subproblems to be solved sequentially in an iterative fashion. We provide a convergence proof for the derived algorithms, and demonstrate their performance through several numerical examples investigating different strengths of the coupling between the different processes.},

  abstract     = {In this work we introduce and analyze a new augmented fully-mixed formulation for the stationary Navier–Stokes/Darcy coupled problem. Our approach employs, on the free-fluid region, a technique previously applied to the stationary Navier–Stokes equations, which consists of the introduction of a modified pseudostress tensor involving the diffusive and convective terms , together with the pressure. In addition, by using the incompressibility condition, the pressure is eliminated, and since the convective term forces the free-fluid velocity to live in a smaller space than usual, we augment the resulting formulation with suitable Galerkin type terms arising from the constitutive and equilibrium equations . On the other hand, in the Darcy region we apply the usual dual-mixed formulation, which yields the introduction of the trace of the porous media pressure as an associated Lagrange multiplier . The latter is connected with the fact that one of the transmission conditions involving mass conservation becomes essential and must be imposed weakly. In this way, we obtain a five-field formulation where the pseudostress and the velocity in the fluid, together with the velocity and the pressure in the porous medium, and the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier , are the corresponding unknowns. The well-posedness analysis is carried out by combining the classical Babuška–Brezzi theory and the Banach fixed-point theorem. A proper adaptation of the arguments exploited in the continuous analysis allows us to state suitable hypotheses on the finite element subspaces ensuring that the associated Galerkin scheme is well-posed and convergent. In particular, Raviart–Thomas elements of lowest order for the pseudostress and the Darcy velocity , continuous piecewise linear polynomials for the free-fluid velocity, piecewise constants for the Darcy pressure, together with continuous piecewise linear elements for the Lagrange multiplier , constitute feasible choices. Finally, we provide several numerical results illustrating the performance of the Galerkin method and confirming the theoretical rates of convergence .},

For such model problems, a certain generalized eigenvalue problem on each subdomain interface is formed to select primal constraints adaptively. In three dimensions , eigenvalue problems are formed on each face or edge nodal equivalence classes. For the case of edges, proposed eigenvalue problems in previous studies are not satisfactory while those for faces perform very effectively. The eigenvalue problems can be enhanced by utilizing prior selected primal constraints. In this paper, this new idea is adopted when forming edge eigenvalue problems and the resulting adaptive BDDC preconditioner is analyzed.

  abstract     = {In this work, a high-order upwind compact finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method (UCDLBM) is developed to efficiently solve viscous incompressible flow problems. A fifth-order upwind compact difference scheme is adopted to discretize the spatial derivatives of the lattice Boltzmann equation , and the third-order total-variation-diminishing Runge–Kutta scheme is utilized for the discretization of the temporal term. Compared to the existing central compact finite-difference lattice Boltzmann method (CFDLBM), the present UCDLBM can prevent non-physical oscillations without filtering due to the natural dissipative property of upwind schemes . Three benchmark problems involving the Taylor–Green vortex problem, the doubly periodic shear layer flow problem and the lid driven square cavity flow problem are numerically solved to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the present method. Numerical results computed are in good agreement with the analytical solution or other available numerical results. And, the present UCDLBM is less time-consuming than the CFDLBM without degenerating the order of accuracy of the numerical solutions.},

  abstract     = {Due to the multidisciplinary nature for the solution of magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) shell structures , developing a novel and accurate computational model is both essential and necessary for the practical engineering. The scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is a semi-analytical technique in which only the surfaces or boundaries of the computational domain need to be discretized, while an analytical formulation can be derived in the radial direction of the surrounding area. These advanced features enable the spatial dimension to be reduced by one, while the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is maintained. In this paper, a novel semi-analytical numerical model based on the SBFEM is developed for the bending analysis of the laminated MEE cylindrical shells under the mechanical or electric/magnetic potential loads. According to the three-dimensional (3D) magneto-electro-elasticity theory, the magneto-electro-mechanical coupling equations and the associated boundary conditions in terms of the mechanical displacement as well as the electrical and magnetical potentials are derived in the scaled boundary coordinate system using the weighted-residual method. The analytical expressions for the generalized displacement and internal nodal force fields are determined by applying the state-space method and have been solved by means of the precise integration technique (PIT). Comparisons between the present numerical results for limiting conditions and solutions available in the published work have been carried out to demonstrate the convergence and accuracy of this approach. At the same time, by utilizing the proposed mechanics, the influences of the aspect ratio and stacking configuration on the through-thickness bending behaviors of the laminated MEE cylindrical shells are studied in detail.},

  abstract     = {Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) occurs at the interface of two fluids, in which the heavier fluid flows at the bottom. In the present numerical work, the KHI was analyzed by solving the modification of two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. To capture the interface, the Cahn–Hilliard equation was implemented into the Navier–Stokes equations. The phenomena around the KHI of two and three-component fluids were investigated numerically by using radial basis function (RBF) combined with the domain decomposition method (DDM) in a primitive variable formulation. Here DDM is able to solve the large scale problem. On the other hand the calculation accuracy decreases with the increase of the number of the subdomains. For the above reason, in the present works, the domain was partitioned into 15 x 15 subdomains in order to reduce the decrease in accuracy due to the domain division. Next, fractional step method was used to solve the modification of the Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical results indicate that the procedure used in the present work can easily handle the KHI problem under the variations of the interface thickness, density ratios, and initial velocity differences. Moreover, the interface evolutions obtained from the present method agree well with those of the finite difference method. The effects of the interface thickness, density ratio and magnitude of velocity difference on the KHI were also investigated. The decrease of the interface thickness produces a non-smooth concentration profile, and the increase of the interface thickness produces too much surface diffusion. It was found also that the increase of the density ratio reduces the growth of KHI. The interface rolls up are strongly affected by the initial horizontal velocity difference. Finally, the present study also shows that the RBF method is a reliable method to solve the KHI on the complex domains.},

The IGABEM boundary-domain integral equation is derived underlying the divergence theorem of Gauss and the Laplace equation. The non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) basis used in the CAD/CAE industries is applied to approximate both the boundary of problem domain and the unknown physical quantities, and the radial integration method (RIM) is employed to deal with the domain integrals induced by the non-homogeneous thermal conductivity and the internal heat source. The present boundary-domain integral equation is firstly divided into several NURBS patches, upon which the IGABEM can be further defined. The main advantage of the NURBS basis in comparison with the standard piecewise polynomial basis is that there is almost no error in the boundary approximation with IGABEM, which plays a significant role in controlling the accuracy of numerical calculation. Four numerical examples consisting of square regions with cubic and exponential thermal conductivities (with or without internal heat source), annulus region with constant and quadratic conductivities as well as complex region with varying thermal conductivity and complex heat source are provided. The accuracy and convergence of the proposed method are assessed by comparing the present solution with the existing results obtained by several other researchers or ANSYS results, and excellent performance is achieved.},

First, we prove that the present model has a unique global weak solution using Banach’s fixed point theorem. Then we apply our model over a set of gray level images to illustrate the image denoising ability of the proposed model.

To overcome the troublesome pressure oscillation in the Stokes problem , a new simple formulation of boundary condition for the Stokes problem is proposed. This numerical approach only adds a mixed boundary condition , the projections of the momentum equation on the boundary outward normal vector, to the Stokes equations , without any other change to the governing equations. The proposed formulation can be easily discretized by the GFDM. The GFDM is evolved from the Taylor series expansions and moving-least squares approximation, and the derivative expressed of unknown variables as linear combinations of function values of neighboring nodes. Numerical examples are utilized to verify the feasibility of the proposed GFDM scheme not only for the Stokes problem, but also for more involved and general problems, such as the Poiseuille flow , the Couette flow and the Navier–Stokes equations in low-Reynolds-number regime. Moreover, numerical results and comparisons show that using the GFDM to solve the proposed formulation of the Stokes equations is more accurate than the classical formulation of the pressure Poisson equation .},

  abstract     = {It is known that for exterior acoustics the domain-based finite element method always encounters the accuracy loss for high wavenumbers and the difficulty in dealing with the Sommerfeld radiation condition. In this work, by using the polynomial and radial bases with specific node-selection schemes, the point interpolation method with the generalized gradient smoothing technique is employed to improve the accuracy for acoustic computations. The appropriately softened acoustical stiffness of the discrete model is constructed based on the edge-based smoothing domains via the gradient smoothing technique. In addition, the perfectly matched layer technique enables the smoothed point interpolation method to investigate exterior acoustics. The complex coordinate transformation is utilized to determine the proper parameters for the perfectly matched layer through theoretical and numerical analyses. Several typical acoustic problems are analyzed, revealing that better accuracy is obtained by the present method compared with the finite element method, especially for high wavenumbers.},

  abstract     = {In the spirit of the “Principle of Equipresence” introduced by Truesdell &amp; Toupin, The Classical Field Theories (1960), we use the full version of the viscous stress tensor ν ∇ u + ∇ u T − 2 3 ∇ ⋅ u I ν∇u+∇uT−23∇⋅uI which was originally derived for compressible flows , instead of the classical incompressible stress tensor ν ∇ u ν∇u . (Note that, here ν ν is the dynamic viscosity coefficient, and u u is the velocity field .) In our approach, the divergence-free constraint for the viscous stress term is not enforced ahead of discretization . Instead, our formulation allows the scheme itself to “choose” a consistent way to interpret the divergence-free constraint: i.e., the divergence-free constraint is interpreted (or enforced) in a consistent fashion in both the mass conservation equation and the stress tensor term (in the momentum equation). Furthermore, our approach preserves the original symmetrical properties of the stress tensor, e.g. its rotational invariance , and it remains physically correct in the context of compressible flows. As a result, our approach facilitates versatility and code reuse. In this paper, we introduce our approach and establish some important mathematical properties for the resulting class of finite element schemes. More precisely, for general mixed methods, which are not necessarily pointwise divergence-free, we establish the existence of a new norm induced by the full, viscous bilinear form . Thereafter, we prove the coercivity of the viscous bilinear form and the semi-coercivity of a convective trilinear form. In addition, we demonstrate L2-stability of the discrete velocity fields for the general class of methods and (by deduction) the H(div)-conforming methods. Finally, we run some numerical experiments to illustrate the behavior of the versatile mixed methods, and we make careful comparisons with a conventional H(div)-conforming scheme.},

In this work, a finite difference/Legendre spectral method is presented for the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional (2D) distributed-order time-fractional cable equation, where the finite difference method is employed in the temporal discretization and Legendre spectral method is adopted in the spatial discretization . The midpoint quadrature rule is used to approximate the distributed-order, such that the considered equation could be transformed into a multi-term fractional equation. The stability and convergence analysis of the proposed scheme is established, which illustrates that the numerical solution converges to the exact solution with order O ( τ 2 + σ 2 + N − s ) O(τ2+σ2+N−s) , where τ τ , σ σ , N N are the time step size, the step length in the approximation of the distributed-order and the polynomial degree , respectively.

In this work, a non-overlapping Schwarz method is constructed with the unsteady simulation of de-icing as the targeted application. To do so, optimized coupling coefficients are first derived for the one dimensional unsteady heat equation with linear boundary conditions and for the steady heat equation with non-linear boundary conditions. The choice of these coefficients is shown to guarantee the convergence of the method. Using a linearization of the boundary conditions, the method is then extended to the case of a general unsteady heat conduction problem. The method is tested on simple cases and the convergence properties are assessed theoretically and numerically.

The exact solution to the unsteady discrete Stokes equations is explicitly constructed with the help of the null-space of the discrete divergence operator and a matrix exponential . In practical implementation, the explicit use of the null-space of the discrete divergence operator is avoided. Therefore, the main workload of solving the unsteady discrete Stokes equations is the matrix exponential vector product . The matrix exponential vector product is written in terms of an integral relation, which is approximated by a linear combination of values of the integrand evaluated at a select number of complex numbers.

As a result, the proposed rules can be used for both quadrature and interpolation purposes. Furthermore, these rules are fully symmetric, as they remain invariant under affine transformations (rotations and reflections) of the pentatope back to itself. In addition, these rules are optimal, in the sense that the truncation error associated with each rule has been minimized via a rigorous optimization procedure .

We only use the information defined on a hierarchy of nested central spatial stencils without introducing any equivalent multi-resolution representation once again. For the shallow flow problems with smooth or discontinuous bed, we combine with the well-balanced procedure developed by Xing and Shu (2005) for balancing the flux gradients and the source terms, and then the new fifth-order well-balanced multi-resolution WENO scheme (Zhu and Shu, 2018) could satisfy the exact C-property for still stationary solutions , maintain the fifth-order accuracy in smooth regions, and keep essentially non-oscillatory property in non-smooth regions. Compared with the classical well-balanced WENO schemes (Xing and Shu, 2005), the new features of this finite difference well-balanced multi-resolution WENO scheme is its simplicity and hierarchical structure in obtaining higher-order accuracy and its linear weights could be arbitrarily chosen with one requirement that their summation is one. It is the first time that a series of unequal-sized hierarchical central spatial stencils are used in designing finite difference well-balanced WENO scheme for solving shallow water equations. This new well-balanced WENO scheme is simple to construct and can be easily implemented to arbitrary high-order accuracy and in higher dimensions . Some benchmark numerical examples are performed to illustrate the good performances of this new well-balanced WENO scheme which could get high-order accuracy, keep exact C-property, sustain good convergence property , and obtain sharp shock transitions in the whole computational field.},

  abstract     = {Improvement in thermal and electric conductivity is the basic requirement of many nano-electrochemical systems. These systems in material science, energy management , and chemical processing can be efficiently handled with the presence of carbon nanotubes in the base fluid. Basically nanofluid is used to act as coolant with enhanced thermal conductivity in equipment such as radiators, heat exchangers , and electronic systems. Transfer of heat in nanofluids has been discussed by many researchers with ordinary derivative but here we have considered fractional derivatives to achieve more control on heat transfer. Here in this communication, we have discussed two-directional viscoelastic fluid flow with suspended carbon nanotubes. SWCNTs as well as MWCNTs are considered as nanoparticles in the base fluid. In order to achieve control of the flow and heat transfer, flow problem is modeled with Caputo fractional derivatives α α , β β along with fractional momentum and thermal relaxation times λ α λα and λ 1 β λ1β . In the electrically conducting flow regime, electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and Ohmic heating is appropriately handled in energy equation via Ohm’s law. Governing fractional PDEs are nonlinear in nature and solved numerically with finite-difference discretization along with L 1 L1 algorithm. Simulated results of velocity and temperature are noted for both the SWCNTs and MWCNTs. Velocity and temperature profiles for MWCNTs remained at a higher level when compared to SWCNTs for all the values of physical parameters . The presence of fractional derivatives, SWCNTs and MWCNTs made the results valuable that can be used to efficiently handle similar thermal management problems in engineering such as to achieve thermal control in the vehicle engines, refrigerators, grinders, boilers, chillers, and heat exchangers.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a machine learning based model for control of local bioaerosol concentration via a forced corner flow with optimal energy efficiency in an indoor environment. A recirculation zone determined by the inlet flow rate traps particles partially with one or more vortices around the corner. The profile of the recirculation zone is then determined mathematically by the minimum net mass flux principle with a grid search technique. Subsequently, the variation of the recirculation zone profile is then learned through a neural network (NN), in which data is collected from the simulation by the Eulerian–Lagrangian scheme. Moreover, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is implemented to achieve an optimal profile of the recirculation zone with optimal energy consumption, based on the linearized NN model. Finally, the proposed NN-MPC is implemented for simulation of removing the local bioaerosol from an indoor corner through a flow-rate-controllable airflow from ventilation outlet located on the ceiling.},

We demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of the fully-discrete explicit locally entropy-stable solver for a set of test cases of increasing complexity.},

  abstract     = {Under-resolved direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the wake of a single-square-grid (SSG) are conducted using the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM), with varying degrees of partial moment entropic stabilisation. Turbulence statistics along the grid centreline show satisfactory agreement with literature, greatly outperforming a control study employing the single-relaxation-time Smagorinsky LES model with equivalent resolution. The coarse-resolution entropic LBM simulations are able to capture the qualitative behaviour of the anisotropic and non-homogeneous​ turbulence generated by the SSG, indicating possible extension of the capability of the entropic lattice-Boltzmann method to simulate more exotic forms of turbulence beyond those reported by the majority of current studies. However, in the extreme near field of the single-square-grid, pseudo-compressibility effects, even at a low lattice Mach number, undermine LBM predictions for turbulence which is generated by action of the pressure Hessian — this is found to be an issue for all models studied, and not a numerical artefact of the entropic stabilisation. With regard to the action of the entropic stabiliser, a comparison of models employing differing degrees of stabilisation on higher-order natural moments suggest that the trace of the stress tensor should not be subject to entropic control for better accuracy in turbulence prediction.},

Furthermore, the well-posedness of the associated augmented formulation along with a priori error bounds for the discrete scheme also were established. We now propose reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori error estimates for a computable approximation of the virtual solution associated to the aforementioned problem. The resulting error estimator is fully computable from the degrees of freedom of the solutions and applies on very general polygonal meshes. For the analysis we make use of a global inf–sup condition, Helmholtz decomposition , local approximation properties of interpolation operators and inverse inequalities together with localization arguments based on bubble functions.

Further, an FE–BE combined technique is utilized to prepare a generic computer code (MATLAB environment) for the numerical prediction via the proposed mathematical formulation.

In this regard, the structural system equation is derived through Hamilton’s principle and the Helmholtz wave equation for the computation of acoustic responses. The performance of the proposed scheme is established initially through the convergence and the corresponding validation studies. The comparison cases are made with the available published benchmark frequency (free vibration) as well as the acoustic data. Appropriate numbers of numerical examples are solved to draw the meaningful inferences of various factors to show the significant influences on the acoustic radiation responses of the curved sandwich panel type of structural components.

  abstract     = {The classical dual mixed finite element method for flow simulations is based on H ( div , Ω ) H(div,Ω) conforming approximation spaces for the flux, which guarantees continuous normal components on element interfaces, and discontinuous approximations in L 2 ( Ω ) L2(Ω) for the pressure. However, stability and convergence can only be obtained for compatible approximation spaces. Stabilized finite element methods may provide an alternative stable procedure to avoid this kind of delicate balance. The main purpose of this paper is to present a high-order finite element methodology to solve the Darcy problem based on the combination of an unconditionally stable mixed finite element method with a hierarchical methodology for the construction of finite dimensional subspaces of H ( div , Ω ) H(div,Ω) and H 1 ( Ω ) H1(Ω) . The chosen stabilized method is free of mesh dependent stabilization parameters and allows for the use of different high order finite element approximations for the flux and the pressure variables, without requiring any compatibility constraint, as required in mixed methods for these problems. Convergence studies are presented comparing the numerical solutions obtained for different approximation orders on quadrilateral elements with the ones given by classical mixed formulation with Raviart–Thomas elements.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, we explore mechanical response of a radially constrained elastic porous shell during the passage of charged fluid (electrically conducting fluid). A constant magnetic field is exposed on the binary mixture of fluid and solid. The governing dynamics involved in the motion of fluid as well as solid deformation was based on the rate of applied compression at the inner radius of the shell. A nonlinear diffusion equation applicable to planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometry was developed for the porosity along with informal integral boundary conditions on both the extremities. An equation for solid deformation is derived in the form of an integral equation for planar, cylindrical, and spherical geometry. The governing system of equations is solved numerically using the method of lines for the transient case whereas an exact solution is provided for the steady-state problem. In the case of linear permeability, an excellent agreement is noticed between both the solutions. The comparison of the fluid flow through the planar, cylindrical, and spherical shell is used to explore the process of fluid flow affected by the geometrical constraint. Graphical results highlight the influence of different physical parameters on the porosity and solid displacement. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the fluid flow through a thick and thin-walled porous shell is also presented.},

In this study, a new type of relaxation model is proposed to resolve two shortcomings of the existing relaxation models: the constant propagation speed of sound, and the collapse of delta shock waves in multidimensional problems. The proposed model seeks a strictly hyperbolic system of equations without any special consideration for the proper values of the propagation speed of sound. Numerical tests showed that the proposed model can accurately describe the behavior of the PGD equations, in particular, the occurrence of delta shock waves and vacuum states in a multidimensional problem.},

Together with previous results on upper bounds (majorants) for one of the cost functionals, both minorants and majorants lead to two-sided estimates of functional type for the optimal control problem. Both upper and lower bounds are derived for the second new cost functional subject to the same parabolic PDE-constraints, but where the target is a desired gradient. The time-periodic optimal control problems are discretized by the multiharmonic finite element method leading to large systems of linear equations having a saddle point structure. The derivation of preconditioners for the minimal residual method for the new optimization problem is discussed in more detail. Finally, several numerical experiments for both optimal control problems are presented confirming the theoretical results obtained.

  abstract     = {The modeling of turbulent flows is relevant in many engineering applications and, is an active field of research on numerical methods. Convergence and stability of proposed formulations are crucial to predict transitional flows from laminar to turbulent flows. In this work, a recently developed stabilized finite element formulation is used as a powerful tool to describe such kind of problems. The essential point of the formulation is the time dependent nature of the subscales and, contrary to residual based formulations, the introduction of two velocity subscale components. The theoretical rate of convergence of the method is verified numerically using linear and quadratic equal-order finite element discretizations. To this end, a standard convergence test of L 2 L2 -norm is presented where the computed solutions are compared when manufactured solutions are imposed at Gauss-point level. Moreover, the Hopf bifurcation is studied for two well-known benchmark problems: flow past a cylinder and the three-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow. For the flow past a cylinder case, the Hopf bifurcation is verified using dynamic subscales and is assessed so that they do not disturb the solution. In particular, a dominant convective problem ( Re = 4000 Re=4000 ) is solved using both the quasistatic and dynamic versions of the method, evaluating the performance of each one in the quality of the solution and in the CPU time needed to obtain a converged solution. For the 3D lid-driven cavity flow problem, the Hopf bifurcation is determined using two different boundary conditions, analyzing their effect on the dynamics of the problem and on the thickness and shape of the boundary layer. The final test case is the turbulent 3D lid-driven cavity problem ( Re = 12000 Re=12000 ), where velocity profiles are compared with experimental, LES and DNS reference solutions. Additionally, pressure and velocity spectra are shown at certain representative points of the domain, as well as phase diagrams, correlation function graphs, the Poincaré map, and the Lyapunov exponent, typical mathematical tools used in dynamical system analysis. From the results, the method is robust and accurate for all the numerical tests both in viscous dominant problems as in dominant convective ones.},

  abstract     = {Utility-indifference approach is a useful approach to be adopted for pricing financial derivatives in an incomplete market and is an ongoing hot research topic in quantitative finance. One interesting question associated with this approach is whether or not it renders to the same option prices, degenerately, when the market becomes infinitesimally close to a complete market. The answer for such a question has been provided for European-style options as there is a well-documented theoretical proof in Davis et al. (1993). However, a theoretical proof for the case of pricing American-style options is unavailable at this stage and the answer for this question must be at least numerically confirmed before it can be comfortably used to price American-style options in incomplete markets. The contribution of this paper is to provide such a numerical verification.},

Therefore we consider that these gradient matrices D x u , D y u Dxu,Dyu also are (approximately) low-rank, and also verify it by numerical test and theoretical analysis. We propose a model called compressive total variation (CTV) to characterize the sparsity and low-rank prior knowledge of an image. In order to solve the proposed model, we design a concrete algorithm with provably convergence, which is based on inertial proximal ADMM. The performance of the proposed model is tested for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction, image denoising and image deblurring. The proposed method not only recovers edges of the image but also preserves fine details of the image. And our model is much better than the existing regularization models based on the TGV, Shearlet-TGV, ℓ 1 − α ℓ 2 ℓ1−αℓ2 TV and BM3D in test for images with piecewise constant regions. And it visibly improves the performances of TV, ℓ 1 − α ℓ 2 ℓ1−αℓ2 TV and TGV, and is comparable to Shearlet-TGV in test for natural images.},

  abstract     = {In this article we consider the numerical approximation of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation. One of the main challenges of designing a numerical method for this problem is that boundary layers occurring in the convection-dominated case can lead to non-physical oscillations in the numerical approximation, often referred to as Gibbs phenomena. The idea of this article is to consider the approximation problem as a residual minimization in dual norms in L q Lq -type Sobolev spaces, with 1 &lt; q &lt; ∞ 1&amp;lt;q&amp;lt;∞ . We then apply a non-standard, non-linear Petrov–Galerkin discretization, that is applicable to reflexive Banach spaces such that the space itself and its dual are strictly convex. Similar to discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin methods, this method is based on minimizing the residual in a dual norm. Replacing the intractable dual norm by a suitable discrete dual norm gives rise to a non-linear inexact mixed method. This generalizes the Petrov–Galerkin framework developed in the context of discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin methods to more general Banach spaces. For the convection–diffusion–reaction equation, this yields a generalization of a similar approach from the L 2 L2 -setting to the L q Lq -setting. A key advantage of considering a more general Banach space setting is that, in certain cases, the oscillations in the numerical approximation vanish as q q tends to 1, as we will demonstrate using a few simple numerical examples.},

Then the pseudospectral method is utilized for spatial discretization . As a result, the fully discrete scheme has several advantages: second-order accurate in time, spectrally accurate in space, uniquely solvable, mass preserving, and unconditionally energy stable. Rigorous proofs are given, along with several numerical results to verify the theoretical results, and to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

In particular, it is stable for the response variable and the Lagrange multiplier , but not for the material property field. This lack of stability implies that we are unable to prove optimal convergence with mesh refinement for the overall problem. We overcome this difficulty by adding to the saddle point problem a residual-based term that provides sufficient stability, and prove optimal convergence in an energy-like norm. We verify these estimates through simple numerical examples .

Despite a number of simplifying assumptions, the model is comprehensive enough to capture the major phenomena that govern the behaviour of a real fire — namely the pyrolysation of wood; the combustion of a mono-phase medium composed of premixed gas of fuel and air; and the heat transferred by conduction, convection, radiation, mass diffusion and transport due to atmospheric wind. The model consists of a system of coupled partial differential equations, one ensuring the balance of enthalpy, and a set of equations representing the mass formation of each chemical species involved in the combustion. Dimensionality reduction is sought by modelling these three-dimensional phenomena in a two-dimensional space, which has been achieved by means of heat-sources and heat-sinks to account for the third dimension in the energy balance equation. Once calibrated with a widely used non-physics-based commercial wildfire simulator, the proposed Fire Pro pagation M odel for F ast simulations (FireProM-F) is tested, returning similar predictions in terms of the size and shape of the burnt area although similarity deteriorates for windy conditions. FireProM-F has the added benefit of being both physics-based and computationally inexpensive so that its interaction with fire suppressants may also be modelled in the future and simulated in real time.},

  abstract     = {This work presents two new alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes for solving parabolic interface problems in two and three dimensions. First, the ghost fluid method (GFM) is adopted for the first time in the literature to treat interface jumps in the ADI framework, which results in symmetric and tridiagonal finite difference matrices in each ADI step. The proposed GFM-ADI scheme achieves a first order of accuracy in both space and time, as confirmed by numerical experiments involving complex interface shapes and spatial–temporal dependent jumps. The GFM-ADI scheme also maintains the ADI efficiency — the computational complexity for each time step scales as O(N) for a total degree of freedom N in higher dimensions. Second, a new matched interface and boundary (MIB) scheme is constructed, which downgrades the quadratic polynomial bases in the existing second order MIB to linear ones. Interestingly, the resulting MIB-ADI or mADI scheme produces the same finite difference matrices as the GFM-ADI scheme in all dimensions. Hence, the mADI scheme can be regarded as an improvement of the GFM, because it calculates tangential jumps which are omitted in the GFM. Consequently, the present mADI scheme is constantly more accurate than the GFM-ADI in all numerical examples, while keeping the same computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the mADI scheme is semi-implicit due to tangential jump approximations, while the GFM-ADI scheme is fully implicit without tangential corrections. Thus, the GFM-ADI scheme could be more stable than the mADI scheme when a huge contrast is presented in diffusion coefficients.},

(2018)) and moving boundary methods (MBM) (Bouzidi et al. (2001), Lallemand and Luo (2003), Yu et al. (2003), Ginzburg et al. (2008) and Filippova and Hänel (1998), Mei et al. (1999, 2000)), are investigated. First, the Galilean invariance of aerodynamic coefficients obtained by each scheme is examined. The Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) LBM is utilized to simulate an eccentrically positioned cylinder in a transient Couette flow. In addition, various refill methods for MBM and volume approximation techniques for PSM are tested. Besides different error norms and a grid independence study of each method, the Galilean invariance violating frequencies are studied as well. These error calculations are used to choose a representative for each class to simulate vortex shedding. The VIV test case describes a transverse oscillation of a cylinder in a freestream at a Reynolds number of 100. Both free and forced cylinder oscillations are examined to study known phenomena as lock-in and lock-out zones. The results of MBM and PSM are in good agreement to literature values and prove the suitability for VIV simulations.},

  abstract     = {This article describes a fast meshless technique, the direct meshless local Petrov–Galerkin (DMLPG) method, for identifying a control function in two-dimensional parabolic inverse PDEs. The DMLPG method is a truly meshless technique that directly approximates the local weak forms. In DMLPG, the local integrations are done over the low-degree polynomial basis functions instead of the complicated shape functions. Thus, the mass and stiff matrices are constructed by integration against polynomials. This feature overcomes the main drawback of meshless methods in comparison with the finite element methods (FEM) and significantly increases the computational efficiency in comparison with the other meshless weak form methods. In this paper, we apply the DMLPG and MLPG methods for solving two-dimensional parabolic inverse PDEs on regular and irregular domains. These methods are compared with each other and the superiority of the DMLPG over the classical MLPG is demonstrated. The numerical results confirm the good efficiency of the DMLPG method for solving inverse problems especially coefficient inverse problems. Finally, we will conclude that the DMLPG method can be considered as an attractive alternative to existing meshless weak form methods in solving inverse problems.},

Since the proposed model as the classic ℓ p ℓp problem unifies two classes of optimization problems such as the nonconvex and nonsmooth problem when p ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) p∈(0,1) , and the convex and smooth problem when p ∈ ( 1 , 2 ) p∈(1,2) , it is generally challenging to find a ready algorithmic framework to solve it.

  abstract     = {This research paper introduces a robust, efficient and stabilized midpoint quadrature to generate element stiffness matrices for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements in finite element method (FEM). This new quadrature is established based on Passive Richardson extrapolation which has the inherent ability to stabilize and improve the accuracy of the extrapolated results. The new quadrature includes a simple artificial stabilizing function with Gauss one-point quadrature (1GP) as an anti-hourglass effect. For the first approximation , the 1GP (sampling point to be considered at origin (0,0)) is done to evaluate element matrices (thermal conductivity matrices, capacitance matrices etc.,) in the 4-square element ( [-2, 2] x [-2, 2] ) in the ( ξ ξ , η η ) plane. As a stabilizing function, sampling points are considered to be either at the center of the four element edges or center of the four quadrants in the reference square element with appropriate constant weighting functions . For hexahedral elements also, the element stiffness coefficients are calculated only in the center of the element and center of all the octants of the reference cubic element ([-2, 2] x [-2, 2] x [-2, 2]), the proposed method deals mostly with integer variables and sampling at (0,0,0), whereas Gauss quadrature uses lengthy float variables corresponding to irrational numbers in terms of decimals in the stiffness matrix calculations, thus consuming time. A number of standard example problems are demonstrated to assess the efficiency of the proposed method. The results of all the numerical examples are found to be in good agreement with the exact results and conventional Gauss quadrature results.},

It is difficult to model flow with dense suspended particles because there are not enough fluid nodes surrounding each particle to apply many existing algorithms, and mass leakage due to interpolated bounce-back is more significant when dealing with many particles. We propose a new curved-boundary treatment and fresh-node initialization scheme, both of which are still effective when two particles get close to contact. We further propose a method to calculate the hydrodynamic interaction accurately when two solid particles get very close to each other without leaving any fluid node between their surfaces. An easy redistributing method is developed to fix mass leakage resulting from curved boundaries. To make the algorithm more stable, we combine implicit particle-velocity updating and Galilean-invariant momentum exchange. We validate the second-order accuracy of this curved-boundary method by channel flow, and other simulations are carried out to show that this model is more accurate and stable in dealing with particle particle interaction. Finally, simulations of magnetic particle flows are conducted to show that this model is suitable for dense suspended particles.},

In the analysis, we adopt a transform matrix M M constructed by natural moments in the evolution equation, and the result of ABB boundary scheme is consistent with the existing work of orthogonal matrix M M . We also find that the discrete effect does not rely on the choice of transform matrix, and obtain a relation to determine some of the relaxation-time parameters which can be used to eliminate the numerical slip completely under some assumptions. In this relation, the weight coefficient is considered as an adjustable parameter which makes the parameter adjustment more flexible. The relaxation factors associated with second moments can be used to eliminate the numerical slip of ABB boundary scheme and BB boundary scheme while the numerical slip cannot be eliminated of NEE boundary scheme. Furthermore, we extend the relations to complex-valued CDE, several numerical examples are used to test the relations.},

  abstract     = {We design and analyze a new finite element discretization technique based on iterative two-grid methods for semilinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). We first present an iterative two-grid method that just applies the classical two-grid for semilinear elliptic PDEs in a successive fashion, namely, to solve a semilinear problem on the coarse space and then to solve a symmetric positive definite problem on the fine space. Thus, we only need to deal with semilinear problems in the coarse space in the first algorithm. Secondly, we replace the semilinear term by using the corresponding first order Taylor expansion in the second iterative two-grid. We provide the error estimates for the second iterative algorithm and present numerical experiments to show the efficiency of our methods.},

In this method, the temporal variable is discretized by means of Crank–Nicolson scheme and the spatial variable is discretized by means of quartic B-spline collocation approach. The discretization is based on uniform mesh. We prove that the method is fourth-order convergent with respect to space variable and second-order convergent with respect to time variable in the maximum norm. Stability of the method is analyzed. Numerical experiment is carried out to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the method. It is shown that the rates of convergence predicted theoretically are same as that obtained numerically and the method is unconditionally stable. The approximate solution corresponding to the present method has been compared with the analytical result. Moreover, our results have been compared with those obtained by other methods.

We consider an inner–outer preconditioning strategy, i.e., the preconditioner is applied through an iterative solver at the inner level. The preconditioner is defined as a H H -matrix representation of the system matrix with a given accuracy. We investigate the influence of various parameters of the preconditioner, i.e., the H H -matrix accuracy, the GMRES threshold and the maximum number of iterations of the inner solver. Different numerical results are presented to compare the efficiency of the preconditioner with respect to the unpreconditioned reference system .

The algorithm is developed without the aid of finite difference method to preserve the accuracy of the Legendre wavelets. In numerical experiments, time dependent 1D, 2D and 3D problems are considered to check the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. A comparison is made with the analytical and numerical solutions available in the literature.

Typically, the design of solvers for isogeometric discretizations that are robust with respect to the polynomial degree is a challenging task. Here, we achieve such robustness by using multiplicative Schwarz methods as smoothers within the multigrid algorithm. The design of the proposed solver is also supported by a local Fourier analysis (LFA), which allows us to choose appropriately the size of the block in the smoother depending on the polynomial degree of the discretization. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed multigrid method is demonstrated through numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional cases.},

  abstract     = {We consider the numerical method for fractional diffusion problems which is based on an extension to a mixed boundary value problem for a local operator in a higher dimensional space. We observe that, when this problem is discretized using tensor product spaces as is commonly done, the solution can be very well approximated by low-rank tensors; we provide some analysis to support this observation. This fact motivates us to apply iterative low-rank approximation algorithms in order to efficiently solve this extended problem. In particular, we employ a recently proposed greedy Tucker approximation method as well as a more classical greedy rank one update method. Throughout, all objects of interest are kept in suitable low-rank approximations, which dramatically reduces the required amount of memory compared to the full formulation of the extended problem. Our approach can be used for general, non-structured space discretizations . If the space discretization itself has tensor product structure, we can further decompose the problem in order to deal with even lower-dimensional objects. We also note that the approach can be directly applied to higher-order discretizations both in space and the extended variable. A further contribution of our work is a rank one version of a diagonal preconditioner which can mitigate the severe ill-conditioning of the extended problem arising due to mesh grading and singularity of the coefficient. This preconditioner can be realized using a simple pre- and postprocessing step and does not affect the computational effort of our algorithm. In several numerical examples , we demonstrate the convergence behavior of the proposed methods. In particular, the Tucker approximation approach requires only a few iterations in order to reach the discretization error in all tested settings.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a number of numerical methods for the solution of fractional Laplace and, more generally, fractional diffusion problems have been proposed. The approaches are quite diverse and include, among others, the use of best uniform rational approximations , quadrature for Dunford–Taylor-like integrals, finite element approaches for a localized elliptic extension into a space of increased dimensions, and time stepping methods for a parabolic reformulation of the fractional differential equation . A systematic comparison, both theoretical and experimental, of these approaches has thus far been lacking. A main contribution of the present work is the observation that all approaches mentioned above can, in fact, be interpreted as realizing different rational approximations of a univariate function over the spectrum of the original (non-fractional) diffusion operator . While this is obvious for some of the methods, it is a new result in particular for extension-based and time stepping approaches . This observation allows us to cast all described methods into a unified theoretical and computational framework, which has a number of benefits. Theoretically, it enables us to develop new convergence proofs for several of the studied methods, clarifies similarities and differences between the approaches, suggests how to design new and improved methods, and allows a direct comparison of the relative performance of the various methods. Practically, it provides a single, simple to implement, efficient and fully parallel algorithm for the realization of all studied methods; for instance, this immediately yields a fast and memory-efficient way of realizing all tensor product extension methods and lets us parallelize the otherwise inherently sequential time stepping approach. Finally, we present a detailed numerical study comparing all investigated methods for various fractional exponents and draw conclusions from the results. The comparison is made fair by the central insight that the computational effort of all these methods depends only on a single parameter , the degree of the underlying rational approximation. As a point of comparison, we also test a simple rational approximation method based on a black-box direct rational approximation algorithm which performs very well in practice.},

  abstract     = {The paper is devoted to the numerical solution of algebraic systems of the type ( A α + q I ) u = f (Aα+qI)u=f , 0 &lt; α 0 q&amp;gt;0 , u , f ∈ R N u,f∈RN , where A A is a symmetric and positive definite matrix . We assume that A A is obtained by finite difference approximation of a second order diffusion problem in Ω ⊂ R d Ω⊂Rd , d = 1 , 2 d=1,2 so that A α + q I Aα+qI approximates the related fractional diffusion–reaction operator or could be a result of a time-stepping procedure in solving time-dependent sub-diffusion problems. We also assume that a method of optimal complexity for solving linear systems with matrices A + c I A+cI , c ≥ 0 c≥0 is available. We analyze and study numerically a class of solution methods based on the best uniform rational approximation (BURA) of a certain scalar function in the unit interval. The first such method, originally proposed in Harizanov et al. (2018) for numerical solution of fractional-in-space diffusion problems, was based on the BURA r α ( ξ ) rα(ξ) of ξ 1 − α ξ1−α in [ 0 , 1 ] [0,1] through scaling of the matrix A A by its largest eigenvalue . Then the BURA of t − α t−α in [ 1 , ∞ ) [1,∞) is given by t − 1 r α ( t ) t−1rα(t) and correspondingly, A − 1 r α ( A ) A−1rα(A) is used as an approximation of A − α A−α . Further, this method was improved in Harizanov et al. (2019) using the same concept but by scaling the matrix A A by its smallest eigenvalue . In this paper we consider the BURA r α ( ξ ) rα(ξ) of 1 ∕ ( ξ − α + q ) 1∕(ξ−α+q) for ξ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] ξ∈(0,1] . Then we define the approximation of ( A α + q I ) − 1 (Aα+qI)−1 as r α ( A − α ) rα(A−α) . We also propose an alternative method that uses BURA of ξ α ξα to produce certain uniform rational approximation (URA) of 1 ∕ ( ξ − α + q ) 1∕(ξ−α+q) . Comprehensive numerical experiments are used to demonstrate the computational efficiency and robustness of the new BURA and URA methods.},

The main goal is to consider two different approaches to construct efficient high order time stepping schemes for the implementation of the Cauchy problem method (Vabishchevich, 2015). The first approach is based on a solution of the related time-dependent PDE , and the second approach is based on diagonal Padé approximations to (1+x)−α when the relation of the solution on two times levels is used. The second and fourth order approximations are constructed by both approaches. In order to increase the accuracy of approximations the graded time grid is constructed which compensates the singular behavior of the solution for t close to 0. Results of numerical experiments are presented, they agree well with the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {There are three criteria when we model with phase-field equations. The first one is the evolution of phase separation. The second one is energy dissipation law. The last one is whether we have the law of conservation of mass or not. If we minimize the Ginzburg–Landau free-energy functional, the kinetics of phase separation inherently follows. However, the other properties such as energy dissipation and mass conservation are more difficult to model. Hitherto, there have been a few proposals to conserve mass using the Allen–Cahn (AC) equation, but we do not have the energy dissipation law in these models when considered in light of local effects of mass-correction. For the reasons, certain researchers still prefer to use the Cahn–Hilliard equation, e.g. biharmonic equation instead of using the Allen–Cahn equation when we consider a mass conserving case. This paper is concerned with numerical solutions of the AC equation in the mass-conserving space, where the solution is corrected at each iteration for mass conservation. We introduce two different methods for solving the conservative AC equation with periodic boundary conditions. In this work, we have the AC equation in common, but use two different mass correction operators. Note that both of mass correction operators satisfy the discrete energy dissipation property. First, we project the solution of the AC equation to the mass conserving space, and then recover the linear convex splitting scheme for the conventional mass-conserving equation. The linear convex splitting scheme is well-known but the convergence of numerical solutions is elaborately studied in terms of gradient-projection. Next, we propose the other energy-minimizing method on the mass-conserving space. It translates the solution of the AC equation to the mass conserving space via an energy-dissipation operator. The dissipation of discrete energy functional for the proposed method is also established. As far as the author knows, no report has been presented for the numerical scheme having discrete energy dissipation property of the mass-conserving AC equation without using the nonlocal and constant multiplier. To verify the common properties of mass-projection and proposed methods numerically, we simulate the evolutions for phase separation, dissipation of energy, and mass conservation. We moreover consider the short and long time stages of evolutions to see the difference between two methods. These several tests are provided for its applications of the proposed method for modeling natural phenomena.},

Firstly, the time variable is discretized by a second-order finite difference scheme. The rate of convergence and stability of the semi-discrete formulation are studied by the energy method. The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the weak form based on the proposed technique have been proved in detail. Furthermore, the interpolating element free Galerkin approach based on the interpolation moving least-squares approximation is employed to derive a fully discrete scheme. Finally, the error estimate of the full-discrete plan is proposed and its convergence order is O ( τ 2 + δ m + 1 ) O(τ2+δm+1) in which τ τ , δ δ and m m denote the time step, the radius of the weight function and smoothness of the exact solution of the main problem, respectively.},

Fourth-order temporal convergence rate of the methods is proved analytically and computed numerically. Profiles of the numerical solutions corresponding to different orders and rates of diffusion are included.

After performing a series of mathematical processes , including nondimensionalization, asymptotic expansion , and successive integration, etc., the authors obtain recurrent sets of motion equations for various order problems. The nonlocal classical shell theory (CST) is derived as a first-order approximation of the current 3D nonlocal elasticity problem , and the equations of motion for higher-order problems retain the same differential operators as those of the nonlocal CST, although with different nonhomogeneous terms. The current asymptotic solutions for the natural frequency parameters of non-embedded or embedded SWCNTs and their corresponding through-thickness modal stress and displacement component distributions are obtained to assess the accuracy of various nonlocal shell and beam theories available in the literature.},

  abstract     = {The nucleation phenomenon and its consequence formation of droplets are destructive effects that occur as a result of the sudden expansion of the flow through the steam turbine blades . The formation of these droplets causes blade corrosion and severe thermodynamic losses , thereby reducing the turbine efficiencyg.In this paper, two holes on the pressure and suction surfaces of the turbine blade were improvised in order to control and optimize the turbine performance. These holes transfer the steam from the high-pressure to the low-pressure part of the cascade; accordingly, the steam is moved from within the cascade itself without using the external steam. For this purpose, an in-house code is written in two-dimensional, compressible, viscous, and turbulent, based on Navier–Stokes equations. To simulate the turbulent flow, the k-k L - ω ω turbulence model is used. The governing equations of the dry flow are solved by the Eulerian approach using a semi-implicit density-based method. Also, in order to avoid the oscillations caused by high accuracy numerical solution, a limiter method called Normalized Variable Diagram (NVD) is employed. For the wet part of the solution field, the equations corresponding to the Lagrangian form are solved. To validate the present numerical code, the results are compared with the experimental data and good agreement is obtained. The results showed that as the hole inlet comes to close the leading edge , further improvement is achieved. Constructing the holes on the suction and pressure surfaces in the case where the holes inlet were closer to the leading edge resulted in complete removal of the wetness from suction and pressure surfaces, and on the middle passage at the outlet of the turbine blade was reduced by 6.7% compared to the baseline geometry. The droplet radius size at the turbine blade outlet on the suction, pressure and mid-pass surface decreased by 99%, 95%, and 29%, respectively, compared to the baseline geometry. Since the hole construction is a passive flow control method without the need to consume energy, using this method to control wet steam is an optimal method.},

As the iterative solution of the optimal control problem requires solving the state and co-state equations many times with different right hand sides , RPS method only requires one-time pre-computation on the fine scale and the following iterations can be done to coarse degrees of freedom. First of all, we extend an approximation method for the multiscale optimal control problem . Secondly, we obtain the error estimates of the multiscale optimal control problem. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {We use the alternating direction method to simulate implicit dynamics. Our spatial discretization uses isogeometric analysis. Namely, we simulate a (hyperbolic) wave propagation problem in which we use tensor-product B-splines in space and an implicit time marching method to fully discretize the problem. We approximate our discrete operator as a Kronecker product of one-dimensional mass and stiffness matrices . As a result of this algebraic transformation, we can factorize the resulting system of equations in linear (i.e., O ( N ) O(N) ) time at each step of the implicit method. We demonstrate the performance of our method in the model P-wave propagation problem. We then extend it to simulate the linear elasticity problem once we decouple the vector problem using alternating triangular methods. We prove theoretically and experimentally the unconditional stability of both methods.},

In the LMFS, the moving least square (MLS) approximation , based on fundamental solutions, is used to construct approximate solution at each node. In this paper, this fundamental solutions-based MLS approximation, named as an augmented MLS (AMLS) approximation, is generalized to any point in the computational domain. Computational formulas, theoretical properties and error estimates of the AMLS approximation are derived. Then, taking Laplace equation as an example, this paper sets up a framework for the theoretical error analysis of the LMFS.

The approach presented in this article can be used for any boundary described by a Jordan curve, and the solution behavior outside the domain need not to considered. The computational process has low cost and generality because the map constructions and changing variables are unnecessary. In addition, by using the presented parametrization process, boundary conditions (boundary bordering) can be implemented conveniently, where the rectangular domains can be considered as an asymptotical case.

The objectives selected were the mean lift force and mechanical power. To achieve performance suitable for optimisation, we also present an efficient GPU implementation of the LBM and adjoint LBM. The Immersed Boundary approach employed for the LBM is verified against results from the literature, while for the flapping case it is compared with two different Finite Volume Method (FVM) approaches. The obtained Pareto front of optimal designs shows a clear discrepancy between the power consumption and the mean lift force.

  abstract     = {Computational simulations of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) enable researchers and medical practitioners to investigate this form of neurostimulation with in silico experiments. For these computer-based simulations to be of practical use to the medical community, patient-specific head geometries and finely discretized computational grids must be used. As a result, solving the partial differential equation based mathematical model that governs tDCS can be computationally burdensome. Further, consider the task of identifying optimal electrode configurations and parameters for a particular patient’s condition, head geometry, and therapeutic objectives; it is conceivable that hundreds of tDCS simulations could be executed. It is therefore important and necessary to identify efficient solution methods for medically-based tDCS simulations. To address this requirement, we exhaustively compare the convergence performance of geometric multigrid and the preconditioned conjugate gradient method when solving the linear system of equations generated from a finite element discretization of the tDCS governing equations. Our simulations consist of three commonly used real-world tDCS electrode montages on MRI-derived three-dimensional head models with physiologically-based inhomogeneous tissue conductivities. Simulations are realized on fine computational meshes with resolutions deemed applicable to the medical community, and as a result, our finite element solutions highlight tDCS-specific phenomena such as electric field shunting that contributes to a notable intensification of the stimulation’s electric current dosage. Convergence metrics of each linear system solver are examined, and compared and linked to theoretical estimates. It is shown that the conjugate gradient method achieves superior convergence rates only when preconditioned with an appropriately configured multigrid algorithm. In addition, it is demonstrated that physiological characteristics of tDCS simulations make multigrid as a stand-alone solver highly ineffective, despite the fact that this method is typically effective in solving the tDCS-based Poisson problem . By identifying the solution methods optimal for medically-driven tDCS simulations, our results extend simulation support to high-resolution and high-volume computing applications, and will ultimately help guide tDCS numerical simulations towards becoming an integrated aspect of the patient-specific tDCS treatment protocol.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, the acoustic attenuation performances of mufflers are predicted by employing three-dimensional isogeometric analysis (IGA) and multi-patch technique for the first time. Circular, elliptical and conical reactive expansion chamber mufflers are exactly parameterized by non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), and the Helmholtz equation governing the interior acoustic field is also solved by NURBS. Compared with traditional finite element method (FEM) which is rooted in Lagrange and Hermite functions , IGA can effectively avoid the time-consuming meshing and totally preserve exact geometrical information during the modelling-analysis process. The computational effectiveness of multi-patch IGA for calculating transmission loss is verified by comparing with experimental approach, boundary element method and other numerical methods from available research articles. The effects of geometry, such as shapes of the expansion cavity and lengths of the extended inlet/outlet are discussed in detail.},

The imperfections are implemented into the von Kármán kinematics and are considered using an a priori and a posteriori manners, respectively, in buckling analysis. Since the nonlinear predictor obtained from the reduced order model with imperfections provides a fairly large step size in path-tracing, the a priori account of imperfections still shows advantages in computational efficiency. The advantages are more significant when considering a posteriori the effects of imperfections in the reduced order model of the structure without imperfections, which means building once and for all, by simply adding some independent imperfection terms in the reduced system. The a posteriori accounts of imperfections with the first/second-order accuracies, are developed, respectively, to deal with the linear/nonlinear prebuckling behaviors and small/large imperfection amplitudes . The good performance of the proposed method in terms of reliability, accuracy and computational effort is demonstrated with several examples using the linear buckling modes or measured geometric shapes as whole-field geometric imperfections.},

On the other hand, we prove the solutions on the fine mesh to be higher accuracy by the postprocessing interpolation technique.

We provide a convergence analysis for the infinite-dimensional iteration as well as for its discretized counterpart. The diffusion correction is computed by a subspace correction, which leads to a convergence behavior that is robust with respect to the discretization. The proven theoretical contraction rate deteriorates for scattering dominated problems. We show numerically that the preconditioned iteration is in practice robust in the diffusion limit. Moreover, computations for the lattice problem indicate that the presented discretization does not suffer from the ray effect. The theoretical methodology is presented for plane-parallel geometries with isotropic scattering, but the approach and proofs generalize to multi-dimensional problems and more general scattering operators verbatim.},

The solution can be obtained iteratively, with a convergence rate that is similar to that obtained with an analogous conformal mesh, and the matrix–vector operator can be computed with completely decoupled operations on both meshes. Furthermore, the scheme can be set as a linear operator that can be fed to a matrix-free efficient iterative solver, such as the BiConjugate Gradient Stabilized method.

For spatial approximation of viscoelastic wave equation two meshless methods based on local radial basis function and barycentric rational interpolation are proposed. Both of the spatial approximation methods do not need mesh, node connectivity or integration process on local subdomains so they are truly meshless . For local radial basis function method we used an existing algorithm in literature to choose an acceptable shape parameter. Time marching is performed with fourth order Runge Kutta method . L 2 L2 and L ∞ L∞ error norms for some test problems are reckoned to indicate efficiency and performance of the proposed two methods. Also, stability of the methods is discussed. Acquired results confirm the applicability of the proposed methods for 2D viscoelastic wave equation. We have performed some comparisons between the proposed two methods in the sense of accuracy and computational cost. From the comparisons, we have observed that performance of the barycentric rational interpolation in the sense of accuracy is slightly better than the performance of local radial basis function however computational cost of the local radial basis function is less than the computational cost of barycentric rational interpolation.},

  abstract     = {In the present contribution, we consider Helmholtz equation with material coefficients being constant in each subdomain of a geometric partition of the propagation medium (discarding the presence of junctions), and we are interested in the numerical solution of such a problem by means of local multi-trace boundary integral formulations (local-MTF). For a one dimensional problem and configurations with two subdomains, it has been recently established that applying a Jacobi iterative solver to local-MTF is exactly equivalent to an Optimised Schwarz Method (OSM) with a non-local impedance. In the present contribution, we show that this correspondence still holds in the case where the subdomain partition involves an arbitrary number of subdomains. From this, we deduce that the depth of the adjacency graph of the subdomain partition plays a critical role in the convergence of linear solvers applied to local-MTF: we prove it for the case of homogeneous propagation medium and show, through numerical evidences, that this conclusion still holds for heterogeneous media. Our study also shows that, considering variants of local-MTF involving a relaxation parameter, there is a fixed value of this relaxation parameter that systematically leads to optimal speed of convergence for linear solvers.},

Our adaptive meshless scheme is based at first on the use of a leave-one-out cross validation technique, and then on a residual subsampling method. Each of phases is characterized by different error indicators and refinement strategies. The combination of these computational approaches allows us to detect the areas that need to be refined, also including the chance to further add or remove adaptively any points. The resulting algorithm turns out to be flexible and effective through a good interaction between error indicators and refinement procedures. Several numerical experiments support our study by illustrating the performance of our two-stage scheme. Finally, the latter is also compared with an efficient adaptive finite element method.},

Thus a Petrov–Galerkin method is combined with an effective mass conservation factor to overcome the challenge. Furthermore, we prove two facts, this method maintains positivity and discrete mass conservation property. In addition, decoupled approach is applied based on the gradient and Laplacian recoveries to solve the coupling system. The relevant stability analyses is provided.

Therefore, in the proposed method, system uncertainties are estimated by the universal approximation ability of the neural network and external disturbance is vanquished by the robust attribute of sliding mode observer. The objectives are: firstly, to propose a method for estimating the states for nonlinear fractional order system based on a novel fractional update law for RBFNN. Secondly, by applying the fractional extension of Lyapunov stability called Mittag-Leffler stability, guarantee the finite time stability of the proposed observer.

Vertex-centered linearity-preserving scheme (VLPS, Wu et al., 2016) is a linear finite volume scheme which is currently only applied to the numerical simulation of diffusion problems. In this paper, we study the relationship between VLPS and the lowest-order VEM for diffusion problems on star-shaped polygonal meshes from an algebraic point of view. The global stiffness matrix of VLPS with a special stabilization term coincides with that of the lowest-order VEM while the load terms are generally different. Specifically, we find that the global stiffness matrices of the two methods can be split as the consistency parts and the stability parts, and the consistency parts are the same while the stability parts coincide under some assumptions. As a by-product, a new stability term is obtained for VLPS. Besides, a post-processing procedure is suggested for the lowest-order VEM to preserve the positivity of the cell-centered unknowns and maintain at the same time the local conservation on the primary meshes. The positivity, existence and uniqueness of the cell-centered unknowns are studied. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the post-processing procedure on various polygonal meshes.},

The DPG methodology can be viewed as a means to solve an overdetermined discretization of a boundary value problem. In the same vein, the DPG* methodology is a means to solve an underdetermined discretization. These two viewpoints are developed by embedding the same operator equation into two different saddle-point problems. The analyses of the two problems have many common elements. Comparison to other methods in the literature round out the newly garnered perspective. Notably, DPG* and DPG methods can be seen as generalizations of L L ∗ LL∗ and least-squares methods, respectively. A priori error analysis and a posteriori error control for the DPG* method are considered in detail. Reports of several numerical experiments are provided which demonstrate the essential features of the new method. A notable difference between the results from the DPG* and DPG analyses is that the convergence rates of the former are limited by the regularity of an extraneous Lagrange multiplier variable.},

Embedding Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) ideas in the Variational Multiscale (VMS) framework yields interface coupling terms that accommodate nonmatching discretizations across glued meshes. A unique feature of the method that emanates from fine-scale modeling facilitated by VMS is the derivation of analytical expressions for the Lagrange multipliers that enforce continuity of the fields across nonmatching meshes. This stabilized form is free of any user-defined parameters and renders itself to consistent linearization that leads to quadratic convergence of the method. The coupling terms at the interface also provide an avenue to employ various kinematic models for interfacial response in multi-constituent materials. An interfacial gap/crack function is introduced together with the conjugate traction vector to model discrete interfacial failure in multi-material applications. An algorithm for consistent implementation of interfacial models for tension, compression, and sliding friction across non-conforming meshes is presented. Test cases that employ 8-node hexahedra and 4-node tetrahedra are presented that highlight the generality of the method and validate its robustness for mathematically nonsmooth thermomechanical problems.},

Some preliminary error analysis for a fully discrete approximation of the contact problem was provided in Jureczka and Ochal (2019). In this paper, we consider a more general fully discrete numerical scheme for the contact problem, derive optimal order error bounds and present computer simulation results showing that the numerical convergence orders match the theoretical predictions.},

  abstract     = {The paper is concerned with the space of C 1 C1 continuous polynomial splines of degree 5 on general triangulations such that the restriction to each triangle corresponds to a Bell element. It is investigated how the standard construction of Bell elements, which is based on prescribing values and derivatives up to order two at the vertices of the triangulation, can be used to define different bases. The most straightforward one is the nodal basis, which lacks stability, but it is shown that this can be improved by scaling the interpolation data. However, the prime focus of the paper is on the construction of B-spline-like bases that depend on the choice of special domain triangles associated with the vertices of the triangulation. A B-spline-like basis consists of functions that are locally supported and form a partition of unity . If the triangulation satisfies certain geometric constraints (e.g. is acute) and the domain triangles are chosen suitably, the basis is also non-negative. The stability analysis of the derived bases is addressed theoretically as well as numerically, the latter with the examples of least square fitting and PDE solving.},

The second approach better addresses large amounts of points, though it is less efficient than the first approach.

Unlike previously known numerical techniques , this guarantees convergence and enables us to compute the solution with controlled accuracy even in sharp resonances.

However, the presence of the nonlocal term reduces the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, which would increase the computational burden. To avoid this and to retain the sparsity of the Jacobian, the nonlinear system is replaced by an equivalent system inspired by the work on the FEM by Gudi (2012). The numerical results show that the proposed methodology yields optimal convergence rate in the L 2 L2 norm.

  abstract     = {The escape of particles through a narrow absorbing gate in confined domains is a rich phenomenon in various systems in physics, chemistry and molecular biophysics. We consider the narrow escape problem in a bounded annular when the two gates randomly switch between different states with a switching rate k k between the two gates. After briefly deriving the coupled partial differential equations for the escape time through two gates, we compute the mean escape time for particles escaping from the gates with different initial states. By numerical simulation under nonuniform boundary conditions, we quantify how narrow escape time is affected by the switching rate k k between the two gates, arc length s s between two gates, angular velocity w w of the steady flow and diffusion coefficient D D . We reveal that the mean escape time decreases with the switching rate k k between the two gates, angular velocity w w and diffusion coefficient D D for fixed arc length, but takes the minimum when the two gates are evenly separated on the boundary for any given switching rate k k between the two gates. In particular, we find that when the arc length size ε ε for the gates is sufficiently small, the average narrow escape time is approximately independent of the gate arc length size. We further indicate combinations of system parameters (regions located in the parameter space) such that the mean escape time is the longest or shortest. Our findings provide mathematical understanding for phenomena such as how ions select ion channels and how chemicals leak in annulus ring containers, when drift vector fields are present.},

  abstract     = {A high-order three-scale approach developed in this work to analyze thermo-mechanical properties of porous materials with interior surface radiation is systematically studied. The microstructures of the porous structures are described by periodical layout of local cells on the microscopic domain and mesoscopic domain, and surface radiation effect at microscale and mesoscale is also investigated. At first, the three-scale formulas based on reiterated homogenization and high-order asymptotic expansion are established, and the local cell solutions in microscale and mesoscale are also defined. Then, two kinds of homogenized parameters are evaluated by upscaling methods, and the homogenized equations are derived on the whole structure. Further, heat flux and strain fields are constructed as the three-scale asymptotic solutions by assembling the higher-order unit cell solutions and homogenized solutions. The significant features of the proposed approach are an asymptotic high-order homogenization that does not require higher order continuity of the macroscale solutions and a new high-order three-scale formula derived for analyzing the coupled problems. Finally, some representative examples are proposed to verify the presented methods. They show that the three-scale asymptotic expansions introduced in this paper are efficient and valid for predicting the thermo-mechanical properties of the porous materials with multiple spatial scales.},

  abstract     = {The purpose of this article is to derive and analyze new discrete mixed approximations for linear elasticity problems with weak stress symmetry. These approximations are based on the application of enriched versions of classic Poisson-compatible spaces, for stress and displacement variables, and/or on enriched Stokes-compatible space configurations , for the choice of rotation spaces used to weakly enforce stress symmetry. Accordingly, the stress space has to be adapted to ensure stability. Such enrichment procedures are done via space increments with extra bubble functions, which have their support on a single element (in the case of H 1 H1 -conforming approximations) or with vanishing normal components over element edges (in the case of H H (div)-conforming spaces). The advantage of using bubbles as stabilization corrections relies on the fact that all extra degrees of freedom can be condensed, in a way that the number of equations to be solved and the matrix structure are not affected. Enhanced approximations are observed when using the resulting enriched space configurations , which may have different orders of accuracy for the different variables. A general error analysis is derived in order to identify the contribution of each kind of bubble increment on the accuracy of the variables, individually. The use of enriched Poisson spaces improves the rates of convergence of stress divergence and displacement variables. Stokes enhancement by bubbles contributes to equilibrate the accuracy of weak stress symmetry enforcement with the stress approximation order, reaching the maximum rate given by the normal traces (which are not affected).},

Two key properties are mimicked at the discrete level, namely the invariance of the velocity with respect to irrotational body forces and the non-dissipativity of the convective term . A full convergence analysis is carried out, showing optimal orders of convergence under a smallness condition involving only the solenoidal part of the body force.

Effected by the complex microstructure of open cell metal foams the macroscopic material behaviour cannot be described with a von Mises yield criterion. In comparison to bulk metals, open cell metal foams collapse under hydrostatic compression and tension. Modelling of this behaviour is realised by using a closed yield surface to describe the plastic behaviour. This contribution considers the asymmetric yield surfaces measured for open cell metal foams with 10 and 20 ppi . A Finite Element implementation of a single closed yield surface is introduced. Furthermore, a new approach to identify the material parameters of the yield surface as well as the structural Young’s and hardening moduli is introduced. The simulations are realised with a Finite Element Method and the numerical results are compared with the experiments. The numerical results are fitted to the experimental data by modifying the material parameters of the model in an iterative optimisation process. The optimised material parameters are used to describe different loading conditions for open cell aluminium foams. The results of the simulation are compared with the multiaxial experiments for the sake of validation.},

This results to a weak-based RBF-generated finite difference (RBF–FD) scheme that possesses some useful properties. The error and stability issues are considered. When the PDE solution or the basis function has low smoothness, the new method gives more accurate results than the already well-established strong-based collocation methods. Although the method uses a Galerkin formulation, it still remains meshless because not only the approximation process relies on scattered point layouts but also integrations are done over non-connected, independent and well-shaped subdomains. Some applications to potential and elasticity problems on scattered data points support the theoretical analysis and show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

To compute the deterministic coefficients of expansion , we have applied Galerkin projection on uncertain data and the solution variables. Then, to ascertain the behavior of the random process , the system of equations obtained from projection are integrated using fourth order Runge–Kutta method. To handle the nonlinearity , we have compared Galerkin projection with pseudo-spectral projection. The procedure is illustrated through three model problems of real life importance. We conclude that Galerkin approximation performs better in comparison to pseudo-spectral approach which is numerically expected.

  abstract     = {Capillary pressure is a key parameter in reservoir numerical simulation. It is generally considered that the capillary force is an only function of water saturation in the current traditional reservoir numerical simulation methods. However, large amount of indoor experiments have shown that capillary force is not only dependent on the water saturation, but also the velocity of fluid flow. In this work, we introduce the dynamic capillary pressure to the oil–water two-phase flow equations. Then, we discrete the modified oil and water phase basic governing equation with difference methods. The full implicit method is selected to solve the pressure equation. Finally, a numerical simulation method coupled with the dynamic capillary force based on the full-implicit method is established. We discussed the effect of dynamic capillary pressure on the oil–water two-phase flow in two-dimensional homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media. Comparing to static capillary pressure model, the dynamic capillary pressure model predicts higher water-saturation near the injection and production wells. In addition, a “funnel” like pressure profile appears in the water saturation profile. At low water cut stage, the rate of water cut increase is relatively high, while opposite is true at high water cut stage. We also calibrated our newly proposed model by comparing to the analytical method and the actual oil field production data. Our work should provide important insights into the effect of dynamic capillary force on the oil–water two-phase flow and better estimation of flow behavior in oil and gas reservoir.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we construct and analyze a family of quadratic finite volume element schemes over triangular meshes for elliptic equations . This family of schemes cover some existing quadratic schemes. For these schemes, by element analysis, we find that each element matrix can be split as two parts : the first part is the element stiffness matrix of the standard quadratic finite element method , while the second part is a tensor product of two vectors. Thanks to this finding, we obtain a sufficient condition to ensure the existence, uniqueness and coercivity result of the finite volume element solution on triangular meshes. More interesting is that, the above condition has a simple and analytic expression, and only relies on the interior angles of each triangular element. Based on this result, a minimum angle condition, better than some existing ones, can be obtained. Moreover, based on the coercivity result, we prove that the finite volume element solution converges to the exact solution with an optimal convergence rate in H 1 H1 norm. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {The Morse–Ingard equations of thermoacoustics Morse and Ingard (1986) are a system of coupled time-harmonic equations for the temperature and pressure of an excited gas. They form a critical aspect of modeling trace gas sensors. In this paper, we analyze a reformulation of the system that has a weaker coupling between the equations than the original form. We give a Gårding-type inequality for the system that leads to optimal-order asymptotic finite element error estimates. We also develop preconditioners for the coupled system. These are derived by writing the system as a 2 × 2 block system with pressure and temperature unknowns segregated into separate blocks and then using either the block diagonal or block lower triangular part of this matrix as a preconditioner. Consequently, the preconditioner requires inverting smaller, Helmholtz-like systems individually for the pressure and temperature. Rigorous eigenvalue bounds are given for the preconditioned system, and these are supported by numerical experiments.},

For matrix Riccati equations, the reduced problem is then solved by means of a direct Riccati scheme such as the Schur method. When we solve differential matrix Riccati equations, the reduced problem is solved by the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) method and the obtained solution is used to build the low rank approximate solution of the original problem.

We focus on a rigorous analysis and consideration of unconditional superconvergence error estimates of the discrete schemes. Firstly, by virtue of the temporal error results, the regularity for the time-discrete system is presented. Secondly, the classical Ritz projection is used to obtain the spatial error with order O ( h 2 ) O(h2) in the sense of L 2 L2 -norm. Thanks to the relationship between the Ritz projection and the interpolated projection, the superclose estimate with order O ( τ 2 + h 2 ) O(τ2+h2) in the sense of H 1 H1 -norm is derived. Thirdly, it follows from the interpolated postprocessing technique that the global superconvergence result is deduced.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the bending response performances of the magneto–electro–elastic (MEE) laminated plates resting on the Winkler foundation or the elastic half-space subjected to a transverse mechanical loading .By assuming that the foundation is not electrically and magnetically conductive, the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) based on the three-dimensional (3D) theory of elasticity is applied for both the simulation of the MEE laminated plate and the elastic half-space. The SBFEM model considers the generalized displacement involving the elastic displacement, electric potential and magnetic potential as the nodal degree of freedom for the MEE laminated plates, and only the in-plane of the MEE laminated plate or the boundary of the elastic half-space needs to be discretized leading to reduce the spatial dimension by one. Furthermore, in the SBFEM, the governing equations can be solved by using an analytical approach in the radial direction of the scaled coordinate system, so that it is particularly suitable for the simulation of the elastic half-space. For the Winkler foundation–plate system, the global stiffness coupling governing equation that includes the interaction between the MEE laminated plate and the Winkler foundation is derived directly from the 3D elasticity equations of the MEE laminated plate by assuming that the foundation reactions are proportional to the transverse displacements of the plate structure. While for the MEE laminated plate-half-space system, the whole domain is divided into three sub-domains including the MEE laminated plate structure, the near and semi-infinite far foundation systems based on the sub-structure method, and then the stiffness matrix of each sub-domain can be determined by means of the SBFEM. As a result, the global stiffness equation of the plate-half-space system can be assembled according to the principle of the degree of freedom matching at the same nodes. The numerical results obtained for limiting cases by using the proposed method were compared with the published works and showed excellent agreements with the solutions based on the analytical and numerical approaches, so that the accuracy and applicability of the proposed formulations for the analysis of the interaction problems between the MEE laminated plate and the Winkler foundation or elastic half-space can be verified. Moreover, several numerical examples with various material properties, geometries, stacking sequences, aspect ratios, and supported boundary conditions were presented to show the effects of which on the responses of the plate–foundation system.},

The spatial-fractional derivative used in the momentum conservation equation is the Riemann–Liouville type derivative. Further, we use non-uniform boundary conditions subject to the boundary layer equations of the fluid flowing through a semi-infinite permeable flat surface . Owing to the fractional derivative model and non-uniform boundary conditions, this problem is complex. Thus, a finite difference scheme is applied after the coupled continuity equation and momentum equation are decoupled and linearized. The accuracy, convergence, and stability of the numerical method are presented. It is shown that non-uniform mass transfer through a permeable surface considerably affects the velocity boundary layer. By illustrating the physical interactions between the velocity fields in the boundary layer and the permeation mode in the surface, this paper predicts the velocity distributions with varying permeable surface, and also provides the possibility of changing the velocity fields by altering the permeable sheet. The results and numerical technique used in this study will help in the understanding of fractional calculus investigation in engineering.},

  abstract     = {In this study, a higher order compact (HOC) finite difference scheme is proposed for the simulation of multiphase flows with surface tension effects by coupling the pure streamfunction formulation of Navier–Stokes (N–S) equations with the level set method. Unlike most of the existing methods for multiphase flows that solve the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the velocity–pressure form or the stream-function vorticity form, we recast the governing equations into the biharmonic form of the N–S equations which carries stream-function ψ ψ as the only variable to be computed. The coupling of this formulation with level set (LS) enables the simulation of two phase flows by the core computation of only the single variable ψ ψ free from discontinuities in the whole physical domain. In the process, we also propose a novel hybrid HOC algorithm for post-processing the pressure on either side of the interface including the jump across it. The robustness of this method is established through a series of benchmark problems such as dispersion of capillary waves, static bubble and oscillating bubble at equilibrium in a fluid at rest, and deforming circular drops in shear flows. We compare our numerical results with available benchmark results and excellent match is obtained in all the cases along with accurate representation of overall trends. Our approach is proved to be very efficient in terms of its easy implementation, relatively low computational time and high order of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Angle-ply laminated plates have been examined for flexure analysis with multiquadric radial basis function (MQRBF) base meshfree method . A new higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT) representing the transverse shear strain function is proposed in the displacement field. Proposed theory satisfies the condition of continuity and differentiability and is accurate enough to predict the results of flexure. Governing differential equations (GDEs) are derived using energy principle. A MATLAB code is developed to obtain the results for deflection and stresses of the angle-ply laminated plate. The flexure results for laminated plates under patch loads commonly used in general practice is obtained with proposed HSDTs and meshfree method. Present results are validated with published results for the cross-ply laminated plate, and some new results are produced for different loading conditions for angle-ply laminated plates. In the present study, eight layered symmetric cross-ply laminate of equal thickness, an antisymmetric cross-ply laminate of equal thickness and a general angle-ply laminate of equal thickness is considered. The effect of the span to thickness ratio , number of layers and shifting patch loads is presented.},

In this work, hyperspherical path-tracking of homotopy curves is consistently employed as an effective strategy for computing unreported multiple solution vectors for an elliptic system of 2-D PDEs for natural convection.

The effect of Reynolds number ranging from 250 to 1000, nanofluid volume fraction ranging from 1 to 3 % and conical strip insert combinations are examined on the fluid flow patterns and heat transfer characteristics. The results showed that among the three combinations of the twisted conical strip insert, CCI-inward locally presents the highest values of heat transfer coefficient , as about 17% higher than plain tube, considering the nature of the secondary flow created in this case. It is also found that the effect of increasing nanofluid concentration on the channel thermal performance is more significant at higher values of R e Re number; however, the pressure drop difference between the three models is subtle.},

Oldroyd-4 constant fluid is approximated as cervical mucus and MHD effects are also considered. After utilizing lubrication and creeping flow assumption the reduced non-linear differential equation is solved (by implicit finite difference technique) so that it will satisfy the dynamic equilibrium condition for steady propulsion. For a special (Newtonian) case the expressions of swimming speed and flow rate are also presented. We also demonstrate that the rheological properties of non-Newtonian fluid can assist or resist the pack of micro-organisms (swimming sheet), while the larger undulation amplitude in swimmer’s body and magnetic field in downward direction can enhance the propulsion speed. The solution obtained via implicit finite difference method is also validated by a built in MATLAB routine bvp-4c. This built in function is based on collocation technique. Moreover an excellent correlation is achieved for both numerical methods .},

First, two linear fluxes are given on both sides of the cell edge, respectively. In order to deal with the defect of the existing scheme preserving maximum principle for solving diffusion problem with discontinuous coefficient, in addition to cell-centered unknowns, we also introduce cell-edge unknowns on discontinuous line as basic unknowns. Second, the conservative flux is constructed by using nonlinear weighted combination of these two linear fluxes. For the cell-edge unknowns on discontinuous line, we add an equation by using the continuity of normal flux. Compared to the classical cell-centered nonlinear finite volume scheme, the introduction of cell-edge unknowns on discontinuous edge is the key point for our scheme to solve diffusion equations with discontinuous coefficient. Then we prove that the scheme satisfies the discrete maximum principle. Based on this, the existence of a solution for the scheme is also obtained. Numerical results are presented to show that our scheme obtains almost second order accuracy for solution on random meshes, preserves discrete maximum principle, and is superior to the existing scheme (in Sheng and Yuan (2011)) preserving the maximum principle on dealing with the problems with strong anisotropic discontinuous coefficient on distorted meshes.},

  abstract     = {We propose a radial basis function collocation method (RBF method) to solve fractional Laplacian visco-acoustic wave equation for the Earth media having heterogeneous velocity model and complex geometry . Unlike the fractional Laplacian wave equation proposed in Zhu and Harris (2014), the wave equation we consider has a different definition for the fractional Laplacian. Specifically, spectral and Riesz fractional Laplacians are considered in Zhu and Harris (2014) and the present paper, respectively. Accordingly, the Fourier pseudospectral method (FPS method) and the RBF method are employed to solve the spectral and the Riesz fractional Laplacian wave equations. The two wave equations are observed to produce obviously different wavefields . We demonstrate the validity and flexibility of the proposed RBF method by considering five benchmarks of seismic forward modeling: (1) two-dimensional Earth media with four types of velocity models (homogeneous, two-layer, homogeneous but complex-geometry, and heterogeneous models) and (2) a spherical medium with homogeneous velocity model. We make a three-way comparison among numerical solutions to the Riesz fractional Laplacian, the spectral fractional Laplacian, and the integer-order visco-acoustic wave equations, and observe that when wave attenuation is weak the Riesz wave equation yields more similar wavefield to that of the integer-order wave equation than the spectral wave equation does. Furthermore, uniform and quasi-uniform layouts for collocation points of the RBF method are considered, and the latter layout turns out to be economical since it can preserve the solution accuracy with the minimum number of collocation points. The RBF method is truly mesh-free and dimension-free and can easily handle high-dimensional, irregular domains. Additionally, the method is easier to implement than element-based methods, such as finite element and spectral element methods , for discretizing the Riesz fractional Laplacian.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the original finite volume lattice Boltzmann method (FVLBM) on an unstructured grid (Part I of these twin papers) is extended to simulate turbulent flows. To model the turbulent effect, the k − ω k−ω SST turbulence model is incorporated into the present FVLBM framework and is also solved by the finite volume method . Based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis, the eddy viscosity is computed from the solution of the k − ω k−ω SST model, and the total viscosity is modified by adding this eddy viscosity to the laminar (kinematic) viscosity given in the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook collision term . Because of solving for the collision term with the explicit method in the original FVLBM scheme, the computational efficiency is much lower for simulating high Reynolds number flow. This is due to the fact that the largest time step decided by the stability condition of the collision term, which is less than twice the relaxation time , is much smaller than that decided by the CFL condition. In order to enhance the computational efficiency, the three-stage second-order implicit–explicit (IMEX) Runge–Kutta method is used for temporal discretization , and the time step can be one or two orders of magnitude larger as compared with the explicit Euler forward scheme. Although the computational cost is increased, the final computational efficiency is enhanced by about one-order of magnitude and good results can also be obtained at a large time step through the test case of a lid-driven cavity flow . Two turbulent flow cases are carried out to validate the present method, including flow over a backward-facing step and flow around a NACA0012 airfoil . The numerical results are found to be in agreement with experimental data and numerical solutions, demonstrating the applicability of the present FVLBM coupled with the k − ω k−ω SST model to accurately predict the incompressible turbulent flows.},

The present study aims to showcase the efficiency of fixed grid X-FEM to numerically simulate the evolving phase transition front with time which further illustrates location &amp; dimensions of ice ball generated after freezing. It has been observed that X-FEM with a fixed mesh is capable to capture phase transitions front and temperature fields accurately while traditional form of FEM requires adaptive re-meshing at each time step. From physician point of view, obtained temperature fields are really important to decide the extent of freezing, location of different cryoprobes, and numbers of cryoprobes to be used for a successful treatment.},

  abstract     = {Systems of reaction–diffusion partial differential equations (RD-PDEs) are widely applied for modeling life science and physico-chemical phenomena. In particular, the coupling between diffusion and nonlinear kinetics can lead to the so-called Turing instability, giving rise to a variety of spatial patterns (like labyrinths, spots, stripes, etc.) attained as steady state solutions for large time intervals. To capture the morphological peculiarities of the pattern itself, a very fine space discretization may be required, limiting the use of standard (vector-based) ODE solvers in time because of excessive computational costs. By exploiting the structure of the diffusion matrix, we show that matrix-based versions of time integrators, such as Implicit–Explicit (IMEX) and exponential schemes, allow for much finer problem discretizations. We illustrate our findings by numerically solving the Schnakenberg model, prototype of RD-PDE systems with Turing pattern solutions, and the DIB-morphochemical model describing metal growth during battery charging processes.},

The resulted schemes are employed for approximating the viscosity solution of Hamilton–Jacobi (H–J) equations. The accuracy in the smooth area is enhanced by locally optimizing the shape parameter according to the results. It is revealed that the proposed schemes in this research prepare more accurate reconstructions and sharper solution near singularities by comparing the RBFENO/RBFWENO schemes and the classical ENO/WENO schemes for some benchmark examples. Looking at the several numerical examples in 1D, 2D and 3D illustrate that the proposed schemes in this paper perform better than the traditional ENO/WENO schemes for solving H–J equations.},

Low-order approximations on triangles are adopted, with the use of three interior penalty DG methods , viz. nonsymmetric, symmetric and incomplete. It is known that these methods are uniformly convergent in the incompressible limit for the isotropic case . This work focuses on behaviour in the inextensible limit for transverse isotropy . An error estimate suggests the possibility of extensional locking, a feature that is confirmed by numerical experiments. Under-integration of the extensional edge terms is proposed as a remedy. This modification is shown to lead to an error estimate that is consistent with locking-free behaviour. Numerical tests confirm the uniformly convergent behaviour, at an optimal rate, of the under-integrated scheme.},

The mathematical model is expressed as the boundary value problem for elliptic partial differential equation (EPDE). Main feature of the presented technique is the separately satisfaction of the conditions on the boundary of the domain and the EPDE inside. To be more precise, we transform the original EPDE to the equation with homogeneous boundary condition (BC) and seek the approximate solution as a sum of the modified RBFs (MRBFs). The MRBFs satisfy the homogeneous BC of the problem. So, any linear combination also satisfies the homogeneous BC. The RBFs of three types are used in the framework of the method: the Multiquadric (MQ) RBF , the Gaussian RBF and the conical one. The coefficients of the linear combination are determined so that it satisfies the governing equation of the EPDE. Ten numerical examples demonstrate the high effectiveness of the presented technique in solving 3D CDR problems in single and double connected domains.},

When we solve the ternary CH system, we only solve the equation for one phase with the fixed third phase. The second phase value is obtained from the local mass conservation. A no-slip condition was imposed for the velocity on the arbitrary domain boundaries. The proposed method uses an unconditionally gradient stable type scheme (Y. Li et al., 2016) for the convective CH equation and a projection method for the modified NS equation. Various numerical experiments, such as the droplet movement in a cavity flow , the Rayleigh–Taylor instability in a porous media, droplet passing through a triangle-shaped solid structure, and droplet movement in a circuitous channel, were performed to demonstrate that the proposed method can deal with the two-phase flow in arbitrary domains.},

Firstly, the discussion of non-Markovian property of q q -Gaussian process provides a numerical support for the future theoretical research. Secondly, the martingale and self-similarity of this process are obtained by Tsallis distributions. Thirdly, the long dependence is analyzed by simulations and Hurst exponents are compared with those of fractional Brownian motion. At last, the European call option price formula driven by this process is simulated, by which we find that this process can better match anomalous diffusion and the volatility smile.},

  abstract     = {This work addresses the simulation of heat flow and electric currents in thin wires. An important application is the use of bond wires in microelectronic chip packaging. The heat distribution is modeled by an electrothermal coupled problem, which poses numerical challenges due to the presence of different geometric scales. The necessity of very fine grids is relaxed by solving and embedding a 1D sub-problem along the wire into the surrounding 3D geometry. The arising singularities are described using de Rham currents. It is shown that the problem is related to fluid flow in porous 3D media with 1D fractures (C. D’Angelo, SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis 50.1, pp. 194–215, 2012). A careful formulation of the 1D–3D coupling condition is essential to obtain a stable scheme that yields a physical solution. Elliptic model problems are used to investigate the numerical errors and the corresponding convergence rates. Additionally, the transient electrothermal simulation of a simplified microelectronic chip package as used in industrial applications is presented.},

This model can be used to deal with single-phase and two-phase flows problems with a source term in the continuity equation . From this generalized model, we can not only get some existing models, but also derive new models. Moreover, for the incompressible model derived, a modified pressure scheme is introduced to calculate the pressure, and then to ensure the accuracy of the model. In this work, we will focus on a two-phase flow system, and in the frame work of our generalized LB model, a new phase-field-based LB model is developed for incompressible and quasi-incompressible two-phase flows. A series of numerical simulations of some classic physical problems , including a spinodal decomposition, a static droplet, a layered Poiseuille flow , and a bubble rising flow under buoyancy, are performed to validate the developed model. Besides, some comparisons with previous quasi-incompressible and incompressible LB models are also carried out, and the results show that the present model is accurate in the study of two-phase flows. Finally, we also conduct a comparison between quasi-incompressible and incompressible LB models for two-phase flow problems, and find that in some cases, the proposed quasi-incompressible LB model performs better than incompressible LB models.},

  abstract     = {In order to study the flow behavior at high Reynolds numbers , two modified models, known as the multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT-LBM) and large-eddy-simulation lattice Boltzmann method (LES-LBM), have been employed in this paper. The MRT-LBM was designed to improve numerical stability at high Reynolds numbers , by introducing multiple relaxation time terms, which consider the variations of density, energy, momentum, energy flux and viscous stress tensor. As a result, MRT-LBM is capable of dealing with turbulent flows considering energy dispersion and dissipation. In the present paper, this model was employed to simulate the flow at turbulent Reynolds numbers in wall-driven cavities. Two-sided wall driven cavity flow was studied for the first time, based on MRT-LBM, at Reynolds numbers ranging from 2 × 1 0 4 2×104 to 1 × 1 0 6 1×106 , and employing a very large resolution2048 × 2048. It is found that whenever top and bottom lids are moving in the opposite directions, and the Reynolds number is higher than 2 × 1 0 4 2×104 , the flow is chaotic, although some quasi-symmetric properties still remain, fully disappearing at Reynolds numbers between 2 × 1 0 5 2×105 and 3 × 1 0 5 3×105 . Furthermore, between this Reynolds numbers range, 2 × 1 0 5 &lt; 2×105&amp;lt; Re &lt; 3 × 1 0 5 &amp;lt;3×105 , the quasi-symmetric structures turn into a much smaller and fully chaotic eddies. The LES-LBM model implements the large eddy simulation turbulent model into the conventional LBM, allowing to study the flow at turbulent Reynolds numbers. LES-LBM combined with Quadruple-tree Cartesian cutting grid (tree grid) was employed for the first time to characterize the flow dynamics over a cylinder and a hump, at relatively high Reynolds numbers. In order to construct the macroscopic quantities in the virtual boundaries separating two different grid levels, a set of new schemes were designed. The coupling of the LES-LBM and tree grid drastically reduced the computational time required to perform the simulations, thus, allowing to minimize the hardware requirements. LES-LBM model is shown to be much more efficient when combined with the tree grid instead of using the standard Cartesian grid .},

The method first attempts to use the multigrid method to decompose the original inverse problem into a sequence of sub-inverse problems which depend on the grid variables and are solved in proper order according to the grid size from the coarsest to the finest, and then carries out the inversion on the coarsest grid by the homotopy method. The strategy may give a rapidly and globally convergent method. As a practical application, this method is used to solve the nonlinear inverse problem of a nonlinear convection–diffusion equation, which is the saturation equation within the two-phase porous media flow.

Thanks to smooth and accurate geometry representation of the NURBS formulation, the employed isogeometric framework not only resolves issues concerning the conventional mesh generation techniques of the finite volume method in steam turbine problems, but also, as validated against well-established experiments, significantly improves the accuracy of the numerical solution.

The proposed method is then to remove the straight waveguides between scatterers and impose the MDtN condition on artificial boundaries resulting from domain truncation. This numerical technique can allow a great reduction of computational efforts .

This method is derived from a simple modification of the cell-vertex unstructured grid based FVLBM proposed by Stiebler et al. (2006). Compared with other complex flux reconstruction methods, the present scheme has a low computational cost and can also achieve second-order spatial accuracy. Furthermore, depending on the use of the different temporal discretization schemes , the temporal accuracy can be adjusted for both steady and unsteady flows . Besides, some comparisons of the computational cost and accuracy with another FVLBM scheme are also presented. Meanwhile, different boundary conditions are illustrated that are easy to implement on complex geometries . To validate the present method, four cases are carried out, including a Couette flow driven by one plate for an accuracy test, flow in a square cavity , flow around a single circular cylinder and a more complex flow around double circular cylinders. Numerical experiments show that the present scheme can simulate steady and unsteady flows at relatively high Reynolds number with relatively few grid cells, thus demonstrating the good capability of the present method.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the potential for an r r -adaptation algorithm to improve the efficiency of space–time residual distribution schemes in the approximation of time-dependent hyperbolic conservation laws, e.g. scalar advection, shallow water flows, on unstructured, triangular meshes. In this adaptive framework the connectivity of the mesh, and hence the number of degrees of freedom, remain fixed, but the mesh nodes are continually “relocated” as the flow evolves so that features of interest remain resolved as they move within the domain. Adaptive strategies of this type are well suited to the space–time residual distribution framework because, when the discrete representation is allowed to be discontinuous in time, these algorithms can be designed to be positive (and hence stable) for any choice of time-step, even on the distorted space–time prisms which arise from moving the nodes of an unstructured triangular mesh. Consequently, a local increase in mesh resolution does not impose a more restrictive stability constraint on the time-step, which can instead be chosen according to accuracy requirements. The order of accuracy of the fixed-mesh scheme is retained on the moving mesh in the majority of applications tested. Space–time schemes of this type are analogous to conservative ALE formulations and automatically satisfy a discrete geometric conservation law, so moving the mesh does not artificially change the flow volume for pure conservation laws. For shallow water flows over variable bed topography, the so-called C-property (retention of hydrostatic balance between flux and source terms, required to maintain the steady state of still, flat, water) can also be satisfied by considering the mass balance equation in terms of free surface level instead of water depth, even when the mesh is moved. The r r -adaptation is applied within each time-step by interleaving the iterations of the nonlinear solver with updates to mesh node positions. The node movement is driven by a monitor function based on weighted approximations of the scaled gradient and Laplacian of the local solution and regularised by a smoothing iteration. Numerical results are shown in two dimensions for both scalar advection and for shallow water flow over a variable bed which show that, even for this simple implementation of the mesh movement, reductions in cpu times of up to 60% can be attained without increasing the error.},

The proposed scheme is a simple, powerful and effective collocation method for crack problems since it only requires the boundary discretization without special treatments of the crack. Three typical numerical examples , namely, a central crack, an off-central crack and a central slant crack are presented and discussed to illustrate the accuracy, convergence and stability of the proposed method.},

An innovative aspect comes from the consideration of stochastic spreads, which increases the dimension of the problem. In this setting, we pose new complementarity problems associated to linear and nonlinear PDEs . Moreover, using the mathematical tools of semilinear variational inequalities for parabolic equations , we prove the existence and uniqueness of a solution for these models. For the numerical solution, we mainly combine a semi-Lagrangian time discretization scheme , a fixed point method to cope with nonlinear terms and a finite element method for the spatial discretization , jointly with an augmented Lagrangian active set method to solve the fully discretized complementarity problem. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the expected behaviour of the option prices and the corresponding total value adjustment, as well as the performance of the proposed numerical techniques . Moreover, we compare the numerical results from the PDEs approach with those obtained by applying Monte Carlo techniques .},

  abstract     = {Numerical modeling near-wall turbulent flows is one of major challenges in the fluid dynamics . It inevitably requires significant computational resources . To overcome these difficulties, there are two principal ways based on simplification of the mathematical model and development of ad-hoc computational approaches . The near-wall non-overlapping domain decomposition approach with the use of Robin interface boundary conditions proved to be very efficient. As has been shown, to apply this approach to essentially unsteady flows , the interface boundary conditions must be nonlocal in time and should be modified to include a memory term. In the current paper, it is proven that the memory term must be caused by the unsteadiness of both the solution at the interface boundary and driving force . The properties of the derived unsteady interface boundary conditions are studied in detail in the application to oscillatory and pulsating laminar flows in a channel and pipe. In particular, we study the effect of the memory term on the reproduction of the unsteady effects. The convergence to the exact solution is theoretically proven and numerically demonstrated. A practical calculation of the memory term is based on a Fourier expansion . It is also proven that the convergence is quadratic with respect to the inverse number of Fourier terms. A key question whether the near-wall domain decomposition can damage an external instability plays an important role to identify the perspectives of the technique to be extended to RANS/ LES (or DNS) decompositions.},

This especially includes crack problems in composites of functionally graded material types. The method is mainly presented in a boundary formulation, although it may be found quite useful in other mesh-based or mesh-less approaches as the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). The present paper considers harmonic and elasticity problems. The most distinguished advantage of the present method is that the solution progress advances without absolutely any knowledge of the analytical singularity order of the problem. To this end the partial differential equation of the problem is approximately satisfied in a weighted residual approach. After developing the formulation in a mapped polar co-ordination, some primary basis functions generated from Chebyshev polynomials and trigonometric functions, along with corresponding weight functions are employed. The numerical examples, either selected from the well-known literature or solved by well-established techniques, will demonstrate the capability of the method in problems related to composite materials.},

This construction uses the equivalent moment-space definition of BGK-type collision operators and the notion of stability structures as guiding principle for the choice of the equilibrium moments for those moments influencing the error term only but not the order of consistency. The presented structured approach is then applied to the 3D isothermal linearized Euler equations with non-vanishing background velocity.

  abstract     = {Nodal Integral Methods (NIM), although frequently used for solving neutron transport equations, have not found wider acceptance for solving fluid flow problems . One of the pivotal reasons behind this is the lack of efficient non-linear solvers for the system of coupled algebraic equations obtained by these methods, thus making such methods prohibitively expensive for highly nonlinear (higher Reynolds number) fluid flow problems. Successive improvements in earlier attempts resulted in an improved version called Modified NIM (MNIM) scheme; following which, a further modified version appeared (called as M 2 NIM), that used the concept of the delayed coefficients. Upon comparing the solutions obtained using MNIM and M 2 NIM schemes, respectively, it was observed that although the modified scheme with delayed coefficients (M 2 NIM) has significantly faster convergence, it is less accurate. The convergence and accuracy are very likely to suffer to a significant extent in the high Reynolds number fluid flows, especially when a large time-step is to be considered. In order to resolve these difficulties, a new type of physics-based predictor–corrector algorithm is proposed in the present study. In the proposed computational algorithm, the linearized M 2 NIM scheme is used to predict the solution, whereas the MNIM scheme is utilized to improve the predictive guess. The novelty of such a hybrid numerical algorithm comes from the fact that it combines the advantage of the faster convergence of M 2 NIM with the accuracy of the MNIM scheme. The algorithm also benefits from the unique inclusion of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method, which helps in getting rid of the formation of large Jacobian matrices , thereby reducing unnecessary computational overhead. The proposed methodology has been applied to solve a non-linear convection–diffusion problem, represented by the Burgers’ equation. The computational results for bothone-dimensional and two-dimensional Burgers’ equation are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed novel algorithm, as well as, the advantage it offers over the existing numerical methods .},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to seek proper stabilized Galerkin methods for solving the two-dimensional coupled Burgers’ equations at high Reynolds numbers . The stabilization techniques employed here include the streamline upwind/Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method, the spurious oscillations at layers diminishing (SOLD) method and the characteristic Galerkin (CG) method. The first two methods are combined with the Crank–Nicolson scheme for time discretization and the last one is applied in its semi-implicit version. Different from most of the studies on the equations which are usually devoted to improving the accuracy of computed solution in the case of low Reynolds numbers , this paper mainly focuses on keeping the stability of the solution at high Reynolds numbers , which is significant in practical applications and also challenging in numerical computation . We study two problems, equipped with mixed boundary conditions and only Dirichlet boundary conditions , respectively. Numerical experiments reveal that the SUPG method is optimal for the former problem, and the SOLD method is more appropriate for the latter one. In addition, the performances of these methods demonstrate the difference between the two problems, which is seldom mentioned previously and might be helpful to other conventional methods intending to solve the problems at high Reynolds numbers. And last, since SOLD methods have rarely been utilized to solve nonlinear unsteady problems before, this study also indicates the potential of this class of methods to solve nonlinear unsteady convection-dominated problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper a fully meshless method is proposed for the numerical solution of the one-dimensional multigroup neutron transport equation with anisotropic scattering. Both first-order and even-parity forms of the transport equation are studied. The radial basis function collocation method is chosen for the spatial treatment, and Legendre polynomials are used to approximate the angular variable. The selection of the Legendre polynomials instead of discrete ordinates approach resulted with a fully meshless algorithm in both independent variables. Multiquadric is utilized as the radial function . Seven problems are considered to evaluate the performance of the method. The results show that the method converges exponentially, and it is possible to obtain high levels of accuracies for the multiplication factor and neutron flux with a good stability in both spatial and angular domains . For the one-group isotropic benchmark problem, discrete ordinates solutions employing discontinuous linear finite elements for the spatial variable are also provided, and a comparison of the methods revealed that the fully meshless method produced more accurate results than the discrete ordinates-finite element scheme when the shape parameter is properly chosen.},

  abstract     = {In many instances of computational science and engineering the value of a definite integral of a known function f ( x ) f(x) is required in an interval. Nowadays there are plenty of methods that provide this quantity with a given accuracy. In one way or another, all of them assume an interpolating function , usually polynomial, that represents the original function either locally or globally. This paper presents a new way of calculating ∫ x 1 x 2 f ( x ) d x ∫x1x2f(x)dx by means of compact integration, in a similar way to the compact differentiation employed in computational physics and mathematics. Compact integration is a linear combination of definite integrals associated to an interval and its adjacent ones, written in terms of nodal values of f ( x ) f(x) . The coefficients that multiply both the integrals and f ( x ) f(x) at the nodes are obtained by matching terms in a Taylor series expansion . In this implicit method a system of algebraic equations is solved, where the vector of unknowns contains the integrals in each interval of a uniform discrete domain. As a result the definite integral over the whole domain is the sum of all these integrals. In this paper the mathematical tool is analyzed by deriving the appropriate coefficients for a given accuracy, and is exploited in various numerical examples and applications. The great accuracy of the method is highlighted.},

  abstract     = {We propose a Newton-type Gauss–Seidel Lax–Friedrichs sweeping method to solve the generalized eikonal equation arising from wave propagation in a moving fluid. The Lax–Friedrichs numerical Hamiltonian is used in discretization of the generalized eikonal equation. Different from traditional Lax–Friedrichs sweeping algorithms, we design a novel approach with a line-wise sweeping strategy. In the local solver, the values of traveltime on an entire line are updated simultaneously by Newton’s method. The global solution is then obtained by Gauss–Seidel iterations with line-wise sweepings. We first develop the Newton-based first-order scheme, and on top of that we further develop high-order schemes by applying weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) approximations to derivatives. Extensive 2-D and 3-D numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new algorithm. The combination of Newton’s method and Gauss–Seidel iterations improves upon the convergence speed of the original Lax–Friedrichs sweeping algorithm. In addition, the Newton-type sweeping method manipulates data in a vectorized manner so that it can be efficiently implemented in modern programming languages that feature array programming, and the resulting advantages are extremely significant for large-scale 3-D computations.},

Four case studies are designed not only to verify the developed basic TLLBM FORTRAN code but also to validate the results of the TLLBM for different conjugate natural convection problems. The convergence study of the presented TLLBM is also carried out and the order of accuracy of the method is reported in different mesh regions. It is concluded that the results of streamlines, isotherms, temperature distributions along a test line, and average Nusselt numbers calculated on the cold and hot walls of the enclosure are compared well with those available in the literature from conventional numerical methods as well as the standard LBM. The computational efficiency of the TLLBM is also examined through comparing the results of simulations on uniform (standard LBM) and non-uniform (TLLBM) meshes in terms of the accuracy and CPU time needed for solutions to converge. It is shown that the TLLBM is able to give accurate results with lower CPU time and mesh sizes than the standard LBM.},

While the detailed molecular scale physics is important in its own right, often a more useful scale to examine electrode performances is the micro and meso scale continuum. The detailed structure of microscale material parameters results from statistical mechanics and will not be discussed here, rather we focus on the micro scale homogenization to the meso scale wherein material parameters result from a micro scale “cell” problem for a periodic lattice . We apply a matched asymptotic formulation to obtain the meso scale field equations and material parameters. The finite element method (FEM) and finite volume method (FVM) are employed to solve the micro scale cell problem and the mesoscale field equations, respectively. Numerical results are presented for the electrical potential field and concentration of cations and anions . For a test case, it is observed that a doubling of the electrode area can create a ten-fold increase in the potential which has interesting implications for electrode design.},

  abstract     = {Variational time integrators are derived in the context of discrete mechanical systems . In this area, the governing equations for the motion of the mechanical system are built following two steps: (a) Postulating a discrete action; (b) Computing the stationary point of the discrete action. The former is formulated by considering Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) systems with the discrete action being constructed through numerical approximations of the action integral. The latter derives the discrete Euler–Lagrange equations whose solutions give the variational time integrator. In this paper, we build variational time integrators in the context of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). So, we start with a variational formulation of SPH for fluids. Then, we apply the generalized midpoint rule, which depends on a parameter α α , in order to generate the discrete action. Then, the step (b) yields a variational time integration scheme that reduces to an explicit approach if α ∈ { 0 , 1 } α∈{0,1} but it is implicit otherwise. Hence, we design a fixed point iterative method to approximate the solution and prove its convergence condition. Besides, we show that the obtained discrete Euler–Lagrange equations preserve linear momentum . In the experimental results, we simulate a bubble flow and a dam breaking set up and consider viscosity as well as boundary interaction effects. We compare standard and implicit SPH solutions. We analyze linear momentum conservation and other benchmark quantities to conclude that the proposed algorithm is accurate and preserves the linear momentum better than the counterpart one for dam breaking set up.},

  abstract     = {Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes comprise a number of flooding techniques aimed at increasing the operational life of mature oilfields. Among these, polymer flooding is one of the most developed; its functionality is to increment the aqueous viscosity , avoiding the formation of viscous fingering . Reservoir simulators consider this influence as well as other physical properties (e.g., adsorption, permeability reduction). However, the polymer degradation is usually not considered even though it plays a critical role in the viscosity. In this paper this mechanism is analyzed and coupled with the previously mentioned physical phenomena in order to present a complete study of their influence in the EOR process. Moreover, since a fully second-order accuracy scheme is used along with a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) flux-limiting function, the influence of the latter on the recovery factor is also discussed. Results showed that the negative effect of the polymer adsorption was the most relevant physical phenomenon in terms of the oil recovery. Furthermore, the analysis of the discretization of the differential equations showed that traditional, linear first-order schemes created numerical diffusion affecting negatively the macroscopic sweeping efficiency, which disappeared when TVD techniques were used. Reservoir simulators allow determining the desired designing properties for future polymers in relationship with the characteristics of the oilfield to be exploited.},

  abstract     = {Early estimation of biological growth of organisms is an indispensable task in ecology and related research areas. The biological growth is always time-continuous, while our observations of the phenomenon are time-discrete in practice. The formalism of the discrete costly observation (DCO) enables us to mathematically bridge the two qualitatively different processes. This formalism is still germinating, and its practical applications have not been carried out. This paper presents a first application of the DCO formalism to a cost-effective early estimation problem of the biological growth, and its mathematical and numerical analysis. Growth dynamics of organisms, which are fishery resources in this paper, is governed by a stochastic differential equation whose solution is observed discretely. The optimality equation to be solved for finding the most cost-effective observation policy is derived as a fixed point problem based on degenerate parabolic partial differential equations. The fixed point problem turns out to be uniquely solvable. A recursive approximation of the fixed point problem is presented and its solvability in a viscosity sense is discussed. A finite different scheme is then employed to fully-discretize the recursive equations. The present model is finally applied to a problem of Japanese smelt Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis (Ayu): an important inland fishery resource in Japan.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a conservative phase-field model for the simulation of immiscible multiphase flows is developed using an incompressible, velocity-based, cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM). Extensions are made to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) equations for interface tracking and incompressible hydrodynamics , proposed by Fakhari et al. [1] , by performing relaxation operations in central moment space. This was motivated by the work of Fei et al. [2] , [3] , where promising results from such a transformation were observed. The relaxation of central moments is defined in a reference frame moving with the fluid, while the existing multiple-relaxation time [4] , [5] scheme performs collision in a fixed frame of reference. Moreover, the derivations make use of continuous, Maxwellian distribution functions . As a result, the CLBM enhances the Galilean invariance and stability of the method when high lattice Mach numbers are evident. The cascaded scheme has been previously used in the literature to simulate multiphase flows based on the pseudo-potential model, where it allowed for high density and viscosity contrasts to be captured [6] , [7] . Here, the CLBM is implemented within the phase-field framework and is verified through the analysis of a layered Poiseuille flow . The performance of the CLBM is then investigated in terms of spurious currents, Galilean invariance and computational efficiency. Finally, the work of Fakhari et al. [1] is extended by validating the model’s ability to capture the relation between surface tension and the rise velocity of a planar Taylor bubble, in both stagnant and flowing fluids. New counter-current results indicate that the rise velocity model of Ha-Ngoc and Fabre [8] also applies in this regime.},

Furthermore, the system is analysed for nonlinear self-adjointness and the conservation laws are obtained associated with infinitesimal symmetries by applying new conservation theorem. The adjoint variables are used to convert conservation laws into original dependent variables .

Under investigation in this paper is a (2+1)-dimensional Gross–Pitaevskii equation with time-varying trapping potential which describes the dynamics of a (2+1)-dimensional BEC. Based on the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili hierarchy reduction, we construct the bilinear forms and the N th order rogue-wave solutions in terms of the Gramian. With the help of the analytic and graphic analysis, we exhibit the first- and second-order rogue waves under the influence of the strength of the interatomic interaction, α(t) , and of Ω(t)=ωR̃∕ωZ , where t is the scaled time, ωR̃ and ωZ are the confinement frequencies in the radial and axial directions : When Ω(t)=0 , the first-order rogue wave exhibits as an eye-shaped distribution; When Ω(t) is a periodic function, the rogue wave periodically raises; When Ω(t) is an exponential function, the rogue wave appears on the exponentially increasing background; When α(t) decreases, background and amplitude of the rogue wave both increase. The second-order rogue waves reach the maxima only once or three times when Ω(t) is a constant. With Ω(t) being the exponential function, the backgrounds of the second-order rogue waves exponentially increase with t increasing.},

While the asymptotic scaling of the direct solver’s computational cost is the same as the nested dissection method, serial implementations of the solution technique are not practical for large scale numerical simulations. This manuscript presents the first parallel implementation of the HPS method. Specifically, we introduce an approach for a shared memory implementation of the solution technique utilizing parallel linear algebra . This approach is the foundation for future large scale simulations on supercomputers and clusters with large memory nodes.

The convective FHN equations consist of the semi-linear activator and the linear inhibitor equations, modeling blood coagulation in moving excitable media. The semilinear activator equation leads to a non-convex optimal control problem (OCP). The most commonly used method in reduced optimal control is POD. We use DEIM and DMD to approximate efficiently the nonlinear terms in reduced order models. We compare the accuracy and computational times of three reduced-order optimal control solutions with the full order discontinuous Galerkin finite element solution of the convection dominated FHN equations with terminal controls.

It suppresses spurious oscillations, by evolving the solution implicitly at points where the solution shows a certain portent of oscillations or reduced smoothness, and maintains as a similar accuracy as the CN method with smooth data. An effective strategy is suggested for the detection of points where the solution may introduce spurious oscillations (the wobble set); the resulting variable- θ method is analyzed for its accuracy and stability.

Linear/quadratic elements near the interface were dynamically refined as an interface evolves in order to produce an accurate solution with a lower computational cost. An adaptive mesh refinement algorithm for a linear element has been extended to a quadratic element by using a node-reordering. The proposed algorithm was successfully validated by solving several benchmark problems. Simulation of a static bubble problem was found to give an accurate solution with negligible spurious currents compared with existing results. Simulation results of rising bubble problems in 2D and 3D were also compared against existing numerical and experimental results in terms of terminal rising speed and terminal bubble shape. We have found that the present algorithm provided stable and accurate solutions even for a high density-ratio and that the solution accuracy strongly depended on the mesh resolution near the interface. Further, the present algorithm was shown to be very efficient because the computational overhead by mesh-refinement algorithm was very small compared to the elapsed times consumed for solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and the advection/re-initialization equations of level set method. Lastly, the coalescence scenario of two oblique bubbles was well reproduced by the present 3D simulation .},

Also, some numerical results are presented to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed technique on the simple and complex domains with the irregular and non-regular grid points.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the coupling between two quasilinear diffusion equations: the diffusion coefficient of the first equation depends on its solution and the diffusion and convective coefficients of the second equation depend on the solution of the first one. This system can be used to describe the drug evolution in a target tissue when the drug transport is enhanced by heat. We study, from an analytical and a numerical viewpoints, the coupling of the heat equation with the drug diffusion equation. A fully discrete piecewise linear finite method is proposed to solve this system and its stability is studied. Assuming that the heat and the concentration are in H 3 H3 we prove that the method is second order convergent. Numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results and the global qualitative behaviour of the coupling are also included.},

Such methods, and in particular the CutFEM method, are attractive in the generation of projection-based reduced order models thanks to their capabilities to seamlessly handle large deformations of parametrized domains and in general to handle topological changes. The combination of embedded methods and reduced order models allows us to obtain fast evaluation of parametrized problems, avoiding remeshing as well as the reference domain formulation, often used in the reduced order modeling for boundary fitted finite element formulations . The resulting novel methodology is presented on linear elliptic and Stokes problems, together with several test cases to assess its capability. The role of a proper extension and transport of embedded solutions to a common background is analyzed in detail.},

Thus, the Allen–Cahn model with nonlocal constraints can serve as an alternative to the Cahn–Hilliard model in simulating crystal growth while conserving the mass of each phase.

The surplus process of the insurer and the return process of the financial market are both modulated by the external macroeconomic environment. The dynamic of the external macroeconomic environment is specified by a Markov chain with finite states. Once the insurer’s accumulated profits attain a new maximum, they have to pay high gain tax. The objective of the insurer is to maximize the expected terminal utility by investment and reinsurance. The controlled wealth process of the insurer turned out to be a controlled jump diffusion process with reflections and Markov regime switching. By the weak dynamic programming principle (WDPP), we prove that the value function is the unique viscosity solution to the coupled Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman (HJB) equations with first derivative boundary constraints. By the Markov chain approximating method for the HJB equations, we construct a numerical scheme for approximating the viscosity solution to the coupled HJB equations. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the impact of both high gain tax and regime switching on the optimal policies .},

We use these equations on a diffuse interface approach, where the properties of the fluid vary continuously across the interface that separates the different phases. The model is able to describe the behavior of both phases with the same set of equations, and it is also able to handle problems with great changes in the topology of the problem. However, high-order derivatives are present in NSK equations, which is a difficulty for the design of a numerical method to solve the problem. Here, we propose the use of a high-order Finite Volume method with Moving Least Squares approximations to handle high-order derivatives and solve the NSK equations. Moreover, a new methodology to obtain accurate equations of state is presented. In this method, we use any accurate equation of state for the pure phases. Under the saturation curve, a B-spline reconstruction fulfilling a given set of thermodynamic criteria is performed. The new EOS can be used for computations using diffuse interface modeling. Several numerical examples to show the accuracy of the new approach are presented.},

  abstract     = {In the present study, the combination of the Concentration Lattice Boltzmann Method and the Smoothed Profile Method (CLBM–SPM) was used to simulate the dissolution of circular particles between parallel plates moving in opposite directions. The hydrodynamics and fluid concentration simulation were performed based on the single relaxation time Lattice Boltzmann Method. LBM convection–diffusion equation was then used to solve the concentration of the solute in the fluid phase. Additionally, SPM was employed to apply the no-slip boundary condition at the solid–fluid interface and to calculate the concentration forces. Initially, the results of the numerical solution were compared with the ones presented in the literature. Then the effects of the initial solid volume fraction, the Schmidt number, the Reynolds number, and particle size were studied to examine the behavior of particles dissolution. The results showed that the smallest dissolution time in the systems with different volume fractions was in a one with the least solid volume fraction. As the volume fraction was increased, the solid–fluid mass transfer driving force was decreased in the system. Also, with the rise of the Schmidt number, the dissolution time was increased, due to the decrease of the diffusion coefficient of the fluid flow. Moreover, by increasing the Reynolds number, the time required for the volume fraction ratio to reach 0.05 of its initial value was reduced. Finally, the particle size in this system was studied. The results indicated that with the decrease in particle size (or increase in the surface area), we could significantly alter the dissolution time.},

We recall various elements of the state of the art for anti bounce back applied to linear heat and acoustics equations and in particular the possibility to take into account curved boundaries. We present an asymptotic analysis that allows an expansion of all the fields in the boundary cells. This analysis based on pure Taylor expansions confirms the well known behaviour of anti bounce back boundary for the heat equation. The analysis puts also in evidence a hidden differential boundary condition in the case of linear acoustics. Indeed, we observe discrepancies in the first layers near the boundary. To reduce these discrepancies, we propose a new boundary condition mixing bounce back for the oblique links and anti bounce back for the normal link. This boundary condition is able to enforce both pressure and tangential velocity on the boundary. Numerical tests for the Poiseuille flow illustrate our theoretical analysis and show improvements in the quality of the flow.},

Most models used nowadays are based on the pioneering work of Jeffery (1922), who obtained an equation for the motion of an ellipsoidal particle immersed in a Newtonian fluid , despite the fact that this model relies on strong assumptions: negligible inertia, unconfined flow, dilute regime, flow unperturbed by the presence of the suspended particle, etc. In this work, we propose a dumbbell-based model aimed to describe the motion of an inertial fibre or ellipsoid suspended in a Newtonian fluid . We then use this model to study the orientation kinematics of such particle in a linear shear flow and compare it to the inertialess case. In the case of fibres, we observe the appearance of periodic orbits (whereas inertialess fibres just align in the flow field). For spheroids , our model predicts an orbit drift towards the flow-gradient plane, either gradually (slight inertia) or by first rotating around a moving oblique axis (heavy particles). Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) simulations were carried out to assess the model predictions in the case of inertial fibres and revealed similar behaviours.},

In contrast to previous segregated finite element methods based on the SIMPLE algorithm, the pressure equation is derived from the continuity equation using the element matrices to ensure convergence. High-order element basis functions are adopted, which greatly reduces the number of nodal points used in the calculation. The validation test that has an analytical solution demonstrates the high accuracy and convergence rate of the method. The flow in a lid-driven cavity with different inclination angles and the flow over a backward-facing step are investigated to further illustrate the performance of the scheme. The computed results are in excellent agreement with the benchmark solutions. The almost periodic solution for the flow of Re =10000 in a lid-driven square cavity is also captured by the present scheme.},

  abstract     = {We consider as discretization in space, the GDM (Gradient Discretization Method) developed recently in Droniou et al. (2018), to approximate multidimensional time fractional diffusion and diffusion-wave equations where the fractional order α α of the time derivative is respectively satisfying 0 &lt; α &lt; 1 0&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;1 and 1 &lt; α &lt; 2 1&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;2 . The time fractional derivative is given in the Caputo sense. The time discretization is performed using a uniform mesh. For the time fractional diffusion equation, we derive an implicit scheme. In addition to an L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) -a priori estimate, which can be derived from a reasoning in Bradji (2018), we present and prove a new L 2 ( H 0 1 ) L2(H01) -a priori estimate for the discrete problem. Under the assumption that the exact solution is sufficiently smooth, these a priori estimates allow to prove error estimates in discrete norms of L 2 ( H 0 1 ) L2(H01) and L ∞ ( L 2 ) L∞(L2) . The convergence order in these estimates is optimal in the sense of two points of view. The first one is that the order in space is the same one proved in Droniou et al. (2018) for elliptic equation, whereas the second point of view is that the particular case of this order when α = 1 α=1 is the same one obtained in Droniou et al. (2018) for the standard heat equation. For the time fractional diffusion-wave equation, we derive two implicit schemes. A full convergence analysis is carried out for both schemes. In particular, we develop new a priori estimates which yield error estimates in several discrete norms for each scheme. The convergence is proved to be unconditional and optimal. The convergence results are obtained thanks to a comparison with appropriately chosen auxiliary gradient schemes and to the stated a priori estimates. These results improve the ones of Bradji (2017) in which a conditional convergence is proved for a SUSHI (Scheme using Stabilization and Hybrid Interfaces) approximating a time-fractional diffusion-wave equation. For both cases of time fractional diffusion and diffusion-wave equations, we show the well-posedness in the sense that the discrete solutions depend continuously on the data of the considered problems. The stated results can be extended to multi-term time-fractional diffusion and diffusion-wave equations. One of the main features when using GDM is that their results hold for all the schemes within the framework of GDM: conforming and nonconforming finite element , mixed finite element , hybrid mixed mimetic family, some Multi-Point Flux approximation finite volume schemes, and some discontinuous Galerkin schemes. Some examples of schemes recovered by the GSs (Gradient Schemes) presented in this work are sketched. Among these examples, we quote the one presented in Jin et al. (2015) to approximate time fractional diffusion equations. This work extends and improves some results presented in brief or stated without proof in the notes Bradji (2018). We present some numerical tests using SUSHI introduced in Eymard et al. (2010) to support the theoretical results.},

An important application of distributed-order diffusions is to model ultraslow diffusion where a plume of particles spreads at a logarithmic rate. To broaden the range of applicability of distributed-order fractional diffusion models, efficient numerical methods are needed to solve the model equation. In this work, we develop spectral tau schemes to discretize the fractional diffusion equation with distributed-order fractional derivative in time and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The model solution is expanded in multi-dimensions in terms of Legendre polynomials and the discrete equations are obtained with the tau method. Numerical examples are provided to highlight the convergence rate and the flexibility of this approach. The proposed spectral tau methods yield an exponential rate of convergence when the solution is smooth. Our results confirm that nonlocal numerical methods are best suited to discretize distributed-order fractional differential equations as they naturally take the global behavior of the solution into account.},

By means of a computation method of induction, it is shown that the difference of solutions near the initial time is integrable of k p − 2 k + 2 order. This higher-order integrability shows continuity of the solution operator from the square Lebesgue space to ( k p − 2 k + 2 ) -order Lebesgue spaces. In particular, the ( 2 p − 2 ) -order integrability shows continuity of the solution operator from the square Lebesgue space to the Sobolev space, which further shows existence of a random attractor in the Sobolev space when the initial space is the square Lebesgue space. Moreover, the higher-order integrability can be uniform with respect to all thin domains, which provides uniformly asymptotic compactness of the random dynamical systems. As a conclusion, the upper semi-continuity of attractors under the Sobolev norm is established when the narrow domain degenerates onto a lower dimensional domain.},

However, the vast majority of the literatures focus on pricing the single asset option under the FPDE framework. In this paper, a two-dimensional FPDE governing the valuation of rainbow options is established, where two underlying assets are assumed to follow independent exponential Lévy processes, and its boundary conditions are determined by solving one-dimensional FPDEs. A second-order accurate finite difference scheme is proposed to discretize the two-dimensional FPDE. Given the block Toeplitz with Toeplitz block structure of the coefficient matrix, a fast preconditioned Krylov subspace method is developed for solving the resulting linear system with O ( N log N ) O(NlogN) computational complexity per iteration, where N N is the matrix size. The proposed preconditioner accelerates the convergence of the iterative method with theoretical analysis. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {In real world, especially in the field of pattern recognition, a matrix formed from images, visions, speech sounds or so forth under certain conditions usually subjects to a low-rank subspace structure. Sparse noise, small noise and so on can be eliminated by the low-rank property of this matrix, leading to the well-known low-rank representation problem. At present, existing algorithms for this problem still need to be improved in the aspects of the recovery accuracy of low-rank component and sparse component, the clustering accuracy of subspaces’ data and their convergence rate. This paper proposes a low-rank matrix decomposition non-convex optimization extended model without nuclear norm . Motivated by human walking, we combine the direction and step size iterative formula with the alternating direction minimization idea for the sake of decomposing the original optimization model that is difficult to be solved into three comparatively easily solved sub-optimization models. On the basis of these, Low-Rank and Sparse Matrices Fitting Algorithm (LSMF) is presented for the sub-models in this paper, which quickly alternates the search direction matrices and the corresponding step sizes. Theoretically, it is proved that LSMF converges to a stable point of the extended model. In simulation experiments, better results are achieved in the three aspects under appropriate conditions. The face denoising and background/foreground separation further demonstrate the capability of LSMF on handling large-scale and contaminated dataset.},

We use the interpolating moving least squares method instead of the moving least squares approximation to construct meshless shape functions with delta function properties. Then the flux boundary condition of the Darcy–Forchheimer model can be handled easily. Hughes’ variational multiscale (HVM) method is applied to overcome the numerical oscillation caused by equal-order basis for the velocity and pressure. Moreover, the HVM ensures that the resultant formulation in the VMIEFG method is consistent and the stabilization parameter (or tensor) appears naturally. Consequently, the stabilization parameter is free of user-defined. The fixed point iteration method is used to deal with the nonlinear term . Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the stability and performance of the proposed method for solving the nonlinear Darcy–Forchheimer model.},

Since only the linear polynomials need to be prepared for reconstruction, this limiter is very simple and compact with a stencil including only the target cell and its immediate neighboring cells.

Essentially, the procedure consists in computing suitable initial conditions for the currents in the rotor bars, thus allowing to obtain the steady-state fields of the machine by solving a transient magnetic model in just a few revolutions. Firstly, the mathematical model that simulates the behavior of the machine is introduced. Then, an approximation of this model is developed, from which suitable initial currents are derived by computing the solution in the least-square sense to an overdetermined problem with only two unknowns. Finally, the method is applied to a particular induction machine working under different operating conditions. The results show important computational savings to reach the motor steady-state in comparison with assuming zero initial conditions, which validate the efficiency of the procedure.},

The reduced order model presented herein accounts for velocity, pressure, and a transport-related variable. The pressure term at both the full order and the reduced order level is reconstructed making use of a projection method. More precisely, a Poisson equation for pressure is considered within the reduced order model. Results are verified against three-dimensional manufactured test cases.

We implement an implicit time integration scheme and apply, for each space-direction, a stabilized mixed method based on residual minimization. We show that the resulting system of linear equations has a Kronecker product structure, which results in a linear computational cost of the direct solver, even using implicit time integration schemes together with the stabilized mixed formulation.

  abstract     = {Modelling the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic interactions of suspended particles is a significant and ongoing numerical challenge. Addressing this is necessary in order to be able to fully model numerous industrial and scientific processes of practical interest. This paper describes extensions to a local and a non-local technique for the calculation of transient conjugate heat transfer within a lattice Boltzmann framework. The interface transition between phases in both methods has been incorporated via a partially saturated boundary condition that weights material properties and allows straight and curved boundaries to be captured. Transient and steady-state performance of the two methods has been compared using a number of static and dynamic problems to evaluate their suitability for modelling particle suspensions. In a number of the static tests the non-local method produced better results however for the dynamic cases the local method demonstrated more accurate behaviour.},

  abstract     = {All explicit immersed boundary–lattice Boltzmann (IB–LB) coupling schemes suffer from instability and restrictive choices of timestep and boundary rigidity . In this paper, an implicit IB–LB coupling method that can greatly alleviate those problems and easily incorporate the boundary mass is presented. The nonlinear equations resulting from the implicit discretization of the immersed boundary (IB) equations are solved by the Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) method, while the boundary mass is handled by introducing ghost boundaries. The improvement in stability is verified by two benchmark cases, and it is evident that both the maximal timestep and bending rigidity attained by the proposed implicit method can increase up to 200 times compared with those of the explicit version. The new method is applied to analyzing the vortex induced vibration of an impulsively started flexible filament, and both the simulated flow field and filament motion agree well with those obtained by particle image velocimetry (PIV). The influences of filament parameters on the vibration characteristics are discussed, and according to the results, the filament mass is the main influencing factor of vibration amplitude and the bending rigidity is the main influencing factor of vibration frequency .},

  abstract     = {Given the complex geometries usually found in practical applications, the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is becoming increasingly attractive for flow simulations. In addition to the simple treatment of intricate geometrical configurations, LB solvers can be implemented on very large parallel clusters with excellent scalability. However, reacting flows lead to additional challenges and have seldom been studied by LB methods. In this study, an in-house low Mach number Lattice Boltzmann solver, ALBORZ, has been extended to take into account multiple chemical components and reactions. For this purpose, the temperature and species of each mass fraction field are modeled through separate distribution functions. The flow distribution function is assumed to be independent of temperature and species mass fractions, which is valid in the limit of weak density variations. In order to compute reaction terms as well as variable thermodynamic and transport properties, the LB code has been coupled to another library of our group, REGATH. In this manner, LB simulations with detailed chemical kinetics and thermo-chemical models become possible. Since the code is currently limited to weak density variation, its performance has been checked for a laminar premixed as well as non-premixed counter-flow Ozone/Air reacting flow, describing kinetics with 4 species and 18 elementary reactions. Comparisons of the obtained reacting flow structures with results from classical finite-difference simulations show excellent agreement.},

First, numerical validation is performed by comparing the MRT-LBM results of power-law fluid flow inside the wall-driven square enclosure (no undulation) and flow inside diagonally flipped L-shaped enclosure with the literature. The strain rate profiles for square enclosure without undulations are compared using various equations available for strain rate calculation in the LBM literature. Further, the effect of different values of the non-hydrodynamic relaxation parameters on the flow is examined. Then, for the undulated enclosures, flow features and eddy dynamics are analyzed and discussed for the variations in the power-law index, n n , to represent shear-thinning and shear thickening fluids. The effects of various parameters such as Reynolds numbers, wall undulation heights and wavelength of undulations on the power-law fluid flow are analyzed. Also, the variation of viscosity with spatial location for steady-state flow and total kinetic energy within the computational domain are presented for various values of power-law index.},

  abstract     = {Seeding of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) into a porous scaffold , as the first step in bone tissue engineering , determines the initial cell spatial distribution and further generating of engineered bone grafts. The immersed boundary (IB)–lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is used to study the dynamic seeding behavior of cells in a simplified scaffold. In this method, the multiple-relaxation-time version of LB method is employed as the fluid solver. An energy constitutive model for the cell is coupled with the fluid using the IB method . An adhesive dynamics model is employed to simulate the stochastic formation and breakage of receptor–ligand bonds. The present method was first validated by studying a capsule deformation in a simple shear flow . The cell model was calibrated based on the deformation of the MSC in a constricted microfluidic channel . Then perfusion of cells into pore structures was simulated to characterize cell motion during the seeding process. The distribution of formed bonds indicates that cells most likely adhere to the pore throats. The cells present different motion characteristics due to distinct adhesion status. The number of bonds plays an important role in determining the adhesion status. The cell-scale deformation and adhesion involved in this study provide more detailed mechanism which is difficult to investigate through experiments. The present method can also be extended to large-scale realistic scaffold contributing to the optimization and development of the seeding process.},

LBMs usually operate on equidistant Cartesian grids and represent moving geometries by either using immersed boundary conditions or dynamic fill algorithms in combination with slip or no-slip boundary conditions. In order to obtain sufficiently high geometric accuracy , the sub-grid distances from Eulerian fluid nodes on uniform and structured grids to a tessellated triangular surface mesh have to be calculated. The proposed algorithm extends a previously published grid generation procedure by an efficient calculation of sub-grid distances. The algorithm is optimized for massively parallel execution on graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on a linearized representation of the obstacle surface, surface normal vectors are computed and stored, which then serve to compute the sub-grid distances. This saves GPU memory, re-uses information that is available from the surface voxelization step, and has shown to be very accurate and efficient for the implementation in a state-of-the-art LBM-GPU solver.},

  abstract     = {A complex fluid flow often involves passive scalars that are transported with the flow field but can be neglected regarding the fluid motion, such as concentration distributions, markers, or temperature fields. Using the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for fluid dynamic simulations, different approaches for coupling advection solvers to the fluid motion exist. The aim of this work is to give an overview of four different methods used for solving the advection equation. Two of these solvers are based on finite differences, namely the Lax–Wendroff method (Lax and Wendroff, 1960) and an extension from Succi et al. (1999) that artificially reduces numerical diffusion. The other two methods Onishi et al. (2005) and Osmanlic and Körner (2016) take advantage of the already available LB distribution functions, instead of depending on macroscopic quantities only. In the ansatz of Onishi et al. (2005) the local concentration flux is calculated from distribution functions directly, while in a similar approach used by Osmanlic and Körner (2016) an additional case distinction is made between incoming and outgoing flux. Besides investigating the order of accuracy and grid dependency, numerical diffusion is examined closely with the objective to simulate fluid flow that is solely determined by advection and contains no physical diffusion.},

The proposed parametrisation consists of linking the variables representing a lattice-dependent porosity with the control variables.
