  abstract     = {Expert finding in Community Question Answering (CQA) networks such as Stack Overflow is a practical issue facing a challenging problem called vocabulary gap. A widely used approach to overcome this problem is translation model . Different from prior works that only consider the relevancy of translations to a query, we intend to diversify query translations for better coverage of query topics. In this work, we have utilized the idea of clustering to group relevant translations to a given query into different clusters and then select representatives from each cluster as a set of diverse translations. We have proposed two new approaches to cluster translations. In the first one, the Mutual Information was primarily utilized as a similarity measure during clustering. In the second approach, the relevant translations are embedded in a topic space and then clustered in that space. After clustering, we propose two batch and sequential methods to select a diverse set of translations from the resultant clusters. The batch method selects the top most relevant translations from each cluster proportional to the relevancy of that cluster to the user query. The sequential one is an iterative method that looks for the most diverse set of translations considering the previously selected ones. Finally, to rank users, a regression model was utilized to learn how expert and non-expert users differ in using a set of diverse translations in their documents. Experiments on a large dataset generated from Stack Overflow demonstrate that the proposed methods improve the ranking performance over baselines in the expert finding.},

  abstract     = {Although the upper echelons theory posits that senior executives&#39; personal characteristics influence firm performance, very few studies have examined the impact of the interplay between CEO and CFO characteristics on corporate activities. To fill this research gap, we propose an econometric analysis model to examine the interplay between the personality traits of CEOs and CFOs and corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) intensity. In particular, our econometric analysis model is empowered by novel personality constructs extracted using a state-of-the-art machine learning-based personality detector that automatically mines CEO/CFO personality traits from firms&#39; earnings call transcripts. Based on historical M&amp;A data of S&amp;P 1500 firms, our econometric analysis reveals that the “openness” personality trait of CEOs is positively associated with corporate M&amp;A intensity, while CEOs&#39; “consciousness” and “neuroticism” personality traits are negatively associated with corporate M&amp;A intensity. Moreover, the impacts of CEOs&#39; “openness” and “consciousness” personality traits on corporate M&amp;A intensity are more pronounced when CFOs have similar personality traits to those of CEOs.},

We compared 9342 players&#39; daily gameplay for a month before and after updates across eighteen updates over seven online games. There are two novel findings. First, middle-ranked players tend to play the game more than high and low-ranked players before an update. Second, contrary to the widespread notion that game updates trigger players to increase their gameplay, online game updates only increase the gameplay of high and low-ranked players.

  abstract     = {Financial statement fraud is an area of significant consternation for potential investors, auditing companies, and state regulators. The paper proposes an approach for detecting statement fraud through the combination of information from financial ratios and managerial comments within corporate annual reports. We employ a hierarchical attention network (HAN) to extract text features from the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) section of annual reports. The model is designed to offer two distinct features. First, it reflects the structured hierarchy of documents, which previous approaches were unable to capture. Second, the model embodies two different attention mechanisms at the word and sentence level, which allows content to be differentiated in terms of its importance in the process of constructing the document representation. As a result of its architecture, the model captures both content and context of managerial comments, which serve as supplementary predictors to financial ratios in the detection of fraudulent reporting. Additionally, the model provides interpretable indicators denoted as “red-flag” sentences, which assist stakeholders in their process of determining whether further investigation of a specific annual report is required. Empirical results demonstrate that textual features of MD&amp;A sections extracted by HAN yield promising classification results and substantially reinforce financial ratios.},

  abstract     = {Online stores currently use recommendation systems (RSs) quasi-universally to provide their customers with added value and increase their profits, thus reshaping the world of e-commerce. RSs, however, depend on the availability of e-commerce user data to be effective. Nevertheless, data privacy regulations are increasingly becoming more restrictive and e-commerce users more aware of and concerned about their data being collected, stored, and processed for RSs. On the other hand, in the RSs context, there is currently a very limited understanding of e-commerce users&#39; attitudes toward data privacy and of these attitudes&#39; antecedents. This study examines the influence that an RS&#39;s perceived usefulness has on e-commerce users in terms of a specific RS collecting, storing, and processing their data. In addition, this study investigates the extent to which RSs&#39; overall relevance for users depends on their perceived usefulness and users&#39; degree of consent. We conducted an online survey of 597 e-commerce users, thereafter analyzing the data by means of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that an RS&#39;s perceived usefulness positively and significantly influences the extent to which users consent to the RS&#39;s provider collecting and storing their data, which in turn also impact RSs&#39; overall relevance for e-commerce users. The findings have practical implications for e-commerce industry players, as well as for national and international authorities responsible for online data privacy regulations},

Because such traditional node evaluators do not take full advantage of group members&#39; individual criminal propensities, a new evaluator called the social network criminal suspect evaluator ( SNCSE ) is proposed. SNCSE incorporates members&#39; individual criminal propensities into the node importance evaluation and employs a novel perspective based on concepts of human and social capital, an ego network structure, and an analogy between social interaction and field theory. SNCSE is applied to solve two real-world problems. Its effectiveness is compared with that of traditional evaluators. The results show that integrating criminal propensity into network analysis enables the more accurate identification of key suspects compared to alternative evaluators.},

  abstract     = {Microtasking is a type of crowdsourcing, denoting the act of breaking a job into several tasks and allocating them to multiple workers to complete. The assignment of tasks to workers is a complex decision-making process, particularly when considering budget and quality constraints. While there is a growing body of knowledge on the development of task assignment algorithms, the current algorithms suffer from shortcomings including: after-worker quality estimation , meaning that workers need to complete all tasks after which point their quality can be estimated; and one-off quality estimation method which estimates workers&#39; quality only at the start of microtasking using a set of pre-defined quality-control tasks. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo–based task assignment approach known as MCMC-TA which provides iterative estimations of workers&#39; quality and dynamic task assignment. Specifically, we apply Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to estimate workers&#39; quality and Markov Chain Monte Carlo to shortlist workers for task assignment. We use Google Fact Evaluation dataset to measure the performance of MCMC-TA and compare it against the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of AUC and F-Score. The results show that the proposed MCMC-TA algorithm not only outperforms the rival algorithms, but also offers a spammer-resistant result that maximizes the learning of workers&#39; quality with minimal budget.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, many companies face shorter product life cycles, increasing the need to properly forecast demand for newly introduced products. These forecasts allow them to support operational decisions, such as procurement and inventory control. However, forecasting the demand of new products is challenging compared to existing products, since historical sales data is not available as an indicator of future sales. Moreover, little attention has been paid in literature to quantitative methods for new product forecasting, especially with respect to quantifying the uncertainty in demand. In this paper, we present a novel demand forecasting method denoted by DemandForest, which combines K-means, Random Forest, and Quantile Regression Forest. This machine learning-based approach combines the historical sales data of previously introduced products and product characteristics of existing and new products to make prelaunch forecasts and support inventory management decisions for new products. DemandForest clusters and predicts demand patterns, and predicts the quantiles of the total demand during an introduction period. We validate and illustrate our approach for forecasting and inventory management using real-world data sets of several companies. Compared to several benchmark methods, DemandForest provides the most accurate predictions, resulting in potential inventory savings of around 15% depending on lead times and service levels.},

In recent years, ransomware attacks have resulted in critical data and financial losses to individuals and industries. These disruptions force the need for developing effective anti-ransomware methods in the research community. However, most of the existing techniques are designed to detect a specific ransomware variant instead of providing a generic solution mainly because of the obfuscation techniques used by ransomware or the use of static analysis methods. In this context, this paper proposes a novel ransomware-detection technique that identifies ransomware attacks by evaluating the current state of a computer system with knowledge of a ransomware attack. The finite-state machine model is used to synthesise the knowledge of the ransomware attack with respect to the victim machine. The proposed method monitors the changes happening in the computer system in terms of utilisation, persistence, and lateral movement of its resources to detect ransomware attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately detect attacks from different ransomware variants with significantly few false predictions.},

The proposed “add-the-best” family of heuristics constructs a portfolio by iteratively adding a project that is best in a greedy sense, with various definitions of “best”. We present analytical results showing that information savings achievable by heuristics can be considerable; a simulation experiment showing that portfolios selected by heuristics can be close to optimal under certain conditions; and a behavioral laboratory experiment demonstrating that choices are often consistent with the use of heuristics. Add-the-best heuristics combine descriptive plausibility with effort-accuracy trade-offs that make them potentially attractive for prescriptive use.},

  abstract     = {Low attendance levels in medical appointments have been associated with poor health outcomes and efficiency problems for service providers. To address this problem, healthcare managers could aim at improving attendance levels or minimizing the operational impact of no-shows by adapting resource allocation policies. However, given the uncertainty of patient behaviour, generating relevant information regarding no-show probabilities could support the decision-making process for both approaches. In this context many researchers have used multiple regression models to identify patient and appointment characteristics than can be used as good predictors for no-show probabilities. This work develops a Decision Support System (DSS) to support the implementation of strategies to encourage attendance, for a preventive care program targeted at underserved communities in Bogotá, Colombia. Our contribution to literature is threefold. Firstly, we assess the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy of regression models. In particular, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used to model the problem accounting for non-linearity and variable interactions. Secondly, we propose a novel use of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation in order to improve the explainability of neural network predictions and obtain insights from the modelling step. Thirdly, we identify variables explaining no-show probabilities in a developing context and study its policy implications and potential for improving healthcare access. In addition to quantifying relationships reported in previous studies, we find that income and neighbourhood crime statistics affect no-show probabilities. Our results will support patient prioritization in a pilot behavioural intervention and will inform appointment planning decisions.},

  abstract     = {The use and popularity of online auctions is growing all over the world. Bidding strategies are important because they are related to an auction&#39;s final price and ultimately its revenue. This study investigates the bidding strategies adopted by online bidders and the factors of the bidders, including bidding motivations, time availability, bidding experience, and risk aversion. We use the data from China to test the model and identify three bidding strategies in single-unit auctions: agent bidding, snipe bidding, and ratchet bidding. By running logistic regression , we find that hedonic motivations, utilitarian motivations, time availability, bidding experience, and risk preference all influence online bidding strategies. We also conduct pairwise comparisons of bidding strategies based on these factors and a simulation experiment to compare the benefits brought by different bidding strategies. We conclude by discussing the implications for both research and practice.},

RSs are widely used in various fields to capture and summarize individuals&#39; opinions on alternatives. In this paper we argue that the multi-attribute additive value model (MAVM) should be used as a benchmark to analyze the reliability of RSs, and present some tight bounds on the parameter N and overall rating scores, which guarantee the consistency between the RS [0, N ] and MAVM at the ranking and rating levels. Interestingly, the tight bounds at the rating level are twice as large as those at the ranking level. The results in this paper can provide new insights about the reliability analysis of RSs.},

  abstract     = {Social networking site (SNS) driven e-commerce, the latest social commerce (s-commerce) phenomenon, gains prominence with the introduction of the call-to-action feature. The call-to-action feature on any sponsored post or advertisement on SNS redirects the user to a linked e-commerce website that offers the product. Information cues available on the SNS are expected to influence user decision making on the linked e-commerce site. Set in the context of Facebook driven e-commerce, this study explores how likes on Facebook influence user&#39;s purchase and recommendation decisions on a linked e-commerce website. Using controlled experiments we find that a higher volume of likes on Facebook leads to a higher likelihood of purchasing and recommending a product on the linked e-commerce site. This effect is found to be mediated by the user&#39;s initial product attitude formed on Facebook. An additional analysis examining the strength of the influence reveals that the mere presence of likes is not sufficient to impact the user&#39;s decision making . In fact, a low volume of likes elicits user behavior similar to absence of likes. The influence is effective only if the number of likes is substantially high. The findings of the study add to the s-commerce literature by establishing the inter-site influence of Facebook likes on user&#39;s purchase and post-purchase decisions and providing empirical evidence of the efficacy of SNS-driven e-commerce.},

Extant research demonstrates that supply chain and operations management functions are among the biggest sources and users of data in the company. Therefore, their decision-making processes would benefit from increased use of BDA technologies . However, there is still a lack of understanding of what determines a company&#39;s ability to build BDA capability to gain a competitive advantage. In this study, we attempt to answer this fundamental question by identifying the factors that assist a company in or inhibit it from building its BDA capability and maximizing its gains through BDA technologies. We base our findings on a qualitative analysis of data collected from field visits, interviews with senior management, and secondary resources. We find that, in addition to technical capacity, competitive landscape and intra-firm power dynamics play an important role in building BDA capability and using BDA technologies.},

  abstract     = {Due to the ageing population and the prevalence of chronic diseases , Home Health Care (HHC) practices are significantly increasing in developed countries to provide coordinated health related services to patients at their homes. Accordingly, the scope of HHC services is also expanding from typical nursing and postoperative care at home to cover all types of needs of elderly patients (e.g., personal care, drug delivery and meal services). This paper aims to address the pressing demand for HHC services and develop a novel and effective mathematical model and solution methodology for supporting health care service delivery decisions. Our decision support framework captures the real needs of HHC services, including the challenges of creating simultaneous schedules and route plans for a set of HHC staff and Home Delivery Vehicles (HDVs) under the requirements of synchronization between HHC staff and HDVs visits, multiple visits to patients, multiple routes of HDVs and pickup/delivery visits related precedence for HDVs. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to characterize the optimization problem . Considering the computational complexity of the problem, a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (HGA) is proposed to suggest HHC planning decisions. The model formulation and proposed HGA are examined on real-life instances for demonstrating its practicality and randomly generated test instances for assessing the scalability of the proposed approach. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution methodology. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provided a good performance even with an increasing number of required synchronized services, whereas the heuristic tactics facilitate the HGA to produce better-quality solutions in a significantly shorter time. Our framework is expected to contribute to an important aspect of shared healthcare mobility.},

  abstract     = {A large amount of research on recommender systems has focused on improving the accuracy of suggestions in offline settings. However, this focus and the commonly used techniques can lead to a “filter bubble”, severely limiting the diversity of content discovered by users. Several offline studies show that this can be mitigated by using experts for recommendation. In contrast to standard recommender systems, experts are able to generate more diverse recommendations and increase the novelty of given suggestions. They can be used in missing-data or cold-start scenarios and reduce noise in the users&#39; ratings. This paper examines the impact of employed experts&#39; recommendations on user behavior for a real-world recommender system on a popular video-on-demand website, provided by a large television network. We study whether the potential benefits of experts lead to differences in user behavior, user perceptions and properties of given recommendations (e.g., diversity). We find that enriching a state-of-the-art system with the suggestions of employed experts can significantly increase platform use. Even though expert recommendations are used less frequently and are less successful than expected, users watch a greater number of clips, use more recommendations, and come back to the website more frequently when they receive expert suggestions. When searching for other influencing factors, we find that experts generate more diverse recommendations and improve the taste coverage of the system keeping user satisfaction unaffected. In summary, our results show large benefits of using employed experts and have implications for the design and use of recommender systems in real-world scenarios.},

The net considers not only the factors leading to the production of the data quality problem by the data operation nodes and the data flow structure, but also the data transfer ratio of the nodes. Then, we propose a nonlinear programming optimization model with control resource constraints. The result of the model provides an optimal strategy to allocate resources for minimizing the expected data quality problem of an information system. Further, we examine the impact of the data flow structure on optimal resource allocation . The result shows that the optimal resource input level for a data operation node is proportional to its potential for downstream propagation .

This paper proposes a specific DSS to improve the daily operation of an industrial heat-recovery section (a network of heat exchangers) in a fiber-production factory. In this process, the aim is to optimize the resource utilization in real time while satisfying a set of production constraints. The operational decisions to be taken by the network operators is to set up the heat-source allocation to heat exchangers . Furthermore, the heat transfer decreases over time due to fouling in the exchangers, so an additional decision to take is which exchanger to clean and when. The proposed model-based DSS builds upon a rigorous mathematical representation of the network, integrating continuous operation with the discrete decisions on maintenance. Then, a mixed-integer nonlinear optimization , solved in real time, drives the analysis and choice phases to fulfill product specifications according to an economic criterion. In this way, the proposed DSS not only provides the user with a right allocation of heat sources to exchangers, but also suggests which of them are potentially beneficial to be cleaned.},

Thus, providing decision aids to design novices is becoming increasingly important. In this research, we investigate taxonomy-based and tags-based decision aids. We draw on cognitive fit theory to construct a research model explaining the relationship between different decision aids and selection accuracy while considering the cognitive effort and the decision styles of novice designers. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a between-subject laboratory experiment with 195 subjects. Our experimental results provide extensive support to our hypotheses. Taxonomy-based decision aids outperform tags-based decision aids concerning selection accuracy mediated by cognitive effort. Furthermore, the results suggest rational decision style as a moderator in the relationship between taxonomy-based decision aids and selection accuracy. Our results have practical implications: First, taxonomy-based decision aids should be primarily leveraged on decision support platforms supporting design processes. Second, design novices&#39; decision style and cognitive effort are influential factors when developing decision aids to support digital service design processes.},

  abstract     = {E-commerce consumers often face complex product choices and have to make decisions at various times of the day. Extant research has primarily focused on providing decision aids and eliminating “distracting” features to help consumers&#39; conscious thought when making complex decisions. Our research adopts a novel perspective that consumers&#39; unconscious thought may have some advantages and be exploited to help consumers make complex purchase decisions, especially when one&#39;s circadian preference (optimal time of day for decision-making, e.g., morning vs. evening) is not met. Drawing on the Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT), we developed two hypotheses regarding the effects of consumers&#39; unconscious thought and its interaction with consumer circadian preference on decision quality. A controlled experiment was conducted to test our hypotheses. The findings show that unconscious thought outperforms conscious thought for making complex product choices in general and such effects are amplified when there is an asynchrony between one&#39;s circadian preference and the time of decision. The new circadian synchrony perspective enriches our understanding of the effects of unconscious thought on decision-making, helps explain the somewhat mixed findings in prior work on UTT, and thus contributes back to the UTT literature. The findings have implications about how unconscious thought can be leveraged to facilitate online shopping, and underscores the importance of considering consumer&#39;s circadian preference and time of decision.},

  abstract     = {The overarching goal of this paper is to develop a modeling framework that can be used to obtain personalized, data-driven and monotonically constrained probability curves. This research is motivated by the important problem of improving the predictions for organ transplantation outcomes, which can inform updates made to organ allocation protocols, post-transplantation care pathways , and clinical resource utilization. In pursuit of our overarching goal and motivating problem, we propose a novel two-stage machine learning-based framework for obtaining monotonic probabilities over time. The first stage uses the standard approach of using independent machine learning models to predict transplantation outcomes for each time-period of interest. In the second stage, we calibrate the survival probabilities over time using isotonic regression. To show the utility of our framework, we applied it on a national registry of U.S. heart transplants from 1987 to 2016. The first stage produces an area under the receiver operating curve ( AUC ) between 0.60 and 0.71 for years 1–10. While the 1-year prediction AUC result is comparable to the reported results in the literature, our 10-year AUC of 0.70 is higher than the current state-of-the-art results. More importantly, we show that the application of isotonic regression to calibrate the survival probabilities for each patient over the 10-year period guarantees monotonicity, while capitalizing on the data-driven and individualized nature of machine learning models. To promote future research, our code and analysis are publicly available on GitHub. Furthermore, we created a web app titled “H-TOP: Heart Transplantation Outcome Predictor” to encourage practical applications.},

Although various techniques have been proposed to address this problem in various industries , a robust methodology that is capable of explicitly considering the presence of uncertainty/vagueness is still a necessity. Therefore, with this study, we propose an integrated methodology that leverages Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE) methods under Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IF) environment. Within the proposed methodology, firstly, the IF-DEMATEL method is employed to obtain the importance-weights of the elicited criteria, and then the IF-ELECTRE method is formulated and applied to rank the candidates based on cardinal and ordinal evaluations. To illustrate the viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is performed at an air-filter manufacturing company. Hence, this study aims to contribute to the theoretical and practical extent of the related literature by proposing and illustrating an integrated analytics methodology capable of addressing personnel selection decisions in complex and imprecise real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {With the goal of devising algorithms for decision support in operational tasks, we introduce a new methodology for the automated configuration of algorithms for combinatorial online optimization problems . The procedure draws upon available instance data and is capable of recognizing data patterns which prove beneficial to the overall outcome. Since online optimization requires repetitive decision making without complete future information, no online algorithm can be optimal for every instance and it is reasonable to restrict attention to rule-based algorithms. We consider such algorithms in the form of procedures which derive their decisions using a threshold value. Threshold values are computed by evaluating a mathematical term (threshold value expression) composed of the available instance data elements. The goal then consists of determining the structure of the threshold value expression leading to the best algorithm performance. To this end, we employ a simulated annealing scheme returning the most favorable term composition given the available instance data. The resulting methodology can be implemented as part of data-driven decision support systems in order to facilitate knowledge-based decision making. Decision rules are generated in an automated fashion once historical input data is provided. The methodology is successfully instantiated in a series of computational experiments for three classes of combinatorial online optimization problems (scheduling, packing, lot sizing). Results show that automatically configured online algorithms are even capable of substantially outperforming well-known online algorithms in respective problem settings. We attribute this effect to the methodology&#39;s capability of integrating instance data into the process of algorithm configuration.},

  abstract     = {A complex decision-making challenge senior managers commonly face is the selection of the winning bid from multiple project proposals. Project selection decisions become more complex when providers deliberately choose to introduce ambiguity to their project proposals rather than address the client&#39;s predetermined set of desired specifications. In particular, providers suggest in their proposals a range of values for some product specifications. Providers introduce ambiguity for various reasons, such as future technological advances and strategic misrepresentation . Further, such disruptive behaviour is tolerated by clients for reasons such as ambition, lack of knowledge, uncertain needs, complexity and a lack of competition. This paper defines the ambiguous proposal evaluation problem and develops a solution which enables such proposals to be compared and ranked. The solution is developed through the utilisation of fuzzy logic in combination with a multi-criteria decision-making method, and is illustrated on a procurement project. The contribution of this paper is firstly to define a practical problem in the literature and secondly to develop a solution which enables ranking ambiguous options.},

  abstract     = {While supporting the execution of business processes, information systems record event logs. Conformance checking relies on these logs to analyze whether the recorded behavior of a process conforms to the behavior of a normative specification. A key assumption of existing conformance checking techniques, however, is that all events are associated with timestamps that allow to infer a total order of events per process instance. Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated in practice. Due to synchronization issues, manual event recordings, or data corruption, events are only partially ordered. In this paper, we put forward the problem of partial order resolution of event logs to close this gap. It refers to the construction of a probability distribution over all possible total orders of events of an instance. To cope with the order uncertainty in real-world data, we present several estimators for this task, incorporating different notions of behavioral abstraction. Moreover, to reduce the runtime of conformance checking based on partial order resolution, we introduce an approximation method that comes with a bounded error in terms of accuracy. Our experiments with real-world and synthetic data reveal that our approach improves accuracy over the state-of-the-art considerably.},

However in most cases, geographic information is not explicit and structured, thus preventing its exploitation in real-time applications. We address this limitation by introducing a novel geoparsing and geotagging technique called Geo-Semantic-Parsing ( GSP ). GSP identifies location references in free text and extracts the corresponding geographic coordinates. To reach this goal, we employ a semantic annotator to identify relevant portions of the input text and to link them to the corresponding entity in a knowledge graph. Then, we devise and experiment with several efficient strategies for traversing the knowledge graph, thus expanding the available set of information for the geoparsing task. Finally, we exploit all available information for learning a regression model that selects the best entity with which to geotag the input text. We evaluate GSP on a well-known reference dataset including almost 10 k event-related tweets, achieving F 1 = 0.66. We extensively compare our results with those of 2 baselines and 3 state-of-the-art geoparsing techniques, achieving the best performance. On the same dataset, competitors obtain F 1 ≤ 0.55. We conclude by providing in-depth analyses of our results, showing that the overall superior performance of GSP is mainly due to a large improvement in recall, with respect to existing techniques.},

In this context, the surprise box model, in which a business notifies consumers through a subscription and then mails boxes of new products without repetition, has emerged to rapidly develop. This study examines the role of consumer emotions in their online review writing behavior in the context of the surprise box shopping model. We find for the attributes of product, service, and fulfillment, but not for value; consumers tend to comment more in reviews when they have an extreme emotion, either positive or negative. Consumers comment even more when they have an extremely negative emotion than when they have an extremely positive emotion. In addition, we find that subscription period, experience, and consumers&#39; overall satisfaction affect their review behavior, which depends on the particular attributes on which consumers comment. Further, we find that consumers&#39; positive and negative emotions play different moderating roles in affecting the influence of the subscription period, subscription experience, and satisfaction on consumers&#39; comments depending on the attribute types. This study helps firms understand how consumers perceive and evaluate various product and service attributes in the new surprise box business model. In this way, firms can better understand consumers&#39; need to improve those attributes with different priorities. In addition, firms can use the positive electronic word-of-mouth effects generated from online consumer reviews to achieve both cognitive and affective empathy to attract future consumers.},

Our study is thus motivated to examine how the emphasis of the text narratives affect the fundraising outcomes. We propose an improved deep learning model for text content emphasis (TCE) detection from various textual sources, including titles, blurbs, and detailed descriptions, and then estimate the impact of TCE on the success of fundraising campaigns. With data collected from public sources of Kickstarter platform, our empirical analyses demonstrate that TCE matters differently for various textual sources. It is more effective for the title and blurb to emphasize the entrepreneur profile, while the detailed description should highlight the idea creativity. Furthermore, for the detailed description, the entrepreneur profile has a more positive effect when it is placed at the beginning of the narrative. And the effects of entrepreneur-oriented narratives are more pronounced in these projects with more social connections. This study contributes to the understanding of TCE, entrepreneur profile disclosure, and social connection in economic exchanges in online crowdfunding.},

Moreover, there has been a call for research studies to enhance personalized medicine and develop clinical decision support systems (CDSS) by analyzing the available EHR data. In EHR data, usually, there are millions of patients records with hundreds of features collected over a long period of time . This enormity of EHR data poses significant challenges, one of which is dealing with many variables with very high degrees of missing values. In this study, the data quality issue of incompleteness in EHR data is discussed, and a framework called ‘Missing Care’ is introduced to address this issue. Using Missing Care , researchers will be able to select the most important variables at an acceptable missing values degree to develop predictive models with high predictive power . Moreover, Missing Care is applied to analyze a unique, large EHR data to develop a CDSS for detecting Parkinson&#39;s disease . Parkinson is a complex disease, and even a specialist&#39;s diagnosis is not without error. Besides, there is a lack of access to specialists in more remote areas, and as a result, about half of the patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease in the US remain undiagnosed. The developed CDSS can be integrated into EHR systems or utilized as an independent tool by healthcare practitioners who are not necessarily specialists; therefore, making up for the limited access to specialized care in remote areas.},

  abstract     = {When an aircraft experiences an unexpected issue during flight operations, a technician determines whether the aircraft can safely perform the next flight. This operational decision process - known as dispatch assessment - has to happen within limited available time between aircraft arrival and departure. Currently, technicians face two main problems during the assessment: lack of access to decision support information and a time-consuming process for finding relevant information in extensive maintenance manuals. These issues often lead to delays and additional costs and are indicative of three larger challenges in the decision support domain: 1) a paucity of decision support models and applications for operational processes in maintenance; 2) relatively few efforts in applying and evaluating artifacts in experimental and real-life operational settings; and 3) a lack of systematic development, application and evaluation of digitization and automation efforts of complex decision processes in maintenance. This paper applies a design science research approach to address these challenges and introduces two novel artifacts: a decision support framework for real-time decision making in aircraft dispatch, and a web-based prototype tool accessible through mobile solutions. The practical relevance of the framework and prototype is validated through two representative application and evaluation studies, one in an experimental setting and one in an operational environment . Results show significant time savings and strong qualitative indications towards a higher incentive to use documentation and reducing human risk factors that lead to maintenance error.},

Physical formats still occupy a fraction of the market, with a noticeable increase in the sales of physical albums in a few countries where digital media is predominant. This study empirically examines the impact of two online music channels (streaming and downloading) on physical album sales in the South Korean music market. By utilizing a unique dataset representing nationwide music sales, our empirical findings suggest that the growth in digital music services can be positively associated with an increase in physical album sales. In particular, this finding is more salient for male, solo, and lesser-known artistes. This empirical evidence implies that burgeoning music streaming services (access-based digital consumption) may lead to another ownership-based physical consumption. Our findings provide useful managerial implications for practitioners in countries where streaming services are growing.},

To successfully campaign for the desired funds, however, entrepreneurs also need to understand the subconscious factors, which influence the funding behavior of potential investors. In pursuit of that goal, this study examines how facial emotional expressions, which are shown in the pictures of project presentations, affect the funding decision. Building upon the emotional contagion theory and evaluating the emotions displayed on the pictures of 18,696 project webpages with a machine-learning algorithm, we show that facial expressions of happiness and sadness positively affect (i.e., encourage) the funding decision. Other than in venture capital markets, an emotional approach of potential investors might hence be a viable strategy in reward-based crowdfunding. As persuasion tool, emotions should nevertheless be used judiciously since we found high intensities of facial emotional expressions to negatively affect the funding decision.},

Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes. Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience . Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility . Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.},

However, few studies have investigated the determinants of the number of customer reviews received by these shared-homes. To fill this gap, we were motivated to propose an analytical framework that identified these determinants, both explicit and implicit. We applied Poisson, Quasi-Poisson, and Negative Binomial regressions with a dataset consisting of Airbnb properties from ten different cities worldwide, while successful bookings were proxied by the count of customer reviews posted by guests. We performed a cluster analysis based on the properties to generate homogeneous “cluster cities” and performed the regressions separately for each cluster. Among host-generated features, superhost , host duration , bedrooms , and amenities became significant. Among user-generated features, overall review scores and negative sentiments were significant. We also found that the “superhost” badge moderated the effects of host-generated content on the count of customer reviews. Consequently, guests paid a higher “price per night” for “superhost” properties, while they overlooked crucial attributes such as “website features.” Through these novel “cluster-specific” recommendations, our study extends the existing theories and contributes to the literature of decision analytics and tourism management . Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis to check for the timeliness and robustness of these determinants.},

This study focuses on SNS users&#39; protection from privacy breaches that are made by or facilitated by SNS vendors and explores the effectiveness of privacy assurance mechanisms on SNS users&#39; privacy preserving actions. This study proposes a conceptual model that explains SNS users&#39; privacy protection behavior based on protection motivation theory . An empirical data was collected to validate the proposed research model. The results suggest that users&#39; coping appraisals of the overall SNS assurance mechanisms, along with their threat appraisals, positively relate to their protection motivation. Further, the results confirm that privacy concern mediates the relationship between threat appraisals and coping appraisals. Finally, findings suggest that protective motivation discourages one&#39;s engagement in risky behavior (disclosing self on SNS), in addition to undertaking safeguards (customizing privacy settings). Meanwhile, we find that individuals&#39; use of safeguards increases personal engagement in risky behaviors (self-disclosure).},

  abstract     = {In recent years, new types of interactive analytical dashboard features have emerged for operational decision support systems (DSS). Analytical components of such features solve optimization problems hidden from the human eye, whereas interactive components involve the individual in the optimization process via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities . This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers&#39; SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.},

The existing signed relationships in a network may impact the relationships between the other nodes, hence learning from the existing signed relationships in a network can be used for decision making in various mining tasks. These signed networks are getting attention in recent years due to their relevance to many applications such as categorization, recommendation, and relationship discovery in various domains for decision support such as biological, social network analysis , communication and making knowledge graphs. In this work, we focus on edge classification (sign/label prediction for edges) in unweighted and undirected signed networks where the task is to predict the label of the unlabeled edges. Edge classification is a challenging problem as in real-world signed networks, edges are scarcely labeled. In our work, we are using labeled edges to predict the sign of unlabeled edges (classification) with the help of structural information. In this work, we have proposed a novel framework named NPECF for the classification of unlabeled edges. The proposed framework is novel in its way of utilizing the existing information in the signed network to predict the label of unlabeled edges. The utilization of the unlabeled edges in NPECF using three spanning subgraph projections of the given network minimizes the information loss. The experiments have been performed on four real-world datasets from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Such content has, for example, served as a catalyst for violent uprisings and shifts in stock market prices. The collection and study of opinion have therefore become a necessity in many industries. Due to the vast nature of such data, manual approaches to this problem are no longer feasible. Several computational approaches have been proposed within the field of sentiment analysis, which successfully address many aspects of this problem, such as the classification of data into one of several sentiment categories. The research in the field is lacking, however, with respect to the integration and application of these techniques in practice, as well as their incorporation into the decision-making process of affected entities. In this paper, a generic framework for sentiment analysis is proposed, with a focus on facilitating the model development process for a user in a manner such that good performance may be achieved irrespective of the problem domain, as well as facilitating a flexible, exploratory analysis of model results in combination with existing structured attributes in order to gain actionable insights. The objective of the framework is to aid organisations in successfully leveraging unstructured, opinion-bearing data in combination with structured data sources to inform decision making.},

  abstract     = {Proliferating applications of deep learning , along with the prevalence of large-scale text datasets, have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field, thereby driving the recent explosive growth. Nevertheless, it is argued that state-of-the-art studies focus excessively on producing quantitative performances superior to existing models, by playing “the Kaggle game.” Hence, the field requires more effort in solving new problems and proposing novel approaches and architectures. We claim that one of the promising and constructive efforts would be to design transparent and accountable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for text analytics . By doing so, we can enhance the applicability and problem-solving capacity of the system for real-world decision support. It is widely accepted that deep learning models demonstrate remarkable performances compared to existing algorithms. However, they are often criticized for being less interpretable, i.e., the “black box.” In such cases, users tend to hesitate to utilize them for decision-making, especially in crucial tasks. Such complexity obstructs transparency and accountability of the overall system, potentially debilitating the deployment of decision support systems powered by AI. Furthermore, recent regulations are emphasizing fairness and transparency in algorithms to a greater extent, turning explanations more compulsory than voluntary. Thus, to enhance the transparency and accountability of the decision support system and preserve the capacity to model complex text data at the same time, we propose the Explaining and Visualizing Convolutional neural networks for Text information (EVCT) framework. By adopting and ameliorating cutting-edge methods in NLP and image processing , the EVCT framework provides a human-interpretable solution to the problem of text classification while minimizing information loss. Experimental results with large-scale, real-world datasets show that EVCT performs comparably to benchmark models , including widely used deep learning models . In addition, we provide instances of human-interpretable and relevant visualized explanations obtained from applying EVCT to the dataset and possible applications for real-world decision support.},

  abstract     = {Shared parking firms offer a double-sided platform for parking space sharing. Many of these firms provide differentiated service levels to both suppliers and buyers. This new phenomenon in the parking industry materialized thanks to recent innovations in IoT-enabled automation and electric vehicle charging technologies. We study shared parking firms. Specifically, we formulate the firm&#39;s location and quality decision problem by using a multiplicative interaction model with competition. A non-cooperative game renders the optimized quality levels and location selections at Nash equilibrium in the presence of competition. We illustrate managerial insights with a small-sized problem. For industry practitioners, we propose a tailored branch and bound based exact algorithm and a problem-specific genetic algorithm for large-sized problems. Simulated computational results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed shared-parking decision support model.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments&#39; success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.},

Synchromodal transportation, as an extension of intermodal transportation, refers to transport systems with dynamic updating of plans by incorporating real-time information. The trend towards spot markets and digitalization in hinterland intermodal transportation gives rise to online synchromodal transportation problems . This paper investigates a dynamic shipment matching problem in which a centralized platform provides online matches between shipment requests and transport services. We propose a rolling horizon approach to handle newly arrived shipment requests and develop a heuristic algorithm to generate timely solutions at each decision epoch. The experiment results demonstrate the solution accuracy and computational efficiency of the heuristic algorithm in comparison to an exact algorithm. The proposed rolling horizon approach outperforms a greedy approach from practice in total costs under various scenarios of the system.},

  abstract     = {Business process simulation is a versatile technique to estimate the performance of a process under multiple scenarios. This, in turn, allows analysts to compare alternative options to improve a business process. A common roadblock for business process simulation is that constructing accurate simulation models is cumbersome and error-prone. Modern information systems store detailed execution logs of the business processes they support. Previous work has shown that these logs can be used to discover simulation models. However, existing methods for log-based discovery of simulation models do not seek to optimize the accuracy of the resulting models. Instead they leave it to the user to manually tune the simulation model to achieve the desired level of accuracy. This article presents an accuracy-optimized method to discover business process simulation models from execution logs. The method decomposes the problem into a series of steps with associated configuration parameters . A hyper-parameter optimization method is used to search through the space of possible configurations so as to maximize the similarity between the behavior of the simulation model and the behavior observed in the log. The method has been implemented as a tool and evaluated using logs from different domains.},

When would be the best time to present the review score information to consumers: before the product description, with the product description, or after the product description? In order to answer this question, we carried out three online experiments in which we manipulated the order of information (reviews presented first or last), and timing of information (reviews presented simultaneously with or sequential to the product description). Overall, consumers put more weight on information that was seen most recently, particularly when the product description and review information was presented sequentially and the average review score was relatively low. That is, consumers put more weight on review score information after they had first formed an independent opinion based on the product description. Theoretically, these findings are best explained by an adjustment-based anchoring account. Practically, these findings arm managers with effective tactics regarding the placement of review score information.},

  abstract     = {“Showrooming”, a practice where consumers visit a brick-and-mortar store to examine and research a product before buying it online, is being increasingly observed in recent times. This not only adversely affects the physical store but also the manufacturer in the long run. Showrooming leads to reduced sales efforts on the part of the brick-and-mortar retailer which leads to a decline in showcasing of the product to consumers. This affects the overall demand for the product in the market. In this paper, we analyze the effect of wholesale prices set by the manufacturer on the retail prices of the products in a multi-channel environment affected by showrooming. To combat the adverse impact of showrooming, we further investigate the feasibility of a manufacturer-driven alliance with the brick-and-mortar retailer so that it expends adequate sales effort that leads to higher demand and a dedicated consumer base. We derive a three-parameter contract that can coordinate the channel and arrive at a win-win situation for the manufacturer and the brick-and-mortar retailer. Our analysis shows that the contract is more beneficial for a brick-and-mortar retailer with lower relative market potential. Additionally, we find that the contract brings down the retail price of the product which benefits the end consumers.},

However, the impact of host self-description on trust perception and whether trust perception can influence purchase behavior remain under-studied. Therefore, a text analytics framework was proposed to research the relationships among host self-description, trust perception and purchase behavior on Airbnb. Specifically, a deep-learning-based method was designed to automatically code trust perception of host self-descriptions. And the linguistic and semantic features of description texts were extracted with text mining methods. The estimated order quantity was used to quantify purchase behavior. Then, the influence of linguistic and semantic features on trust perception was identified, and the relationship between trust perception and purchase behavior was also verified. The empirical analysis derives the following findings: i. The readability of self-description is positively associated with trust perception; ii. Perspective taking expressed in self-description is also helpful; iii. Excessive positive sentiment expression can raise barriers to trust building; iv. Paying more attention to family relationship, openness, service and travel experience in self-description would be helpful; v. Trust perception can promote purchases. These findings can help hosts write better self-description, which contributes to trust building and purchases on short-term rental platforms.},

Results also reveal the importance of personal attributes, such as past success in phishing detection and phishing desensitization, in regulating the effects of a recent phishing encounter. Finally, results show the relationship between detection process difficulty and outcome failures, in addition to confirming antecedents to the two detection components.

When building the decision model, we adopted the design science paradigm and used multi-criteria decision analysis as well as normative analytical modeling as research methods. We evaluated the model by discussing it with practitioners, by building a software prototype , and by applying it at a German insurance company.

  abstract     = {Evidence suggests that firms which use customer data analytics perform better than those that do not. However, the current policy of voluntary profiling allows firms to collect and use customer information only if customers voluntarily disclose information with them. Further, surveys and literature show that many customers are not comfortable with firms collecting their information due to privacy concerns. A vast literature has examined customer information disclosing behavior using the privacy calculus. The primary premise of the privacy calculus is that despite strong privacy concerns, customers disclose information if the benefits they can get from disclosure justify the costs of losing privacy, or privacy costs. Based on the privacy calculus, firms and marketers believe that customers voluntarily disclose information in exchange for monetary benefits such as discount coupons or cash rewards. Using transaction data that we collected from a firm that sells skin care cosmetic products on its website, we investigate if there is statistical evidence that shows customers disclose information in exchange for monetary benefits. In line with the privacy calculus, we find that customers with low privacy costs and that expect high benefits from personalized services such as product recommendations are more likely to disclose information. Monetary incentives only work as an effective means to elicit information from customers in the age range of 12–21 years old. Customers, on average, and especially customers in the age range of 22–54 years old are not likely to disclose information simply as a tradeoff for monetary benefits. Personalized services outweigh monetary benefits in enticing these customers to disclose information.},

To address this challenge, a series of motivation factors that range from self-interest driven to prosocial-oriented motives have been identified by scholars. As members participate in continuous contributions and community activities alike, their status or positions within the virtual communities would change, which may influence their cognition and behavior. While status-seeking can lead to greater contributions and a better performance, research has yet to study in a comprehensive manner how an individual&#39;s status-standing shape one&#39;s recognition and behavior in a systematic way. To fill this research gap, a comprehensive theoretical model based on the status theory of collective action is proposed to explain how status standing moderates the impact of different types of motivations (self-interest vs. prosocial) on continuous contributions in virtual communities. Our findings suggest that improved status-standing can enhance the motivational incentives of virtual rewards and peer recognition, while boosting the prosocial motivation of opinion leadership to contribute content in virtual communities. Overall, this study not only suggests a comprehensive view of our current understandings regarding contribution behavior in virtual communities, but also yields deep insights into how motivational mechanism of virtual communities can be reasonably designed and properly used to promote continuous contributions.},

  abstract     = {Humankind faces many “wicked” decision-making problems, which must be solved. One promising approach refers to crowdsourcing systems that hold the potential to solve any kind of problem – notably wicked ones. Crowdsourced solutions work well because crowds exchange knowledge from different domains – a concept known as “cross-fertilisation.” Thereby, the “facilitator” of a crowdsourcing system is the primary decision maker when it comes to specifying and managing the crowd. The facilitator&#39;s role includes actively managing cross-fertilisation. However, in the light of technological advancements and large-scale data, facilitation proves difficult – especially in one particular type of crowdsourcing – crowdsolving. Thus, academia recently called for relieving some burden of facilitators and started developing tools for supporting or automated facilitation. Yet, the focus of existing tools is not on fostering the innermost core of crowdsolving endeavours – cross-fertilisation. By taking a design science perspective, we propose design principles and design guidelines for a decision-support tool aiding facilitators to (a) set the boundary conditions for, (b) measure, and (c) facilitate cross-fertilisation. We evaluate feasibility and value added of the abstract design by applying it to different crowdsolving platforms including a prototypical implementation and qualitative evaluation by facilitators.},

  abstract     = {The review systems of online platforms create a stream of online word-of-mouth that allows consumers to learn from others&#39; purchasing experience. However, it is difficult for consumers to discern the authenticity of a review or the reviewer&#39;s level of experience with the product. Platforms can aid the authentication process by incorporating a verified purchase (VP) indication, or “badge” as is done on Amazon, in reviews where the consumer writing the review has verifiably purchased the focal product. A VP is a revealed preference for a product implying a utility-maximizing choice where the consumer writing the review has experience with the product. Combining an Amazon dataset on tablet computers with the theory of revealed preference in online reviews, we uncover a surprising new result: the proportion of VP reviews (a revealed preference) is associated with higher future sales, and the effect of the proportion of VP reviews on sales dominates the effect of the mean rating. This novel use of VP with revealed preference theory has implications for new research in the design of recommendation systems, detecting fraudulent reviews, and online profiling/privacy. Moreover, the use of a VP badge is immediately applicable to firms and platforms.},

Hence, in order to decide upon a suitable treatment plan, health professionals benefit from decision support, i.e., predictions about how a disease is to evolve. In clinical practice, such a prediction model requires interpretability . Interpretability, however, is often precluded by complex dynamic models that would be capable of capturing the intrapersonal variability of disease trajectories. Therefore, we develop a cross-sectional ARMA model that allows for inference of the expected course of symptoms. Distinct from traditional time series models , it generalizes to cross-sectional settings and thus patient cohorts (i.e., it is estimated to multiple instead of single disease trajectories). Our model is evaluated according to a longitudinal 52-week study involving 928 patients with low back pain. It achieves a favorable prediction performance while maintaining interpretability. In sum, we provide decision support by informing health professionals about whether symptoms will have the tendency to stabilize or continue to be severe.},

Our study suggests that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model should be employed as a classification algorithm in predicting patient no-shows by using the variable set that is commonly selected by a Genetic Algorithm ( GA ) and Simulated Annealing ( SA ) . In addition, we used Random Under Sampling ( RUS ) to improve the performance of the model in predicting the minority group (no-show) patients. The patient-specific risk scores were justified by applying a threshold sensitivity analysis. Also, the web-based decision support tool that can be adopted by clinics is developed. The clinics can incorporate their own intuition/incentive to make the final decision on the cases where the model is not confident enough (i.e. when the estimated probabilities fall near the decision boundary).

Despite much being written about data quality in general, a generalisable framework for analysing event data quality issues when extracting logs for process mining remains unrealised. Following the DSR paradigm, we present RDB2Log, a quality-aware, semi-automated approach for extracting event logs from relational data . We validated RDB2Log&#39;s design against design objectives extracted from literature and competing artifacts, evaluated its design and performance with process mining experts, implemented a prototype with a defined set of quality metrics, and applied it in laboratory settings and in a real-world case study .

This study proposes a novel BCT-based mHealth App recommendation method to suggest suitable mHealth Apps to users. Specifically, we encode mHealth Apps to obtain information on the BCT adopted by the Apps. Based on the combination of BCTs in each mHealth App and its usage information, we construct a User-BCT matrix to represent users&#39; preferences concerning BCTs. We also construct a user profile for each user, which considers their characteristics related to BCTs. Next, we build a prediction model that links each user&#39;s profile to BCTs, and use the AdaBoost algorithm to predict suitable BCTs for a target user. Finally, we recommend mHealth Apps with the highest BCT-matching levels to a target user. We also investigate the performance of the proposed method using a real dataset.

  abstract     = {Given the increasing competition to attract new customers, e-commerce providers (i.e., e-tailers) are being urged to optimize their website onboarding journeys. Design mechanisms employing social influence tactics seem to be promising avenues to effectively improve user onboarding experiences. Specifically, two social influence tactics—namely, reciprocity and social proof—are widely used in practice to reliably enhance user registrations. Yet, researchers have only tentatively examined how these combined tactics affect user onboarding behavior. While combining both tactics may hold synergistic potential, it may also be counterproductive, as too much social influence may backfire. We address this research gap by investigating the distinct and joint effects of reciprocity and social proof on user registration behavior. Drawing on two forms of reciprocity (i.e., utility- and monetary-based reciprocity), we conduct an online experiment ( N = 249) and a related randomized field experiment ( N = 475,495) to compare both reciprocity variants in combination with social proof and investigate their efficacy for actual user onboarding decisions (i.e., user registrations). Our results show that both social influence tactics and both reciprocity variants have positive effects on users&#39; registration behavior if applied individually. However, when both tactics are employed together, the effect of reciprocity is moderated by social proof such that social proof nullifies the effect of monetary-based reciprocity whereas it amplifies the effect of utility-based reciprocity. Our study thereby contributes to a more advanced understanding of the interactive relationship between reciprocity and social proof and their joint effect on user onboarding decisions.},

Developed and implemented from a predictive analytics perspective in the particular context of a Portuguese aircraft maintenance organization, the tool integrates four main modules: (1) a forecasting module used to predict future and unprecedented maintenance workloads from historical data ; (2) a Bayesian inference module used to transform prior workload forecasts, resulting from the forecasting module, into predictive forecasts after observations on the maintenance interventions being predicted become available; (3) a simulation module used to characterize the forecasted total workloads through sets of random variables , including maintenance work types, maintenance work phases, and maintenance work skills; and (4) a Bayesian network module used to combine the simulated workloads with historical data through probabilistic inference. A linear programming model is also developed to improve the efficiency of the decision-making process supported by Bayesian networks. The tool uses real industrial data, comprising 171 aircraft maintenance projects collected at the host organization, and is validated by comparing its results with real observations of a given maintenance intervention to which predictions were made and with a model simulating current forecasting practices employed in industry. Significantly more accurate forecasts have been obtained with the proposed tool, resulting in an important cost saving potential for maintenance organizations.},

Through providing an elaborately designed decision support system in Experiment I, we validate that the optimal recommendations help to alleviate human newsvendors&#39; Pull-to-Center bias, i.e., the actual orders fall in the range between mean demand and optimal order that maximizes the expected profit theoretically, and decrease the bias asymmetry under two profit conditions (high or low). We also reveal that optimal recommendations can&#39;t eliminate the bias, as decision makers exhibit two competing psychological factors simultaneously when using the decision support system: algorithm aversion and regret aversion. Algorithm aversion persistently impedes them from following the superior recommendations, while regret aversion sometimes pulls them to approach to the recommendations driven by the feeling of experienced regret. Further, we redesign the decision support system in Experiment II and find that, although the conservative system recommendations are valueless compared with the optimal one, the well-designed radical system recommendations may eliminate the Pull-to-Center bias under the high-profit condition, through the interaction of the dominant regret aversion, dominated algorithm aversion, and the anchoring effect .},

Since a CoRS architecture is generally composed of different elements, we performed an in-vitro experiment with two synthetic datasets , to investigate the impact that each component has on the CoRS in terms of recommendation accuracy. Additionally, an in-vivo experiment was carried out to understand how natural language influences both the cost of interaction and recommendation accuracy of a CoRS. Experimental results have revealed the most critical components in a CoRS architecture, especially in cold-start situations, and the main issues of the natural-language-based interaction. All the dialogues have been collected in a public available dataset.},

  abstract     = {Companies are increasingly conscious of the importance of Enterprise Architecture (EA) to represent and manage IT and business in a holistic way. EA modelling has become decisive to achieve models that accurately represents behaviour and assets of companies and lead them to make appropriate business decisions. Although EA representations can be manually modelled by experts, automatic EA modelling methods have been proposed to deal with drawbacks of manual modelling, such as error-proneness, time-consumption, slow and poor re-adaptation, and cost. However, automatic modelling is not effective for the most abstract concepts in EA like strategy or motivational aspects. Thus, companies are demanding hybrid approaches that combines automatic with manual modelling. In this context there are no clear relationships between the input artefacts (and mining techniques) and the target EA viewpoints to be automatically modelled, as well as relationships between the experts&#39; roles and the viewpoints to which they might contribute in manual modelling. Consequently, companies cannot make informed decisions regarding expert assignments in EA modelling projects, nor can they choose appropriate mining techniques and their respective input artefacts. This research proposes a decision support system whose core is a genetic algorithm. The proposal first establishes (based on a previous literature review) the mentioned missing relationships and EA model specifications. Such information is then employed using a genetic algorithm to decide about automatic, manual or hybrid modelling by selecting the most appropriate input artefacts, mining techniques and experts. The genetic algorithm has been optimized so that the system aids EA architects to maximize the accurateness and completeness of EA models while cost (derived from expert assignments and unnecessary automatic generations) are kept under control.},

These tools include feedback ratings and symbols that indicate reputation. However, surprisingly few studies have investigated the effects of reputation indicators in the decision-making process in online marketplaces. No prior study in our knowledge has examined the role of graphics indicators in online decision-making. We investigated the decision process and the price premium an individual was willing to pay for a product using an experiment with the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak procedure and event-related measures of brain activity . As signaling theory expects, results showed that the price premium paid for a product was higher when the product sold by a seller appeared with a high-reputation symbol. High-reputation seller indicators triggered significantly higher neural activity compared with low-reputation seller indicators in brain regions associated with emotions in the prefrontal cortex (the ventromedial prefrontal cortex). The degree of integrated cognitive value and cognitive and emotional value as represented by neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and VMPFC respectively was correlated with the price premium individuals bid for products. The results indicate the applicability of semeiotic theory along with signaling theory in the e-marketplace context and suggest fruitful avenues for further research.},

  abstract     = {Safety, as the most important concern in civil aviation , needs to be maintained at an acceptable level at all times in the air transportation system. This paper aims to increase en-route flight safety through the development of deep learning models for trajectory prediction, where model prediction uncertainty is characterized following a Bayesian approach . The proposed methodology consists of four steps. In the first step, a large volume of raw messages in Flight Information Exchange Model (FIXM) format streamed from Federal Aviation Administration are processed with a distributed computing engine Apache Spark to extract trajectory information in an efficient manner. In the second step, two types of deep learning models are trained to predict flight trajectory from different perspectives. Specifically, deep feedforward neural networks (DNN) are trained to make a one-step-ahead prediction on the deviation along latitude and longitude between the actual flight trajectory and target flight trajectory. In parallel, deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks are trained to make longer-term predictions on the flight trajectory over several subsequent time instants. The DNN model is more accurate but has a single-step prediction horizon, whereas the LSTM model is less accurate but longer prediction horizon. Therefore, in the third step, the two different types of deep learning models are blended together to create a multi-fidelity prediction. After quantifying the discrepancy between the two model predictions in the current time instant, the DNN prediction is used to correct the LSTM prediction of flight trajectory along subsequent time instants accordingly. The multi-fidelity approach is expanded to multiple flights, and is then used to assess safety based on horizontal and vertical separation distance between two flights. Computational results illustrate the promising performance of the blended model in predicting the flight trajectory and assessing en-route flight safety.},

Taking down jackets and trousers sold on Tmall—China&#39;s largest B2C e-commerce platform—as the example, this paper collects data about three factors that influence consumers&#39; first impression on their search results: the price of a product, the quantity of historical reviews, and a photo of the product. Among these factors, previous research shows that a product photo contains four attributes: brand logo, promotional information, street scenes, and model display. Focusing on these attributes, we apply a decision tree to explore customer purchasing patterns, which allows us to further investigate the influence of product photo attributes on sales volume by using a hierarchical regression model. Our research finds that among the products from the list of their search results, customers prefer those with many good historical reviews and low prices. In addition, gender that differentiates men&#39;s from women&#39;s clothing has a moderating effect on the relationship between photo attributes and product sales. The purchase decision of consumers shopping for men&#39;s clothing is susceptible to the influence of the product photo. Furthermore, different from the traditional view which shows that brands can reduce perceived risks and increase sales, this study finds that men&#39;s clothing sales are negatively affected by brand logo attribute in product photos. Finally, using models cannot significantly increase product sales among consumers shopping for either men&#39;s or women&#39;s clothing.},

In particular, with the change in potential market size from low to high, the creator will choose investing none, part or all of the crowdfunded money to improve the advertising level. Meanwhile, when the market size is small, the creator tends to set a high price; when it becomes larger, the creator prefers menu prices or a low price to guarantee the success of the crowdfunding campaign. Comparing two scenarios, one with and one without considering advertising investment, creators may never choose the low price if they cannot raise enough money for advertising; however, that situation can never arise without considering the option of advertising investment. These results provide implications for launching a successful crowdfunding campaign and product promotion/advertising in this E-commerce era.},

We collect geo-tagged images from earthquake-hit regions and apply deep learning method for classification of these images to identify survivors in debris. We find that deep learning method is able to classify the images with significantly higher accuracy than the conventionally used machine learning methods for image classification and utilizes significantly lesser time and computational resources .

  abstract     = {Health care consumers and patients are increasingly using online health communities (OHCs) to exchange social support and enhance their well-being. The success of OHCs in promoting health, however, depends not just on posting activity by participants, but, crucially, on whether or not responses are subsequently received. While previous studies have considered various mechanisms by which the likelihood of social support provisioning can be increased (e.g., the establishment of social capital), the impacts of linguistic signals have yet to be considered. Therefore, we consider whether or not linguistic signals in posts—including sentiment valence, linguistic style matching, readability , post length, and spelling—impact the amount of support received. Adopting an overarching theoretical framework of signaling theory, this study proposes a model that explains the signaling roles of linguistic features within OHC posts in promoting social support provision from OHC participants. The research model is empirically tested on a large dataset collected from an OHC platform covering multiple health conditions. Results show that affective linguistic signals, including negative sentiment and linguistic style matching, are effective in invoking both informational and emotional support from the community. We also find that informative linguistic signals including readability, post length, and spelling are positively associated with informational support receipt, while readability and spelling are also positively associated with emotional support receipt. Overall, this research not only enriches our current understandings of the linguistic signaling in OHCs, but also provides practical insights into improving social support exchange in OHCs.},

To advance decision support systems literature, this study validates the proposed customer life event prediction model in a real-world setting in the financial services industry ; compares models that rely on aggregated data , fine-grained transaction data, and their combination; and extends existing methods to incorporate fine-grained data that preserve recency, frequency, and monetary value information of the transactions. The results show that the proposed model predicts life events significantly better than random guessing, especially with the combination of fine-grained transaction and aggregated data. Incorporating recency, frequency, and monetary value information of fine-grained transaction data also significantly improves performance compared with models based on binary logs.

  abstract     = {Combinatorial auctions (CAs) promote allocative efficiency and are important market mechanisms for a wide variety of specialized domains where bidders are allowed to place bids on packages of items. However, the adoption of combinatorial auctions in real-life business scenarios has been fairly limited, perhaps because bidders find it difficult to construct their bids without extensive knowledge of the current state of the auction. In this paper, we develop decision support tools for bidders to provide information feedback at runtime for the general class of combinatorial auctions namely, online (continuous) multi-item multi-unit combinatorial auctions (MUCAs), an area that has witnessed a rapid growth of interest in recent years. In online MUCAs the number of packages may be large, and bidders need real time decision support to construct their bids, such as information on the ask prices of packages. The deadness level of a package serves as the ask price, and indicates the minimum bid on the package that keeps it in contention for inclusion in winning combinations in future. It has proved a challenge to find a satisfactory method for computing the deadness levels of packages in MUCAs. Here we present exact methods for determining package deadness levels in such auctions. Both the OR and the XOR formulations are considered. Experiments on simulated data as well as on live data show that the time and memory requirements are not excessive, so it appears possible to adopt the methods for the procurement and sale of commodities in B2B and B2C markets.},

  abstract     = {Port logistics is characterised by a high degree of fragmentation, uncertainty and complexity. In a context with these characteristics, decision support can be of significant value. This study presents the prototype of an intelligent decision support system (DSS) that leads to horizontal and vertical cooperation among freight agents involved in port logistics. A multi-agent simulation model is presented where heterogeneous actions are enabled as a result of an adaptive reinforcement learning algorithm that is inspired by human decision-making strategies. The model combines optimisation modelling and decision theory to operate in a dynamic environment characterised by information asymmetry among agents and dynamic changes over time. A simulation demonstrates the dynamics and convergence to equilibrium of the interactions of heterogeneous agents for delivery and pick up of import/export shipments. In particular, we answer two specific research questions. What is the likely impact of an intelligent DSS in hinterland container transport as a value-added service of port community system (PCS)? How can an optimum cooperative strategy be formulated to meet the dynamic demand and supply of freight agents in hinterland container transport and achieve agility in the age of hyper-competition? By addressing these two research questions we make a specific contribution by developing an agent-based simulation model in a real-world and large-scale case study , by using a reinforcement learning model based on probability matching theory that allows simulating realistically the adaptive behaviour of agents. The results of the simulation of two weeks of container movements indicate huge savings in total transport costs and distance travelled as well as higher utilisation of trucks from the sharing of resources. Moreover, we show that it is strictly better for smaller freight agents to cooperate – a conclusion generated endogenously inside the model as a trade-off between exploration and exploitation. As a result of this prototype simulation, major freight agents will not necessarily benefit from the DSS mainly because they are already using the economies of scale .},

  abstract     = {Using frameworks from the literature on emotion, cognitive processing and gender stereotypes, we extend existing research on online product review helpfulness by demonstrating that reviewer gender moderates the relationship between emotional content and review helpfulness and that readers&#39; perceptions of reviewer credibility explain this effect. In the first study, experimental methods were used to demonstrate that the differential effect of angry vs. non-emotional reviews on review helpfulness was moderated by reviewer gender. Further, findings showed that the negative effect of anger on review helpfulness for female (but not male) reviewers was explained by lower reviewer credibility. In the second study, by analyzing product reviews from the Amazon web site, we found supportive evidence for the results of the first study on the relationship between female-expressed anger and review helpfulness. In addition, we explored the influence of gender stereotypes in terms of the relationship between anxiety and review helpfulness and compared it to anger. Study 2 also allowed us to explore the moderation effect of the contextual emotional tone of other reviews on the target product. Our findings highlight limitations in perceived helpfulness ratings due to gender stereotype biases and offer insights for various decision makers to better understand and manage review helpfulness.},

  abstract     = {Our study contributes to the research on human error during IS use by studying the antecedents of the omission errors that occur during routine instances of computerized work. While attention lapses have been identified as the main mechanism leading to omission errors, we still know little about how such lapses come about during post-adoptive system use. To address this limitation, we draw our theoretical insights from theories of attention and prospective memory to illustrate how the different forms of system use carry the potential to explain patterns of human error. Accordingly, we distinguish between two forms of use history that can consist of features that are either related or unrelated to the execution of a focal task and examine their effects on the frequency of omission errors . We also examine the interaction effects of task variation on the aforementioned relationship. Our hypotheses are tested by analyzing log data associated with the use of a newly introduced mobile application in the context of a sailing sports event. Our results indicate that restricting one&#39;s system use on related task features reduces omission errors, whereas a use history based on unrelated task features produces the opposite effects. Further, task diversity positively moderates the relationship between a use history of unrelated features and omission errors, but has no significant moderating effect on the relationship between a use history of related features and omission errors. Our findings hold a number of implications for the literature on human error, and these are discussed alongside with the implications of our study for practitioners and system design.},

  abstract     = {Over the last years home dialysis has become the preferred treatment option for some patients with kidney failure. However, determining efficient and effective daily home-dialysis service plans imposes multiple challenges to hospital administrators, as it is a complex task with a number of interrelated decisions. These decisions are about the number of nurses required for daily visits and their travel itineraries, and involve multiple (often conflicting) objectives. Working together with physicians and administrators from The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) in Canada, we have developed a system intended to support administrators of nephrology departments in creating daily visit schedules and routes for nurses assisting with dialysis treatment in patients&#39; homes. The decision support system, called Home Dialysis Scheduler System (HDSS), employs a mixed-integer linear programming model to create daily nurse itineraries that minimize the cost of providing home dialysis for a pre-specified group of patients. In developing this model, we also considered nurses&#39; workload balance, overtime work, need for mealtime breaks (lunch or dinner, depending on shift times), restrictions and preferences associated with the time of the visits, and different types of services provided to patients. The model was validated using data provided by the Division of Nephrology at TOH. The interface of the HDSS was developed following the principles of user-centred design and validated with a group of end-users. In the validation stage, daily visit schedules and nurse routes generated by the HDSS were compared to nurse itineraries created manually by hospital administrators. The use of the HDSS resulted in improved workload distribution among nurses, simpler routes, and reduced total distance travelled — which translates into lower costs for the home dialysis program. In this paper, we provide details about the mixed-integer linear programming model, describe the HDSS, and discuss its implementation results and managerial implications.},

Motivated by the controversy over the function of social media in the firm&#39;s generation of value from CSR activities, this study hypothesizes that firms that perform CSR activities may become better employers and that this positive relationship may be stronger when firms leverage social media technologies. We explain this effect of social media by arguing that these social technologies enable higher social visibility and exposure/credibility . We tested our research model with data from 100 organizations in Spain. The results provided two key insights: 1) CSR activities enable firms to build greater employer reputation; and 2) social media capability amplifies the effect of CSR activities on employer reputation. This study contributes to Information Systems and Business Ethics research by arguing theoretically and demonstrating empirically that leveraging a technology such as social media generates business value through maximization of the positive impact of CSR activities on employer reputation of the firm.},

When a relay attack between a honest prover and a honest verifier occurs, an adversary tricks the prover and verifier into believing that they are indeed communicating with each other. Such attacks are rather difficult to identify and prevent since a passive adversary does not modify any of the communicated messages between prover and verifier. RFID/NFC-based applications are particularly vulnerable to such attacks. We provide an overview of RFID-based relay attacks and evaluate various streams of research that have attempted to address these attacks.

Predictive business process monitoring aims at providing timely information that enables proactive and corrective actions to improve process enactments and mitigate risks. There are a handful of research works focusing on the predictions at the instance level. However, it is more practical to predict the performance of processes at the process model level and detect potential weaknesses in the process to facilitate the proactive actions that will improve the process execution. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the future performances of a business process at the process model level. More in detail, we construct an annotated transition system and generate a process representation matrix from it. Based on the process representation matrix , we build performance prediction models using deep neural networks that consider both spatial and temporal dependencies present in the underlying business process. To validate the proposed method, we performed case studies on three real-life logs.},

The main contribution of this research is the introduction of a new multivariate method based on rotated factor scores by varimax strategy for the repeatability and reproducibility study to effectively identify possible data of poor quality leading to measurement errors. In addition, a new confidence ellipsoid-based decision support method is developed. The efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated using the metallographic measurements of the geometric characteristics of the resistance spot welding process . To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, it was compared with other consolidated techniques such as the analysis of variance , weighted principal components method, and factor analysis without rotation. Thus, we verified that the proposed method performed better interpretation of the latent information, minimizing the dimensionality of the data, and separating the quality attributes analyzed by clusters. One response group was classified as acceptable, and the other as marginal. These results were verified by the confidence ellipsoids, in which the proposed method obeyed the Bonferroni bilateral limits, outlining the factors which demonstrated superior discriminatory power with non-overlapping ellipsoids avoiding the confounding and favoring the better data quality analysis for multicriteria decision-making. When compared with the other approaches, the proposed method demonstrated more reliable and robust results without such deficiencies as inversion of the groupings, neglection of the variance-covariance structure, and the variability attributed to the data within the measurement system.},

Surprisingly, no research has been found on measuring preferences stability. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a novel approach for measuring the stability of preferences and also for improving understanding of current and future decisions. In order to be faithful to reality, this research considers decisions like complete pre-orders on a set of alternatives. Following this reasoning, this paper provides the general concept of decision stability measure as well as two specific measures: the local and the global decision stability measure . Moreover, the main features of the novel approach are examined, including several mathematical results on the behaviour of the proposed measure. And eventually, this contribution develops two real cases of study, with in-depth analysis of preferences behaviour and their stability over time.

PEHER consists of three segments, namely, preferability estimator, authority estimator, and expertise estimator. The preferability estimator utilizes the textual information to determine both intra-profile and inter-profile preferences of answerers for each term. The intra-profile preferences consider the preference of a term using the answering history of a given answerer. The inter-profile preferences incorporate the preferences of all answerers for a term. These preferences are then used to determine the preferability of each answerer for each of the archived questions. The authority estimator considers the textual familiarity between each archived question and the profile of each answerer as the weight of the associated link in the network. The expertise estimator is composed of three blocks, namely, question similarity finder, proficiency estimator, and expert list generator. The question similarity finder finds the similarities between the new question and each of the archived questions. The proficiency estimator uses the said similarities of the archived questions along with their preferabilities to decide the proficiencies of answerers for the new question. Finally, the expert list generator considers the authorities and proficiencies to generate a list of experts for a given question. We compare PEHER with twenty existing methods on four real-world datasets using five performance measures. We find that PEHER outperforms the comparing algorithms in 92.00 % (368 out of 400) cases.},

This research aims to systematically analyze the most relevant academic literature on gamification , to establish if it influences online consumer decisions and, if so, which elements, mechanisms, and theories can explain it. After a thorough search from Web of Science and Scopus databases using SciMAT, 257 papers were analyzed. Twenty-nine (29) of the 36 papers found show empirical evidence that the inclusion of game elements in non-game activities has a significant influence on consumer engagement and online consumer decisions in digital contexts. Moreover, rewards and challenges were identified as the two most used mechanisms, with points, badges, and leaderboards being the most tested gamification elements. The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) are the two most common theoretical explanations for why gamification works. Lastly, possible future studies to include thematic, methodological and theoretical agendas were discussed.},

These weights carry the attitudes and subjective beliefs of individuals toward risks and uncertainties. Our variable precision method adopts a dynamic mechanism that can elicit the measuring points of individual probability weighting flexibly. These points are used to exhibit violations of expected utility theory, which measures individual risk attitudes and captures subjective beliefs on probabilities. Our method is flexible, tractable, and cognitively less demanding compared with other nonparametric elicitations in the literature. Experimental studies are conducted on a sample of Hong Kong (China) residents to verify our method. Our experimental results yield a prevailing inverse-S shape. We conduct the analyses and uncover their implications by comparing them with the results of residents of Beijing, Shanghai, Paris, and Amsterdam.},

  abstract     = {Medication adherence is a critical element in promoting healthcare outcomes, especially for chronic medical conditions . However, due to several underlying factors, major challenges such as how to improve and maintain the required level of medication adherence still exist. We propose a novel mobile health-based intervention, we call Carrot and Stick, to promote medication adherence (MA) for patients with intentional and/or unintentional non-adherence. Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory , Social Exchange Theory , Goal-setting Theory, and people&#39;s dependency on smartphones, we develop a composite intervention using both positive and negative reinforcements, goal-setting, and social connections. The m-health intervention provides decision support to patients in their medication-taking process. With multiple intervention scenarios, healthcare professionals have baselines to adjust the intervention to meet patients&#39; needs. We validate our design using analytical modeling and show that (1) high medication adherence is achievable by the composite intervention for single and multiple medications, (2) negative reinforcement (NR) leads to better MA outcomes in addition to positive reinforcement (PR), (3) the intervention can maintain effectiveness in the operational environment due to its adaptability, and, (4) the estimated healthcare savings are significant even for slightly improved medication adherence. Our research is the first to utilize NR in intervention design to enhance MA and to categorize patients based on elements derived from theories while providing technical and behavioral interventions for both unintentional as well as intentional non-adherence. The future work can address multiple different types of NR; development of DSS for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals; and, integration of other m-health interventions for creating sophisticated and highly effective personalized solutions.},

However, traditional methods cannot properly reflect the intrinsic semantics and relationships of keyphrases because they rely on a simple term-frequency-based process. Consequently, these methods are not effective in obtaining significant contextual knowledge. To resolve this, we propose a topical keyphrase extraction method based on a hierarchical semantic network and multiple centrality network measures that together reflect the hierarchical semantics of keyphrases. We conduct experiments on real data to examine the practicality of the proposed method and to compare its performance with that of existing topical keyphrase extraction methods. The results confirm that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art topical keyphrase extraction methods in terms of the representativeness of the selected keyphrases for each topic. The proposed method can effectively reflect intrinsic keyphrase semantics and interrelationships.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of information technology, platform-facilitated collaborative consumption has recently become attractive to consumers. A comparative study of consumers&#39; online review behavior and its impact on overall satisfaction and demand in the accommodation-sharing economy and the hotel industry indicates that consumers&#39; perceptions and behavior change gradually with changes in the level of sharing—from no sharing when staying in hotel rooms to intensive sharing when sharing rooms through collaborative consumption. Online consumer reviews focus on product and service attributes, and the influential factors of customer satisfaction and demand differ when consumers are at different accommodation-sharing levels. Not all attributes described in online reviews influence overall customer satisfaction. With a higher level of sharing, consumers&#39; valuation changes from more to less tangible attributes. Consumers at a higher sharing level care more about social interaction and economic value than consumers at a lower sharing level. Transaction costs, particularly the information search and acquisition costs, play an important role in influencing customer purchase decisions in the sharing economy. Consumers refer to direct information for tangible attributes and to previous consumers&#39; online reviews for intangible attributes to familiarize themselves with details before making purchase decisions. Our study provides implications that help platforms and hosts better target consumer segments with different sharing levels and more effectively utilize online reviews to generate positive electronic word of mouth to enhance consumer demand and the performance of platform economics.},

This dynamic is apparent in a variety of settings including criminal justice , environmental regulation, and marketing applications. However, the central task of the influencing entity is confounded by uncertainty regarding their understanding of the structure and/or parameters of the decisions being made. The research herein sets forth a decision support methodology to identify robust influence strategies under such uncertain conditions. Furthermore, the utility of this framework and its proper parameterization are illustrated via an application to the contemporary, global problem of the Afghan opium trade. Utilizing open source data, we demonstrate how counternarcotic policy can be informed using a quantitative analysis that embraces both the bounded rationality of the economy&#39;s decisionmakers and the government&#39;s uncertainty regarding the degree of their deviation from perfect rationality. In this manner, we provide a new framework with which robust influence decisions can be identified under realistic information conditions, and we discuss how it can be used to inform real-world policy.},

In fact, there exists no scholarly research explicating the concept or its measurement. This research makes an important contribution by conceptualizing cyber hygiene, operationalizing it, empirically identifying its sub-dimensions, and developing an inventory for it. The research achieves this with a mixed-methods approach, where using a combination of experts and a convenience sample of Internet users, it develops the initial items reflecting the construct, empirically refines the items, confirms its dimensions, and validates its fit. The outcome is an 18-item Cyber Hygiene Inventory (CHI) that measures five distinct dimensions of user cyber hygiene. Finally, the research demonstrates why cyber hygiene matters. Using the CHI it shows how cyber hygiene significantly predicts aspects of human cyber interaction that are pivotal to cyber safety including user self-beliefs about technology, how they cognitively process information online, and their online banking behavior.},

Tools using the methods of social network analysis have proven particularly effective in the identification of associations between individuals whose relationships are not otherwise evident. This identification is typically based on the links between individuals and does not account for other relevant information, such as individual attributes. The present study proposes a new model for identifying criminal associations that incorporates this type of data. Built around a linear association model, this approach identifies the principal association between two individuals. Assuming one of the individuals as the crime planner, the approach can be used to maximize his/her utility function . The model is compared with an existing algorithm for identifying associations using a real dataset provided by the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office of Región del Biobío-Chile. The results demonstrate the proposed model&#39;s effectiveness and flexibility in generating different association alternatives, a particularly useful feature that contributes to the more efficient use of criminal investigation resources.},

  abstract     = {Content sharing platforms such as product review websites largely depend on reviewers&#39; voluntary contributions. In order to motivate reviewers to contribute more, many platforms established incentive mechanisms, either reputation-based or financial. Yet most of the existing research has focused on reputations that are everlasting, such as badges and virtual points, or financial rewards where no evaluation exists about the users&#39; contributed content, such as rebates. There is still a significant gap in our understanding of how incentives with reevaluation mechanism actually influence reviewers&#39; behaviors such as their contribution levels, the opinion they express, and how they express. In this paper, we fill this gap using data collected from Yelp Elite Squad where reviewers with good reviewing history are awarded into the elite group and most importantly reevaluated each year. We draw from the accountability theory and conduct a difference-in-differences analysis to empirically study the effect of incentives with reevaluation mechanism on reviewers&#39; behaviors in both short term and long term. The results show that in short term, reviewers significantly increase their contribution levels, become more conservative with lower percentage of extreme ratings, and also increase the readability of their reviews. In long term, they continue improving the quality of reviews though their numerical rating behaviors stabilize. Our research has significant implications for business models that rely on user contributions.},

As long as the new cases are “similar enough” to the past cases, segmentation proceeds normally. However, when a new case is substantially different from the known cases, a reexamination of the previously created segments is required. The reexamination may result in the creation of new segments or in the updating of the existing ones. In this paper, we assume that in big and dynamic data environments it is not possible to reexamine all past data and, therefore, we suggest using small groups of selected cases, stored in small data buffers, as an alternative to the collection of all past data. We present an incremental dynamic classifier that supports real-time unsupervised segmentation in big and dynamic data environments. In order to reduce the computational effort of unsupervised clustering in such environments, the suggested model performs calculations only on the relevant data buffers that store the relevant representative cases. In addition, the suggested model can serve as a dynamic classification unit (DCU) that can act as an autonomous agent , as well as collaborate with other DCUs.
