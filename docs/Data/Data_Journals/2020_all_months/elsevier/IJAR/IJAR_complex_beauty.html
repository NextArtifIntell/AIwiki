  abstract     = {As two important methods used to deal with uncertainty, the rough set theory and the evidence theory have close connections with each other. The purpose of this paper is to examine relationships between the relation-based rough set theory and the evidence theory, and to present interpretations of belief structures in relation-based rough set algebras. The probabilities of relation lower and upper approximations from a serial relation yield a pair of belief and plausibility functions and its belief structure. Properties of the belief structures induced by different relation-based rough set algebras are explored in this paper. The belief structure induced from a reflexive (serial and transitive, serial and symmetric, serial and Euclidean, respectively) relation is reflexive (transitive, symmetric, Euclidean, respectively). Conversely, for a reflexive (transitive, symmetric, Euclidean, respectively) belief structure, there exist a probability and a reflexive (serial and transitive, serial and symmetric, serial and Euclidean, respectively) relation such that the belief and plausibility functions defined by the known belief structure are, respectively, the belief and plausibility functions induced by the relation approximation operators. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for a belief structure to be the belief structure induced by the relation approximation operators from different binary relations are presented.},

Until now, in this scenario the conjunction has been commonly modeled by a t-norm, but recently the possibility of using a more general conjunction has been pointed out. In this work, we want to generalize the Modus Tollens inequality by using a conjunctive uninorm instead of a t-norm, leading to the so-called U -Modus Tollens. First, we give a study of this new property for implication functions in general and then we specially focus on residual implications derived from uninorms. In all cases, we prove that there are a lot of solutions of the U -Modus Tollens and we give a characterization of all the solutions in some particular cases.},

  abstract     = {Feature selection is an indispensable work to make the data mining more effective. It reduces the computational complexity and effectively improves the performance of learning models. The exhaustive algorithm and the greedy algorithm cannot adapt to the current increasing number of features when finding the potential optimal feature subset. Therefore, the feasible way for feature selection called swarm intelligence algorithms becomes popular. The grasshopper optimization algorithm is a novel swarm intelligence algorithm which has good performance. In this study, we improve the grasshopper optimization algorithm by applying quantum method. A dynamic population quantum binary grasshopper optimization algorithm based on mutual information and rough set theory (DQBGOA_MR) for feature selection is proposed. Through the quantization of grasshopper individuals, the search scope of feature space is improved, and a good balance is achieved between exploration and exploitation. The premature and catastrophe strategies are used to avoid converge prematurely and fall into a local optimum. Moreover, the rough set and mutual information based evaluation criterion is defined which considers both effectiveness of selected features and the relation among unselected features, selected features, and classes. The proposed method is evaluated by extensive experiments in twenty UCI datasets. Experimental results show that DQBGOA_MR has better feature reduction rate, higher classification accuracy and more stable results compared to other swarm intelligence algorithms.},

Due to the incomplete considerations and poor feasibility of the drawbacks for existing methods, a set of the practical reliability design method is proposed in this paper. The time characteristics and many influential factors of units are considered in the design process. The influential factors of the system&#39;s units are scored by several experts with extensive engineering experience. Based on this, the reliability allocation and the maintainability prediction of the repairable system are performed using different methods. To realistically evaluate the reliability level of each unit obtained by three different methods, a fuzzy reliability evaluation method is developed to rank the reliability level of each unit with considerations of the mean time between failure (MTBF), mean time to repair (MTTR), failure frequency and availability using the compound weight and fuzzy membership function . Following this, redundant design is used to eliminate weaknesses to keep the system reliability at a high level. Using the reliability data obtained above, a time-dependent reliability model of the system considering load sharing is built to explore the influences of reliability allocation on the system reliability in the 20-year service life. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approaches are demonstrated with a 5MW offshore wind turbine.},

An interval is a typical notion of information representation with incompleteness and uncertainty. To measure the dominance degree of one interval dominating or being dominated by another is a hot issue. In this paper, a novel dominance measure is constituted by considering both lengths and locations of intervals. The proposed dominance measure distinguishes two overlapped or coincided intervals, and is able to quantize the separation degree of disjoint intervals . A notion of variable precision overall dominance relation is introduced by integrating both the attribute-wise evaluation information and overall dominance degree of objects. Based on the constituted dominance relation, two three-way decision models are presented in interval-valued decision systems with categorical and interval-valued decision attributes , respectively. Numerical examples of three-way decisions and simulated experiments on classification over two synthetic and four benchmark datasets are presented. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model can produce lower classification errors in comparison with existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Environmental investment prediction is an effective solution to reduce the wasteful investments of environmental management. Since environmental management involves diverse environmental indicators, investment prediction modeling usually causes the curse of dimensionality and uses irrelevant indicators. A common solution to solve these problems is the use of indicator selection methods to select representative indicators. However, different indicator selection methods have their relative strengths and weaknesses, resulting in different selected indicators and information loss of real representative indicators. Hence, in the present work, a new environmental investment prediction model is proposed on the basis of extended belief rule-based (EBRB) model along with the indicator ensemble selection (IES) and is called IES-EBRB model. The EBRB model is a white-box designed decision-making model and has the specialty on using prior knowledge to enhance data analytics for autonomous decision making; and the IES is an extension of ensemble learning to cooperatively integrate different kinds of indicator selection methods for selecting representative indicators. In a case study, the real world environment data from 2005 to 2018 of 31 provinces in China are applied to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the IES-EBRB model. Results show that the IES-EBRB model not only can obtain desired environmental investments, but also produces satisfactory accuracy compared to some existing investment prediction models.},

While various computational problems on independence relations can be solved by manipulating these smaller sets without the need to explicitly generate the full relation, existing algorithms for constructing these sets are associated with often prohibitively high running times. In this paper, we introduce a lattice structure for organising sets of independence statements and show that current algorithms are rendered computationally less demanding by exploiting new insights in the structural properties of independence gained from this lattice organisation. By means of a range of experimental results, we subsequently demonstrate that through the lattice organisation indeed a substantial gain in efficiency is achieved for fast-closure computation of semi-graphoid independence relations in practice.},

This framework allows us to specify a semantics for the probability of deontic statuses. The deontic argumentation part builds on standard concepts from the study of computational models of argument: rule-based arguments, argumentation graphs, argument labelling semantics and statement labelling semantics. We then encapsulate this deontic composition with the approach of probabilistic labellings to probabilistic argumentation, in order to associate deontic statements with probability values.

It helps us to analyze and solve problems better by dividing complex problems into several simpler ones. Three-way granular concept is an important concept proposed by combining granular computing, formal concept analysis and three-way decision. Using traditional updating methods of three-way granular concepts, a lot of time and space resources are needed when multiple attributes or objects are deleted in formal context. In order to improve the efficiency and flexibility of obtaining three-way concepts, this paper discusses a novel dynamic update method of three-way granular concepts. In this paper, we firstly introduce the related knowledge of three-way granular concepts. Secondly, the update rules of the extension and connotation of attribute-induced three-way granular concepts are discussed in the dynamic formal context to construct three-way granular concepts. Moreover, we develop a method for establishing attribute-induced three-way granular concept by dynamic changes in the case of deleting multiple objects and attributes in the formal context. Furthermore, we design four algorithms to compare between the proposed approaches and traditional updating ways of three-way granular concepts. Finally, the validity of dynamic update method of attribute-induced three-way granular concept is verified through the experimental evaluation using six datasets coming from the University of California-Irvine (UCI) repository.},

The time consumed in the process of maintaining approximations from scratch makes it natural to take into account incremental strategies in order to reduce computational complexity in dynamic multigranulation contexts. To address this challenge, we propose two matrix-based incremental strategies that can dynamically update the lower and upper approximations of each decision class with incremental granular structures in dominance-based multigranulation rough sets (DMGRSs). Moreover, the corresponding incremental algorithms are designed for handling dynamic multi-source ordered data. Ultimately, empirical experiments conducted on UCI data sets depict that the proposed algorithms exhibit a better computational performance compared with the matrix-based static algorithm.},

We focus on the semantical foundations in service of providing abstractions of well-known problems such as SAT, Bayesian inference , generative models , learning and convex optimization . Programs are understood in terms of first-order logic structures with semiring labels, which allows us to freely combine and integrate problems from different AI disciplines and represent non-standard problems over unbounded domains .

  abstract     = {Sum-Product Networks (SPN) are deep probabilistic models with demonstrated excellent performance in several machine learning tasks. As with many other probabilistic models, performing Maximum-A-Posteriori inference in SPNs is NP-hard. Selective SPNs are a subclass of SPNs that allow for efficient Maximum-A-Posteriori inference and closed-form parameter learning. Due to the high number of parameters, SPNs learned from data can produce unreliable and overconfident inferences, especially for instances with low statistical support. This issue can be partially mitigated by performing a robustness analysis of inferences with respect to small changes in the parameters. In this work, we address the problem of assessing the robustness of Maximum-A-Posteriori inferences produced with Selective SPNs to global perturbations of the parameters. We consider such an inference robust if it remains the single maximizer under small perturbations of the model parameters. We present efficient algorithms and an empirical analysis with realistic problems involving missing data completion and multilabel classification. The experiments show that our criteria are informative with respect to the inference accuracy, suggesting that it indeed discriminate robust and non-robust instances.},

In this paper, we examine one of these approaches, namely fuzzy rough sets with crisp reference sets, from a lattice-theoretic point of view. We connect the lower and upper approximations of a fuzzy relation R to the approximations of the core and support of R . We also show that the lattice of fuzzy rough sets corresponding to a fuzzy equivalence relation R and the crisp subsets of its universe is isomorphic to the lattice of rough sets for the (crisp) equivalence relation E , where E is the core of R . We establish a connection between the exact (fuzzy) sets of R and the exact (crisp) sets of the support of R .},

We show that some well known properties, valid in the case of unconditional events, still hold in our approach to logical operations among conditional events. In particular we prove a decomposition formula and a related additive property. Then, we introduce the set of conditional constituents generated by n conditional events and we show that they satisfy the basic properties valid in the case of unconditional events. We obtain a generalized inclusion-exclusion formula and we prove a suitable distributivity property. Moreover, under logical independence of basic unconditional events, we give two necessary and sufficient coherence conditions. The first condition gives a geometrical characterization for the coherence of prevision assessments on a family F F constituted by n conditional events and all possible conjunctions among them. The second condition characterizes the coherence of prevision assessments defined on F ∪ K F∪K , where K K is the set of conditional constituents associated with the conditional events in F F .

In this method, general nonlinear systems are converted to equivalent Duffing nonlinear systems according to the minimum mean square error criterion, whose exact analytical solution of the random steady-state responses can be determined by a FokkerPlanckKolmogorov equation. Then the exact results of stochastic responses are used to analyze structural dynamic reliability. To use the equivalent nonlinear system method to analyze structural dynamic reliability is not only convenient for calculation but highly accurate. In addition, the presented equivalent nonlinear system has a parameter ε , which controls the degree of nonlinearity. Thus, it is easy to obtain the corresponding analysis results from converting the original system to equivalent nonlinear systems with different degrees of nonlinearity by changing the value of ε . Especially, when ε is zero, the equivalent nonlinear system will degenerate to the linear system, and leading to the analysis results of the equivalent linearization method . An example shows that the analysis results of the proposed equivalent nonlinear system method are reliable, and the calculation appears to be more accurate than that of the equivalent linearization method.},

A case study is presented consisting of experimental measurements and their mathematical analysis. The decisive parameters (wave speed and damping coefficient) of a mathematical model of the acoustic wave are calibrated by comparing the measurement data with the numerically evaluated exact solution predicted by the mathematical model. The calibration is done both deterministically by minimizing the square error over time and stochastically by a Bayesian approach, implemented through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The resulting posterior distribution of the parameters can be used to construct a Bayesian test for damage.},

The fuzzy β -covering approximation space ( β -FCAS) is a generalization of the FCAS through replacing the value 1 with a parameter β . In other words, the β -FCAS is the basis of studying fuzzy covering-based rough sets and their applications. Therefore, it is necessary to study some questions in the fuzzy covering approximation space, such as problems of reduction, relationships among some basic concepts and relationships between two fuzzy covering approximation spaces. In this article, we investigate the questions in the β -FCAS further. Firstly, the definitions of I-irreducible element and I-reduct are presented, which can be seen as the complement of the existing notions. Then, relationships among some concepts in the β -FCAS are investigated, such as the relationship between fuzzy β -minimal description and β -reduct, and the relationship between fuzzy β -covering and its I-reduct. Thirdly, inspired by some concepts in the β -FCAS, we present some new concepts between two β -FCASs and their properties. Based on these new concepts, we present some conditions such that two fuzzy β -coverings have the same reduct (or I-reduct). Finally, based on the results above, seven derived β -FCASs are investigated further and a corresponding lattice of them is proposed.},

  abstract     = {The n -dimensional fuzzy logic ( n -DFL) has been contributed to overcome the insufficiency of traditional fuzzy logic in modeling imperfect and imprecise information, coming from different opinions of many experts by considering the possibility to model not only ordered but also repeated membership degrees. Thus, n -DFL provides a consolidated logical strategy for applied technologies since the ordered evaluations provided by decision makers impact not only by selecting the best solutions for a decision making problem, but also by enabling their comparisons. In such context, this paper studies the n -dimensional fuzzy implications ( n -DI) following distinct approaches: (i) analytical studies, presenting the most desirable properties as neutrality, ordering, (contra-)symmetry, exchange and identity principles, discussing their interrelations and exemplifications; (ii) algebraic aspects mainly related to left- and right-continuity of representable n -dimensional fuzzy t-conorms; and (iii) generating n -DI from existing fuzzy implications. As the most relevant contribution, the prospective studies in the class of n -dimensional interval (S,N)-implications include results obtained from t-representable n -dimensional conorms and involutive n -dimensional fuzzy negations. And, these theoretical results are applied to model approximate reasoning of inference schemes, dealing with based-rule in n -dimensional interval fuzzy systems. A synthetic case-study illustrates the solution for a decision-making problem in medical diagnoses.},

First, using BWM to preprocess the attribute indicators of the decision problem, the relationship between the criteria important for decision problem is determined. Then, according to the importance of the determined level of granularity, from rough to clear, three-way decisions are made in sequence at each level. In this way, we obtain a lattice based three-way decision-making process. Also, in the process at each granularity, we consider the costs of both the decision process and the decision result. Thus, this paper builds a multigranulation sequential three-way decisions model with cost-sensitive. Next, based on the above-mentioned model, we propose a decision procedure and an algorithm for multi-attribute group decision making. It is worth noting that according to the research goals of the decision problem, MULTIMOORA is used to sort the classified alternatives. And a ranking result of the decision problem is given. Finally, the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model is verified by a multi-attribute group decision problem. The problem is the case of emergency diagnosis and treatment after a highway accident . And put forward reasonable suggestions for further development direction.},

Hence global maxima of the marginal likelihood are (infinitely) degenerate and predictions of the marginal likelihood are not unique. We show how to generalize the marginal likelihood by introducing an effective temperature, and making it similar to the free energy. This generalization resolves the observational nonidentifiability, since its maximization leads to unique results that are better than a random selection of one degenerate maximum of the marginal likelihood or the averaging over many such maxima. The generalized likelihood inherits many features from the usual likelihood, e.g. it holds the conditionality principle, and its local maximum can be searched for via suitably modified expectation-maximization method. The maximization of the generalized likelihood relates to entropy optimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an axiomatic framework for influence diagram computation, which allows reasoning with partially ordered values of utility. We show how an algorithm based on sequential variable elimination can be used to compute the set of maximal values of expected utility (up to an equivalence relation). Formalisms subsumed by the framework include decision making under uncertainty based on multi-objective utility, or on interval-valued utilities, as well as a more qualitative decision theory based on order of magnitude probabilities and utilities. Consequently, we also introduce the order of magnitude influence diagram to model and solve partially specified sequential decision problems when only qualitative (or imprecise) information is available.},

In a multivariate context, we propose a notion of marginalisation , and its inverse operation called weak (cylindrical) extension. We combine this with our definition of conditioning to define a notion of irrelevance, and we obtain the irrelevant natural extension in this framework: the least informative choice function that satisfies a given irrelevance assessment.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are logic circuits where the inputs of disjunctive gates are annotated by probability values. They allow for a compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets of Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints defined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually “learned” from a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent inferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we develop the credal sentential decision diagrams , a generalisation of their probabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities with (so-called credal ) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint credal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability zero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference algorithms are derived for these models. These allow to compute: (i) the lower and upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables; (ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single variable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic sentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the same most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation of the other variables. These inferences are tractable , as all the three algorithms, based on bottom-up traversal with local linear programming tasks on the disjunctive gates, can be solved in polynomial time with respect to the circuit size. The first algorithm is always exact, while the remaining two might induce a conservative (outer) approximation in the case of multiply connected circuits. A semantics for this approximation together with an auxiliary algorithm able to decide whether or not the result is exact is also provided together with a brute-force characterization of the exact inference in these cases. For a first empirical validation, we consider a simple application based on noisy seven-segment display images. The credal models are observed to properly distinguish between easy and hard-to-detect instances and outperform other generative models not able to cope with logical constraints.},

The axiomatic framework used is analogous to von Neumann-Morgenstern&#39;s utility theory for probabilistic lotteries as described by Luce and Raiffa. Unlike the probabilistic case, our axiomatic framework leads to interval-valued utilities, and therefore, to a partial (incomplete) preference order on the set of all belief function lotteries. If the belief function reference lotteries we use are Bayesian belief functions, then our representation theorem coincides with Jaffray&#39;s representation theorem for his linear utility theory for belief functions. We illustrate our representation theorem using some examples discussed in the literature, and we propose a simple model for assessing utilities based on an interval-valued pessimism index representing a decision-maker&#39;s attitude to ambiguity and indeterminacy . Finally, we compare our decision theory with those proposed by Jaffray, Smets, Dubois et al., Giang and Shenoy, and Shafer.},

First, the concepts of support intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets are defined, and their related properties are discussed. Then, we combine support intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets with multigranulation rough sets (MRSs), present optimistic/pessimistic multigranulation support intuitionistic fuzzy rough set models, and discuss their corresponding properties. Second, a parameter α is introduced to constrain the disjunction and conjunction of multiple support intuitionistic fuzzy relations , and variable optimistic and pessimistic multigranulation support intuitionistic fuzzy rough set models are constructed. Third, we define the similarity measure, positive ideal solution, negative ideal solution, and conditional probability based on multigranulation support intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets. Four kinds of TWD models based on four proposed multigranulation support intuitionistic fuzzy rough set models are established. Finally, decision rules can be obtained from a new score function and accuracy function, and the decision rule extraction algorithm based on multigranulation support intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets is designed. Experimental results on a series of examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TWD models.},

By using the dependence space, we introduce a closure operator . Related properties of the operator are discussed. It is also proved that any closed element of the closure operator is the maximum element in the attribute granule generated by the element. Further, the closed element is just the intension of some formal concept. Similarly, we define a congruence relation on the basis of a sufficiency operator, and introduce a dependence space on the power set of the object set. A closure operator is proposed for the subset of objects. The corresponding closed element of the closure operator is the maximum element in each object granule. All maximum elements generate the set of all extensions of the concept lattice. An example is used to show the validity of the approach to obtain all intensions. Finally, we introduce a dominance congruence relation, which is used to produce a closure operator. The dependence of attributes is defined based on the closure operator.

Since the effect of inherent uncertainties as well as the spatial variability of soils cannot be reflected via the deterministic factor of safety, probabilistic stability analyses of slopes reinforced with pile in spatially constant soils and spatially variable soils were successively carried out, respectively. The failure probability was determined by random limit equilibrium method (RLEM) considering the influence of different pile locations, pile length and soil statistical parameters. The optimal locations along slope and length of pile were analyzed based on the reliability analyses results in spatially constant soils and spatially variable soils, which were inconsistent with the results via the traditional deterministic methods, with a lower probability of sliding failure. Finally, method was proposed to determine the minimum samples of simulation iterations for investigating the convergence of failure probability of soil slope reinforced with piles. The results revealed that the multiple potential sliding surfaces introduced by the installations of pile would result in the increased uncertainty of slope failures.},

Firstly, decision support characteristic function and decision related characteristic function are constructed. Secondly, a pair of aggregation operators, including fixed aggregation operator and possible aggregation operator, is defined through two characteristic functions. Meanwhile, the two cases when thresholds α and β take special values are discussed. Finally, the relevant properties of aggregation operators in different situations are proposed and proved. What is more, two groups of comparative experiments are carried out to illustrate the effect of the aggregation operators.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of quantification and propagation of uncertainties associated with dependence modeling when data for characterizing probability models are limited. Practically, the system inputs are often assumed to be mutually independent or correlated by a multivariate Gaussian distribution . However, this subjective assumption may introduce bias in the response estimate if the real dependence structure deviates from this assumption. In this work, we overcome this limitation by introducing a flexible copula dependence model to capture complex dependencies. A hierarchical Bayesian multimodel approach is proposed to quantify uncertainty in dependence model-form and model parameters that result from small data sets. This approach begins by identifying, through Bayesian multimodel inference, a set of candidate marginal models and their corresponding model probabilities, and then estimating the uncertainty in the copula-based dependence structure, which is conditional on the marginals and their parameters. The overall uncertainties integrating marginals and copulas are probabilistically represented by an ensemble of multivariate candidate densities. A novel importance sampling reweighting approach is proposed to efficiently propagate the overall uncertainties through a computational model . Through an example studying the influence of constituent properties on the out-of-plane properties of transversely isotropic E-glass fiber composites , we show that the composite property with copula-based dependence model converges to the true estimate as data set size increases, while an independence or arbitrary Gaussian correlation assumption leads to a biased estimate.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we introduce and analyze the concepts of a fixed ordering structure and a variable ordering structure on intervals. The fixed ordering structures on intervals are defined with the help of a pointed convex cone of intervals. A variable ordering is defined by a set-valued map whose values are convex cones of intervals. In the sequel, a few properties of a cone of intervals are derived. It is shown that a binary relation , defined by a convex cone of intervals, is a partial order relation on intervals; further, the relation is antisymmetric if the convex cone of intervals is pointed. Several results under which a variable ordering map of intervals satisfies the conditions of a partial ordering relation of intervals are provided. The introduced fixed and variable ordering of intervals are applied to define and characterize optimal elements of an optimization problem with interval-valued functions. Finally, we propose a numerical technique and present its algorithmic implementation to obtain the set of optimal elements of an interval optimization problem. We also provide illustrative examples to support the study.},

  abstract     = {Three-way concept analysis provides a novel model for three-way decisions, and also extends the classical formal concept analysis, which has attracted many attentions in recent years. In order to construct three-way concept lattices , original formal context and its complement context need to be considered simultaneously. In this paper, a new method of constructing attribute-induced three-way (AE) and object-induced three-way (OE) concept lattices is proposed. Firstly, we introduce an AE-oriented composite operator and an OE-oriented composite operator that combine a pair of formal concepts coming from the concept lattices of original formal context and its complement context. Secondly, we define the candidate AE concepts and redundant AE concepts based on the AE-oriented composite operator, and define the candidate OE concepts and redundant OE concepts based on the OE-oriented composite operator, respectively. Finally, we propose an AE lattice construction algorithm and an OE lattice construction algorithm. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is simple and effective, and it is a useful supplement to current three-way concept lattice construction methods.},

In our approach, however, we avoid triviality because the import-export principle is invalid. We then analyze an example of reasoning under partial knowledge where, given a conditional if A then C as information, the probability of A should intuitively increase. We explain this intuition by making some implicit background information explicit. We consider several (generalized) iterated conditionals, which allow us to formalize different kinds of latent information. We verify that for these iterated conditionals the prevision is greater than or equal to the probability of A . We also investigate the lower and upper bounds of the Affirmation of the Consequent inference. We conclude our study with some remarks on the supposed “independence” of two conditionals, and we interpret this property as uncorrelation between two random quantities.},

  abstract     = {Various methods have been proposed to express and solve maximum likelihood problems with incomplete data. In some of these approaches, the idea is that incompleteness makes the likelihood function imprecise. Two proposals can be found to cope with this situation: the maximax approach that maximizes the greatest likelihood value induced by precise data sets compatible with the incomplete observations, and the maximin approach that maximizes the least such likelihood value. These approaches prove to display extreme behaviors in some contexts, the maximax approach having a tendency to disambiguate the data, while the maximin approach favors uniform distributions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach consisting in minimizing a relative regret criterion with respect to maximal likelihood solutions obtained for all precise data sets compatible with the coarse data. In contrast with the maximax and the maximin methods, the min-max-regret method relies on comparing relative likelihoods and obtains results that achieve a trade-off between results of the two other methods. The methods are compared on toy examples and also on simulated random data as well as a supervised classification problem.},

We show that unless the falsity propositional constant is part of the defeasible assumptions, the grounded and the well-founded semantics for ABFs lack most of the desirable properties they have in abstract argumentation frameworks (AAFs), and that for simple definitions of the contrariness operator and the attacks relations, preferred and stable semantics are reduced to naive semantics. We also show the redundancy of the closure condition in the standard definition of Dung&#39;s semantics for ABFs, and investigate the use of disjunctive attacks in this setting. Finally, we show some close relations of reasoning with ABFs to reasoning with maximally consistent sets of premises, and consider some properties of the induced entailments , such as being cumulative, preferential, or rational relations that satisfy non-interference.},

  abstract     = {Label distribution learning (LDL) is a generalized machine learning framework for dealing with label ambiguity, as it can explore the relative importance levels of different labels in the description of each sample. Although several algorithms have been proposed to solve LDL problems, they usually destroy the consistency of geometric structures between feature space and label space to a certain extent, which frequently plays a significant role in learning tasks. Meanwhile, most existing LDL algorithms only take predictive performances into consideration, while ignoring the computational cost and robustness to noises. To remedy above deficiencies, we propose a novel algorithm, i.e., Local Collaborative Representation based Label Distribution Learning, shortly LCR-LDL. In LCR-LDL, an unlabeled sample is treated as the collaborative representation of the local dictionary constructed by the neighborhood of the unlabeled sample, and the discriminatory information of representation coefficients is used to reconstruct the label distribution of the unlabeled sample. Experimental results on 20 real-world LDL data sets compared with results produced by 11 state-of-the-art algorithms show that, the proposed LCR-LDL algorithm can not only effectively improve the predictive performances for LDL tasks, but also exhibit higher robustness and a lightweight computational overhead. This study suggests new trends for considering the computational cost and robustness issues in the LDL community.},

Then, we prove that sys-consistent functions are structure-preserving mappings with respect to interior and closure operators on neighborhood systems, whereas gra-consistent functions are not. In addition, we connect consistent functions with well-known model-theoretic notions of bisimulations and bounded morphisms in modal logic. As a consequence, this implies that properties described by modal formulas remain invariant under consistent mappings.

One of the most important aspects related to energy efficiency is the need for a suitable model of energy consumption that can be used to make predictions or to aid experts in high level decision making processes. Symbolic regression techniques can be used to discover an energy consumption model that fits these purposes. Traditionally, the problem of symbolic regression has been solved by using genetic programming approaches to find the algebraic expression that best fits the regression problem data, where each expression is encoded as a tree structure . In previous works, we found that a different approach using Straight Line Programs as a representation technique could provide promising results for symbolic regression, although the size of the resulting algebraic expression might be increased when compared to the traditional approach. This work proposes an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for Straight Line Programs to solve the problem, and makes a study to compare the approach with traditional genetic programming in a real energy consumption modelling problem.},

He studies the fusion of independent elementary partially reliable pieces of evidence coming from different sources, showing that not all belief functions can be seen as the combination of simple support functions, representing such pieces of evidence, using Dempster rule. It only yields a special kind of belief functions called separable. In 1995, Ph. Smets has indicated that any non-dogmatic belief function can be seen as the combination of so-called generalized simple support functions, whose masses may lie outside the unit interval. It comes down to viewing a belief function as the result of combining two separable belief functions, one of which models reports from sources, and the other one expresses doubt, via a retraction operation. We propose a new interpretation of the latter belief function in terms of prejudice of the receiver, and consider retraction as a special kind of belief change. Its role is to weaken the support of some focal sets of a belief function, possibly stemming from the fusion of the incoming information. It provides an alternative extensive account of non-dogmatic belief functions as a theory of merging pieces of evidence and prejudices, which partially differs from Shafer approach&#39;s based on support functions and coarsenings. Retraction differs from discounting, revision, and from the symmetric combination of conflicting evidence. The approach relies on a so-called diffidence function on the positive reals ranging from full confidence to full diffidence. We also discuss information orderings and combination rules that rely on diffidence functions. Finally, we study the diffidence-based ordering and combination in the consonant case, and show that the diffidence view suggests a new branch of possibility theory, in agreement with likelihood functions.},

The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations.

In this paper, based on a brief review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using α -similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using α -meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.},

This paper proposes a new frame addressing the issue, the so-called ( Δ M − , Δ M + ) (ΔM−,ΔM+) instead. This new version smoothly matches with ⁎ ⁎ ( M ⁎ , M ⁎ ) (M⁎,M⁎) w.r.t. the topological operators. Furthermore, both ⁎ ⁎ ( M ⁎ , M ⁎ ) (M⁎,M⁎) and ( Δ M − , Δ M + ) (ΔM−,ΔM+) are shown to have many theoretical and mathematical properties in common. Therefore, they can efficiently be used in applied sciences with a strong combination. Besides, they can support certain decision rules without any limitations of studying something continuous or discrete (or digital) from the viewpoint of covering rough set theory . In this paper each of a universe U and a target set X of U need not be finite, and a covering C C is locally finite.},

The reason lies in lacking evidential granules carrying knowledge and evidence for inferential learning. The shortage slows down representation learning which aims at discovering expressions for featuring concepts. Therefore, this paper proposes evidential memberships carrying preferential relevance to build a heuristic representation learning. Empirically, it solves local features and global representations with maximum coverage under challenges of shallow bury. For illustration, it is implemented on the testing data set of UCI-SPECTF.},

  abstract     = {Shadowed set provide a three-way approximation scheme for transforming a fuzzy set into three disjoint areas (elevated, reduced, and shadow areas). A fundamental issue in the construction of shadowed sets is the interpretation and determination of a pair of thresholds ( α , β ) (α,β) . Several extended shadowed set models have been proposed to calculate ( α , β ) (α,β) . However, the construction of a few of these models may have a large fuzzy entropy loss, and the determination of ( α , β ) (α,β) involves artificial subjective parameters. Therefore, in this study, a novel shadowed set model is proposed, namely, mean-entropy-based shadowed sets (MESS). At first, based on the principle of uncertainty invariance, a novel framework of three-way approximations of fuzzy sets is proposed based on the mean of fuzzy entropy. Secondly, new decision rules are generated based on the fuzzy entropy loss, and ( α , β ) (α,β) is obtained. Thirdly, the MESS model is optimized more reasonably using an iterative method, and thus the fuzzy entropy loss of the MESS model can be minimized. Finally, the validity and rationality of the proposed model are verified by instances and experimental analysis.},

  abstract     = {The monotonicity of the system function of a fuzzy relational inference (FRI) system is one of the most important issues that need attention. The unavailability of monotonicity of the system function of an FRI system is not desirable in many practical settings. Works existing in the literature have dealt with monotonicity of the system function of an FRI system where fuzzy implications have been widely used and those fuzzy implications are known to come from a residuated lattice structure. Moreover, there are very few studies where monotonicity has been studied under a non-residuated lattice structure. Building on our recent work on monotonicity under a non-residuated setting, in this work, we ensure that the system function of a certain type of FRI system with a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) implicative rule base and ordering property preserving fuzzy implications is monotonic. Towards doing this, we represent the monotone fuzzy rule base by a fuzzy relation that involves fuzzy implications which satisfy the so-called neutrality property and ordering property, simultaneously. It should be highlighted that this work generalizes the class of fuzzy implications that can be employed in an FRI system without modifying the rule base to ensure the monotonic nature of the system function, giving more choices to the practitioners.},

This method employs rough set theory (RST) along with a newly introduced binary version of the water wave optimization approach (WWO) which is denoted by BWWO. WWO simulates the phenomena of water waves, such as propagation, refraction, and breaking and is one of the newest nature inspired methods for global optimization problems . In our approach, BWWO utilizes the phenomena of water waves propagation, refraction, and breaking in a binary version. Two main experiments based on the rough set approach and wrapper method as a part of the objective function are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. In the first experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on RST is demonstrated on 16 different datasets. The proposed approach is compared with various typical attribute reduction methods and popular optimizers in the literature, such as ant colony, nonlinear great deluge algorithm, scatter search and others. For the second experiment, a feature subset that maximizes the classification accuracy (using cross-validated k NN classifier) with minimizing the number of selected features is obtained over 17 different datasets. In wrapper experiment BWWO is compared with the binary gray wolf optimization , binary particle swarm optimizer, binary cat swarm optimization , binary dragonfly algorithm and the binary bat algorithm . The computational results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach in finding a minimal features subset that maximize the classification accuracy. Furthermore, Friedman test and Wilcoxon&#39;s rank-sum test are carried out at 5\% significance level in this study.},

It eliminates the correlation threshold hyperparameter often used in other structure learning techniques, allowing Prometheus to learn structures that are robust in low data regimes. Prometheus outperforms other structure learning techniques in 30 discrete and continuous domains.

Unlike previous approaches that employ a rule learner (for structure learning) and a weight learner (for parameter learning) sequentially, we develop a gradient-boosted approach that performs both simultaneously. Our approach learns a set of weak relational regression trees , whose paths from root to leaf are conjunctive clauses and represent the structure, and whose leaf values represent the parameters. When the learned relational regression trees are transformed into a lifted RBM, its hidden nodes are precisely the conjunctive clauses derived from the relational regression trees. This leads to a more interpretable and explainable model. Our empirical evaluations clearly demonstrate this aspect, while displaying no loss in effectiveness of the learned models.},

Probabilistic neighborhood rough sets (PNRSs) model, which is a generalized rough set model by combining neighborhood rough sets (NRSs) with probabilistic theory, can efficiently handle numerical data with noise values and allow tolerance of errors. Approximations of a target concept are fundamental and vital notions of the PNRSs, which can induce the certain and uncertain decision rules. Nevertheless, data evolves over time due to dynamic characteristics, especially, the addition of new attributes and the deletion of redundant or irrelevant attributes. Therefore, the potential meaningful knowledge may alter over time accordingly. To improve the efficiency of acquiring decision rules, the three-way regions (i.e., the positive, negative, and boundary regions) of the PNRSs need to be updated in an incremental fashion. To address this issue, two incremental algorithms for updating the three-way regions of each decision class of the PNRSs are investigated from the matrix perspective with time-evolving attributes (namely, adding attributes and deleting attributes). First, a matrix-based characterization of the three-way regions of each decision class of the PNRSs is constructed. Subsequently, considering the variation of the attributes, matrix-based updating mechanisms for relevant matrices are developed by means of the previously calculated information. Furthermore, the incremental algorithms are developed by taking advantage of the matrix-based updating mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments are performed on benchmark UCI data sets, and comparative results demonstrate our proposed algorithms consistently outperform the non-incremental algorithm in terms of computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a special approach for the design of complex systems in early development stages accounting for lack-of-knowledge uncertainty. As complex systems have to be broken down into their components by a decoupling methodology, the presented work regards so-called box-shaped solution spaces as subsets of the total set of permissible designs not violating any design constraints. Hereby, the design variables are decoupled and their design intervals are maximized. Then, each aspect related to the corresponding interval can be studied independently in a subsequent development step by different stakeholders (design groups or designers). Especially in early design phases, the consideration of uncertainty is crucial; this is not so much related to aleatoric uncertainty as probability functions are often unavailable. More important and more difficult to handle is epistemic uncertainty , i.e., lack-of-knowledge uncertainty. Here, uncertainties which occur later in the development and the facts that the current design stage does not include smaller design features and that the available models represent only coarsely the later designs are important. This paper complements prior work by providing a complete methodology for relevant uncertainties. This includes uncertainties in controllable design variables as well as in uncontrollable parameters all captured by interval arithmetic . Furthermore, it extends existing worst-case approaches by best-case approaches. The user can now base design decisions on (a) a deterministic solution space without consideration of lack-of-knowledge uncertainties, (b) the same with consideration of uncertainties in uncontrollable parameters only or controllable variables only, or (c) the most complete approach where uncertainties in both controllable variables and uncontrollable parameters are considered. The corresponding scenarios are exemplified via examples from automotive engineering (design for crashworthiness).},

Relations of this kind occur quite naturally in various domains, such as preference modeling and preference learning. For example, Q ( i , j ) Q(i,j) could be the fraction of voters in a population who prefer candidate i to candidate j . In the literature, various attempts have been made at generalizing the notion of transitivity to reciprocal relations. In this paper, we compare three important frameworks of generalized transitivity: g -stochastic transitivity, T -transitivity, and cycle-transitivity. To this end, we introduce E-transitivity as an even more general notion. We also use this framework to extend an existing hierarchy of different types of transitivity. As an illustration, we study transitivity properties of probabilities of pairwise preferences , which are induced as marginals of an underlying probability distribution on rankings (strict total orders) of a set of alternatives. In particular, we analyze the interesting case of the so-called Babington Smith model, a parametric family of distributions of that kind.},

For complex agents operating in uncertain, complex and rapidly-changing environments it is difficult to guarantee safety without imposing unrealistic assumptions and restrictions. It is therefore necessary to complement traditional formal verification with monitoring of the running system after deployment. Runtime verification can be used to monitor that an agent behaves according to a formal specification. The specification can contain safety-related requirements and assumptions about the environment, environment-agent interactions and agent-agent interactions. A key problem is the uncertain and changing nature of the environment. This necessitates requirements on how probable a certain outcome is and on predictions of future states. We propose Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic (ProbSTL) by extending Signal Temporal Logic with a sub-language to allow statements over probabilities , observations and predictions. We further introduce and prove the correctness of the incremental stream reasoning technique progression over well-formed formulas in ProbSTL. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the applicability and benefits of ProbSTL for robot safety.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address ambiguity, intended as a characteristic of any data expression for which a unique meaning cannot be associated by the computational agent for either lack of information or multiple interpretations of the same configuration. In particular, we will propose and discuss ways in which a decision-support classifier can accept ambiguous data and make some (informative) value out of them for the decision maker . Towards this goal we propose a set of learning algorithms within what we call the three-way-in and three-way-out approach, that is, respectively, learning from partially labeled data and learning classifiers that can abstain. This approach is based on orthopartitions, as a common representation framework, and on three-way decisions and evidence theory , as tools to enable uncertain and approximate reasoning and inference. For both the above learning settings, we provide experimental results and comparisons with standard Machine Learning techniques , and show the advantages and promising performances of the proposed approaches on a collection of benchmarks, including a real-world medical dataset.},

  abstract     = {The trisecting-acting-outcome (TAO) model of three-way decisions comprises three components, i.e., constructing a trisection, strategies for action, and measuring the outcome. Existing research seldom involves the third component, i.e., measuring the effectiveness of the outcome. A previous study provides a strategy select method by analyzing benefits or costs in the movement-based three-way decision. However, we often choose a strategy depend on the probability or distribution of three regions instead of the benefits or costs. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic movement model of three-way decision and give a strategy selection mechanism based on information entropy. Conditional entropy and cross entropy are used to select strategies by measuring these probabilities according to the user&#39;s preferences and structural features of the three partitions. It selects the action or strategy which has the maximum probability of desirable movements based on the minimization of the conditional entropy. It also selects the action or strategy which has the least difference between actual probabilistic distributions and expected probabilistic distribution based on the minimization of the cross entropy. We give two examples to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the strategy selection method in the probabilistic movement model of three-way decision.},

  abstract     = {Risk assessment is an important decision support task in many domains, including health, engineering, process management, and economy. There is a growing interest in automated methods for risk assessment. These methods should be able to process information efficiently and with little user involvement. Currently, from the scientific literature in the health domain, there is availability of evidence-based knowledge about specific risk factors. On the other hand, there is no automatic procedure to exploit this available knowledge in order to create a general risk assessment tool which can combine the available quantitative data about risk factors and their impact on the corresponding risk. We present a Framework for the Assessment of Risk of adverse Events (FARE) and its first concrete applications FRAT-up and DRAT-up, which were used for fall and depression risk assessment in older persons and validated on four and three European epidemiological datasets, respectively. FARE consists of i) a novel formal ontology called On2Risk; and ii) a logical and probabilistic rule-based model. The ontology was designed to represent qualitative and quantitative data about risks in a general, structured and machine-readable manner so that this data may be concretely exploited by risk assessment algorithms. We describe the structure of the FARE model in the form of logic and probabilistic rules. We show how when starting from machine-readable data about risk factors, like the data contained in On2Risk, an instance of the algorithm can be automatically constructed and used to estimate the risk of an adverse event.},

Then, based on the correlation between the loss functions and the IFNs, we get the relative loss functions based on IFNs. At the same time, the classification rules of the TWDs are discussed from different viewpoints, including the thresholds and their properties. Aiming at MADM problems with unreasonable values, a new integrated method of relative loss functions is established to obtain a fairer loss integration result of alternatives. In addition, considering that there are no decision attributes and only condition attributes in MADM, we use grey relational degree to calculate the condition probability .

The model is able to manage also “unexpected” (i.e., “null”) conditioning events and distinguishes between a systematically pessimistic or optimistic behavior, either referring to “objective” belief functions or their dual plausibility functions.

  abstract     = {In neighborhood rough set, radius is a key factor. Different radii may generate different neighborhood relations for discriminating samples. Unfortunately, it is possible that two samples with different labels are regarded as indistinguishable, mainly because the neighborhood relation does not always provide satisfactory discriminating performance. Moreover, it should be noticed that the process of obtaining reducts in terms of multiple different radii is very time-consuming, mainly because different radii imply different reducts and those reducts should be searched, respectively. To solve the above problems, not only a supervised neighborhood relation is proposed for obtaining better discriminating performance, but also an accelerator is designed to speed up the process of obtaining reducts. Firstly, both intra-class radius and inter-class radius are proposed to distinguish samples. Different from the previous approaches, the labels of samples are taken into account and then this is why our approach is referred to as the supervised neighborhood based strategy. Secondly, from the viewpoint of the variation of radius, an accelerator is designed which aims to quickly obtain multiple radii based reducts. Such mechanism is based on the consideration that the reduct in terms of the previous radius may guide the process of obtaining the reduct in terms of the current radius. The experimental results over 12 UCI data sets show the following: 1) compared with the traditional and pseudo-label neighborhood based reducts, our supervised neighborhood based reducts can provide higher classification accuracies ; 2) our accelerator can significantly reduce the elapsed time for obtaining reducts. This study suggests new trends for considering neighborhood rough set related topics.},

With the development of related research, many modifications of the definition of characteristic relation have been proposed. However, few of them can be used for decision rule induction due to the so-called definability problem. In this paper, by using the wide sense of the three-way decision theory, we extend the notions of characteristic relation and characteristic set to the systems with four types of characteristic relations and characteristic sets, respectively. Then we study the probabilistic approximations based on the extended characteristic set system. Moreover, we extend the maximal characteristic neighborhood system into four types of maximal characteristic neighborhood systems, and investigate the probabilistic approximations based on them. Finally, we generalize the definition of local definability for incomplete data processing. In particular, several existing methods based on characteristic sets are integrated into our model, and the new types of characteristic relations proposed by us seem more practical than the classical one in some aspects. In this way, our model illustrates the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of thinking in threes.},

While the derivation of FSCs has received some attention in the context of discounted expected reward measures, they are often solved approximately and/or without correctness guarantees. In essence, that makes it difficult to analyze fundamental concerns such as: do all paths terminate, and do the majority of paths reach a goal state? In this paper, we present new theoretical results on a generic technique for synthesizing FSCs in stochastic environments, allowing for highly granular specifications on termination and goal satisfaction.},

The combination of interval analysis and Monte Carlo simulation is required for each design to be optimized. This can only be realized by substituting the nonlinear finite element model by numerically efficient surrogate models . In this paper, a multilevel strategy for neural network based surrogate modeling is presented.

So in this paper we study probability measure of Pythagorean fuzzy sets and belief structure of Pythagorean fuzzy information systems based on rough set theory, and discuss the reduction of Pythagorean fuzzy information systems. First, we review the properties of Pythagorean fuzzy sets and the upper and lower Pythagorean fuzzy rough approximation operators on the level sets. Then using these properties, probability measure of Pythagorean fuzzy sets are constructed. And the belief and plausibility functions are studied by using the Pythagorean fuzzy rough upper and lower approximation operators.

They also form a starting point for the task of information processing: an operation of passing from raw data or information to semantically processed knowledge. The fundamental issue here is the question about the meaning of data: What do entries in the data table actually tell us about objects? It entails another question: How should the meaning be further processed? The primary aim of the article is an attempt to answer these two questions. To this end we are going to employ conceptual scales from formal concept analysis, an important theory of data processing introduced by Rudolf Wille, and apply them to data tables so as to obtain multivalued information systems, which were introduced and developed within the conceptual framework of rough set theory by Zdzisław Pawlak and Ewa Orłowska. Our main idea is to regard multivalued information systems as the semantics or meaning of the original tables. This idea allows us to describe and combine classical rough set theory, dominance-based rough set approach, and formal concept analysis within the single framework of multivalued information systems, which is rich enough to cope with a number of semantical nuances that may occur during the process of data analysis.},

  abstract     = {Rule reduction is one of the focuses of numerous researches on belief-rule-based system, in some cases, too many redundant rules may be a concern to the rule-based system. Though rule reduction methods have been widely used in the belief-rule-based system, extended belief-rule-based system, which is an expansion of belief-rule-based system, still lacks methods to reduce and train rules in the extended belief rule base (EBRB). To this end, this paper proposes an EBRB reduction and training method. Based on the density-based spatial clustering applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, a new EBRB reduction method is proposed, where all the rules in the EBRB will be visited and rules within the distance of the fusion threshold will be fused. Moreover, the EBRB training method using parameter learning, which uses a set of training data to train the parameters of EBRB, is also proposed to improve the accuracy of the EBRB system. Two case studies of regression and classification are used to illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed EBRB reduction and training method. Comparison results show that the proposed method can effectively downsize the EBRB and increase the accuracy of EBRB system.},

  abstract     = {Some hypothesis tests for analyzing the degree of overlap between the expected value of random intervals are provided. For this purpose, a suitable measure to quantify the overlapping grade between intervals is considered on the basis of the Szymkiewicz-Simpson coefficient defined for general sets. It can be seen as a kind of likeness index to measure the mutual information between two intervals. On one hand, an estimator for the proposed degree of overlap between intervals is provided and its strong consistency is analyzed. On the other hand, two tests are also proposed in this framework: a one-sample test to examine the degree of overlap between the expected value of a random interval and a given interval, and a two-sample test to check the degree of overlap between the expected value of two random intervals. To solve such hypothesis tests, two statistics are suggested and their limit distributions are studied by considering both asymptotic and bootstrap techniques. Their power has been also explored by means of local alternatives. In addition, some simulation studies are carried out to investigate the behavior of the proposed approaches. Finally, the performance of the tests is also reported in a real-life application.},

  abstract     = {Incremental learning is an alternative approach for maintaining knowledge by utilizing previous computational results of dynamic data contexts. As a new and important part of incremental learning, incremental Concept-cognitive learning (CCL) is an emerging field of concerning evolution of object or attributes sets and dynamic knowledge processing in the dynamic big data. However, existing incremental CCL algorithms still face some challenges that improve the generalization ability of new concepts, and the previously acquired knowledge should be efficiently utilized to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. At the same time, formal concept analysis has become a potential direction of cognitive computing, which can describe the processes of CCL. Attribute topology (AT) as a new representation of formal concepts can clearly display the relationship between new data and original data for reducing the complexity of the CCL process; therefore, we present an incremental concept-cognitive algorithm based on AT for incremental concept calculation, which is expressed by a concept tree. First, a relationship between the new object and some of the original objects is established. Then, on the basis of this finding, we propose an algorithm for updating the concept and presenting them through a concept tree. The algorithm determines the position and subtree of the new object by the relationship between the object and the original objects. Finally, an example is presented to demonstrate that the concept update algorithm based on AT is feasible and effective, and different orders of increments will result in different concept tree structures .},

In the present study, we define a rough confusion matrix based on a very general classifier, and derive various statistics from it which are related to common rough set estimators. In other words, we perform a rough set–like analysis on a confusion matrix, which is the converse of the usual procedure; in particular, we consider upper approximations . A suitable index for measuring the tightness of the upper bound uses a ratio of odds. Odds ratios offer a symmetric interpretation of lower and upper precision, and remove the bias in the upper approximation. We investigate rough odds ratios of the parameters obtained from the confusion matrix; to guard against undue random influences, we also approximate their standard errors.},

  abstract     = {By achieving their purposes through interactions with the physical world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) pose new challenges in terms of dependability . Indeed, the evolution of the physical systems they control with transducers can be affected by surrounding physical processes over which they have no control and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. While it is illusory to hope for a comprehensive model of the physical environment at design time to anticipate and remove faults that may occur once these systems are deployed, it becomes necessary to evaluate their degree of effectiveness in vivo. In this paper, the degree of effectiveness is formally defined and generalized in the context of the measure theory. The measure is developed in the context of the Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an elaboration on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence so as to handle epistemic and aleatory uncertainties respectively pertaining the users&#39; expectations and the natural variability of the physical environment. The TBM is used in conjunction with the Input/Output Hidden Markov Modeling framework we denote by Ev-IOHMM to specify the expected evolution of the physical system controlled by the CPS and the tolerances towards uncertainties. The measure of effectiveness is then obtained from the forward algorithm, leveraging the conflict entailed by the successive combinations of the beliefs obtained from observations of the physical system and the beliefs corresponding to its expected evolution. The proposed approach is applied to autonomous vehicles and shows how the degree of effectiveness can be used for bench-marking their controller relative to the highway code speed limitations and passengers&#39; well-being constraints, both modeled through an Ev-IOHMM.},

  abstract     = {Strongly connected components (SCCs) are an important kind of subgraphs in digraphs . It can be viewed as a kind of knowledge in the viewpoint of knowledge discovery. In our previous work, a knowledge discovery algorithm called RSCC was proposed for finding SCCs of simple digraphs based on two operators, k -step R -related set and k -step upper approximation , of rough set theory (RST). RSCC algorithm can find SCCs more efficiently than Tarjan algorithm of linear complexity. However, on the one hand, as the theoretical basis of RST applied to SCCs discovery of digraphs, the theoretical relationships between RST and graph theory investigated in previous work only include four equivalences between fundamental RST and graph concepts relating to SCCs. The reasonability of using the two RST operators to find SCCs still need to be investigated. On the other hand, it is found that there are three SCCs correlations between vertices after we use three RST concepts, R -related set, lower and upper approximation sets, to analyze SCCs. RSCC algorithm ignores these SCCs correlations so that the efficiency of RSCC is affected negatively. For the above two issues, firstly, we explore the equivalence between the two RST operators and Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is one of the most basic graph search algorithms and the most direct way to find SCCs. These equivalences explain the reasonability of using the two RST operators to find SCCs, and enrich the content of the theoretical relationships between RST and graph theory. Secondly, we design a granulation strategy according to these three SCCs correlations. Then an algorithm called GRSCC for finding SCCs of simple digraphs based on granulation strategy is proposed. Experimental results show that GRSCC provides better performance to RSCC.},

In this article, we propose different variance based criteria for determining the thresholds. In particular, we examine the variance or spread in evaluation function values of objects contained in the three regions obtained with 3WC of objects. An algorithm called 3WC-OR is introduced that considers the optimization of the proposed criteria for determining effective thresholds by incorporating approaches such as genetic algorithms and game-theoretic rough sets. Experimental results on five UCI datasets indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves results on datasets with overlapping clusters and provide comparable results on datasets with non-overlapping clusters.},

When there is imprecision about the marginals, one can model the available information by means of p -boxes, that are pairs of ordered distribution functions. By analogy they introduce pairs of bivariate functions satisfying certain conditions. In this paper we introduce the imprecise versions of some classes of copulas emerging from shock models that are important in applications. The so obtained pairs of functions are not only imprecise copulas but satisfy an even stronger condition. The fact that this condition really is stronger is shown in Omladič and Stopar (2019) thus raising the importance of our results. The main technical difficulty in developing our imprecise copulas lies in introducing an appropriate stochastic order on these bivariate objects.},

Here discernibility matrix is a known way of discernibility information measure in rough set theory . This paper applies the quasi/pseudo value of discernibility matrix rather than the true value of discernibility matrix to design an incremental mechanism. Unlike those discernibility matrix based non-incremental algorithms, the improved algorithm needs not save the whole discernibility matrix in main memory, which is desirable for the large data sets. More importantly, with the increment of decision tables, the discernibility matrix-based feature selection algorithm could constrain the computational cost by applying efficient information updating techniques—quasi/pseudo approximation operators. Finally, our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm needs less computational cost, especially less occupied space, on the condition that the accuracy is limitedly lost.},

Although many researchers have presented various MAGDM methods under different environments, there are still some imperfections, such as the weight information is not comprehensive or flexible enough, the decision results lack interpretability , and the impact of risk attitude is not fully taken into account. In order to overcome the above shortcomings and improve the scientificity and rationality of decision-making, a novel data-driven MAGDM method under interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic environment is established based on the idea of multi-granulation and three-way decisions. Our contributions can be identified as follows: (1) The multi-granulation weight mining and fusion methods for experts and attributes are proposed, respectively; (2) The coarse-granulation grading information based on three-way decisions is developed to enhance the interpretability and reference value of decision results; (3) The expected value with risk attitude factor is defined to compare interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic variables (IVIULVs) and then is used to grade and rank alternatives under different risk attitudes. To illustrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method, a case of logistics supplier selection in e-commerce enterprises is demonstrated. Furthermore, the advantages and characteristics of the proposed method are highlighted via detailed comparison and thorough analysis.},

  abstract     = {Attribute reduction of rough set theory is effective for intelligent information processing, and class-specific attribute reducts are beneficial for pattern recognition and rule reasoning. According to three-way decisions, class-specific reducts already have three-way types (namely, positive, negative, and positive-negative) of qualitative optimization, which adhere to classical rough sets. In terms of region preservations, there are no corresponding three-way types of quantitative optimization that match probabilistic rough sets. Thus, this paper constructs and investigates quantitative three-way class-specific attribute reducts based on region preservations. First, the uncertainty/nonmonotonicity of quantitative region change is revealed, and it naturally induces the reduction criteria of quantitative region preservations. Then, quantitative three-way class-specific reducts are constructed, and their basic properties regarding their necessary conditions, attribute cores, and reduct algorithms are achieved. Furthermore, their interrelation regarding equivalence and strengthening/balance are obtained for consistent and inconsistent decision classes, respectively, and their expansions for qualitative three-way class-specific reducts are proved. Finally, relevant concepts and obtained results are effectively verified by decision tables and data experiments. By virtue of sure region preservations, quantitative three-way class-specific attribute reducts robustly extend the existing qualitative three-way class-specific reducts and facilitate the optimal identification and quantitative reasoning of class-specific patterns.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model particle filtering algorithm (TSF-PF) based on fuzzy C-regression clustering is proposed for uncertainty modeling of the target dynamic model with non-Gaussian noise. In the proposed algorithm, a generic semantic framework of the T-S fuzzy model is constructed to incorporate spatial feature information of a target into the particle filter, in which the spatial feature information is characterized by several semantic fuzzy sets. Meanwhile, a fuzzy C-regression clustering method based on correntropy is proposed to adaptively identify the premise parameters of the T-S fuzzy model, which is used to adjust the weight of models, and a Kalman filter is used to identify the consequent parameters. And then an efficient importance density function is constructed by using the proposed T-S fuzzy model, which can efficiently improve the robust and diversity of the sampling particles. Furthermore, in order to improve the real-time performance of the proposed algorithm, two improved T-S fuzzy model particle filtering algorithms are presented. The simulation results show that the tracking performance of the proposed algorithms are better than that of the traditional interacting multiple model (IMM), interacting multiple model unscented Kalman filter (IMMUKF), interacting multiple model particle filter (IMMPF) and interacting multiple model Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (IMMRBPF). Particularly, the proposed algorithms can accurately track the maneuvering target when the moving direction abruptly changes or the prior information of the target dynamic model is inaccuracy.},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel approach to multiple criteria sorting incorporating a threshold-based value-driven procedure. The parameters deciding upon the shape of marginal value functions and separating class thresholds are inferred through preference disaggregation from the Decision Maker&#39;s incomplete assignment examples and partial requirements on the type of (non-)monotonicity for each marginal value function. These types include standard monotonic shapes, level-monotonic functions, A- and V-types combining increasing and decreasing value trends, and unknown monotonicity constraints. A representative instance of the sorting model compatible with the preference information is constructed by solving a dedicated Mixed-Integer Linear Programming problem. Its complexity is controlled by minimizing the number of changes in monotonicity between all subsequent sub-intervals of marginal value functions. The assignments derived using the constructed representative model are validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis. The proposed method is applied to a real-world problem of exposure management of engineered nanomaterials . We develop a model for predicting precaution level while handling nanomaterials in certain conditions using a respirator. The model captures interrelations between ten accounted evaluation criteria, including both monotonic and non-monotonic criteria, and the recommended class assignment. This makes it suitable for the management of exposure scenarios, which have not been directly judged by the experts.},

  abstract     = {Understanding causal relationships is a central challenge in many research endeavours. Recent research has shown the importance of accounting for feedback (cycles) and latent confounding variables, as they are prominently present in many data analysis settings. However, allowing for cycles and latent confounders makes the structure learning task especially challenging. The constraint-based approach is able to learn causal graphs even over such general search spaces, but to obtain high accuracy, the conflicting (in)dependence information in sample data need to be resolved optimally. In this work, we develop a new practical algorithmic approach to solve this computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem . While recent advances in exact algorithmic approaches for constraint-based causal discovery build upon off-the-shelf declarative optimization solvers, we propose a first specialized branch-and-bound style exact search algorithm. Our problem-oriented approach enables directly incorporating domain knowledge for developing a wider range of specialized search techniques for the problem, including problem-specific propagators and reasoning rules, and branching heuristics together with linear programming based bounding techniques, as well as directly incorporating different constraints on the search space, such as sparsity and acyclicity constraints. We empirically evaluate our implementation of the approach, showing that it outperforms current state of art in exact constraint-based causal discovery on real-world instances.},

In this paper, we examine the construction of hybrid models from categorical data , where we use logistic regression (LR) as a discriminative component, and naïve Bayes (NB) as a generative component. We adopt a bias-variance tradeoff based strategy, with the objective of minimizing the sum of these two errors. Specifically, the proposed heuristic consists of functions of training sample size and conditional dependence among features. These functions serve as proxies for model variance and model bias. We implement our method on 25 different classification datasets, and find that the hybrid model does better than pure LR and pure NB. Our proposed method is competitive with random forest . Although the hybrid model fails to beat LASSO in predictive performance , as suggested by the experimental results, the difference appears to be insignificant when the number of features is small. Also, the hybrid model requires less training time than LASSO, which makes it more attractive when the training time is a big concern.},

We demonstrate that covering-based rough models are equivalent to Pawlak&#39;s on partitions if they satisfy granule selection principles, which are weaker than a combination of contraction, extension, monotonicity, addition and granularity . In order to take advantage of their equivalence, we illustrate a method named “covering evolution” to change granules from given coverings to corresponding partitions for covering-based approximation operators. The evolutions can be divided into three steps: at the beginning, coverings are transformed into 1-neighborhood systems based on some quintessential neighborhood operators, then in the middle, more-refined 1-neighborhood systems are built by using “cores” from general topology, and at last, core systems (in fact, partitions) are extracted from these more-refined 1-neighborhood systems. We lay a strong emphasis on the variations in accuracy of six representative covering-based approximation operators during three evolutions, two of which preserve the accuracy of approximation operators. The investigation carried on covering evolutions helps us to establish the corresponding mapping relationship from covering spaces to partition spaces directly, and therefore provides a convenient method for making choice of covering-based approximation operators as they are consistent with the classical Pawlak&#39;s rough sets over partitions.},

Rough set theory (RST), as an important research technique for granular computing, can describe any target granule (any subset of a universe of discourse) by the lower and upper approximations . But, there is no measure to evaluate the quality of granule description in RST. Moreover, one can acquire different granule descriptions by decomposing a multi-scale information table into different single-scale information tables. Then, it is important to find the most appropriate single-scale information table for meeting specific granule description accuracy requirement. Inspired by the above problem, this paper is to discuss optimal granule level selection based on the granule description accuracy. First of all, a new granule description accuracy is defined by combining GrC and RST. After that, optimal granule level selection is investigated in a multi-scale information table subject to preserving granule description accuracies for a target granule and a group of target granules, respectively. Specially, for the case of a group of target granules, we put forward optimal granule level selection methods based on three different criteria, commonly used by people in daily life. In addition, considering that the data in real-life will be updated as time goes by, we discuss the impact on the optimal granule level when new objects are added gradually. Finally, the time complexity of the proposed algorithms is analyzed, the reasonability of setting the parameters is explained, some numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our methods, and a comparison of our algorithms and the existing ones is made.},

With the advent of ball-shaped screen technologies and the growing importance of globally situated data, the digital sphere, known as T 2 T2 , becomes a viable embedding. While topological relations have been investigated for a spherical embedding S 2 S2 within a continuous framework, the lack of a full account of the relations in T 2 T2 prevents more refined query systems on global discrete data. This paper extends the concept of spherical topological relations to the digital spherical embedding, building on the model of a planar digital region in Z 2 Z2 whose boundary comprises the pixels along the region&#39;s margin. With the 9-intersection and its detailed descendant, the 9 + -intersection, 29 relations between two digital regions are derived. This set of binary digital spherical relations is jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint . The relations&#39; conceptual neighborhood graph , capturing the similarity among the relations, further highlights that 18 of the 29 relations are refinements of those found in S 2 S2 . These topological relations between digital regions coincide with the binary relations found between broad-boundary regions when the broad boundaries are of uniform thickness, a scenario preventing the inclusion of an entire interior of one region within the boundary of the other. Five different rationales for coarsening are investigated, each leading to a different group of the relations along the conceptual neighborhood graph.},

  abstract     = {Pairwise comparisons have been a long standing technique for comparing alternatives/criteria and their role has been pivotal in the development of modern multi-criteria decision analysis methods; they represent a useful tool for deriving a weighting vector which establishes a cardinal ranking of the alternatives/criteria. The weighting vector used in this paper gained popularity due to its mathematical properties and satisfies fundamental requirements, such as the immunity to rank reversal and preservation of the algebraic structure of the problem. Under consistency condition, that represents the full decision maker&#39;s coherence, this vector is completely reliable because it exactly represents the decision maker&#39;s preferences expressed by means of the pairwise comparisons. Unfortunately, the consistency is hard to reach in real situation; thus, in a previous paper, we provided a condition weaker than consistency so that the weighting vector at least preserves the preferences order expressed by means of inconsistent pairwise comparisons. This paper deals with a further crucial step in multi-criteria decision analysis, that is to ensure that the weighting vector preserves the preferences intensity, in addition to the preferences order, expressed by means of inconsistent pairwise comparisons. Thus, firstly, we introduce a necessary condition so that the weighting vector preserves the preferences intensity. Then, we show that this condition is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Finally, we propose a sufficient condition so that the weighting vector preserves the preferences intensity. In order to provide a general unified framework, we deal with pairwise comparison matrices defined over Abelian linearly ordered groups .},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on sequential qualitative decision problems, where no probability distribution on the states that may follow an action is available. New qualitative criteria that are based on ordinal uninorms and namely ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ and ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ are proposed. Like the Hurwicz criterion, the ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ and ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ uninorms arbitrate between pure pessimism and pure optimism, and generalize the Maximin and Maximax criteria. But contrarily to the Hurwicz criterion they are associative, purely ordinal and compatible with Dynamic Consistency and Consequentialism . These important properties allow the construction of an optimal strategy in polytime, following an algorithm of Dynamic Programming . Making a step further, we then generalize ⁎ R ⁎ R⁎ to qualitative decision under possibilistic uncertainty, proposing an alternative to the classical optimistic and pessimistic criteria used for the computation of optimal strategies in possibilistic decision trees .},
