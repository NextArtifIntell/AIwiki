  abstract     = {The last decades, crowd simulation for crisis management is highlighted as an important topic of interest for many scientific fields. As the continuous evolution of computational resources increases, along with the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence , the demand for better and more realistic simulation has become more attractive and popular to scientists. Along those years, there have been published hundreds of research articles and numerous different systems have been created that aim to simulate crowd behaviors, crisis cases and emergency evacuation scenarios. For better outcomes, recent research has focused on the separation of the problem of crisis management, to multiple research sub-fields (categories), such as the navigation of the simulated pedestrians, their psychology, group dynamics etc. There have been extended research works suggesting new methods and techniques for those categories of problems. In this paper, we propose three main research categories , each one consisting of several sub-categories, relying on crowd simulation for crisis management aspects and we present the outcomes of the last decade, focusing mostly on works exploiting multi-agent technologies. We analyze a number of technologies, methodologies, techniques, tools and systems introduced throughout the last years. A comparative review and discussion of the proposed categories is presented toward the identification of the most efficient aspects of the proposed categories. A general framework toward the future crowd simulation for crisis management is presented to yield the most realistic outcomes. The paper is concluded with some highlights and open questions for future directions.},

  abstract     = {In-flight turbulence is recognized as a major safety hazard for the global aviation system , capable of causing serious injuries to crew and passengers as well as structural damage to the aircraft. Its prediction at 1 to 2 days ahead mainly relies on numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, which suffer from various practical and inherent deficiencies. This paper applies the XGBoost algorithm in generating skillful aviation turbulence forecasts through optimal combination of a collection of conventional “turbulence indices” produced by an NWP model. Verification over a 1-year period against over 16000 aircraft pilot reports demonstrated consistent superior performance of the machine-learning based multi-index consensus (MIC) over the Asia-Pacific region, with median gains in skill score between 3\% to 17\% compared to constituent turbulence indices when taken individually.},

  abstract     = {Local temperature forecasts for horizons up to 24 h are required in many applications. A common method to generate such forecasts is the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model or, much simpler, the naïve forecast. In this paper, we test whether deep neural networks are able to improve on the results from the above mentioned methods. In addition to univariate long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, we present an alternative method based on a 2D-convolutional LSTM (convLSTM) network. For benchmarking our approach we set up a case study using data from five different weather stations in Germany. The SARIMA model and the univariate LSTM network perform quite well in the first few hours, but are then outperformed by the multivariate LSTM network and our convolutional LSTM network for longer forecast horizons. Besides, both multivariate approaches show better performance when the temperature is changing in the course of the day. Overall, our presented approach based on a convolutional LSTM network performs best on all used test data sets.},

After we present a complete categorization system, we analyze the two essential implementation technologies, namely, the pattern matching approach and machine learning . Moreover, we compose a general architectural design that gathers critical details, and we highlight crucial issues to take into account before system design. Furthermore, we present chatbots applications and industrial use cases while we point out the risks of using chatbots and suggest ways to mitigate them.

  abstract     = {Depression is a common and serious mood disorder that negatively affects the patient’s capacity of functioning normally in daily tasks. Speech is proven to be a vigorous tool in depression diagnosis. Research in psychiatry concentrated on performing fine-grained analysis on word-level speech components contributing to the manifestation of depression in speech and revealed significant variations at the phoneme-level in depressed speech. On the other hand, research in Machine Learning-based automatic recognition of depression from speech focused on the exploration of various acoustic features for the detection of depression and its severity level. Few have focused on incorporating phoneme-level speech components in automatic assessment systems. In this paper, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based application for clinical depression recognition and assessment from speech. We investigate the acoustic characteristics of phoneme units, specifically vowels and consonants for depression recognition via Deep Learning . We present and compare three spectrogram-based Deep Neural Network architectures , trained on phoneme consonant and vowel units and their fusion respectively. Our experiments show that the deep learned consonant-based acoustic characteristics lead to better recognition results than vowel-based ones. The fusion of vowel and consonant speech characteristics through a deep network significantly outperforms the single space networks as well as the state-of-art deep learning approaches on the DAIC-WOZ database.},

There exist numerous imaging modalities that are utilized to identify tumors in the brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is generally utilized for such a task because of its unrivaled quality of the image and the reality that it does not depend on ionizing radiations. The relevance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of Deep Learning (DL) in the area of medical imaging has paved the path to extraordinary developments in categorizing and detecting intricate pathological conditions , like a brain tumor, etc. Deep learning has demonstrated an astounding presentation, particularly in segmenting and classifying brain tumors. In this work, the AI-based classification of BT using Deep Learning Algorithms are proposed for the classifying types of brain tumors utilizing openly accessible datasets. These datasets classify BTs into (malignant and benign). The datasets comprise 696 images on T1-weighted images for testing purposes. The projected arrangement accomplishes a noteworthy performance with the finest accuracy of 99.04\%.

A phased evaluation approach was then designed for summarizing dataset-level assessment metrics and discussing the results.
