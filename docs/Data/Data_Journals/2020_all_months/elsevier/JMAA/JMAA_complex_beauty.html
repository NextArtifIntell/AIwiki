Our goal is to weaken the necessary assumptions to obtain a linking structure to the problem, for instance to allow zero being in the spectrum or the nonlinearity being sign-changing. Our main difficulty is to overcome the lack of monotonicity on the nonlinear term , as well, as the lack of compactness since the domain is unbounded.

In the vectorial case we show not all Toeplitz kernels have a maximal function and in the case of p = 2 p=2 we find the exact conditions for when a Toeplitz kernel has a maximal function.

In this work we assume lower or upper radial bounds on some weighted or unweighted curvatures of M to deduce comparisons for the weighted isoperimetric quotient and the weighted capacity of metric balls in M centered at a point o ∈ M . As a consequence, we obtain parabolicity and hyperbolicity criteria for weighted manifolds generalizing previous ones. A basic tool in our study is the analysis of the weighted Laplacian of the distance function from o . The technique extends to non-compact submanifolds properly immersed in M under certain control on their weighted mean curvature .},

As a consequence, a q -identity involving Π q Πq and two Lambert series, which was conjectured by Gosper, is proved.

In the first scenario, − A generates a bounded holomorphic semigroup of angle θ = π 2 θ=π2 , and so A is sectorial of angle 0. In the second, where θ may be relaxed to any value in ( 0 , π 2 ] (0,π2] , we impose an additional assumption that e − A e−A is sectorial. Regularization results for the original ill-posed problem are then established in the linear case where h = h ( t ) h=h(t) , and subsequently extended to nonlinear problems where h is replaced by h ( t , u ( t ) ) h(t,u(t)) . We compare the two cases in terms of regularization convergence rates and apply our results to backward heat equations, both linear and nonlinear in L p ( R n ) Lp(Rn) , 1 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;∞ .},

We show two limits behaviors according to the magnetic field. On the one hand, if the magnetic field has at least two different directions at the interface between the hard phase and the soft phase, then the limit of the displacement in the hard phase is independent of time, so that the magnetic field induces an infinite effective mass. On the other hand, if the magnetic field has a constant direction ξ at the interface, then the limit of the displacement in the hard phase involves an additional displacement in the direction ξ which is solution to an elastodynamics equation with a memory mass, a memory stress tensor and memory external forces depending on the initial conditions, which read as time convolutions with some kernel. When the magnetic field has the same direction ξ in the soft phase with smooth inclusions, we prove that the space-average of the kernel is regular and that the limit of the overall displacement in the direction ξ is solution to a viscoelasticity equation.},

  abstract     = {A partially hyperbolic dynamical system is said to have the quasi-shadowing property if every pseudotrajectory can be shadowed by a sequence of points ( x n ) n ∈ Z (xn)n∈Z such that x n + 1 xn+1 is obtained from the image of x n xn by moving it by a small factor in the central direction. In the present paper, we prove that a small nonlinear perturbation of a partially dichotomic sequence of (not necessarily invertible) linear operators acting on an arbitrary Banach space has the quasi-shadowing property. We also obtain a continuous time version of this result. As an application of our main result, we prove that a certain class of partially dichotomic sequences of linear operators is stable up to the movement in the central direction.},

  abstract     = {A modified alternating direction implicit scheme for the time integration of linear isotropic Maxwell equations with strictly positive conductivity on cuboids is constructed. A key feature of the proposed scheme is its uniform exponential stability, being achieved by coupling the Maxwell system with an additional damped PDE and adding artificial damping to the scheme. The implicit steps in the resulting time integrator further decouple into essentially one-dimensional elliptic problems, requiring only linear complexity. The convergence of the scheme to the solution of the original Maxwell system is analyzed in the abstract time-discrete setting, providing an error bound in a space related to H − 1 H−1 .},

  abstract     = {We present new results on existence and uniqueness of absolutely continuous solutions for systems of discontinuous ordinary differential equations . Our existence result complements an earlier theorem by Bressan and Shen. Basically, we show that a global transversality condition assumed by Bressan and Shen need only be imposed on the sets where the nonlinear part is discontinuous. Our proof, completely different to the one given by Bressan and Shen, uses Krasovskij solutions as a first step. We illustrate the applicability of our result with several examples not covered by the previous literature. The second part of this paper concerns uniqueness. Specifically, we prove uniqueness of solutions for discontinuous systems of differential equations with piecewise Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities and assuming localized Bressan–Shen transversality conditions on the boundaries between different Lipschitz continuity domains. Our uniqueness result appears to be new even in the classical case of continuous nonlinearities .},

Also, the chance of finding a direct route to infectious pulmonary TB (PTB) of certain vulnerable risk-group and the diagnosis effort to detect latent TB individual (LTBI) are critical factors in TB epidemiology. The current investigation proposes a mathematical model based on a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDE) to encounter these vital characteristics of TB transmission. The analytical study mainly encompasses well-posedness of the PDE system , the asymptotic behavior of the model around the disease-free equilibrium point P 0 P0 and existence criterion of endemic equilibrium point ⁎ P ⁎ P⁎ . A threshold quantity R 0 R0 , called basic reproductive number provides the average size of infected population due to a single infectious individual introduced in the naive community. The current expression of R 0 R0 offers a notable refinement in basic reproduction number compared to previous estimations. Also, theoretically we observe, detectivity of LTBI cases can both increase and decrease the size of R 0 R0 depending upon a parametric condition.},

There are several counterexamples showing that this sufficient condition is not necessary. However, for one class of groups, namely discrete abelian groups , no such counterexample is known. Thus there remains the possibility that the convolution inequality truly characterizes stability of convolution for weighted L p Lp -spaces on these groups.

To be specific, we consider a diffusion equation on ( 0 , ∞ ) (0,∞) whose diffusion coefficient vanishes at the boundary 0, equipped with the Cauchy initial data and the Dirichlet boundary condition . One such diffusion equation that has been extensively studied is the one whose diffusion coefficient vanishes linearly at 0. Our main goal is to extend the study to cases when the diffusion coefficient has a general order of degeneracy, with a primary focus on the fundamental solution to such a degenerate diffusion equation. In particular, we study the regularity properties of the fundamental solution near 0, and investigate how the order of degeneracy of the diffusion operator and the Dirichlet boundary condition jointly affect these properties. We also provide estimates for the fundamental solution and its derivatives near 0.},

  abstract     = {To reduce the frequency of data exchange in power grid, a novel self-triggered consensus-based optimization algorithm for economic dispatch problem (EDP) is proposed for switching topologies, which guarantees that the increment cost converges to an optimal consensus value after iterations. In this brief, sampled-data framework is employed to complete the implementation of algorithm digitally. Based on that, self-triggered mechanism based approach can also avoid infinite number of communication in finite time, which can save communication cost between generators. Further, a time-varying gain function is designed to derive a tradeoff between convergence rate and triggering performance. Finally, some simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the relevant theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the performance output tracking for a boundary controlled Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) system. First, the mathematical properties of a recently developed mathematical model of the DCMD system are discussed. This model consists of parabolic equations coupled at the boundary. Then, the existence and uniqueness of the solutions are analyzed, using the theory of operators. Some regularity results of the solution are also established. A particular case showing the diagonal property of the principal operator is studied. Then, based on one-side feedback law the control problem, which consists of tracking both the feed and permeate outlet temperatures of the membrane distillation system is formulated. A servomechanism and an output feedback controller are proposed to solve the control problem. In addition, an extended state observer aimed at estimating both the system state and disturbance, based on the temperature measurements of the inlet is proposed. Thus, by some regularity for the reference signal and when the disturbance vanishes, we prove the exponential decay of the output tracking error. Moreover, we show the performance of the control strategy in presence of the flux noise.},

Moreover, this principal eigenvalue and its normalized principal eigenfunction are approached in R × H 1 ( Ω ) R×H1(Ω) by principal eigen-pairs of boundary eigenvalue problems with classical mixed boundary conditions . In some sense, the glued mixed boundary conditions analyzed in this work may be regarded as classical mixed boundary conditions with large potentials in the Robin boundary condition. The principal eigenvalues analyzed in this paper, play a crucial role in analyzing the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic behavior of the positive solutions of certain kinds of semilinear elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions and spatial heterogeneities. The main technical tools used to carry out the mathematical analysis of this work are variational and monotonicity techniques.

Useful nonlocally related systems can be constructed through conservation law and symmetry based methods. In this paper, we focus on an application of the symmetry-based method to linear PDE systems. In particular, we show how to obtain systematically non-invertible mappings of linear PDEs to linear PDEs . As examples, we obtain non-invertible mappings of the Kolmogorov equation with variable coefficients to the backward heat equation (a PDE with constant coefficients) as well as non-invertible mappings of linear hyperbolic PDEs with variable coefficients to linear hyperbolic PDEs with constant coefficients .},

The construction developed by Gross yields a domain which is symmetric with respect to the real axis, but it has been noted by other authors that other domains are also possible, in particular there are a number of examples which have the property that a vertical ray starting at a point in the domain lies entirely within the domain. In this paper we give a new solution to the problem posed by Gross, and show that these other cases noted before are special cases of this method. We further show, following a method due to Mariano and Panzo, that the domain generated by this method has the property that it always has the minimal rate (as defined in terms of the spectrum of the Laplacian operator) among all possible domains corresponding to a fixed distribution μ . This gives a partial solution to a question posed by Mariano and Panzo. We show that the domain is unique, provided certain conditions are imposed, and use this to give several examples. We also describe a method for identifying the boundary curve of the domain, and discuss several other related topics.},

It is easy to see that the modulus of continuity of a function of bounded variation is always smaller or equal to the modulus of continuity of its variation function. We show that we cannot make any reasonable conclusion on the modulus of continuity of the variation function if we only know the modulus of continuity of the parent function itself. In particular, given two moduli of continuity, the first being weaker than Lipschitz continuity, we show that there exists a function of bounded variation with minimal modulus of continuity less than the first modulus of continuity, but with a variation function with minimal modulus of continuity greater than the second modulus of continuity. In particular, this negatively resolves the open problem whether the variation function of an α -Hölder continuous function is α -Hölder continuous.},

At each stage of the game they simultaneously bid some part of their current fortune and the probability of winning or loosing depends on their bids. In many models of the red-and-black game it is assumed that the win probability is a function of the quotient of the bid of the first player and the sum of both bids. In the literature some additional properties, like concavity or super-multiplicativity are assumed in order to ensure that the bold and timid strategies form a Nash equilibrium , which turns out to be unique in several cases. Our aim is to provide a generalization in which the probability of winning is a two-variable function which depends on both bids. We introduce two new functional inequalities whose solutions lead to win probability functions for which a Nash equilibrium is realized by the bold-timid strategy. Since both inequalities may appear as not quite intuitive, we discuss them in a separate section of the paper and we provide some illustrating examples.},

The main results of this work are: (1) A necessary and sufficient condition on an infinite metric space M , under which the transportation cost space on M contains an isometric copy of ℓ 1 ℓ1 . The obtained condition is applied to answer the open questions asked by Cúth and Johanis (2017) concerning several specific metric spaces.

  abstract     = {In this note, we investigate stability issues for a mixture of two elastic solids. The governing equations consist of two coupled systems of elastodynamic equations with a weak damping. The damping involves the difference of velocities, so that the damping operator is degenerate. First, we show that the underlying semigroup is strongly stable under a weaker parameters constraint, thereby improving an earlier strong stability result of Dafermos. Next, we show that under extra appropriate constraints on the parameters of the coupled system, the semigroup is exponentially stable. Our proof relies on the frequency domain method, the multipliers technique, and a seemingly new vector calculus identity (Lemma B). Our exponential stability result is new in the framework of mixtures involving elastodynamic equations with weak damping. We also show that for some sets of parameters, the system is asymptotically unstable; in particular, we use a concrete example to show that strong stability fails for a certain parameters constraint.},

The extension to Lie sphere geometry is applied in the following to a sequence of Möbius geometries, which has been investigated recently in a bicomplex matrix representation . When higher dimensional space-time geometries are invoked by inverse projections starting from an originating point geometry, the Lie sphere scheme provides a more natural structure of the involved Clifford algebras compared to the previous representation. The spin structures resulting from the generated Clifford algebras can potentially be used for the geometrization of internal particle symmetries. A simple model, which includes the electromagnetic spin, the weak isospin, and the hadronic isospin, is suggested for further verification.},

In particular we shall put emphasis to reveal the full power of the universal properties of the universal crossed products. It turns out to make things consistent, one has to perform the constructions in some bigger categories which allow the right framework for studying the universal properties and which are stable under the construction of crossed products even for non-discrete groups. In the case of operator systems, this larger category is what we call a ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -operator system, i.e., a selfadjoint subspace X of some B ( H ) B(H) which contains a ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra A such that A X = X = X A AX=X=XA . In the case of operator spaces, the larger category is given by what we call ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -operator bimodules . We introduce the notion of crossed products in these categories and show that the classical Imai-Takai and Katayama duality theorems for crossed products by group (co-)actions on ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras extend to our notion of crossed products by ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -operator systems and ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -operator bimodules .},

  abstract     = {In this work we propose and study a self-adaptive projection method for the numerical solution of Stokes equations under slip boundary conditions . We introduce the projection operator to formulate the slip constraint as a fixed point equation. To solve this problem we suggest a projection method by reformulating the nonlinear slip boundary conditions into an iterative form. To make the method more efficient, we find a self-adaptive rule that uses iterative functions to adjust the penalty parameter automatically. We show the convergence of the method in function space and give its application in detail. Finally, the numerical results are given to support our theoretical results.},

First, we aim to extend for 0 0&amp;lt;s&amp;lt;1 the results of one of the authors about equilibrium measures in the real axis in external fields created by point-mass charges for the case of logarithmic potentials ( s = 0 s=0 ). Our second motivation comes from the work of the other two authors on Riesz s -equilibrium problems on finitely many intervals on the real line in the presence of external fields. They have shown that when the signed equilibrium measure has concave positive part on every interval, then the s -equilibrium support is also a union of finitely many intervals, with one of them at most included in each of the initial intervals. As the positive part of the signed equilibrium for point-mass external fields is not necessarily concave, the investigation of the corresponding s -equilibrium support is of comparative interest. Moreover, we provide simple examples of compactly supported equilibrium measures in external fields Q not satisfying the usual requirements about the growth at infinity, that is, lim | x | → ∞ ⁡ Q ( x ) = ∞ lim|x|→∞⁡Q(x)=∞ . Our main tools are signed equilibrium measures and iterated balayage algorithm in the context of Riesz s -equilibrium problems on the real line. As these techniques are not mainstream work in the field and can be applied in other contexts we highlight their use here.},

In this paper, a refinement of an existing method permitting to expand time-asymptotically the solution formulas is proposed. Here the first term of the expansion is supported in a space-time cone whose origin depends explicitly on the initial datum. As an important consequence of our refined method, the first term inherits the mean position of the solution together with a constant variance error and a shifted time-decay rate is obtained. Hence this refinement, which takes into account both spatial and frequency information of the initial datum, makes stable some propagation features under time-asymptotic approximations and permits a better description of the time-asymptotic behaviour of the solutions. The results are achieved firstly by making apparent the cone origin in the solution formula, secondly by applying precisely an adapted version of the stationary phase method with a new error bound, and finally by minimising the error bound with respect to the cone origin.},

In particular this means that shadowing guarantees that α f ‾ = ω f ‾ = I C T f αf‾=ωf‾=ICTf (where the closures are taken with respect to the Hausdorff topology on the space of compact sets), whilst the addition of expansivity entails α f = ω f = I C T f αf=ωf=ICTf . We progress by introducing novel variants of shadowing which we use to characterise both maps for which α f ‾ = I C T f αf‾=ICTf and maps for which α f = I C T f αf=ICTf .},

The usual applications are high-dimensional data in random fields. To ensure the validity of recovering a true original complex object from its observed images treated in a product space that appears in existing high-dimensional data applications widely arising in physical, biological, and social sciences and engineering, we begin with the results on the σ -algebra of the original space Ω induced by a given map f T fT mapping from Ω to a product measure space ( Ω T , F T , μ T ) (ΩT,FT,μT) . We study the certain measurability issues on Ω with the induced measure μ from the image measure μ T μT of the product space by establishing the outer measure ν ⁎ ν⁎ restricted to the trace σ -algebra. We further investigate the measure μ on Ω under the map f T fT to obtain the conditions for the identifiability equality μ T = μ ∘ f T − 1 μT=μ∘fT−1 to hold so that a practical and rigorous foundation is provided for the nontrivial applications to work meaningfully.},

Further constraining the arbitrary elements of the superclass, we construct a hierarchy of normalized classes of Schrödinger-type equations. This gives us an appropriate normalized superclass for the non-normalized class of multidimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations with potentials and modular nonlinearities and allows us to partition the latter class into three families of normalized subclasses. After a preliminary study of Lie symmetries of nonlinear Schrödinger equations with potentials and modular nonlinearities for an arbitrary space dimension, we exhaustively solve the group classification problem for such equations in space dimension two.},

In the setting of a general metric domain, the conditions are less restrictive and the extension is only required to be Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz constant . In this case, the successive procedure can be replaced by a much simpler one which was done by McShane and Whitney in the 1930s. Using virtually the same construction, Czipszer and Gehér showed a similar extension property for pointwise Lipschitz functions . In the present paper, we relate this construction to another classical result obtained previously by Hausdorff and dealing with pointwise Lipschitz approximations of semi-continuous functions. Moreover, we furnish complementary extension-approximation results for locally Lipschitz functions which fit naturally in this framework.},

  abstract     = {Nakao and Mikhailov proposed using continuous models (mean-field models) to study reaction-diffusion systems on networks and the corresponding Turing patterns. This work aims to show that p -adic analysis is the natural tool to carry out this program. This is possible due to the fact that the discrete Laplacian attached to a network turns out to be a particular case of a p -adic Laplacian. By embedding the graph attached to the system into the field of p -adic numbers, we construct a continuous p -adic version of a reaction-diffusion system on a network. The existence and uniqueness of the Cauchy problems for these systems are established. We show that Turing criteria for the p -adic continuous reaction-diffusion system remain essentially the same as in the classical case. However, the properties of the emergent patterns are very different. The classical Turing patterns consisting of alternating domains do not occur in the p -adic continuous case. Instead of this, several domains (clusters) occur. Multistability , that is, coexistence of a number of different patterns with the same parameter values occurs. Clustering and multistability have been observed in the computer simulations of large reaction-diffusion systems on networks. Such behavior can be naturally explained in the p -adic continuous model, in a rigorous mathematical way, but not in the original discrete model.},

The typical feature of this kind of system is that the corresponding linearized system has one eigenvalue with the real part equals to zero. This violates the Kawashima-Shizuta stability conditions. In this paper, we develop a general global well-posedness theory for this kind of system. Moreover, as the applications of the general theory, several examples are given.},

In this paper, first we give a natural reinterpretation of the underlying algorithmic construction in the language of ultrastatic Lorentzian manifolds. Subsequently we show that the construction carries over to the case of static backgrounds thanks to a suitable reduction to the ultrastatic scenario. Finally we prove that the overall procedure can be generalised to any globally hyperbolic spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces. As an application, we discuss how, from our procedure, one can recover the local Hadamard expansion which plays a key role in all applications in quantum field theory on curved backgrounds.},

We prove that such kind of nonlocal and local diffusion problems has a unique global solution, and then show that a spreading-vanishing dichotomy holds. Moreover, criteria of spreading and vanishing, and long time behavior of solution when spreading happens are established for the classical Lotka-Volterra competition and prey-predator models. Compared with free boundary problems of reaction diffusion systems with local diffusions ( [10] , [24] , [25] ), with nonlocal diffusions ( [9] ) as well as with nonlocal and local diffusions ( [14] ) (one equation is Cauchy problem and the other one is free boundary problem), the present paper involves some new difficulties, which should be overcome by use of new techniques. This is part I of a two part series, where we prove the existence, uniqueness, regularity and estimates of global solution. The spreading-vanishing dichotomy, criteria of spreading and vanishing, and long-time behavior of solution when spreading happens will be studied in the separate part II ( [17] ).},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider a nonlinear wave equation with nonlinear boundary damping and source terms, subject to a localized viscoelastic damping and localized frictional damping. We obtain the global existence of solution via potential well method. Furthermore, by introducing suitable Lyapunov functionals, using multiplier method and constructing convex differential inequality, we compare the effect of locally viscoelastic term and frictional damping and establish an explicit and general decay rate result. This stability result allows the localized viscoelastic damping and localized frictional damping acting simultaneously or complementarily in the domain, which gives the competing relationship of the viscoelastic and frictional damping.},

Some results are in the spirit of Li-Wang, Lam, and Dung-Sung, but without assumptions of sign and growth rate of the weight function as Vieira did for manifolds with weighted Poincaré inequality , and some are vanishing results without curvature restrictions. Moreover, a vanishing and splitting theorem is established with a much weaker curvature condition and a lower bound of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian.},

We analyze the preorders in detail using the standard representation of JBW ⁎ -triples. We also provide a refined version of this representation – in particular a decomposition of any JBW ⁎ -triple into its finite and properly infinite parts. Since a JBW ⁎ -algebra is finite if and only if the extreme points of its unit ball are just unitaries, our notion of finiteness differs from the concept of modularity widely used in Jordan structures so far.

The governing equations are formulated as a similarity solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, and the no-slip boundary conditions are replaced by the Navier&#39;s partial slip boundary conditions . The resulting system of nonlinear equations are governed by the dimensionless shear parameter γ , slip parameter λ and a free parameter β . The oblique stagnation point flow consists of classical orthogonal stagnation point flow along with a shear flow on the surface. Previous works of the oblique stagnation point were studied numerically, and several speculations regarding the behaviour of the solutions are made. Current work is to confirm the speculations. We prove the existence and the uniqueness results for the classical boundary layer flow near an orthogonal stagnation point flow for a rough surface. Moreover, a general solution is also given for shear flow which confirms the existence of negative shear flow for a large value of free parameter β and describes the effects of partial slip on reverse flow. Further, the detailed effects of physical parameters on the flow domain are shown through tables and graphs. It is observed that the streamlines are skewed towards left of orthogonal stagnation point for positive values of shear parameter γ and towards right for negative values.},

Next, under the same conditions on the coefficients, we show that pointwise persistence occurs, that is, any globally defined positive solution is bounded below by a positive constant independent of its initial condition when the time is large enough. It should be pointed out that in [21] , the authors established the persistence of mass for globally defined positive solutions, which indicates that any extinction phenomenon, if occurring at all, necessarily must be spatially local in nature, whereas the population as a whole always persists. The pointwise persistence proved in the current paper implies that not only the population as a whole persists, but also it persists at any location eventually.

The latter can be further adjusted if convective or conductive phenomena are dominant.

To do so, some new necessity conditions for the existence of equilibrium investment strategies are established, which considerably extends the analogue in [9] with distinctive ideas. Some new interesting facts are revealed. For example, if risk-free return rate is random, it is shown that there exists a unique open-loop equilibrium investment strategy relying on initial wealth, even when risk aversion is merely a constant but not state-dependent.},

It has been known since the 1980s that the longest gap obeys the laws of large numbers L ( t ) / ln ⁡ t → 1 L(t)/ln⁡t→1 as t → ∞ t→∞ almost surely. However large deviation probabilities of the longest gap have not been well developed yet, and in this paper we derive such large deviations with a very general speed.

  abstract     = {It has been asserted that the semilinear wave equation with scattering damping admits the same Strauss critical exponent as the classical semilinear wave equation. In this paper, we devote to showing that this assertion holds for the space dependent damping wave equation when the decay rate of the space dependent variable coefficients of the damping is greater than 2. In particular, we derive the lifespan upperbound estimates for both sub-critical and critical exponents. Moreover, when the nonlinear term is of derivative type, we also obtain the same Glassey exponent and the same upper bound lifespan as that of the corresponding problem for wave equation without damping. Both results show the “hyperbolicity” of the equation from the blow-up aspect.},

Similar results have been obtained before for the case of fattened graphs, i.e. M being one-dimensional. In the case of a smooth surfaces M , the problem has been studied well.

In particular, we show that the Toeplitz operator induced by the Berezin transform of a complex symmetric operator on Hardy space is also complex symmetric with the same conjugation.

Instead, we rely on simpler functions that capture the impact of these elements on extensions but are defined by boundary asymptotics. This new perspective makes calculations much more accessible and allows for a more nuanced analysis of the associated domains. The maximal domain for n -th composition of the Jacobi operator is characterized in terms of a smoothness condition for each derivative, and the endpoint behavior of functions in the underlying Hilbert space can then be classified, for j ∈ N 0 j∈N0 , by ( 1 − x ) j (1−x)j , ( 1 + x ) j (1+x)j , ( 1 − x ) − α + j (1−x)−α+j and ( 1 + x ) β + j (1+x)β+j . Most of these behaviors can only occur when functions are in the associated minimal domain, and this leads to a formulation of the defect spaces with a convenient basis. Self-adjoint extensions, including the important left-definite domain, are then given in terms of the new basis functions for the defect spaces using GKN theory. Comments are made for the Laguerre operator as well.},

A mathematical model is set up for the state equation where the dipole source takes the form of a Dirac mass located in the interior of the conducting domain. A non-standard approach featuring the fundamental solution of a curl curl − Id curlcurl−Id operator is proposed to address the well-posedness of the state problem, leading to a split structure of the state field as the sum of a singular part and a regular part. The aim of the control is the best approximation of desired electric and magnetic fields via a suitable L 2 L2 -quadratic tracking cost functional. Here, special attention is devoted to establishing an adjoint calculus which is consistent with the form of the state variable and in this way first order optimality conditions are eventually derived.},

Different from existing literature on coupled systems, the functions in the system we addressed are nonlinear without the linear growth condition. By employing graph theory and Lyapunov method, almost sure exponential stabilization criterion of hybrid coupled systems with two independent noises is derived. The criterion is closely associated with the noise strength, the number of vertex systems, the coupling strength, the existence interval and period of intermittent noises.

Also, we demonstrate how model sensor relay networks with the r-fusion frames. Further, we consider certain bridging problem for fusion frames and provide several solutions to this problem. Some sufficient conditions for a fixed fusion frame to have an associated r-fusion frame will be given. We indicate that the process of r-fusion frame model can be implemented in both positive and negative directions, which is consistent with the requirement that subnets have the same type of network topology in practical applications.

Moreover, it is proved that if X is not reflexive then such difference A − B A−B is not necessarily closed. Using the techniques of variational analysis and in terms of asymptotic hyperplanes, several characterizations and sufficient conditions are established for A to have attainable separation property and attainable strict separation property.

  abstract     = {The Spin-Boson model describes a two-level quantum system that interacts with a second-quantized boson scalar field . Recently the relation between the integral kernel of the scattering matrix and the resonance in this model has been established in [18] for the case of massless bosons. In the present work, we treat the massive case. On the one hand, one might rightfully expect that the massive case is easier to handle since, in contrast to the massless case, the corresponding Hamiltonian features a spectral gap. On the other hand, it turns out that the non-zero boson mass introduces a new complication as the spectrum of the complex dilated, free Hamiltonian exhibits lines of spectrum attached to every multiple of the boson rest mass energy starting from the ground and excited state energies. This leads to an absence of decay of the corresponding complex dilated resolvent close to the real line, which, in [18] , was a crucial ingredient to control the time evolution in the scattering regime. With the new strategy presented here, we provide a proof of an analogous formula for the scattering kernel as compared to the massless case and use the opportunity to provide the required spectral information by a Mourre theory argument combined with a suitable application of the Feshbach-Schur map instead of complex dilation.},

  abstract     = {In the recent paper [1] D. Azagra studies the global shape of continuous convex functions defined on a Banach space X . More precisely, when X is separable, it is shown that for every continuous convex function f : X → R f:X→R there exist a unique closed linear subspace Y of X , a convex function h : X / Y → R h:X/Y→R with the property that lim t → ∞ ⁡ h ( u + t v ) = ∞ limt→∞⁡h(u+tv)=∞ for all u , v ∈ X / Y u,v∈X/Y , v ≠ 0 v≠0 , and ⁎ ⁎ x ⁎ ∈ X ⁎ x⁎∈X⁎ such that ⁎ f = h ∘ π + x ⁎ f=h∘π+x⁎ , where π : X → X / Y π:X→X/Y is the natural projection. Our aim is to characterize those proper lower semicontinuous convex functions defined on a locally convex space which have the above representation. In particular, we show that the continuity of the function f and the completeness of X can be removed from the hypothesis of Azagra&#39;s theorem. For achieving our goal we study general sublinear functions as well as recession functions associated to convex ones.},

These functions satisfy a functional equation of the form ϕ ( a k x + b k ) = c k x + d k ϕ ( x ) + e k ϕ(akx+bk)=ckx+dkϕ(x)+ek , for k = 1 , 2 , … , r k=1,2,…,r and x ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] x∈[0,1] . They include the Takagi function, the Riesz-Nagy singular functions , Okamoto&#39;s functions, and many other well-known examples. It is shown that the multifractal spectrum of ϕ is given by the multifractal formalism when | d k | ≥ | a k | |dk|≥|ak| for at least one k , but the multifractal formalism may fail otherwise, depending on the relationship between the shear parameters c k ck and the other parameters. In the special case when a k &gt; 0 ak&amp;gt;0 for every k , an exact expression is derived for the pointwise Hölder exponent at any point.

The existence and uniqueness of a traveling wave solution of the model are obtained. In particular, solutions have interfaces that divide into constant and non-constant regions. In particular, the profile of the population distribution has compact support. Numerical simulations are provided and compared with analytic results.},

Despite the fact that many papers have been published regarding the determination of spectra and also possibly the sharpest systemwide uniform rates of energy decay, many problems remain open. In this paper, we first mention a few examples of distributed and boundary damping, then proceed to examine the simplest such possible case of boundary feedback control of the one-dimensional wave equation. Using the wave propagation method, one can see that the analysis of the spectra is quite sophisticated. Indeed, for most cases, with seemingly the best efforts one can only pin down the rates of damping in some narrow range. Several open questions are posed at the end of the paper, which along with higher dimensional problems we hope will further motivate more studies in such decay spectral analysis.},

  abstract     = {This work is devoted to the mathematical analysis of Stieltjes Bochner spaces and their applications to the resolution of a parabolic equation with Stieltjes time derivative. This novel formulation allows us to study parabolic equations that present impulses at certain times or lapses where the system does not evolve at all and presents an elliptic behavior. We prove several theoretical results related to existence of solution, and propose a full algorithm for its computation, illustrated with some realistic numerical examples related to population dynamics.},

A L p Lp Minkowski inequality for torsion is also obtained, which implies the uniqueness of the solutions for the L p Lp Minkowski problem mentioned above.},

We first show that the model admits global solutions and possesses a global attractor. Following the definition of the next infection operator, we obtain the expression of the basic reproduction number ℜ0 , which is shown as a threshold parameter for the model dynamics. Our results indicate that the clearance/persistence of HIV is governed by the sign of ℜ0−1 . In particular, an explicit formula of ℜ0 is given in the homogeneous case.},

We prove a number of results about both micro-transitive and uniformly micro-semitransitive spaces. In particular, they are uniformly convex and uniformly smooth, and form a self-dual class. To this end, we relate the fact that the group of isometries acts micro-transitively with a property of operators called the pointwise Bishop-Phelps-Bollobás property and use some known results on it. Besides, we show that if there is a non-Hilbertian non-separable Banach space with uniform micro-semitransitive (or micro-transitive) norm, then there is a non-Hilbertian separable one. Finally, we show that an L p ( μ ) Lp(μ) space is micro-transitive or uniformly micro-semitransitive only when p = 2 p=2 .},

This contribution is focussed on studying the continuity properties of functions u at a chosen internal point x 0 x0 to which we attribute a notion of criticality of order k and with respect to the weight w . For non-critical points x 0 x0 we formulate a local embedding result that guarantees continuity of functions u or their derivatives. Conversely, we employ duality theory to show that criticality of x 0 x0 furnishes a smooth approximation of functions in H μ w m , p Hμwm,p admitting jump-type discontinuities at x 0 x0 .

In the rest part of the paper, we study the function theoretic behaviour of operator-valued multishifts. We determine the bounded point evaluation, reproducing kernel structure and the unitary equivalence of operator-valued multishifts with invertible operator weights. In contrast with a result of Lubin, it appears that the set of all bounded point evaluations of an operator-valued multishift may be properly contained in the joint point spectrum of the adjoint of underlying multishift.},

They involve a dual tiling condition on S with respect to the lattices T Z × Ω Z TZ×ΩZ and L T Z × L Ω Z LTZ×LΩZ where Ω = 1 / ( L T ) Ω=1/(LT) .},

In this study, for the mapping f ˜ : N → R n + 1 f˜:N→Rn+1 defined by: f ˜ ( x ) = f ( x ) − | | f ( x ) − P | | 2 2 ( f ( x ) − P ) ⋅ ν ( x ) ν ( x ) , f˜(x)=f(x)−||f(x)−P||22(f(x)−P)⋅ν(x)ν(x), the following four statements hold. (1) f ˜ f˜ is a frontal with the Gauss mapping ν ˜ ( x ) = f ( x ) − P | | f ( x ) − P | | ν˜(x)=f(x)−P||f(x)−P|| at f ˜ ( x ) f˜(x) . (2) f ˜ f˜ is the unique anti-orthotomic of f relative to P . (3) The property that ( f ˜ ( x ) − P ) ⋅ ν ˜ ( x ) ≠ 0 (f˜(x)−P)⋅ν˜(x)≠0 holds for any x ∈ N x∈N . (4) The equality of | | f ˜ ( x ) − P | | = | | f ˜ ( x ) − f ( x ) | | ||f˜(x)−P||=||f˜(x)−f(x)|| holds for any x ∈ N x∈N . Moreover, three applications of the main result are given. A generalization of the Cahn–Hoffman vector formula is given as the first application. The second application involves clarifying an optical meaning of anti-orthotomics. The third application provides a criterion for determining a front for a given frontal.},

Also, we introduce new type degenerate Bell polynomials, which are different from the previously studied partially degenerate Bell polynomials and arise naturally in the recent study of degenerate zero-truncated Poisson random variables, and deduce some of their properties. Furthermore, we derive some identities connecting the polyexponential functions and the new type degenerate Bell polynomials.},

We first introduce a new notion of upper-lower-solution for the equation of wave profile for a given wave speed. Then, with the help of Schauder&#39;s fixed point theorem , we construct two different pairs of upper-lower-solutions to obtain traveling waves for a continuum of wave speeds under two different assumptions. Due to the sign-changing nature of the kernel, the wave profiles may take both positive and negative values. Finally, we analyze the limit of the right-hand tail of wave profiles. Under some further condition on the wave speeds, we prove that the right-hand tail limit of the wave profile does exist. In particular, we obtain the existence of nonnegative traveling waves connecting the unstable state 0 and the stable state 1 for wave speeds large enough.},

We propose a unified approach to these three problems based on the use of the auxiliary dynamical system with the discrete time associated with a semi-infinite Jacobi matrix . It is shown that the set of moments determines the inverse dynamic data for such a system. Using the ideas of the Boundary Control method, for every N ∈ N N∈N we can recover the spectral measure of N × N N×N block of Jacobi matrix , which is a solution to a truncated moment problem. This problem is reduced to the finite-dimensional generalized spectral problem, whose matrices are constructed from moments and are connected with the well-known Hankel matrices by simple formulas. Thus the results on existence of solutions to Hamburger, Stieltjes and Hausdorff moment problems are naturally provided in terms of these matrices. We also obtain results on uniqueness of the solution of the moment problems, where as a main tool we use Krein-type equations of inverse problem.},

Firstly, a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem for the equation with nonzero boundary conditions at infinity is systematically discussed. Then the inverse problems are solved through the investigation of the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem. Therefore, the general solutions for the potentials, and explicit expressions for the reflection-less potentials are presented. Furthermore, we construct the simple-pole and double-pole solutions for the equation. Finally, the remarkable characteristics of these solutions are graphically discussed.

The other is that the solution set of the TCP is connected under a newly proposed condition.

Such systems appear in applications related to the modeling of coupled diffusion and elastic deformation processes in inhomogeneous porous media within a quasi-static assumption. We establish the global existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial and boundary data of a weak solution to the system. The proof of this result involves the proposed pseudo-decoupling method which reduces the coupled system to an initial-boundary value problem for a single implicit equation and a refined approach to deriving a priori energy estimates based on component-wise contributions of system parameters to energy norms.},

The system of equations comes from a linearization of a nonlocal model of elasticity in solid mechanics. It is a nonlocal analogue of the Navier-Lamé system of classical elasticity . We use a well-known semigroup technique that hinges on the strong solvability of the corresponding steady-state elliptic system. The leading operator is an integro-differential operator characterized by a distinctive matrix kernel which is used to couple differences of components of a vector field. For an operator possessing an asymmetric kernel comparable to that of the fractional Laplacian , we prove the L 2 L2 -solvability of the elliptic system in a Bessel potential space using the Fourier transform and a priori estimates. This L 2 L2 -solvability together with the Hille-Yosida theorem is used to prove the well posedness of the wave-type time dependent problem. For the fractional Laplacian kernel we extend the solvability to L p Lp spaces using classical multiplier theorems.},

This problem requires the determination of the unknown shape of a domain in the Euclidean space from finite-dimensional observation data with some Gaussian random noise. Then, the stability of posterior is studied for observation data. For each point of the space, the conditional probability that the point is included in the unknown domain given the observation data is considered. The stability is also studied for this probability distribution. As a model problem for our inverse problem, a heat inverse problem is considered. This problem requires the determination of the unknown shape of cavities in a heat conductor from temperature data of some portion of the surface of the heat conductor. To apply the above stability results to this model problem, one needs the measurability and some boundedness of the forward operator. These properties are shown.},

  abstract     = {The modified Lommel function t μ , ν ( x ) tμ,ν(x) is an important special function, but to date there has been little progress on the problem of obtaining functional inequalities for t μ , ν ( x ) tμ,ν(x) . In this paper, we advance the literature substantially by obtaining a simple two-sided inequality for the ratio t μ , ν ( x ) / t μ − 1 , ν − 1 ( x ) tμ,ν(x)/tμ−1,ν−1(x) in terms of the ratio I ν ( x ) / I ν − 1 ( x ) Iν(x)/Iν−1(x) of modified Bessel functions of the first kind, thereby allowing one to exploit the extensive literature on bounds for this ratio. We apply this result to obtain two-sided inequalities for the condition numbers x t μ , ν ′ ( x ) / t μ , ν ( x ) xtμ,ν′(x)/tμ,ν(x) , the ratio t μ , ν ( x ) / t μ , ν ( y ) tμ,ν(x)/tμ,ν(y) and the modified Lommel function t μ , ν ( x ) tμ,ν(x) itself that are given in terms of x I ν ′ ( x ) / I ν ( x ) xIν′(x)/Iν(x) , I ν ( x ) / I ν ( y ) Iν(x)/Iν(y) and I ν ( x ) Iν(x) , respectively. The bounds obtained in this paper are quite accurate and often tight in certain limits. As an important special case we deduce bounds for modified Struve functions of the first kind and their ratios, some of which are new, whilst others extend the range of validity of some results given in the recent literature.},

The equations are analyzed in a bounded domain with initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions . If the relaxation time is sufficiently small and the boundary data is close to the equilibrium state, the density matrix converges exponentially fast to the spinless near-equilibrium steady state. The proof is based on a reformulation of the matrix-valued cross-diffusion equations using spin-up and spin-down densities as well as the perpendicular component of the spin-vector density, which removes the cross-diffusion terms. Key elements of the proof are time-uniform positive lower and upper bounds for the spin-up and spin-down densities, derived from the De Giorgi–Moser iteration method , and estimates of the relative free energy for the spin-up and spin-down densities.},

Our second main result gives sufficient conditions for the Borel measurability of optimal transports and transportation costs with respect to a parameter in the case where marginal measures and cost functions depend on a parameter.

We also discuss the errors introduced in each approximation and give corresponding error bounds. Numerical results on implementation of this method to price for popular two-assets options, under both the geometric Brownian Motion and Variance-Gamma dynamics, demonstrate remarkable accuracy and robustness.},

One of the bounds can be written in terms of hyperbolic sine and inverse hyperbolic sine functions . Some of the bounds involve exponential functions and are improved versions of previously proposed bounds or are improved versions of the new bounds introduced earlier in this paper. Some results from reliability theory and Jensen&#39;s inequality are used to improve determinantal inequalities. Some open problems are discussed, and conjectures are made.},

We also present a streamlined proof of the Garrido-Jaramillo result itself, but one that still relies on their natural continuous linear operator from the Lipschitz space for the target space to the Lipschitz space for the domain. Separately, we include a highly applicable uniform closure theorem that yields the most important uniform density theorems for Lipschitz-type functions as special cases.},

To characterize such a queueing system , the corresponding Markov process is constructed by the number of complete batches of customers and the number of remaining customers in the incomplete batch. By analyzing this system, we find it difficult to obtain the joint stationary distribution of the Markov process . Therefore, we consider the tail asymptotics for the joint probabilities . Using the matrix analytic method and censoring technique, we obtain the one-term and general expansions for the nonzero elements of the rate matrices , where the coefficients of the expansions are presented in the closed form.

  abstract     = {In nature, species typically migrate to regions of favorable habitat that provide sufficient food and conditions beneficial to survival. When resources in a certain region are insufficient, there tends to be high species motility in search of food. Starvation-driven diffusion (SDD), which is affected by the local habitat conditions in heterogeneous environments, is a dispersal strategy that increases species motility when food or another resource is limiting. In this study, to gain an understanding of how nonuniform random dispersal affects the fitness of species in a heterogeneous region, we examine a Lotka-Volterra-type predator-prey model applied to the situation where the movement of predators follows the rules of SDD. The main result of this study is that when a predator diffuses following the rules of SDD and the prey diffuses uniformly, the predator is more likely to invade a region than when it diffuses uniformly. We conclude that dispersal using an SDD strategy increases species fitness from an evolutionary perspective. The results we present are obtained based on an eigenvalue analysis of the semi-trivial solutions for a linearized operator derived from a model with nonuniform random diffusion. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness property of coexistence state under appropriate conditions are given.},

It is a two-sided extension of λ -graph system, that has been previously introduced by the author. Its matrix presentation is called a symbolic matrix bisystem. We first show that any λ -graph bisystem presents subshifts and conversely any subshift is presented by a λ -graph bisystem, called the canonical λ -graph bisystem for the subshift. We introduce an algebraically defined relation on symbolic matrix bisystems called properly strong shift equivalence and show that two subshifts are topologically conjugate if and only if their canonical symbolic matrix bisystems are properly strong shift equivalent. A λ -graph bisystem ( L − , L + ) (L−,L+) yields a pair of ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras written O L − + , O L + − OL−+,OL+− that are first defined as the ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras of certain étale groupoids constructed from ( L − , L + ) (L−,L+) . We study structure of the ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras, and show that they are universal unital unique ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebras subject to certain operator relations among canonical generators of partial isometries and projections encoded by the structure of the λ -graph bisystem ( L − , L + ) (L−,L+) . If a λ -graph bisystem comes from a λ -graph system of a finite directed graph, then the associated subshift is the two-sided topological Markov shift ( Λ A , σ A ) (ΛA,σA) by its transition matrix A of the graph, and the associated ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra O L − + OL−+ is isomorphic to the Cuntz–Krieger algebra O A OA , whereas the other ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra O L + − OL+− is isomorphic to the crossed product ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra ⁎ C ( Λ A ) ⋊ σ A ⁎ Z C(ΛA)⋊σA⁎Z of the commutative ⁎ C ⁎ C⁎ -algebra C ( Λ A ) C(ΛA) of continuous functions on the shift space Λ A ΛA of the two-sided topological Markov shift by the automorphism ⁎ σ A ⁎ σA⁎ induced by the homeomorphism of the shift σ A σA .

These new methods follow from the DG differential calculus framework that defines discrete differential operators to replace the continuous differential operators when discretizing a partial differential equation (PDE). We establish optimal a priori error estimates for both linear and quadratic elements provided the exact solution is sufficiently regular. These results are also shown to hold for some non-positive penalty parameters, with the emphasis on zero penalization across all interior and boundary edges. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results and gauge the performance of the proposed methods.},

We also formulate an extremal density problem, whose solution provides an upper bound for the pointset configuration problem in the limit as the number of points tends to infinity. Existence of solutions to both problems is established and the relationship between the parameters in the two problems is studied. Several examples are studied in detail, including the density problem for the d -dimensional ball and sphere, where the solution can be computed exactly using rearrangement inequalities. We develop a computational method for the density problem that is very similar to the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) diffusion-generated method. The method is proven to be increasing for all non-stationary iterations and is applied to study more examples.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study complex dynamics of a non-autonomous predator-prey system with a Holling type II functional response and predator being generalist. We first studied basic dynamics such as boundedness , positive invariance, permanence, non-persistence and globally asymptotic stability . We also provide sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness and globally asymptotic stability of positive periodic solutions and boundary periodic solutions of the proposed model when parameters are periodic. We give the integral conditions to prove the extinction of prey and predator and globally asymptotic stability of boundary periodic solutions, and we show that these conditions have more reasonable biological interpretation than those expressed by supremum and infimum of parameters in some literature. We also perform numerical simulations to complement our analytical results and obtain more insights. Some of our numerical simulations indicate that periodic system may promote or suppress the permanence of its autonomous version with parameters being the averages of periodic parameters.},

In one dimensional case, this system tends time-asymptotically to the Navier–Stokes equations. That is to say, the basic wave patterns to the compressible micropolar fluids model are stable. Hence, in this paper we consider the nonlinear stability of planar rarefaction wave to the corresponding three dimensional model. Some cancellations on the flux terms and viscous terms are crucial. Moreover, a proper combining of damping term and rotation terms can provide an extra regularity of w .},

Secondly, we investigate the blow-up of strong solutions to the system. Thirdly, we study the Gevrey regularity and analyticity of the solutions to the system in the Gevrey-Sobolev spaces by using the generalized Ovsyannikov theorem.

But it is possible to use partial information to construct an ambiguity set of probability distributions. In some cases, decision vector x may have a direct impact on the likelihood of the underlying random events that occur after the decision is taken, which motivates us to propose an ambiguity set to be parametric and decision-dependent. To conduct quantitative stability analysis of the optimal value function and the optimal solution mapping of the DRRO problem, we derive error bounds results for the parametrized ambiguity set under the total variation metric and investigate Lipschitz continuity of the objective function of the DRRO problem under some conditions. As an application, we demonstrate that the two-stage stochastic linear semi-definite programs satisfy these conditions and then apply results obtained to it.},

In order to solve this problem, an algorithm has been proposed to estimate the saddle point of a Lagrangian . We study the convergence of this algorithm in the most general case where initial and final densities may vanish on regions of the transportation domain. Under these assumptions, the main difficulty of our study is the proof of existence of a saddle point and of uniqueness of the density-momentum component, as it leads to deal with non-regular optimal transportation maps. For these reasons, a detailed study of the regularity properties of the velocity field associated to an optimal transportation map is required.},

The constitutive functions of these materials have a non-polynomial growth.

We demonstrate existence and uniqueness results of abstract almost history-dependent inclusion and variational inequality in the reflexive Orlicz–Sobolev space.

Differential Equations 252 (2012) 3142–3162] proved that a Liénard system of degree four: d x d t = y − ( a x + b x 2 + c x 3 + x 4 ) dxdt=y−(ax+bx2+cx3+x4) , d y d t = − x dydt=−x has at most one limit cycle. Moreover, the limit cycle is stable and hyperbolic if it exists. Based on their works, the aim of this paper is to give the complete bifurcation diagram and global phase portraits in the Poincaré disc of this system further. First we analyze the equilibria at both finity and infinity. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of separatrix loop is founded by the rotation property. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition of the existence of limit cycles is also obtained. Finally, we show that the complete bifurcation diagram includes one Hopf bifurcation surface and one bifurcation surface of separatrix loop.},

Our framework is on the same stream line of the recent paper by Accardi, Barhoumi, and Dhahri [1] . The (classical) coordinate variables are decomposed into non-commuting (quantum) operators called creation, annihilation, and preservation operators, in the interacting Fock spaces . Getting the commutation relations , which follow from the commuting property of the coordinate variables between themselves, we can develop the reconstruction theory of the measure, namely the Favard&#39;s theorem. We then further develop some related problems including the marginal distributions and the rank theory of the Jacobi operators . We will see that the deficiency rank of the Jacobi operator implies that the underlying measure is supported on some algebraic surface and vice versa. We will provide with some examples.},

As an application, we prove that the nodal set of the second eigenfunctions of the p -Laplacian (with mixed boundary conditions) on a ball cannot be a concentric sphere.},

We then produce two sets of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) bases by means of the first few coefficient vectors of the CNMFE solutions and set up a reduced-order extrapolating CNMFE (ROECNMFE) model with the POD bases as well as discuss the existence and stability as well as errors of the ROECNMFE solutions by means of the matrix tool, resulting in the theoretical analysis becoming very succinct. Lastly, we present some numerical experiments to validate the correctness of the theoretical results, finding that the superiority of the ROECNMFE method is further verified.},

In this context, a Central Limit Theorem was established only under a strong hypothesis going beyond the Riemann Hypothesis . In the present paper, we consider a smoothed version of the Sato-Tate conjecture, which allows us to overcome several limitations. In particular, for the smoothed version, we are able to establish a Central Limit Theorem for much smaller families of modular forms, and we succeed in proving a theorem of this type for families of elliptic curves under the Riemann Hypothesis for L -functions associated to Hecke eigenforms for the full modular group .},

Via the abstract operator theory , we obtain the strongly resolvent convergence of the inherited regular operators and spectral inclusion of spectrum. Moreover for the case with both endpoints being limit circle, spectral exactness of spectrum is obtained by Hilbert-Schmidt norm convergence.

Given this result, we consider the problem of maximising the n -dimensional Lebesgue measure of a measurable set A ⊂ [ 0 , 1 ] n A⊂[0,1]n subject to the constraint that it satisfies H 1 ( A ∩ C ) ≤ κ H1(A∩C)≤κ for all chains C ⊂ [ 0 , 1 ] n C⊂[0,1]n , where κ is a fixed real number from the interval ( 0 , n ] (0,n] . We show that the measure of A is not larger than the measure of the following optimal set: A κ ⁎ = { ( x 1 , … , x n ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] n : n − κ 2 ≤ ∑ i = 1 n x i ≤ n + κ 2 } . Aκ⁎={(x1,…,xn)∈[0,1]n:n−κ2≤∑i=1nxi≤n+κ2}. Our result may be seen as a continuous counterpart to a theorem of Erdős, regarding k -Sperner families of finite sets.},

In 2008 Miculescu and Mihail introduced a concept of a generalized iterated function system (GIFS in short), a particular extension of classical IFS, in which they considered families of mappings defined on finite Cartesian product X m Xm with values in X . Recently, Secelean extended these considerations to mappings defined on the space ℓ ∞ ( X ) ℓ∞(X) of all bounded sequences of elements of X endowed with supremum metric. In the paper we show that in Euclidean spaces a typical compact set is an attractor in sense of Secelean and that in general in the polish spaces it can be perceived as selfsimilar in such sense.},

For simultaneously finding the equivalence groups of an unnormalized class of differential equations and a collection of its subclasses, we suggest an optimized version of the direct method. The optimization includes the preliminary study of admissible transformations within the entire class and the successive splitting of the corresponding determining equations with respect to arbitrary elements and their derivatives depending on auxiliary constraints associated with each of required subclasses. In the course of applying the suggested technique to subclasses of the class under consideration, we construct, for the first time, a nontrivial example of finite-dimensional effective generalized equivalence group. Using the method of Lie reduction and the generalized separation of variables, exact solutions of some equations under consideration are found.},

As opposed to classical primal interpolatory schemes, these new schemes have masks with an even number of elements and are not step-wise interpolants. A complete algebraic characterization, which covers every arity, is given in terms of identities of trigonometric polynomials associated to the schemes. This characterization is based on a necessary condition for refinable functions to have prescribed values at the nodes of a uniform lattice , as a consequence of the Poisson summation formula . A strategy for the construction is then showed, alongside meaningful examples for applications that have comparable or even superior properties, in terms of regularity, length of the support and/or polynomial reproduction, with respect to the primal counterparts.},

To this end, the order-preservation properties of proximity mapping are explored. Applying these order-preservation properties and combining with the Knaster-Tarski fixed point theorem, we prove the existence of solutions and the order-preservation properties of solution mapping for mixed variational inequalities on Hilbert lattices . Relying on the above obtained results as well as some order-theoretic techniques, the existence of mild solutions to PDMVI is established. In contrast to many existing results on PDMVIs, the order-theoretic approaches are new, and the results obtained in this paper do not require the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping associated to nonlinear evolution equation.},

The boundary conditions for fluid may include Tresca slip, leak and one-sided leak conditions based on total stress, velocity, total pressure, rotation, total stress together and the conditions for temperature may include Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin conditions together. Relying on the relations among strain, rotation, normal derivative of velocity and shape of boundary surface, we get variational formulation. The formulation consists of a variational inequality for velocity due to the boundary conditions of friction type and a variational equation for temperature. We first study existence, estimation and relative compactness of solutions to an approximate equation. By passing to limits as the parameter for approximation goes to zero, we get existence of a solution with “defect measure” for temperature.},

  abstract     = {The linear canonical transform (LCT) has long been recognized as a competent tool for optics and signal processing. However, the LCT cannot reveal the local LCT-frequency contents due to its global kernel and as such makes the LCT incompetent in situations demanding a joint information of time and linear canonical domain-frequency. In this paper, we propose the linear canonical Stockwell transform (LCST) in order to rectify the limitations of the LCT and the Stockwell transform (ST). Firstly, we examine the resolution of the novel transform in the time and LCT domains and then derive some of its basic properties, such as Moyal&#39;s formula, inversion formula and provide a characterization of the range. Furthermore, we derive a direct relationship between the well known Wigner distribution and the proposed LCST. In sequel, a discrete version of the linear canonical Stockwell transform is also presented. Finally, we extend the scope of the proposed work by studying the LCST in the realm of almost periodic functions .},

Some auxiliary systems are constructed in order to make the control and the disturbance become collocated, or make the measured tracking error become the output. Then the error feedback adaptive servomechanism is presented, in which the parameters of the disturbance and the reference signals are estimated. Our design is based on the motion planning and the backstepping approaches. In addition, we give a brief description that our approach is applicable to the heat equation with distributed disturbance. It is shown that the proposed adaptive control law regulates the tracking error to zero and keeps the states of all the internal loops bounded.},

Its importance comes mostly from its role in fractional calculus although other interesting applications also exist. If the sums of the scaling factors in the top and bottom parameters are equal, the series defining the Fox-Wright function has a finite non-zero radius of convergence . It was demonstrated by Braaksma in 1964 that the Fox-Wright function can then be extended to a holomorphic function in the complex plane cut along a ray from the positive point on the boundary of the disk of convergence to the point at infinity. In this paper we study the behavior of the Fox-Wright function in the neighborhood of this positive singular point . Under certain restrictions we give a convergent expansion with recursively computed coefficients completely characterizing this behavior. We further compute the jump and the average value of the Fox-Wright function on the banks of the branch cut.},

  abstract     = {Sterile insect technique is one of the effective biological measures in mosquitoes control. Since mosquitoes fly around as we release sterile mosquitoes, the mosquito dispersals affect the effectiveness of the releases. To study the impact of mosquito dispersals, we formulate a simple two-patch model where sterile mosquitoes are released in only one of the two patches. We determine the threshold of releases such that the wild mosquitoes either go extinct or coexist with sterile mosquitoes. We then investigate the existence and stability of coexistent positive equilibria, and show that, in certain cases, multiple positive equilibria can exist. Numerical examples are also provided.},

  abstract     = {On Orlicz spaces of measurable functions , the classical Orlicz and Luxemburg norm can be defined by use of the Amemiya formula: ‖ x ‖ Φ o = inf k &gt; 0 ⁡ 1 k ( 1 + I Φ ( k x ) ) ‖x‖Φo=infk&amp;gt;0⁡1k(1+IΦ(kx)) and ‖ x ‖ = inf k &gt; 0 ⁡ 1 k max ⁡ { 1 , I Φ ( k x ) } ‖x‖=infk&amp;gt;0⁡1kmax⁡{1,IΦ(kx)} respectively, where Φ is an Orlicz function and I Φ ( x ) = ∫ T Φ ( x ( t ) ) d μ ( t ) IΦ(x)=∫TΦ(x(t))dμ(t) . Based on this observation, in the last few years a number of papers have been published that dealt with the geometrical properties of Orlicz spaces equipped with the so-called p -Amemiya norms defined by ‖ x ‖ Φ , p = inf k &gt; 0 ⁡ 1 k ( 1 + I Φ p ( k x ) ) 1 / p ‖x‖Φ,p=infk&amp;gt;0⁡1k(1+IΦp(kx))1/p , where 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞ 1≤p≤∞ . The aim of this paper is to present a general and universal method of introducing norms in Orlicz spaces that will cover all the cases mentioned above. Namely, using the concept of outer function, s -norms ‖ x ‖ Φ , s = inf k &gt; 0 ⁡ 1 k s ( I Φ ( k x ) ) ‖x‖Φ,s=infk&amp;gt;0⁡1ks(IΦ(kx)) are introduced. It is proved that to each outer function s we can associate an outer function ⁎ s ⁎ s⁎ that is conjugate to s in the Hölder sense, i.e. ⁎ u + v ≤ s ( u ) s ⁎ ( v ) u+v≤s(u)s⁎(v) for all u , v ≥ 0 u,v≥0 . Moreover, it is proved, under some minor assumptions, that the Köthe dual of the subspace E Φ EΦ of the Orlicz space equipped with the s -norm ‖ ⋅ ‖ Φ , s ‖⋅‖Φ,s is an Orlicz space L Ψ LΨ equipped with the s -norm ⁎ ‖ ⋅ ‖ Ψ , s ⁎ ‖⋅‖Ψ,s⁎ , where the outer function ⁎ s ⁎ s⁎ is conjugate to s in the Hölder sense and the Orlicz function Ψ is complementary to Φ in the Young sense.},

The usual backward stochastic equations ( B S E s ) (BSEs) are studied for their terminal conditions ξ in L p ( F T , R d ) Lp(FT,Rd) . Motivated by the study of continuous–time conditional mean–conditional convex risk measure portfolio selection, this paper, for the first time, formulates and studies a more general class of B S E s BSEs with their terminal conditions in L F 0 p ( F T , R d ) LF0p(FT,Rd) . The main results of this paper are to prove two fixed point theorems in complete random normed modules, which are respectively the random generalizations of Banach contraction mapping principle and Browder–Kirk fixed point theorem, and give their applications to the general class of B S E s BSEs .},

By using Fourier transform , this classes of equations are transformed into a Riemann boundary value problem with nodal point, and we prove the existence of solutions and the Noether theory for the equations. For such equations, we propose one method different from classical one, and we obtain the general solutions and the conditions of solvability. All cases about the behaviors of the solution are considered at nodal points. Therefore, the theory of integral equations and the classical Riemann boundary value problems is extended further.},

  abstract     = {A two-level atom coupled to the quantized radiation field is studied. In the physical relevant situation, the coupling function modeling the interaction between the two components behaves like | k | − 1 / 2 |k|−1/2 , as the photon momentum tends to zero. This behavior is referred to as critical, as it constitutes a borderline case. Previous results on non-existence state that, in the general case, neither a ground state nor a resonance exists. Hasler and Herbst (2011) have shown, however, that a ground state does exist if the absence of self-interactions is assumed. Bach, Ballesteros, Könenberg, and Menrath (2017) have then explicitly constructed the ground state this specific case using the multiscale analysis known as Pizzo&#39;s method (Pizzo, 2003). In the present paper, a resonance eigenvalue of the complex deformed Hamiltonian is constructed by applying an inductive multiscale approach developed by Bach, Ballesteros, and Pizzo (2013, 2017), thus showing the existence of resonances in the critical case. Although the proof does not mainly rely on spectral renormalization, some techniques enter in the form of a suitable Feshbach-Schur map to control the exponential decay of the terms in the Neumann series expansions. Overall, the interaction terms obtained only involve second powers of the creation and annihilation operators and thus allow for a simpler proof.},

A generalization of the Toda equation is the Kostant-Toda equation, whose Lax representation is expressed using bidiagonal and lower Hessenberg matrices. The discrete Toda equation, which is a time-discretization of the Toda equation, is extended to the so-called discrete hungry Toda (dhToda) equation. The Lax representation for the dhToda equation generates similarity transformations of lower Hessenberg matrices. Although both have been considered, a discrete analogue of the Kostant-Toda equation or a continuous analogue of the dhToda equation has yet to be presented in the literature. In this paper, we present a continuous analogue of the dhToda equation, and then relate this to the Kostant-Toda equation. By using a continuous analogue of the Bäcklund transformation between the dhToda equation and the discrete hungry Lotka-Volterra system, we relate the resulting continuous analogue to the continuous hungry Lotka-Volterra system.},

To make a connection with this theory, we mostly consider the case where f(0)=0 and f′(0) is a positive real number. We found, in particular, that R forms an inverse Löwner chain of hyperbolically convex functions . Moreover, each element of R satisfies the Noshiro-Warschawski condition. This, in turn, implies that each element of R is also the infinitesimal generator of a one-parameter semigroup on Δ. We consider also quasiconformal extensions of elements of R . Finally we study the existence of repelling fixed points of this family.},

Thereby, the hydrodynamic parameters (permeability, diffusivity) are assumed to depend on the porosity and degeneracies arise in case of clogging. Introducing appropriate weighted function spaces and including the degenerate parameters as weights of Muckenhoupt class, we are able to handle the degeneracy and obtain analytical results. We solve the underlying equations via saddle-point theory or an adjusted Rothe method by applying the useful properties of such weighted function spaces. Moreover, we obtain nonnegativity and boundedness for the weak solution to the transport equation. Finally, we are interested in the decay behavior of this solution with respect to the porosity.},

We introduce a new parameter optimization method for random matrix models which works even in such a case. The method is based on the spectral distribution instead of the traditional likelihood. In the method, the Cauchy noise has an essential role because the free deterministic equivalent, which is a tool in free probability theory , allows us to approximate the spectral distribution perturbed by Cauchy noises by a smooth and accessible density function. Moreover, we study an asymptotic property of determination gap, which has a similar role as generalization gap. Besides, we propose a new dimensionality recovery method for the signal-plus-noise model, and experimentally demonstrate that it recovers the rank of the signal part even if the true rank is not small. It is a simultaneous rank selection and parameter estimation procedure.},

However, the precise Hausdorff dimension formulas have been given only in special cases. This problem is even unsolved for a general integral self-affine set F , which is generated by an n × n n×n integer expanding matrix T (not necessarily a similitude) and a finite set A ⊂ R n A⊂Rn of integer vectors so that F = T − 1 ( F + A ) F=T−1(F+A) . In this paper, we focus on the pivotal case F ⊂ R 2 F⊂R2 and show that the Hausdorff dimension of F is the limit of a monotonic sequence of McMullen-type dimensions by introducing a process, which we call the fractal perturbation (or deflection) method. In fact, the perturbation method is developed to deal with the pathological case where the characteristic polynomial of T is irreducible over Z Z . We also consider certain examples of exceptional self-affine fractals for which the Hausdorff dimension is less than the upper bound given by Falconer&#39;s formula. These examples show that our approach leads to highly non-trivial computation.},

In particular, it was found to possess such a right inverse I α Iα that the change of an unknown function u = I α v u=Iαv reduces the Cauchy problem for a linear equation with D α Dα (for radial functions) to an integral equation whose properties resemble those of classical Volterra equations. In other words, we found, in the framework of non-Archimedean pseudo-differential operators, a counterpart of ordinary differential equations . In the present paper, we study nonlinear equations of this kind, find conditions of their local and global solvability.},

  abstract     = {We construct and investigate an adaptive variance reduction framework in which both importance sampling and control variates are employed. The three lines (Monte Carlo averaging and two variance reduction parameter search lines) run in parallel on a common sequence of uniform random vectors on the unit hypercube . Given that these two variance reduction techniques are effective often in a complementary way, their combined application is well expected to widen the applicability of adaptive variance reduction. We derive convergence rates of the theoretical estimator variance towards its minimum as a fixed computing budget increases, when stochastic approximation runs with optimal constant learning rates. We derive sufficient conditions for the proposed algorithm to attain the minimal estimator variance in the limit, by stochastic approximation with decreasing learning rates or by sample average approximation, when computing budget is unlimitedly available. Numerical results support our theoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

So far, it has only been applied to set-valued dynamic risk measures within a stochastic framework, but not to deterministic calculus of variations and optimal control problems . In this paper, a multi-objective calculus of variations problem is considered which is turned into a set-valued problem by a straightforward extension. A new set-valued value function is introduced, for which a Bellman&#39;s optimality principle holds. Also the classical result of the Hopf-Lax formula holds for the generalized value function. Finally, a derivative with respect to the time and a directional derivative with respect to the state variable of the value function are defined. The value function is proved to be a solution of a corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.},

A compatible linear connection which is both a critical point and minimizer of YM is called a Yang-Mills connection. In this paper, we investigate Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature . We are interested in Yang-Mills connections on the following classes of modules over D μ ν c Dμνc : (i) Abadie&#39;s module Ξ of trace 2 μ and its submodules ; (ii) modules Ξ ′ Ξ′ of trace 2 ν ; (iii) tensor product modules of the form P E μ ν c ⊗ Ξ PEμνc⊗Ξ , where E μ ν c Eμνc is Morita equivalent to D μ ν c Dμνc and P is a projection in E μ ν c Eμνc . We present a characterization of critical points and minimizers of YM, and provide a class of new Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature on Ξ over D μ ν c Dμνc via concrete examples. In particular, we show that every Yang-Mills connection ∇ on Ξ over D μ ν c Dμνc with constant curvature should have a certain form of the curvature such as Θ ∇ ( X , Y ) = Θ ∇ ( X , Z ) = 0 Θ∇(X,Y)=Θ∇(X,Z)=0 and Θ ∇ ( Y , Z ) = π i μ Id E Θ∇(Y,Z)=πiμIdE . Also we show that these Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature do not provide global minima but only local minima. We do this by constructing a set of compatible connections that are not critical points but their values are smaller than those of Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature. Our other results include: (i) an example of a compatible linear connection with constant curvature on D μ ν c Dμνc such that the corresponding connection on an isomorphic projective module does not have constant curvature, and (ii) the construction of a compatible linear connection with constant curvature which neither attains its minimum nor is a critical point of YM on D μ ν c Dμνc . Consequently the critical points and minimizers of YM depend crucially on the geometric structure of D μ ν c Dμνc and of the projective modules over D μ ν c Dμνc . Furthermore, we construct the Grassmannian connection on the projective modules Ξ ′ Ξ′ with trace 2 ν over D μ ν c Dμνc and compute its corresponding curvature. Finally, we construct tensor product connections on P E μ ν c ⊗ Ξ PEμνc⊗Ξ whose coupling constant is 2 ν and characterize the critical points of YM for this projective module.},

  abstract     = {This work deals with finding exact solution of the Stokes&#39; problem analogue to a composite free flow and porous matrix layers. The upper free flow region is bounded above by a plate moving with a time dependent velocity and the bottom porous layer is of unbounded depth. The velocity field corresponding to this Stokes&#39; problem is obtained by means of Laplace transform , Mellin-Fourier transform and Faltung theorem on convolution . This study investigates the effect of the transition zone (mushy layer) length on the interfacial velocity profile . We have compared these results with the classical Stokes&#39; problem. We realize that the findings of this work are useful in understanding flow mechanics in solidification process of multi-component melts, the impact of viscous shearing inside the lumen region of an endothelial glycocalyx layer of human arteries.},

The model, which is based on a classical model due to Martiel and Goldbeter [16] , takes the form of a planar system of ordinary differential equations with two singular perturbation parameters which manifest very differently: while one parameter encodes the separation of scales between the slow and fast variables, the other induces a non-uniformity in the corresponding vector field in the singular limit. We apply geometric singular perturbation theory and the desingularisation technique known as “blow-up” to construct a family of attracting, periodic (relaxation-type) orbits; in the process, we elucidate the novel singular structure of the model, and we describe in detail the resulting oscillatory dynamics.},

  abstract     = {In 1938, Schoenberg [20] posed a few seemingly simple problems in the area of elementary probability theory . The main goal was to characterize all the pseudo-isotropic distributions; that is, probability distributions in which all the one-dimensional projections are the same up to a scale parameter c . However, except for rotationally invariant and symmetric stable distributions this goal turned out to be extremely difficult and significant results appeared after four decades. In 2005, Misiewicz, Oleszkiewicz and Urbanik [17] presented the introduction to the theory of weakly-stable distributions and vectors, where a random vector X , taking values in a Banach space E E , is called weakly-stable iff for all random variables Q 1 , Q 2 Q1,Q2 there exists a random variable Θ such that ( ⁎ ⁎ ⁎ ) X Q 1 + X ′ Q 2 = d X Θ , XQ1+X′Q2=dXΘ, where X , X ′ , Q 1 , Q 2 , Θ X,X′,Q1,Q2,Θ are independent. In [6] , the authors showed that under some additional weak assumptions , every extreme point of the set of pseudo-isotropic distributions with the fixed quasi-norm c has to be weakly-stable. In this paper we show the converse implication; i.e. we show that every symmetric weakly-stable random vector is pseudo-isotropic. This seems to be another small step in solving Schoenberg&#39;s problems. As an application of our results, we propose a method to check whether a given symmetric multi-dimensional distribution is pseudo-isotropic, or, equivalently, whether or not a given symmetric weakly-stable distribution has a multidimensional version.},

The Lagrangian corresponding to the non-static spherically symmetric metric is used to obtain the set of determining equations of Noether symmetries. These equations are integrated to get a general solution in terms of some unknown functions of two variables, giving a list of integrability conditions . The ‘rifsimp’ command in Maple is used to classify the metric functions. Solving the integrability conditions for all possible cases, we obtain Noether algebras of dimension 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 17. Some physical implications of the obtained metrics, including conservation laws and energy conditions, are also discussed for all the obtained metrics.},

We focus on the case of random measures, that is K is a subset of all non-negative Radon measures on R d Rd . We consider as K the space of sub-probabilities, probabilities and point configurations on R d Rd . For each of these spaces we provide at least one representation as a generalized basic closed semi-algebraic set to apply the main result in Infusino et al. (2014) [20] . We demonstrate that this main result can be significantly improved by further considerations based on the particular chosen representation of K . In the case when K is a space of point configurations, the correlation functions (also known as factorial moment functions) are easier to handle than the ordinary moment functions. Hence, we additionally express the main results in terms of correlation functions.},

As a consequence two distributional dependencies are presented: the first between the distribution of GIG distribution on R + R+ and the distribution of functional A t At , and the second one, between the distribution of GIG on a hyperplane and the distribution of the vector ( A t , e B t ) (At,eBt) .},

Moreover, we prove that this spectral triple has a close connection to the wavelet decomposition of Λ∞ which was introduced by Farsi, Gillaspy, Kang, and Packer in 2015. We first introduce the concept of stationary k -Bratteli diagrams, in order to associate a family of ultrametric Cantor sets , and their associated Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples, to a finite, strongly connected higher-rank graph Λ. We then study the zeta function , abscissa of convergence, and Dixmier trace associated to the Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples of these Cantor sets , and show these spectral triples are ζ -regular in the sense of Pearson and Bellissard. We obtain an integral formula for the Dixmier trace given by integration against a measure μ , and show that μ is a rescaled version of the measure M on Λ∞ which was introduced by an Huef, Laca, Raeburn, and Sims. Finally, we investigate the eigenspaces of a family of Laplace-Beltrami operators associated to the Dirichlet forms of the spectral triples. We show that these eigenspaces refine the wavelet decomposition of L2(Λ∞,M) which was constructed by Farsi et al.},

First, we present some probability properties of the bankruptcy risk by our model and demonstrate the statistical inference for the unknown parameters. We also study the European option pricing problem and propose its statistical computation method. In addition, via a real data analysis, we show that our model captures the trend of the stock prices much better than geometric Brownian motion and clarify that the bankruptcy is a crucial factor to be considered in the Black-Scholes system.},

  abstract     = {Cauchy singular integral equations are widely used in physics and mathematics, especially in solid contact mechanics. The solution of Cauchy singular integral equations composed of explicit functions has already been achieved in existing research. However, when dealing with the contact problem between two solid bodies with irregular surfaces described by implicit parametric functions, difficulties arise when trying to solve the Cauchy singular integral because it is composed of multiple implicit parameter functions. Moreover, the integral limits are unknown, and constrained by physical characteristics. To solve this kind of problem, an approximate calculation method with high accuracy will be provided in this paper. Specifically, based on the quadrature method and taking the constraint function of the boundary as the convergence criterion, both the integral limits satisfying the physical characteristics condition and the solution of the Cauchy singular integral equations composed of multiple parameter functions can be derived by an iterative method. Finally, five different examples are calculated using the new method, and the absolute errors between the approximate values provided by the new method and the true values are analysed.},

We construct weak solutions of the two-phase model by performing the asymptotic limit as the adiabatic exponent γ goes to ∞ for a macroscopic model which arises from the kinetic theory of dilute solutions of nonhomogeneous polymeric liquids. In this context the polymeric molecules are idealized as bead-spring chains with finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE) type spring potentials. This class of models involves the unsteady, compressible, isentropic, isothermal Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain Ω in R d Rd , d = 2 , 3 d=2,3 coupled with a Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski-type diffusion equation (cf. Barrett and Süli [3] , [4] , [7] ). The convergence of these solutions, up to a subsequence, to the free-boundary problem is established using weak convergence methods, compactness arguments which rely on the monotonicity properties of certain quantities in the spirit of [12] .},

Here Q = 2 n + 2 Q=2n+2 is the homogeneous dimension of H n Hn . For given α ∈ ( 0 , Q ) α∈(0,Q) , the fractional integral operator associated with the Schrödinger operator L L is defined by I α = L − α / 2 Iα=L−α/2 . In this article, the author introduces the Morrey space L ρ , ∞ p , κ ( H n ) Lρ,∞p,κ(Hn) and weak Morrey space W L ρ , ∞ p , κ ( H n ) WLρ,∞p,κ(Hn) associated with L L , where ( p , κ ) ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ) × [ 0 , 1 ) (p,κ)∈[1,∞)×[0,1) and ρ ( ⋅ ) ρ(⋅) is an auxiliary function related to the nonnegative potential V . The relation between the fractional integral operator and the maximal operator on the Heisenberg group is established. From this, the author further obtains the Adams (Morrey-Sobolev) inequality on these new spaces. It is shown that the fractional integral operator I α = L − α / 2 Iα=L−α/2 is bounded from L ρ , ∞ p , κ ( H n ) Lρ,∞p,κ(Hn) to L ρ , ∞ q , κ ( H n ) Lρ,∞q,κ(Hn) with 0 0&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;Q , 1 1&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;Q/α , 0 0&amp;lt;κ&amp;lt;1−(αp)/Q and 1 / q = 1 / p − α / Q ( 1 − κ ) 1/q=1/p−α/Q(1−κ) , and bounded from L ρ , ∞ 1 , κ ( H n ) Lρ,∞1,κ(Hn) to W L ρ , ∞ q , κ ( H n ) WLρ,∞q,κ(Hn) with 0 0&amp;lt;α&amp;lt;Q , 0 0&amp;lt;κ&amp;lt;1−α/Q and 1 / q = 1 − α / Q ( 1 − κ ) 1/q=1−α/Q(1−κ) .

In addition, it is proved that I α Iα is bounded from L ρ , ∞ p , κ ( H n ) Lρ,∞p,κ(Hn) to BMO ρ , ∞ ( H n ) BMOρ,∞(Hn) under κ = 1 − ( α p ) / Q κ=1−(αp)/Q , and bounded from L ρ , ∞ p , κ ( H n ) Lρ,∞p,κ(Hn) to C ρ , ∞ β ( H n ) Cρ,∞β(Hn) under κ &gt; 1 − ( α p ) / Q κ&amp;gt;1−(αp)/Q and β = α − ( 1 − κ ) Q / p β=α−(1−κ)Q/p .},

Our first main result, using resolvent estimates in the frequency domain, is to show that interior damping created by the interfacial slip in companion with boundary feedback controls acting on the complementary displacements (traverse and rotation angle) drives the solution to zero with exponential decay rate . We impose neither conditions on the physical parameters of the model nor on the damping coefficients . Our second main result is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions for partially dissipative problems. Assuming the condition that the waves travel at the same speed, we prove the decay of solutions with exponential rate . Finally, the same condition allows us to show that dissipative effect created by the interfacial slip is strong enough to exponentially stabilizes the solutions to zero.},

We study the class S H 0 ( p ) SH0(p) in the geometric function theoretic viewpoint.

The paper establishes existence and characterization theorems for such paths showing, in particular, that any trajectory maximizing a logarithmic functional over a finite time horizon is rapid. The proof of this result is based on the methods of convex analysis in spaces of measurable functions .

  abstract     = {Consider a finite state irreducible Markov process with transition graph G and invariant probability distribution π . Its inverse communication speed is defined as the expectation of the time to go from x to y when x , y x,y are sampled independently according to π . We study this in the context of both discrete and continuous time. One of our goals is to show (under a suitable normalization condition on the transition rates for the continuous time case) that the shortest inverse communication speed among all Markov processes compatible with G and π is attained on those whose successive positions follow a Hamiltonian cycle , assuming one exists, and that π is close enough to the uniform distribution υ . This result is no longer true when π is sufficiently different from υ . Another purpose of the paper is to prove that when the invariance with respect to π is dropped and the inverse communication speed is replaced by the unweighted sum of the hitting times, then the Hamiltonian cycles, when they exist, are still the minimizers over all processes compatible with the prescribed directed graph G of permitted transitions, not only Markov processes, thus extending some previous results.},

The resulting modified models are called open. Their essential properties, regarding in particular equilibrium behavior, are investigated both analytically and numerically. The hallmarks of the quasispecies dynamics, viz. the heterogeneous quasispecies distribution itself and the error threshold phenomenon, can be observed in our models, along with extinction. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the introduced framework, we study the inverse problem of fitness allocation under the biologically motivated criterion of steady-state fitness maximization. Having in mind the complexity of numerical investigation of high-dimensional quasispecies problems and the fact that the actual number of genotypes or alleles involved in a studied process can be extremely large, we also build continuous-time distributed open quasispecies models. The obtained results may serve as an initial step to developing mathematical models that involve directed therapy against various pathogens .},

Our result suggests that by adding horizontal transmission, even a homogeneous case, the basic reproduction number is larger than the case without horizontal transmission mechanism. This may lead to over-evaluating the threshold role of the basic reproduction number . Finally, we also carry out the bifurcation analysis of steady state solutions by considering disease-induced mortality as the main bifurcation parameter, and such results can help us better understanding how it affects the spatial pattern of the pathogen .},

  abstract     = {We study the dynamics of a prey-predator interaction model that incorporates: (1) reduction of prey growth rate, in the form of fear effect, in presence of predator; and (2) group defense of prey, against predation, by using the Monod-Haldane type functional response. Moreover, we interrelate these two factors, through the predator-taxis sensitivity, as the total time or energy for foraging and defense is constant for prey. If the prey invests more time or energy for group defense, then reproduction may decrease due to that investment. We provide detailed mathematical results, including, basic dynamical properties, existence of positive equilibria, asymptotic stability of all equilibria, Hopf-bifurcation, direction and stability of bifurcated periodic solutions. We also provide some global features and possible occurrence of multi-stability in our model. Furthermore, we perform detailed numerical simulations to validate our mathematical results numerically. Our mathematical and numerical results suggest that the predator-taxis sensitivity should be less than some threshold density, for possible survivability of predator. We provide some sensitivity analysis of our model solutions with respect to the three important model parameters, namely, the predator-taxis sensitivity, level of fear, and the tolerance limit of predator. We can observe that the perturbation of the tolerance limit of predator has the greatest influence over model dynamics. Initially, the predator-taxis sensitivity has a positive effect on prey as its decreases the killing rate, however, for long run, its effect is negative on both the solutions, as it decreases the growth rate of prey, which affects overall fitness of both the populations. Our results may provide some useful biological insights on predator-prey interactions.},

We generalize and extend those results by discussing the asymptotic behavior of the weak solution and proving that the weak solution converges to the corresponding stationary solution as time tends to infinity. Moreover, a lower and an upper bound estimation for blow-up time and rate are obtained for the blow-up weak solution in different initial energy cases. Furthermore, we establish the weak solution with high initial energy that is global bounded or blow-up under some sufficient conditions as well as a nonblow-up criterion and algebraic decay result in other assumptions.},

The dynamics is described by a parametrized continuity equation , in which the Eulerian velocity field is affine w.r.t. some variables. Our aim is to minimize a cost functional which includes a control norm, thus enforcing a control sparsity constraint. More precisely, we consider a nonlocal restriction on the total amount of control that can be used depending on the overall state of the evolving mass. We treat in details two main cases: an instantaneous constraint on the control applied to the evolving mass and a cumulative constraint, which depends also on the amount of control used in previous times. For both constraints, we prove the existence of optimal trajectories for general cost functions and that the value function is viscosity solution of a suitable Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann equation. Finally, we discuss an abstract Dynamic Programming Principle, providing further applications in the Appendix.},
