Each of these has a complete “internal semiring” and can be enriched over its modules. We describe a semantics of nondeterministic PCF weighted over this semiring in which fixed points are obtained from the bifree algebra over its exponential structure. By characterizing them concretely as infinite sums of approximants indexed over nested finite multisets , we prove computational adequacy. We can construct examples of our semantics by weighting existing models such as categories of games over a complete semiring. This transition from qualitative to quantitative semantics is characterized as a “change of base” of enriched categories arising from a monoidal functor from coherence spaces to modules over a complete semiring. For example, the game semantics of Idealized Algol is coherence space enriched and thus gives rise to to a weighted model, which is fully abstract.},

There exist various notions of causality in π -calculus, which differ in the treatment of parallel extrusions of the same name. Hence, by using a parametric way of bookkeeping the order and the dependencies among extruders it is possible to map different causal semantics into the same framework. Starting from this simple observation, we present a uniform framework for reversible π -calculi that is parametric with respect to a data structure that stores information about the extrusion of a name. Different data structures yield different approaches to the parallel extrusion problem. We map three well-known causal semantics into our framework. We prove causal-consistency for the three instances of our framework. Furthermore, we prove a causal correspondence between the appropriate instances of the framework and the Boreale-Sangiorgi semantics and an operational correspondence with the reversible π -calculus causal semantics.},

Performing each block has an additional time-consumption—waiting to be executed—besides the running time. We interpret the operational semantics of PPD by Markov automata with a cost structure on transitions. Our goal is to measure those individual execution paths of a PPD that terminates within a given time bound, and to compute the minimum termination probability , i.e. the termination probability under a demonic scheduler that resolves the nondeterminism inherited from probabilistic programs. When running time plus waiting time is bounded, the demonic scheduler can be determined by comparison between a class of well-formed real numbers. The method is extended to parametric PPDs. When only the running time is bounded, the demonic scheduler can be determined by real root isolation over a class of well-formed real functions under Schanuel&#39;s conjecture. Finally we give the complexity upper bounds of the proposed methods.},

The gap symbols are associated with bounds determining possible lengths of matching strings. Online DROG captures the difficulty in a bottleneck procedure for cyber-security, as many digital signatures of viruses manifest themselves as patterns with a single gap. Following the work on the closely related online Dictionary Matching with One Gap problem (DMOG), we provide algorithms whose time cost depends linearly on δ ( G D ) δ(GD) , where G D GD is a bipartite graph that captures the structure of D and δ ( G D ) δ(GD) is the degeneracy of this graph. These algorithms are of practical interest since although δ ( G D ) δ(GD) can be as large as d d , and even larger if G D GD is a multi-graph, it is typically a small constant in practice.},

In particular, our result answers affirmatively the question whether there exists a secure and reliable universal system of rate asymptotically larger than log ⁡ κ log⁡κ , where κ is the security parameter. Next, we prove a lower bound on the query complexity of stegosystems showing that our construction is optimal. This lower bound extends the results by Hopper et al. (2009) [19] and by Dedić et al.

We prove that an exponential number of samples is needed to embed messages in documents of high min-entropy.

This is done with a linear blow-up in the number of states, where the constant factor depends on the degree of the graphs being traversed. The construction directly applies to all basic models representable as GWA, and, in particular, subsumes numerous existing results for making individual models halt on every input.},

IDentity-based 2-PAKA (ID-2-PAKA) protocols are widely researched, since it eliminates the need for explicit public-key verification using digital certificates. Over the years, ID-2-PAKA protocols with perfect forward secrecy and Key Generation Center forward secrecy were devised, to circumvent the inherent key escrows in identity based cryptosystems. Nevertheless, cryptanalysis of the recent ID-2-PAKA schemes reveals that many of the protocols are insecure. We reconstruct the possible attacks against the schemes and propose a secure escrowless pairing-free ID-2-PAKA protocol. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the modified extended Canetti-Krawczyk model, which captures all the desirable security attributes of ID-2-PAKA protocols, including, public key replacement attack resilience. Comparative analysis of the protocol with other pairing-free ID-2-PAKA schemes suggests that the proposed scheme offers a fine trade-off between efficiency and security.},

The goal is to compute the sum of weights of all paths (instead of number of accepting paths). Useful properties and plenty of applications make them interesting. The definition captures even undecidable problems, but obtaining an exponentially small additive approximation is just as hard as solving conventional counting. We present a structured view by defining classes that depend on the functions that assign weights to paths and by showing their relationships and how they generalize counting problems. Weighted counting is flexible and allows us to cast a number of famous results of computational complexity , including quantum computation , probabilistic graphical models and stochastic combinatorial optimization .

Current QA platforms allow for the optimization of quadratic objectives defined over binary variables (qubits), also known as Ising problems. In the last decade, QA systems as implemented by D-Wave have scaled with Moore-like growth. Current architectures provide 2048 sparsely-connected qubits, and continued exponential growth is anticipated, together with increased connectivity. We explore the feasibility of such architectures for solving SAT and MaxSAT problems as QA systems scale. We develop techniques for effectively encoding SAT –and, with some limitations, MaxSAT– into Ising problems compatible with sparse QA architectures. We provide the theoretical foundations for this mapping, and present encoding techniques that combine offline Satisfiability and Optimization Modulo Theories with on-the-fly placement and routing. Preliminary empirical tests on a current generation 2048-qubit D-Wave system support the feasibility of the approach for certain SAT and MaxSAT problems.},

They focus on mobility by allowing both a dynamic network topology as well as the movement of code within the network. To analyse the quality of mobile ambients as a good foundational model for distributed computation, we analyse the level of synchronisation between distributed components that they can express. Therefore, we rely on earlier established synchronisation patterns . It turns out that mobile ambients are not fully distributed, because they can express enough synchronisation to express a synchronisation pattern called M M . However, they can express strictly less synchronisation than the pi-calculus. For this reason, we can show that there is no good and distributability-preserving encoding from the pi-calculus into mobile ambients and also no such encoding from mobile ambients into the join-calculus, i.e., the expressive power of mobile ambients is in between these languages. Finally, we discuss how these results can be used to obtain a fully distributed variant of mobile ambients and present one example. Such a fully distributed variant of mobile ambients is a good foundation for distributed computation.},

The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm needs only one query to compute D J n 0 DJn0 but the classical deterministic algorithm requires n 2 + 1 n2+1 queries to compute it in the worse case. We present all symmetric partial Boolean functions with degree 1 and 2; We prove the exact quantum query complexity of all symmetric partial Boolean functions with degree 1 and 2. We prove Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can compute any symmetric partial Boolean function f with exact quantum 1-query complexity.},

This result is essentially optimal, as we also show that, in the same environment, no failure detector outputting a constant number of bits per process can achieve perfect failure detection.},

This paper addresses the problem of defining variants of this equivalence which are insensitive to silent moves. We define (rooted) weak team equivalence and (rooted) branching team equivalence as natural transposition to finite-state machines of Milner&#39;s weak bisimilarity [25] and van Glabbeek and Weijland&#39;s branching bisimilarity [12] on labeled transition systems . The process algebra CFM [15] is expressive enough to represent all and only the finite-state machines, up to net isomorphism. Here we first prove that the rooted versions of these equivalences are congruences for the operators of CFM, then we show some algebraic properties, and, finally, we provide finite, sound and complete, axiomatizations for them.},

In this paper, we restrict the semantics such that a symbol that is pushed onto a stack s can be popped only within a given number of contexts involving s , i.e., we bound the scope (in terms of number of contexts) of matching push and pop transitions. This restriction permits runs with unboundedly many contexts even between matching push and pop transitions (for systems with at least three stacks). We call the resulting model a multi-stack pushdown system with scope-bounded matching relations ( SMpds ). We show that the configuration reachability and the location reachability problems for SMpds are both Pspace -complete, and that the set of the reachable configurations can be captured by a finite automaton .},

We develop semantic theories and proof techniques for link -calculus and apply them in reasoning about complex distributing computing scenarios, where more than two participants need to synchronise in order to perform a task. In particular, we introduce the notion of linked bisimilarity in analogy with the early bisimilarity of the π -calculus.

Next, we consider a generalization of the classical Breakpoint Median problem, where an ancestral genome is represented by a PQ-tree and p ≥ 1 p≥1 permutations are given and we want to compute a permutation generated by the PQ-tree that minimizes the sum of the breakpoint distances to the p permutations (or k ).

In AAUML the update modalities formalize the execution of arrow update models , and there is also a modality for quantification over arrow update models. Arrow update models are an alternative to the well-known action models. We provide an axiomatization of AAUML. The axiomatization is a rewrite system allowing to eliminate arrow update modalities from any given formula, while preserving truth. Thus, AAUML is decidable and equally expressive as the base multi-agent modal logic. Our main result is to establish arrow update synthesis : if there is an arrow update model after which φ , we can construct (synthesize) that model from φ .

Besides, inspired by the autopoiesis process (ability of a system to maintain itself), membrane creation rules are considered as an efficient mechanism to provide an exponential workspace in terms of membranes. The presumed efficiency of these computing models (ability to solve computationally hard problems in polynomial time and uniform way) is explored. Specifically, an efficient solution to the SAT problem is provided by means of a family of recognizer cell-like P systems with evolutional symport/antiport rules and membrane creation which make use of communication rules involving a restricted number of objects.},

  abstract     = {The asynchronous automaton associated with a Boolean network f : { 0 , 1 } n → { 0 , 1 } n f:{0,1}n→{0,1}n is considered in many applications. It is the finite deterministic automaton with set of states { 0 , 1 } n {0,1}n , alphabet { 1 , … , n } {1,…,n} , where the action of letter i on a state x consists in switching the i th component if f i ( x ) ≠ x i fi(x)≠xi or doing nothing otherwise. This action is extended to words in the natural way. We then say that a word w fixes f if, for all states x , the result of the action of w on x is a fixed point of f . In this paper, we ask for the existence of fixing words, and their minimal length. Firstly, our main results concern the minimal length of words that fix monotone networks. We prove that there exists a monotone network f with n components such that any word fixing f has length Ω ( n 2 ) Ω(n2) . Conversely, we construct a word of length O ( n 3 ) O(n3) that fixes all monotone networks with n components. Secondly, we refine and extend our results to different classes of networks.},

  abstract     = {Asynchronous Boolean totalistic cellular automata have recently attracted attention as promising models for implementation by reaction-diffusion systems. It is unknown, however, to what extent they are able to conduct computation. In this paper, we introduce the so-called non-camouflage property , which means that a cell&#39;s update is insensitive to neighboring states that equal its own state. This property subsumes the Boolean totalistic property , which signifies the existence of states in a cell&#39;s neighborhood, but is not concerned with how many cells are in those states. We argue that the non-camouflage property is extremely useful for the implementation of reaction-diffusion systems, and we construct an asynchronous cellular automaton with this property that is Turing-complete by directly simulating Turing machines . We also construct another asynchronous cellular automaton, but this model incorporates the so-called freezing property [1] , which restricts the direction of transitions of each cell to one-way. We show that this model is Turing-complete, since it can simulate the temporal evolution of elementary cellular automata. These results indicate the feasibility of computation by reaction-diffusion systems.},

  abstract     = {Cellular automata are discrete dynamical systems with locally defined behaviour, well known as simple models of complex systems. Classically, their dynamics derive from synchronously iterated rules over finite or infinite configurations; however, since for many natural systems to be modelled, asynchrony seems more plausible, asynchronous iteration of the rules has gained a considerable attention in recent years. One question in this context is how changing the update schedule of rule applications affects the global behaviour of the system. In particular, previous works addressed the notion of maximum sensitivity to changes in the update schemes for finite lattices . Here, we extend the notion to infinite lattices , and classify elementary cellular automata space according to such a property.},

Second, we obtain a partial classification of elementary vN-regular CA over { 0 , 1 } Z {0,1}Z by taking advantage of some symmetries among them. Next, when A and G are both finite, we obtain a full characterisation of vN-regular CA over A G AG .

  abstract     = {Recent advances in the analysis of random linear systems on finite fields have paved the way for the construction of constant-time data structures representing static functions and minimal perfect hash functions using less space with respect to existing techniques. The main obstacle for any practical application of these results is the time required to solve such linear systems: despite they can be made very small, the computation is still too slow to be feasible. In this paper, we describe in detail a number of heuristics and programming techniques to speed up the solution of these systems by orders of magnitude, making the overall construction competitive with the standard and widely used MWHC technique, which is based on hypergraph peeling. In particular, we introduce broadword programming techniques for fast equation manipulation and a lazy Gaussian elimination algorithm. We also describe a number of technical improvements to the data structure which further reduce space usage and improve lookup speed. Our implementation of these techniques yields a minimal perfect hash function data structure occupying 2.24 bits per element, compared to 2.68 for MWHC-based ones, and a static function data structure which reduces the multiplicative overhead from 1.23 to 1.024. For functions whose output has low entropy , we are able to implement feasibly for the first time the Hreinsson–Krøyer–Pagh approach, which makes it possible, for example, to store a function with an output of 10 6 values distributed following a power law of exponent 2 in just 2.76 bits per key instead of 20.},

  abstract     = {We consider n -player non-zero sum games played on finite trees (i.e., sequential games), in which the players have the right to repeatedly update their respective strategies. This generates a dynamics in the game which may eventually stabilise to a Nash Equilibrium , and we study the conditions that guarantee such a dynamics to terminate. We build on the works of Le Roux and Pauly who have studied the Lazy Improvement Dynamics. We extend these works by first defining a turn-based dynamics, proving that it terminates on subgame perfect equilibria, and showing that several variants do not terminate. Second, we define a variant of Kukushkin&#39;s lazy improvement where the players may now form coalitions to change strategies. We show how properties of the players&#39; preferences on the outcomes affect the termination of this dynamics, and we characterise classes of games where it always terminates (in particular two-player games).},

  abstract     = {Parametric Markov chains have been introduced as a model for families of stochastic systems that rely on the same graph structure, but differ in the concrete transition probabilities . The latter are specified by polynomial constraints over a finite set of parameters. Important tasks in the analysis of parametric Markov chains are (1) computing closed-form solutions for reachability probabilities and other quantitative measures and (2) finding symbolic representations of the set of parameter valuations for which a given temporal logical formula holds as well as (3) the decision variant of (2) that asks whether there exists a parameter valuation where a temporal logical formula holds. Our contribution to (1) is to show that existing implementations for computing rational functions for reachability probabilities or expected costs in parametric Markov chains can be improved by using fraction-free Gaussian elimination , a long-known technique for linear equation systems with parametric coefficients. Our contribution to (2) and (3) is a complexity-theoretic discussion of the model-checking problem for parametric Markov chains and probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) formulas. We present an exponential-time algorithm for (2) and a PSPACE upper bound for (3). Moreover, we identify fragments of PCTL and subclasses of parametric Markov chains where (1) and (3) are solvable in polynomial time and establish NP-hardness for other PCTL fragments.},

The problem is shown to be decidable in LogSpace for a class of forgetful automata , where the nodes see the messages received from their neighbors but cannot remember their own state. When restricted to the appropriate families of graphs, these forgetful automata are equivalent to classical finite word automata, but strictly more expressive than finite tree automata . On the other hand, we also show that the emptiness problem is undecidable in general. This already holds for two heavily restricted classes of distributed automata: those that reject immediately if they receive more than one message per round, and those whose state diagram must be acyclic except for self-loops. Additionally, to demonstrate the flexibility of distributed automata in simulating different models of computation , we provide a characterization of constraint satisfaction problems by identifying a class of automata with exactly the same computational power.},

The new logic, named LTL-EF , can be interpreted with different models of time (including discrete, dense, and super-dense time) and with different first-order theories (à la Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)). We show that the “at next” and “at last” can encode (first-order) MTL 0 , ∞ MTL0,∞ with counting. We provide rewriting procedures to reduce the satisfiability problem to the discrete-time case (to leverage on the mature state-of-the-art corresponding verification techniques) and to remove the extra functional symbols. We implemented these techniques in the nuXmv model checker enabling the analysis of LTL-EF and MTL 0 , ∞ MTL0,∞ based on SMT-based model checking. We show the feasibility of the approach experimenting with several non-trivial valid and satisfiable formulas.},

  abstract     = {The McNaughton-Zielonka divide et impera algorithm is the simplest and most flexible approach available in the literature for determining the winner in a parity game. Despite its theoretical exponential worst-case complexity and the negative reputation as a poorly effective algorithm in practice, it has been shown to rank among the best techniques for solving such games. Also, it proved to be resistant to a lower bound attack, even more than the strategy improvements approaches, but finally Friedmann provided a family of games on which the algorithm requires exponential time . An easy analysis of this family shows that a simple memoization technique can help the algorithm solve the family in polynomial time . The same result can also be achieved by exploiting an approach based on the dominion-decomposition techniques proposed in the literature. These observations raise the question whether a suitable combination of dynamic programming and game-decomposition techniques can improve on the exponential worst case of the original algorithm. In this paper we answer this question negatively, by providing a robustly exponential worst case, showing that no possible intertwining of the above mentioned techniques can help mitigating the exponential nature of the divide et impera approaches. The resulting worst case is even more robust than that, since it serves as a lower bound for progress measures based algorithms as well, such as Small Progress Measure and its quasi-polynomial variant recently proposed by Jurdziński and Lazic.},

Our framework also yields upper bounds on the complexity of determining the winner of such delay games and upper bounds on the necessary lookahead to win the game.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate the model checking (MC) problem for Halpern and Shoham&#39;s modal logic of time intervals (HS) and its fragments, where labeling of intervals is defined by regular expressions. The MC problem for HS has recently emerged as a viable alternative to the traditional (point-based) temporal logic MC. Most expressiveness and complexity results have been obtained by imposing suitable restrictions on interval labeling, namely, by either defining it in terms of interval endpoints, or by constraining a proposition letter to hold over an interval if and only if it holds over each component state (homogeneity assumption). In both cases, the expressiveness of HS gets noticeably limited, in particular when fragments of HS are considered. A possible way to increase the expressiveness of interval temporal logic MC was proposed by Lomuscio and Michaliszyn, who suggested to use regular expressions to define interval labeling, i.e., the properties that hold true over intervals/computation stretches, based on their component points/system states. In this paper, we provide a systematic account of decidability and complexity issues for model checking HS and its fragments extended with regular expressions. We first prove that MC for (full) HS extended with regular expressions is decidable by an automaton-theoretic argument. Though the exact complexity of full HS MC remains an open issue, the complexity of all relevant proper fragments of HS is here determined. In particular, we provide an asymptotically optimal bound to the complexity of the two syntactically maximal fragments A A ‾ B B ‾ E ‾ AA‾BB‾E‾ and A A ‾ E B ‾ E ‾ AA‾EB‾E‾ , by showing that their MC problem is AEX P pol AEXPpol -complete ( AEX P pol AEXPpol is the complexity class of problems decided by exponential-time bounded alternating Turing Machines making a polynomially bounded number of alternations). Moreover, we show that a better result holds for A A ‾ B B ‾ AA‾BB‾ , A A ‾ E E ‾ AA‾EE‾ and all their sub-fragments, whose MC problem turns out to be PSPACE -complete.},

Using the new feature and recent work on streaming Multiple Pattern Matching we develop a series of streaming algorithms for pattern matching on weighted strings, which are a commonly used representation of uncertain sequences in molecular biology. We also show that these algorithms are space-optimal up to polylog factors. A preliminary version of this work was published at DCC 2017 conference [24] .},

  abstract     = {In this work we present a formalization , backed with a contrasted implementation, of a relational database language (called HR-SQL) that extends SQL in two aspects. On the one hand, including non-linear and mutual recursion. On the other hand, including hypothetical relations and queries. Regarding expressiveness, HR-SQL allows a novel form of hypothetical reasoning, completely integrated with recursive definitions . In addition, aggregate functions are added. Regarding formalization , the extended language is founded on a stratified fixpoint semantics based on logic programming techniques. We include results of the existence of such fixpoints. An algorithm that transforms a database containing hypothetical definitions into an equivalent one without hypothesis and its correctness proof are presented. Regarding the implementation, we introduce here a system that incorporates the aforementioned benefits and enhances former implementations in several areas. The current HR-SQL system is targeted to several state-of-the-art relational database systems , and could be used with any SQL-based system with minor modifications in the implementation.},

Perfect decomposition requires the obtained constituent parts to be non-interacting components and easier to conceive, understand, program, and maintain. However, how to decompose a complex system and ensure the correctness of such a decomposition approach usually relies on some informal principles. In this paper, we present a new and automatic decomposition approach for functionalities. We first show the correctness of the functional decomposition in terms of weakly termination in theory and then discuss the automation method of the functional decomposition. The approach can automatically decompose a system into independent subsystems which may be independently developed and deployed. Finally, we develop an algorithm. A case study demonstrates these results.},

Synthesis tries, for a given (finite) labelled transition system (LTS), to find an (unlabelled) Petri net with an isomorphic reachability graph . Synthesis often requires a large set of inequality systems to be solved, making it quite costly. In presynthesis we exploit common necessary properties of some class of Petri nets. If any of the properties do not hold, we can directly dismiss the LTS, it cannot be the reachability graph of a Petri net from our class. This also allows an implementation to give a meaningful response instead of just telling the user that some inequality system is unsolvable. If all properties hold, we may gain additional information that can simplify the inequality systems to be solved. In this paper, we enhance theoretically, and tune algorithmically a presynthesis strategy already known for choice-free nets to fork-attribution nets.},

Such annihilator exists, for example, if the number of distinct patterns of some finite shape D in the configuration is at most the size | D | |D| of the shape. This is our low pattern complexity assumption. We prove that the configuration must be a sum of periodic configurations over integers, possibly with unbounded values.

We then consider the case of mixtures and show: (a) there exists an effective mixture of separable strategies which succeeds on every casino sequence with effective Hausdorff dimension less than 1/2; (b) there exists a casino sequence of effective Hausdorff dimension 1/2 on which no effective mixture of separable strategies succeeds.

This tree can be constructed iteratively by solving | V | − 1 |V|−1 minimum s l − sl− separator problem.

In this paper, we initiate a new line of investigation on the presence of faults, focusing on a different issue: we study, for the first time, the unintended dynamics of the robots when they execute an algorithm designed for a fault-free environment, in presence of undetectable crashed robots. We start this investigation considering a classical point-convergence algorithm for oblivious robots with limited visibility in a simple setting (which already presents serious challenges): synchronous robots on a line with at most two faults. Interestingly, the presence of faults induces the robots to perform some form of scattering , rather than point-convergence . In fact, we discover that they arrange themselves inside the segment delimited by the two faults in complex interleaved sequences of equidistant robots.},

Systems are coalgebras with a finitely generated carrier for an endofunctor on a locally finitely presentable category.

The LFF exists provided that the endofunctor is finitary and preserves monomorphisms , is a subcoalgebra of the final coalgebra, i.e. it is fully abstract w.r.t. behavioural equivalence, and it is characterized by two universal properties: as the final locally finitely generated coalgebra, and as the initial fg-iterative algebra. Instances of the LFF are: regular languages, rational streams, rational formal power-series, regular trees etc. Moreover, we obtain e.g. (realtime deterministic resp. non-deterministic) context-free languages, constructively S -algebraic formal power-series (in general, the behaviour of finite coalgebras under the coalgebraic language semantics arising from the generalized powerset construction by Silva, Bonchi, Bonsangue, and Rutten), and the monad of Courcelle&#39;s algebraic trees.},

Both techniques are applied to a previous work of us, that has focused on developing a threshold to efficiently store subsequences inside a one or two level inverted index, based on their number of occurrences inside a biological sequence. We study the performance of these two compression algorithms over different fluctuations of the threshold. The compression ratio of the OptPFD is affected by the changes in the threshold and is also efficient as in text documents. Whereas, IPC has a different performance for each threshold and it is more stable, although it is much less efficient than in text documents.},

  abstract     = {An absent word of a word y is a word that does not occur in y . It is then called minimal if all its proper factors occur in y . In fact, minimal absent words (MAWs) provide useful information about y and thus have several applications. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that maintains the set of MAWs of a fixed-length window sliding over y online. Our algorithm represents MAWs through nodes of the suffix tree. Specifically, the suffix tree of the sliding window is maintained using modified Senft&#39;s algorithm (Senft, 2005), itself generalizing Ukkonen&#39;s online algorithm (Ukkonen, 1995). We then apply this algorithm to the approximate pattern-matching problem under the Length Weighted Index distance (Chairungsee and Crochemore, 2012). This results in an online O ( σ | y | ) O(σ|y|) -time algorithm for finding approximate occurrences of a word x in y , | x | ≤ | y | |x|≤|y| , where σ is the alphabet size.},

  abstract     = {Line of Sight (LoS) networks were designed to model wireless communication in settings which may contain obstacles. For fixed positive integer d , and positive integer ω , a graph G = ( V , E ) G=(V,E) is a ( d -dimensional) LoS network with range parameter ω if it can be embedded in a finite cube of the d -dimensional integer grid so that each pair of vertices in V are adjacent if and only if their embedding coordinates differ only in one position and such difference is less than ω . In this paper we investigate a dynamic programming (DP) approach which can be used to obtain efficient algorithmic solutions for various combinatorial problems in LoS networks. In particular DP solves the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem in LoS networks optimally, for any ω , on narrow LoS networks (i.e. networks which can be embedded in a k × k … × k × n k×k…×k×n region, for some fixed k independent of n ). In the unrestricted case it has been shown that the (decision version of the) problem is NP-hard when 2 2&amp;lt;ω=O(n1−δ) , for fixed 0 0&amp;lt;δ&amp;lt;1 . We describe how DP can be used as a building block in the design of good approximation algorithms in this case. In particular we present a semi-online polynomial-time approximation scheme for the MIS problem in narrow d -dimensional LoS networks, as well as a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm and a fast polynomial time approximation scheme for the MIS problem in arbitrary d -dimensional LoS networks. Finally we comment on how the approach can be adapted to prove similar results for a number of important optimization problems in LoS networks.},
