We find that the complete queue transparency (i.e., disclosing the real-time system information) can have positive effect on customers, which might encourage more customers to join. Further, the follow-the-crowd (FTC) behavior can be observed, which results in multiple equilibria. By comparing the customer welfare under two different information levels, we demonstrate that, somewhat surprisingly, the queue transparency does not necessarily hurt the customer welfare, and a higher customer welfare can be obtained in the transparent case than that in opaque case when the demand volume is large.},

In its a priori version, we are also given independent probabilities of each vertex being active. We want to find a master tour τ τ originating from r r and visiting all vertices. The objective is to minimize the expected sum of arrival-times at all active vertices, when τ τ is shortcut over the inactive vertices. We obtain the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for a priori TRP under independent non-uniform probabilities . Our result provides a general reduction from non-uniform to uniform probabilities, and uses (in black-box manner) an existing approximation algorithm for a priori TRP under uniform probabilities.},

Model performance is assessed through different backtesting techniques, including multinomial test, for three risk measures: Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall and Median Shortfall. Our results show that the ‘large’ semi-nonparametric expansion is a good alternative to measure Bitcoin risk according to recommendations of Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, but also that 99\%-Median Shortfall seems to be an accurate and robust risk measure for Bitcoin.},

  abstract     = {This paper shows that an option to recapitalize with debt accelerates the exercise of a real option to start an irreversible project investment. The debt-recapitalization add-on, while not directly affecting project cash flows, influences the timing of the project start by offering an extra gain from tax savings less debt costs. This finding demonstrates that capital structure decisions are closely linked to project investment decisions, a deviation from the standard optimal investment rule of the real option theory.},

Recently, a practical policy called the Tailored Base-Surge (TBS) policy has been proposed to manage the system, and shown to perform well.

Using the techniques of MacLaurin series analysis, we develop an efficient method to calculate the moments of the inventory position, the bullwhip effect, and performance measures. Numerical experiments show that our method works well.},

We show that the stationary joint queue-length distribution exhibits state-space collapse in heavy traffic: as the load ρ ρ tends to 1, the scaled joint queue-length vector ( 1 − ρ ) Q (1−ρ)Q converges in distribution to the product of a deterministic vector and an exponentially distributed random variable, with known parameters. The result provides new insights into the behavior of DPS systems. It shows how the queue-length distribution depends on the system parameters, and in particular, on the simultaneity of the arrivals. The result also suggests simple and fast approximations for the tail probabilities and the moments of the queue lengths in stable DPS systems, capturing the impact of the correlation structure in the arrival processes. Numerical experiments indicate that the approximations are accurate for medium and heavily loaded systems.},
