  abstract     = {The recent advances usually attempt to mine the effective market information from the chaotic data and learn multilevel representations by using attention mechanisms to conduct a stock prediction task. However, such methods usually lack the full utilization of local semantic embedding which contains the abundant textual semantics information. Moreover, these models suffer from the severe noise diffusion in contextual embeddings from a sequence after passing through the RNN . The noises diffusion constrains the performance of the proposed methods. In this work, we propose a stock movement predictive network via incorporative attention mechanisms . The core innovation is that the incorporative attention combines local and contextual attention mechanisms to clean the contextual embeddings by using local semantics. As a result, the attention effectively reduce the noises in the constructed higher-level representations and enhance the performance. Moreover, the local semantics and context are merged into the constructed higher-level representations which provide more abundant local semantic and contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on tweet and historical price dataset.},

  abstract     = {Radar automatic target recognition (RATR) aims at extracting meaningful target features from the electromagnetic echo signal and utilizing the features to automatically recognize the target types. The high-resolution range profile (HRRP) plays an important role in RATR field, HRRP is the amplitude of the echo summation for target scattering centers in each range cell of wideband radar. Using deep neural networks for HRRP radar target recognition encounters the problem of storage overhead and slow convergence rate, to resolve those issues, we propose a one-dimension local receptive fields based extreme learning auto-encoder (1D ELM-LRF-AE) network for HRRP local structures and meaningful representations learning . ELM-LRF-AE consists of an input layer, a random convolution layer , a pooling layer, several local connected layers and an output layer, it reconstructs the input with a greedy strategy that the input feature vectors are divided into several subgroups and the i -th pooling feature vector is used to reconstruct the i -th grouping input feature vector. Then we use the learned pooling feature vectors to replace the random pooling feature vectors as the learned representations. We also stack several 1D ELM-LRF-AEs to build 1D hierarchical local receptive fields based extreme learning machine (1D H-ELM-LRF) for high level HRRP abstract representations learning and recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data set demonstrate the superior high recognition performance and high computational efficiency of our algorithm.},

An impulsive pinning controller is designed for realizing the spatio-temporal synchronization of neural networks . By the Lyapunov functional theory and the comparison principle, exponential synchronization criteria are established, which consist of algebraic inequalities and are easy to implement. Two numerical examples show that controlling only a portion of neurons in the slave neural network can achieve the synchronization of master–slave systems.},

Currently most methods employ the hierarchical information in embedding and/or softmax layers. It is interesting to ask if incorporating such information into hidden layer will be beneficial to the overall language modeling performance. Therefore, in this research we propose a dual channel class hierarchy (DCCH) model that utilizes two channels of RNNs to form a class hierarchy within the model, where class-channel is used to capture class sequence’s information. Furthermore, we study two auxiliary techniques in class organization: word hierarchy initialization and class exchange, to boost the overall performance. Finally, experiments on the PTB, WikiText-103, Wiki-fr and OBW datasets evaluate the potential of proposed model and our observation.},

  abstract     = {Cross-environment activity recognition in smart homes is a very challenging problem, specially for data-driven approaches. Currently, systems developed to work for a certain environment degrade substantially when applied to a new environment, where not only sensors, but also the monitored activities may be different. Some systems require manual labeling and mapping of the new sensor names and activities using an ontology. Ideally, given a new smart home, we would like to be able to deploy the system, which has been trained on other sources, with minimal manual effort and with acceptable performance. In this paper, we propose the use of neural word embeddings to represent sensor activations and activities, which comes with several advantages: (i) the representation of the semantic information of sensor and activity names, and (ii) automatically mapping sensors and activities of different environments into the same semantic space. Based on this novel representation approach, we propose two data-driven activity recognition systems: the first one is a completely unsupervised system based on embedding similarities, while the second one adds a supervised learning regressor on top of them. We compare our approaches with some baselines using four public datasets, showing that data-driven cross-environment activity recognition obtains good results even when sensors and activity labels significantly differ. Our results show promise for reducing manual effort, and are complementary to other efforts using ontologies.},

In the traditional diagnostic process, clinical experts manually segment left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (Myo) to get the guideline for cardiopathy diagnosis. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose automatic cardiac MRI segmentation and cardiopathy classification based on deep neural networks and point clouds. The cardiac MRI segmentation consists of two steps: ( i ) We use a detector based on you only look once (YOLO) to obtain region of interest (ROI) from the sequential diastolic and systolic MRI. ( ii ) We obtain the segmentation masks from the ROI automatically by a fully convolutional neural network (FCN). Subsequently, we reconstruct 3D surfaces by a simple linear interpolation method , then randomly sample uniform 3D point clouds from the 3D surfaces. From the cardiac point clouds, we perform cardiopathy classification using a cardiopathy diagnosis network (CDN). Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully segments LV, RV, and Myo from cardiac MRI images and achieves comparable results against several existing ones. Moreover, the CDN successfully classifies heart diseases based on point clouds and achieves 92\% accuracy on the testing dataset.},

  abstract     = {Optomotor response (OMR) describes an innate orienting behavior for numerous kinds of model animals when the surrounding visual scene is moving, and is often used for evaluating animals’ visual function and nervous system . OMR measurements are generally performed and analyzed by skillful operators, but this manual measurement suffers from low accuracy and efficiency, which further yields unreliable and even misleading results. In this paper, we present a quantitative method to automatically measure the OMR in mice. The presented measurement method consists of a set of algorithms, e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN) to track the orientation of the mouse’s head, and a feature extraction method to measure the OMRs. Compared with existing techniques, the proposed method can measure the exact starting and ending time instants of each OMR in a video segment of a mouse motion record, based on the visual detection and analysis algorithms for mice motion, which is more precise and consistent compared to only judging the presence or absence of OMR for a whole segment of a motion record in almost all the existing OMR measuring methods. In the experiments, 21 mice (7 wt mice, 7 OPTN E50K mice, and 7 OPTN E50K + BMCs mice) with three levels of optic nerve injury treatments are performed the OMR tests. The observed statistical difference in results of the three groups of mice with different vision verifies the validity of the method. Compared with the calibration results from ophthalmological experts, the system can achieve the recognition rate of 94.89\%. The proposed method also provides a quantitative and analytical alternative of the OMR behavior of mice in neuroscience and ophthalmology studies.},

We utilize the features extracted by the convolutional layers to optimize the proposals generated by rules-based methods, and solve the above problem through combining the two different features. Then, a box regression module is added to the weakly supervised object detection network, which supervised by a proposal completeness scoring network (PCSNet). The box regression module modifies proposals to obtain higher intersection-over-Union (IoU) with ground truth. PCSNet scores the proposal output from the box regression network and utilizes the score to improve the box regression module. In addition, we take advantage of the random proposal scoring (RPS) algorithm for generating more accurate pseudo labels to train the box regression module.

In this paper we extend the NNN models to the more general cases through introducing a “regularization” parameter and a power parameter in these two matrix factors. The new proposed models are named here as the improved recurrent neural networks (IMRNN) since their convergence performance can be much better than the NNN models by appropriate choices of the introduced parameters. Such convergence property is theoretically analyzed in detail. Some numerical experiments are also performed to validate the theoretical results, including the numerical comparisons with the existing gradient neural network (GNN), ZNN and NNN models. In particular, the proposed IMRNN models are successfully applied to the inverse kinematic control of a three-link redundant robot manipulator where the superiority of the IMRNN models to the GNN, ZNN and NNN models is also indicated.},

However, when the size of the training dataset is small, the overfitting problem may happen and lead to performance degradation . Besides, the robust identification still remains a challenging problem even under the less strict requirements. This paper proposes a novel approach, SpeakerGAN, for speaker identification with the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). It allows the adversarial networks for distinguishing real/fake samples and predicting class labels simultaneously. We configure the generator and the discriminator in SpeakerGAN with the gated convolutional neural network (CNN) and the modified residual network (ResNet) to obtain generated samples of high diversity as well as increase the network capacity. The multiple loss functions are combined and optimized to encourage the correct mapping and accelerate the convergence. Experimental results show that SpeakerGAN reduces the classification error rate by 87\% and 16\% compared with the traditional i-vector system and the state-of-the-art DNN based method. Under the scenario of limited training data, SpeakerGAN obtains significant improvement over the baselines. In the case of taking 1.6 s of each speaker for testing, SpeakerGAN achieves the identification accuracy of 98.20\%, which suggests the promise for short-utterance speaker identification.},

Inspired by the human brain network , the artificial neural network (ANN) method was proposed and has become an important engineering tool for pattern recognition. A recent study suggested the similarity between the human brain network and ANN. Would the ANN show topographic features that are similar to those of the human brain network? In the present study, we first constructed a simple backpropagation ANN (BP-ANN) with one hidden layer, which is one of the simplest, representative ANN, based on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. Then, we explored the topographic features of a network with artificial neurons. We found that artificial neurons of the BP-ANN showed a high local efficiency and modularity similar to the human brain network. However, the global efficiency of artificial neurons of the BP-ANN was comparable with those of a random network. Our results showed that the best model (high accuracy and no overfitting) of a large-scale BP-ANN during epochs of training showed the lowest local and global efficiency. These results might imply that after epochs of training, neurons of the BP-ANN form local highly intra-connected functional modules but lack cooperation at the global level. The topography structure of the BP-ANN also shows the potential to become an early-stop marker during training.},

  abstract     = {In this study, the novel fully distributed asynchronous event-triggered protocols that use sampled state information are developed to address the leader-follower and leaderless consensus issues for the general linear multi-agent systems with physically interconnected network. By designing the state estimate of each follower agent, the protocols avoid the requirements for the continuous communication. Meanwhile, this paper proves that the designed protocols don’t exhibit the Zeno behavior in any finite time by giving a strictly positive lower-bound of the minimum inter-event interval. In contrast to the existing related papers, the salient features of this study are that both physically interconnected network and communication network of the multi-agent systems are considered and the developed protocols don’t require global network information, which reduce the conservativeness of previous systems modeling and protocols. Finally, two simulation results are provided to display the performance and effectiveness of the protocols.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, hashing based cross-modal retrieval methods have attracted considerable attention, due to the significant reduction in computational cost and storage consumption. Most previous cross-modal hashing methods usually assume that data examples in different modalities are fully-paired. However, they neglect the fact that the data are often unpaired without one-to-one corresponding relationships in practical applications. Though several methods have noted the semi-paired or partial paired scenario, they ignore the completely unpaired scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method, named Unpaired Cross-Modal Hashing (UCMH) for cross-modal retrieval to address the data with completely unpaired relationships. It leverages matrix factorization , similarity preservation, and semantic information to map data of different modalities to their respective semantic spaces. Moreover, different from most previous approaches, we construct an affinity matrix to bridge the semantic gap of data in different semantic spaces, which allows our method to handle single-label and multi-label unpaired cases simultaneously. Extensive experiments on one single-label dataset Wiki and two multi-label datasets namely MIR Flickr and NUS-WIDE, demonstrate that UCMH outperforms the state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods .},

Thirty different reciters and twelve imitators, of top reciters, were evaluated in the study. In addition to identifying the reciter, our objective is to first evaluate different classifiers performing the stated recognition, compare classical vs. deep-based classifiers, and finally benchmark automatic against human expert listeners’ accuracy in identifying authentic reciters from imitators. Using different multimedia outlets over the internet, several reciters became more popular than others for their distinct cantillation style. Towards the development of a practical classifying system, a significant dataset of 15810 audio clips is constructed for thirty reciters in addition to 397 clips for top imitators. A combination of perceptual and acoustic features was extracted in order to achieve better classification. The classifying system is implemented using six top-achieving classical and two deep learning classifiers. Finally, we perform a survey engaging human expert listeners’ performance in detecting imitators from authentic reciters, against the fine-tuned classifiers to be able to discuss cross-comparative results. The concluded results demonstrated a high accuracy performance for the selected classifiers averaging 98.6\% 98.6\% on the testing dataset, 93\% 93\% on a separate testing dataset, 97\% 97\% on the problem of discriminating authentic Cantillations from imitations, and outstanding performance on the survey reaching an accuracy rate of 98\% 98\% compared to 61\% 61\% of human experts.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable segmentation of the prostate, its inner and surrounding structures in magnetic resonance (MR) images, is of essential importance for image-guided prostate interventions and treatments. Further clinical demand is the automated segmentation of central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ). Although T2-weighted (T2W) images can show prostate tissues more clearly, the lack of contrast between PZ and other surrounding tissues in T2W images increases the difficulty of PZ segmentation. In this context, it is necessary to consider using multi-parametric MR images to obtain complementary information for prostate zonal segmentation. In this paper, we propose a 3D multi-scale discriminative network with pyramid attention module (PAM) and residual refinement block (RRB) for automated and accurate segmentation of CG and PZ using bi-parametric (T2W and apparent diffusion coefficient) MR images. One of the major difficulties in prostate MR image segmentation is the ambiguous edge between the prostate and other surrounding anatomical structures, which is reflected in some specific directions. Therefore, we design a multi-directional edge loss to help the network focus on the multi-directional edge information of foreground areas. For the Prostate Multi-parametric MRI (PROMM) dataset, our proposed model achieved Dice similarity coefficient of 0.908 at CG and 0.785 at PZ. The average boundary distance obtained by our model is 1.397 mm at CG and 3.891 mm at PZ. For the NCI-ISBI dataset, our method greatly improves the Dice similarity coefficient at PZ, reaching 0.806 and achieved the Dice similarity coefficient of 0.901 at CG. The experimental results on two different MR prostate datasets demonstrate that our model is more sensitive to object boundaries and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The visualization of feature map activations in PAM shows that the proposed model can capture multi-scale discriminative features effectively.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) depends on carefully engineering environment rewards. However, rewards from environments are extremely sparse for many RL tasks, challenging for the agent to learn skills and interact with the environment. One solution to this problem is to create intrinsic rewards for agents and to make rewards dense and more suitable for learning. Recent algorithms, such as curiosity-driven exploration, usually estimate the novelty of the next state through the prediction error of dynamics models. However, these methods are typically limited by the capacity of their dynamics models. In this paper, a random curiosity-driven model using deep reinforcement learning is proposed, which uses a target network with fixed weights to maintain the stability of dynamics models and create more suitable intrinsic rewards. We integrate the parametric exploration method for further promoting sufficient exploration. Besides, a deeper and more closely connected network is utilized for encoding the pixel images for policy-gradient. By comparing our method against the previous approaches in several environments, the experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most but not all of the Atari games.},

The specificity of coding is the key issue of efficiently realizing complex cognition functions. In this study, a scale-free spiking neural network (SFSNN) is constructed based on synaptic plasticity and scale-free topology. The time coding properties of the SFSNN under different intensities of different stimulations including Gauss stimulation, impulse stimulation, and AC electric field stimulation are analyzed. On this basis, the specificity of time coding and the mechanism of time coding are studied emphatically. The experimental results show that: (1) Under each kind of stimulation, the inter-spike interval (ISI) is decreased, and the stronger the stimulation intensity is, the smaller the ISI is. (2) The time coding patterns have high similarity under same kind of stimulation, which is verified by the cosine similarity algorithm; the time coding patterns have high difference under different kind of stimulations, which is verified by the K-means clustering algorithm. Therefore, the time coding specificity is verified by the algorithms. (3) The relationship between the synaptic plasticity and time coding is established based on the Pearson correlation coefficient . The dynamic regulation of synaptic plasticity is significantly correlated with time coding under each kind of stimulation, which implies that the dynamic regulation of synaptic plasticity is the intrinsic factor of time coding mechanism.},

This paper proposes a novel network named Part Alignment Network (PAN) which can properly handle the misalignment of vehicles. It is therefore adapted to the vehicle re-ID task, avoiding the use of any additional pre-processing steps such as the annotation of vehicle key points and part segmentation by hand. In PAN, cross-correlation is adopted to the alignment of vehicle parts. Then, an effective network architecture is designed to extract the discriminative aligned features. By combining complementary aligned features and original features, more robust feature representations are learned. To show the effectiveness of PAN, this paper conducts experiments on three vehicle re-ID databases (VD1, VD2, and VehicleID), on which it improves the current state-of-the-art performance.},

Specifically, we build a change detection network, which computes absolute difference of the multiscale deep features of image pairs and learns adaptive features for change detection. The proposed network is based on off-the-shelf CNNs, whose convolutional layer blocks are used as feature extracting modules to extract multiscale deep features. We devise intra and cross encoding modules. The intra encoding modules are used for learning change related features from extracted features. These features are used for generating absolute difference features (ADFs). By progressively fusing the ADFs from high to low layers with cross encoding modules, we obtain full resolution of change detection result. Extensive experiments on three change detection benchmark datasets validate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art change detection methods .},

Based on the parallel architecture , we design a Boundary-aware High-resolution Network (BHNet). First, BHNet maintains high resolution to extract features of the image at the first pathway, and the resolution of the other four pathways are lower, which are used to provide more semantic information for the first pathway. Second, in order to better integrate multi-level semantic information into the first pathway and improve the ability of the model to perceive salient objects, several Multi-path Channel Weight Modules (MCWMs) and Region Enhancement Modules (REMs) are further designed for corresponding blocks. Finally, we also propose a boundary loss function to guide the network to learn more detailed boundary information, which leads to accurate predictions with clear boundaries. Exhaustive evaluations on 6 popular datasets illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches due to its superior performance, nice generalization and powerful learning ability.},

In this paper, based on a new neural dynamic, a novel Noise-Tolerance Finite-time convergent ZNN (NTFZNN) model for solving the time-varying Lyapunov equations has been proposed. The NTFZNN model simultaneously converges in finite time and have stable residual error even under unbounded time-varying noises. Furthermore, the Simplified Finite-te convergent Activation Function (SFAF) with simpler structure is used in the NTFZNN model to reduce model complexity while retaining finite convergence time. Theoretical proofs and numerical simulations are provided in this paper to substantiate the NTFZNN model’s convergence and robustness performances, which are better than performances of the ordinary ZNN model and the Noise-Tolerance ZNN (NTZNN) model.

To tackle the challenge, we propose a complementary convolution neural network ( com-CNN ) with attentional multiple instance learning (MIL) to obtain highly comprehensive features for extracting relations, and alleviate the negative effect caused by sentence-level noise. Our model com-CNN fully captures information from two different representations of a relation instance, raw word sequence (RWS) and multiple dependency path (MDP), and enables them to complement each other. To achieve better combination of RWS and MDP, we design a flexible feature fusion method. To mitigate the over-fitting problem of attention mechanism , which is caused by sparse texts, entity information is employed to guide the computation of attention scores for multiple instances in a bag to alleviate the impact of the wrongly labelled data. Experiments on Chinese relation extraction show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, and that the combination of RWS and MDP can generate more representative features for relation extraction. Besides, the empirical results validate our intention that entity-integrated attentional MIL offers the best performance in denoising for sparse domain texts compared with alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Most previous works on future market price forecasting only utilize the historical transaction data, while ignoring many other valuable factors. Recently, many research works propose multiple-source data-based predicting approaches in the stock market. Although the futures market and the stock market are very similar, the futures market still has its uniqueness. Most importantly, the subject matter of futures is usually commodity entities with prominent competing products or upstream, downstream industries, which can significantly influence the price. Therefore, it is essential to propose a future specific analysis framework by considering different factors. In this study, we constructed a Multi-source Heterogeneous Data Analysis (MHDA) method for future price prediction by integrating multiple-source information, i.e., trading data, news event data, and investor comments. Firstly, we first constructed a relation map to capture all related news events from upstream and downstream commodities and then built a future-specific sentiment dictionary to accurately quantify the sentiment impact of related news and investor comments during the feature extraction. Finally, we model the quantified multi-source heterogeneous information by an extended Hidden Markov Model to capture the underlying temporal dependency in the data. Evaluations on the data of palm oil futures from 2016.9 to 2017.9 show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

Specifically, we propose a multi-model structure for CF trackers to capture the target appearance changes, where different appearance models are trained with specific samples to catch the salient features of the target and reduce the computational cost. Furthermore, a space filter for detection features is designed to suppress the boundary effect under Gaussian motion prior, which contributes to improving the accuracy of position estimation. We deploy our method to three hand-crafted features based CF trackers to perform real-time visual tracking on popular benchmarks.

  abstract     = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a domain, in which a person can send information without using any exterior nerve or muscles, just using their brain signal, called electroencephalography (EEG) signal. Multiview learning or data integration or data fusion from a different set of features is an emerging way in machine learning to improve the generalized performance by considering the knowledge with multiple views. Multiview learning has made rapid progress and development in recent years and is also facing many new challenges. This method can be used in the BCI domain, as the meaningful representation of the EEG signal in plenty of ways. This study utilized the multiview ensemble learning (MEL) approach for the binary classification of five mental tasks on the six subjects individually. In this study, we used a well-known EEG database (Keirn and Aunon database). The EEG signal has been decomposed using by methods i.e wavelet transform (WT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), empirical wavelet transform (EWT), and fuzzy C-means followed by EWT (FEWT). After that, the feature coding technique is applied using parametric feature formation from the decomposed signal. Hence, we had four views to learn four same type of independent base classifiers and predictions are made in an ensemble manner. The study is performed independently with three types of base classifiers , i.e., K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels The performance validation of the ten combinations of mental tasks was performed by three MEL based classifiers, i.e., K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels. For reliability of the obtained results of the classifiers, 10-fold cross-validation was used. The proposed algorithm shows a promising accuracy of 80\% 80\% to 100\% 100\% for binary pair-wise classification of mental tasks.},

Our study employs the Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) model, which can be subjected to analytical characterization. We map the temporal structure of spike input trains to the type of spike response, and show how the emergence of nontrivial input–output preferences is modulated by intrinsic and synaptic parameters in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate that these temporal input discrimination properties are robust to noise and to variations in synaptic strength . Furthermore, we also illustrate the presence of these input–output relationships in conductance-based models. Our results suggest a widespread computationally economic and easily tunable mechanism for temporal information discrimination in single neurons.},

Recently, research attention has been paid to combining doctor’s opinions and machine learning technology to build up a better computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. In this paper, we propose an improved approach that uses human-rating BI-RADS scores to classify the BUS samples. A BI-RADS feature scoring scheme is firstly adopted to standardize the descriptions on breast lesions, and then the diagnostic patterns are mined by a biclustering algorithm in the collected BI-RADS feature score dataset. With an input sample, the diagnostic patterns could be activated to different degrees which represent the high-level features by calculating the distance between input sample and patterns. The high-level features of the sample are input into a multi-layer perception neural network (MLPNN) and we use a cost matrix to convert the output from probabilities to classification cost. The structure of the MLPNN and the values of elements in cost matrix are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization , and it finally classifies the input of BUS sample. According to the comparative experiments with other CAD approaches and the experienced sonographers, the proposed approach achieved the best sensitivity, indicating that it can serve as an assistant diagnostic system in clinical practices.},

Firstly, an augmented system method is explored such that the bipartite containment problem is formulated as the convergence problem of the product of an infinite number of sub-stochastic matrices. Then, by constructing a new leader–follower topology for each switching topology, the corresponding relationships between two topologies are used to simplify our model. Moreover, based on the properties of non-negative matrix and the technique of edge composition, a mild topological condition is developed for guaranteeing the bipartite containment collective behavior.

However, various and improved models of PNN do not properly balance their performance and efficiency. In this study, we present novel self-organized hybrid fuzzy neural networks (SHFNN). The purpose of this study is to develop a new design methodology of constructing a hybrid fuzzy model through enhanced input strategy (EIS) and probability-based node selection (PNS) to reinforce the performance of the model without sacrificing efficiency. l 2 l2 -norm regularization ( l 2 l2 ) is utilized to mitigate overfitting as well as enhance generalization capability. The key points of SHFNN can be summarized as follows. First, a hybrid network structure is constructed by combining fuzzy radial basis function neural networks (FRBFNN) and PNN. Second, we propose a probability-based node selection strategy for node (neuron) selection. Third, an enhanced input strategy (EIS) is proposed to design the enhanced input set by merging the general candidate input set (GCIS) and the original candidate input set (OCIS). The regularization coefficient estimation method based on l 2 l2 is used in conjunction with EIS and PNS to improve the performance and enhance the stability of the model. The effectiveness of SHFNN is validated using synthetic and machine learning dataset. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is improved by 4–22\% when compared with some methods reported in the literature. Statistical analysis is also considered to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been proved to be an effective framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning applications. The core operation block of GCN is the convolutional layer , which enables the network to construct node embeddings by fusing both attributes of nodes and relationships between nodes. Different features or feature interactions inherently have various influences on the convolutional layers. However, there are very limited studies about the impact of feature importance in GCN-related communities. In this work, we attempt to augment convolutional layers in GCNs with statistical attention-based feature importance by modeling the latent interactions of features, which is complementary to the standard GCNs and only needs simple calculations with statistics rather than heavy trainings. To this end, we treat the feature input of each convolutional layer as a separate multi-layer heterogeneous graph, and propose Graph Statistical Self-Attention (GSSA) method to automatically learn the hierarchical structure of feature importance. More specifically, we propose two modules in GSSA, Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA) to capture the dependencies between feature channels, and Mean-based Self-Attention (MSA) to reweight similarities among features. Aiming at each graph convolutional layer, GSSA can be applied in a ”plug and play” way for a wide range of GCN variants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation that optimizes GCNs from the feature importance perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSSA can promote existing popular baselines remarkably in semi-supervised node classification tasks. We further employ multiple qualitative evaluations to get deep insights into our method.},

  abstract     = {As an important part of linear perspective, vanishing points (VPs) provide useful clues for mapping objects from 2D photos to 3D space. Existing methods are mainly focused on extracting structural features such as lines or contours and then clustering these features to detect VPs. However, these techniques suffer from ambiguous information due to the large number of line segments and contours detected in outdoor environments. In this paper, we present a new convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect dominant VPs in natural scenes, i.e., the Dominant Vanishing Point detection Network (D-VPnet). The key component of our method is the feature line-segment proposal unit (FLPU), which can be directly utilized to predict the location of the dominant VP. Moreover, the model also uses the two main parallel lines as an assistant to determine the position of the dominant VP. The proposed method was tested using a public dataset and a Parallel Line based Vanishing Point (PLVP) dataset. The experimental results suggest that the detection accuracy of our approach outperforms those of state-of-the-art methods under various conditions in real-time, achieving rates of 115 fps.},

  abstract     = {Most of the current image captioning models that have achieved great successes heavily depend on manually labeled image-caption pairs. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to acquire large scale paired data. In this paper, we propose the Interactions Guided Generative Adversarial Network (IGGAN) for unsupervised image captioning, which joints multi-scale feature representation and object-object interactions. To get robust feature representation, the image is encoded by ResNet with a new Multi-scale module and adaptive Channel attention (RMCNet). Moreover, the information on object-object interactions is extracted by our Mutual Attention Network (MAN) and then adopted in the process of adversarial generation, which enhances the rationality of generated sentences. To encourage the sentence to be semantically consistent with the image, we utilize the image and generated sentence to reconstruct each other by cycle consistency in IGGAN . Our proposed model can generate sentences without any manually labeled image-caption pairs. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves quite promising performance on the MSCOCO image captioning dataset. The ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.},

Considering the profound connections between stock prices and consumer opinions, asking experienced buyers can be a promising direction. In this paper, which is based exclusively on online reviews, a framework for predicting long-term returns of individual stocks is established. Specifically, 6,246 features of 13 categories inferred from more than 18 million product reviews are elaborated to build the prediction model. A satisfactory increase in accuracy, 13.94\%, was achieved compared to the cutting-edge solution with 10 technical indicators being features. Additionally, we conduct a trading simulation on real-world stocks and our model obtains the highest return 13.12\% among all baselines in half year. The robustness of the model is further evaluated and testified. Our approaches, in both feature inference and prediction model, will offer insightful advices to investors in long-term investments on individual stocks.},

Two categories of exogenous noises, i.e., the persistent bounded noise and square additive noise in l 2 l2 space, are taken into investigation, respectively. Meanwhile, the well-known Round-Robin scheduling protocol is employed to regulate the data transmission through the shared communication media. The exponential mean-square ultimate boundedness and stochastic bounded real lemma (BRL) are obtained for the filtering error dynamics, and then two distributed filters are correspondingly designed.

  abstract     = {Existing face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods usually train a deep network-based detector on collected living and spoofing faces recorded with several reserved face capture conditions ( e.g. , reserved devices and scenes). Due to this data-driven approach, the trained detector performs well in detecting spoofing faces recorded with reserved capture conditions. However, as faces recorded with different conditions will differ to a greater or lesser degree, the detector’s performance may decline in real FAS applications in which faces are recorded with new capture conditions. To avoid the detector’s performance decline in real applications, we propose that the detector should efficiently adapt itself to any new application by fully utilizing the easy-collecting living faces in this application. We call this problem a one-class adaptation (OCA) problem for FAS. In this paper, we develop a novel one-class adaptation face anti-spoofing (OCA-FAS) method for the OCA problem. Specifically, OCA-FAS solves the OCA problem by training a meta-learner on OCA tasks for learning adaptation with only living faces. In addition, a novel meta loss function search (MLS) strategy that searches for better loss function to help the meta-learner solving OCA tasks is presented in OCA-FAS. To evaluate the developed OCA-FAS, we propose a benchmark with three protocols to test the detector’s performance on the OCA aspect. Our experiments show that compared with existing state-of-the-art FAS methods, OCA-FAS performs much better on not only our proposed benchmark but also existing benchmarks.},

Existing convolutional network (CNN) based approaches usually learn a single image super-resolution (SISR) model for a specific downsampler ( e.g. , bicubic downsampling, blurring followed by downsampling). The learned model, however, is tailored to the specific downsampler and fails to super-resolve real LR images which are degraded in more sophisticated and diverse manners. Moreover, the ground-truth high-resolution (HR) of real LR images are generally unavailable. Instead of learning from unpaired real LR-HR images or a specific downsampler, this paper learns blind SR network from a realistic, parametric degradation model by considering blurring, noise, downsampling, and even JPEG compression. In contrast to direct blind reconstruction of HR image, the proposed model adopts a cascaded architecture for noise estimation, blurring estimation, and non-blind SR, which can be jointly end-to-end learned from training data and benefit generalization ability . By taking the bicubicly upscaled LR image as input to non-blind SR, the proposed method can present a single unified model for blind SR with any upscaling factors and varying degradation parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably on synthetic and real LR images.},

However, adversarial examples , created by inserting a small amount of noise into the original samples, can be a serious threat because they can cause misclassification by the DNN. Adversarial examples have been studied primarily in the context of images, but their effect in the audio context is now drawing considerable interest as well. For example, by adding a small distortion to an original audio sample, imperceptible to humans, an audio adversarial example can be created that humans hear as error-free but that causes misunderstanding by a machine. Therefore, it is necessary to create a method of defense for resisting audio adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose an acoustic-decoy method for detecting audio adversarial examples. Its key feature is that it adds well-formalized distortions using audio modification that are sufficient to change the classification result of an adversarial example but do not affect the classification result of an original sample. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can detect adversarial examples by reducing the similarity rate for an adversarial example to 6.21\%, 1.27\%, and 0.66\% using low-pass filtering (with 12 dB roll-off), 8-bit reduction, and audio silence removal techniques, respectively. It can detect an audio adversarial example with a success rate of 97\% by performing a comparison with the initial audio sample.},

Despite the great progress of video captioning research, particularly in video feature encoding, the language decoder is still largely based on the prevailing recurrent structure such as LSTM , which tends to prefer frequent words that align with the video and do not generalize well to new videos. In this paper, we propose a boundary-aware hierarchical language decoder for video captioning, which consists of a high-level decoder, working as a global (caption-level) language model , and a low-level decoder, working as a local (phrase-level) language model . Most importantly, we introduce a binary gate into the low-level language decoder to detect the phrasal boundaries. Together with other advanced components including a joint video prediction module, a shared soft attention, and a boundary-aware video encoding module, our integrated video captioning framework can discover hierarchical language information and distinguish the subjects from the objects of the verbs in a sentence, which are usually confusing during caption generation. Extensive experiments on two widely-used video captioning datasets, MSR-Video-to-Text (MSR-VTT) and YouTube-to-Text (MSVD), show that our method is highly competitive, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Imbalanced learning is a challenging task for conventional algorithms. Sampling techniques address this problem by synthesizing minority class samples or selecting part of majority class samples to provide a balanced data. A large number of related researches emerged in the past decades. Recent studies show that the samples in overlapping area play a more important role in improving the classification performance for imbalanced data . However, how to eliminate majority class samples in overlapping area efficiently while avoiding classification performance deterioration caused by loss of original distribution is still an open problem. This paper proposes to deal with the overlapped samples with an Evolutionary Hybrid Sampling technique (EHSO). The main purpose of EHSO is to make the decision boundary more visible through removing useless majority class samples and to avoid the possible unexpected data introduced by synthetic new minority samples. EHSO applies evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal compromise between classification performance and the replicate ratio of random oversampling. Numerical experiments on all the binary-class imbalanced datasets (100 datasets) of KEEL repository have demonstrated its superiority compared with other well-known sampling methods.},

For handling this issue, an auxiliary random series method is presented to describe the data transferring in the network. Based on this method, the closed-loop NCSs is constructed and then analyzed via Lyapunov stability theory . Additionally, the probability of random data losses at each instant is supposed to be different which is more practical. For the purpose of obtaining more relaxed stabilization conditions, the fuzzy Lyapunov function obtained on the basis of both plant and controller fuzzy rules is employed. Furthermore, variations of membership functions are taken into account, and consequently, slack matrices are introduced to obtain less conservative result.

With availability of vast amounts of sensor data and cloud computing for processing and training of deep neural networks, and with increased sophistication in mobile and embedded technology, the next-generation intelligent systems are poised to revolutionize personal and commercial computing. This survey begins by providing background and evolution of some of the most successful deep learning models for intelligent speech and vision systems to date. An overview of large-scale industrial research and development efforts is provided to emphasize future trends and prospects of intelligent speech and vision systems. Robust and efficient intelligent systems demand low-latency and high fidelity in resource-constrained hardware platforms such as mobile devices , robots, and automobiles. Therefore, this survey also provides a summary of key challenges and recent successes in running deep neural networks on hardware-restricted platforms, i.e. within limited memory, battery life, and processing capabilities. Finally, emerging applications of speech and vision across disciplines such as affective computing , intelligent transportation, and precision medicine are discussed. To our knowledge, this paper provides one of the most comprehensive surveys on the latest developments in intelligent speech and vision applications from the perspectives of both software and hardware systems.

Our objective is to mimic these connections with a neurodynamic network of firing-rate neurons in order to predict visual attention. Early visual subcortical processes (i.e. retinal and thalamic) are functionally simulated. An implementation of the cortical magnification function is included to define the retinotopical projections towards V1, processing neuronal activity for each distinct view during scene observation. Novel computational definitions of top-down inhibition (in terms of inhibition of return, oculomotor and selection mechanisms), are also proposed to predict attention in Free-Viewing and Visual Search tasks. Results show that our model outpeforms other biologically inspired models of saliency prediction while predicting visual saccade sequences with the same model. We also show how temporal and spatial characteristics of saccade amplitude and inhibition of return can improve prediction of saccades, as well as how distinct search strategies (in terms of feature-selective or category-specific inhibition) can predict attention at distinct image contexts.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have recently been introduced to recommender systems . Most existing research works focus on designing policy and learning algorithms of the recommender agent but seldom care about the top-aware issue , i.e., the performance on the top positions is not satisfying, which is crucial for real applications. To address the drawback, we propose a Supervised deep Reinforcement learning Recommendation framework named as SRR. Within this framework, we utilize a supervised learning (SL) model to partially guide the learning of recommendation policy, where the supervision signal and RL signal are jointly employed and updated in a complementary fashion. We empirically find that suitable weak supervision helps to balance the immediate reward and the long-term reward, which nicely addresses the top-aware issue in RL based recommendation. Moreover, we perform a further investigation on how different supervision signals impact on recommendation policy. Extensive experiments are carried out on two real-world datasets under both the offline and simulated online evaluation settings, and the results demonstrate that the proposed methods indeed resolve the top-aware issue without much performance sacrifice in the long-run, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {In the modern manufacturing industry, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the machining tools plays a significant role in promoting machining efficiency, ensuring product quality and reducing production costs. In recent years, many data-driven prognostic approaches have been developed for machining tools, but few of them have considered the operating conditions such as spindle load and rotating speed that may have great impact on the degradation behavior and sensor signals. It may give rise to more uncertainty and lead to an obvious decrease in prediction accuracy when operating condition changes. Besides, feature extraction from the raw signals that are nonstationary, nonlinear, and mixed with abundant noise is essential but quite challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel prognostic approach for machining tools under dynamic operating condition with varying spindle load. In the proposed approach, an adaptive variational mode decomposition (VMD) is newly developed to adaptively search the optimal parameters for processing the raw vibration data, then several components with good trendability and noise robustness are obtained for feature extraction. Furthermore, a deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention mechanism is constructed to perform RUL prediction. Numerical experiments on a real-world case study show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach in comparison with other baseline data-driven approaches.},

  abstract     = {As a comparatively complicated and compact system with fast response, accurate control precision and high load-bearing capacity, electrohydraulic actuator (EHA) is generally composed of electronic control, hydraulic power, and mechanical drive systems, and has been widely used in aircrafts, mining machines, and transportation vehicles. Although a lot of redundancy designs are used in EHA to improve its operational reliability, failures are still inevitable due to long-term operation and harsh working environments. This paper conducts an experimental investigation on EHA fault diagnosis based on numerical simulation tests and real experimental tests. Multiple source domain signals are sampled from three types of sensors with multiple channels in the EHA’s test platforms under variable control commands, thereby showing high redundancy of information. Another challenge is that the fault data sampled from an experimental test platform are more complex than that of the simulated data obtained from the AMESim simulation test platform. These characteristics may cause a huge challenge for traditional fault diagnosis methods . Recent development on deep learning has accelerated many classification tasks because of its end-to-end adaptive learning ability, while the application of deep learning in fault diagnosis of EHAs remains relatively rare. Therefore, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for EHA fault diagnosis, and comparison with several popular data-driven methods are conducted using two datasets sampled from the AMESim simulation test platform and experimental test platform. Among these classifiers, the proposed convolutional neural network is more robust, especially when handling complicated real experimental test data.},

Compared to existing observer design for nonlinear systems , the high-gain observer design only requires a modified version of the Lipschitz condition . The output feedback controller is further presented on this basis. Second, to consider the transient constraints on the tracking performance, a barrier Lyapunov function with the user-defined time-varying performance is developed. In addition, the proposed controller design is shown to be free of control direction singularity. The convergence of the learning scheme and the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals during the learning phase are discussed theoretically. Finally, two simulation examples are conducted to verify the advantage of the proposed adaptive output feedback controller design.},

Motivated by the great efficiency and popularity of deep learning algorithms for time series classification, the proposed work is mainly based on the One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN). Unlike the traditional CNN models based classification, a new Multi-Level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks (ML-WCNN) is proposed to recognize automatically various types of cardiac arrhythmias. The proposed approach incorporates the 1D-CNN model and the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to extract discriminative features from different wavelet sub-bands and from the raw ECG signal simultaneously. The extracted features by the ML-WCNN model are then merged using different fusion strategies, especially by concatenation and maximization. This improves greatly the features learning process at different scales of the ECG signal, providing better diagnosis performances. The proposed ML-WCNN framework is evaluated on the Standard Database MIT-BIH Arrhythmia considering six classes of heart Beats: Normal (N), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Right Bundle Brunch Block (RBBB), Left Bundle Brunch Block (LBBB), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC) and Paced beats (PAC). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ML-WCNN, in comparison with the state-of-the-art heart diseases diagnosis based Machine/Deep learning algorithms, with a maximum Accuracy of 99.57\% 99.57\% using the 10-fold cross validation technique.},

Even though the high-order approach is more capable of modeling the correlation, it is computationally more demanding and has scalability issues. This paper aims at exploiting the high-order label correlations locally using supervised learning classifier systems (UCS). For this purpose, the label powerset (LP) strategy is employed and a prediction aggregation is utilized that improves the prediction capability of the LP method in the presence of unseen labelsets. Exact match ratio and Hamming loss measures are considered to evaluate the rule performance and the expected fitness value of individual classification rules is investigated using both metrics. Also, a computational complexity analysis is provided for training the proposed algorithm.

  abstract     = {Accurate heart rate is vital to acquiring critical physical data of human subjects. For this reason, facial video-based heart rate estimation has recently received tremendous attention owing to its simplicity and convenience. However, its accuracy, reliability and computational complexity have yet to reach the desired standards. In this work, we have endeavored to develop a novel deep learning framework for real-time estimation of heart rates by using an RGB camera. Our approach consists of the following four steps. We begin Step 1 by detecting the face and facial landmarks in the video to identify the required facial Region of Interests (ROIs). In Step 2, we extract the sequence of the mean of the green-channeled video from the facial ROIs, and explore a three-stage sequential filtering, including illumination rectification, trend removal and signal amplification. In Step 3, the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to convert the 1D filtered signal into the corresponding 2D Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) for characterizing the frequencies over short time intervals. The 2D TFR allows the formulation of the heart rate estimation as a video-based supervised learning problem, which can be solved by exploring a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as is carried out in Step 4. Our approach is one of the pioneering work that proposes a deep learning framework with TFRs as input for solving the heart rate estimation from facial videos. In addition, we have developed a heart rate database, named the Pulse From Face (PFF), and used it along with the existing PURE (PUlse RatE) database [1] to train the CNN. The PFF database is released for research purpose with this paper. We have evaluated the proposed framework on the MAHNOB-HCI database [2] and the VIPL-HR database [3] and compared its performance with that of other contemporary approaches to demonstrate its efficacy.},

Mainly, considering the interaction of the feature between different convolution layers , we construct a residual clique block (RCB) to infer the local information, allowing the network to rectify the model parameters in RCB alternately. Besides, a multi-path dilated convolutional unit is embedded into a scale clique block (SCB) to cover more scale components. In SCB, we consider the complementary correlation of different scales, and the multi-scale features are updated alternately, which is essential for excellent feature representation. Along with the clique recursive feedback mechanism, the information flowing among RCB and SCB is thus maximized during propagation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world images have shown the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.},

In this work, we propose a generalized minimax-concave (GMC) sparse regularization, which is nonconvex, to promote sparsity to design dictionary learning model. Applying the alternate optimization scheme, we use the forward–backward splitting (FBS) algorithm to solve the sparse coding problem. As the improvement, we incorporate Nesterov’s acceleration technique and adaptive threshold scheme into the FBS algorithm to improve the convergence efficiency and performance. In the dictionary update step, we apply the difference of convex functions (DC) programming and the DC algorithm (DCA) to address the dictionary update. Two dictionary update algorithms are designed; one updates the dictionary atoms one by one, and the other one updates the dictionary atoms simultaneously.

  abstract     = {The segmentation of coronary arteries in X-ray angiograms by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is promising yet limited by the requirement of precisely annotating all pixels in a large number of training images, which is extremely labor-intensive especially for complex coronary trees. To alleviate the burden on the annotator, we propose a novel weakly supervised training framework that learns from noisy pseudo labels generated from automatic vessel enhancement, rather than accurate labels obtained by fully manual annotation. A typical self-paced learning scheme is used to make the training process robust against label noise while challenged by the systematic biases in pseudo labels, thus leading to the decreased performance of CNNs at test time. To solve this problem, we propose an annotation-refining self-paced learning framework (AR-SPL) to correct the potential errors using suggestive annotation. An elaborate model-vesselness uncertainty estimation is also proposed to enable the minimal annotation cost for suggestive annotation, based on not only the CNNs in training but also the geometric features of coronary arteries derived directly from raw data. Experiments show that our proposed framework achieves 1) comparable accuracy to fully supervised learning, which also significantly outperforms other weakly supervised learning frameworks; 2) largely reduced annotation cost, i.e., 75.18\% of annotation time is saved, and only 3.46\% of image regions are required to be annotated; and 3) an efficient intervention process, leading to superior performance with even fewer manual interactions.},

We propose an approach in which feature space is partitioned into quality layers that can then effectively compute the discriminant function. We prove that the resulting discriminant function is optimal with respect to the two quality measures mentioned, which indicates, among other things, the equivalence of these two quality measures. We also show that the associated optimal partitioning of feature space is unique, and provide a polynomial training algorithm for generating this partitioning.},

  abstract     = {The mechanisms of task-positive and task-negative activations are basic elements for exploring cognitive functions, impairment of which would trigger degenerative neurological diseases . Our research group combined the default mode network (DMN) with the working memory model, chosen as the task positive network (TPN), to carry out computational simulation under various stimulus conditions. The paper has demonstrated the following results: 1) task-positive (TPN) and task-negative networks (TNN) represented antagonistic neural activities; 2) the degree of attenuation in TNN was enhanced with increasing stimulus directions on the working memory; 3) neural activities in TNN decreased as long as that in working memory-related brain regions increase; 4) the more difficult the working memory task was, the more rapidly neural activities in TNN attenuated. Since the task-negative activation was the main characteristic of DMN, mutual inhibition between DMN and TPN was the key of the antagonism between the two networks with different properties.},

  abstract     = {Classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) data has been an important research topic in the machine learning area for many years. Recently, deep learning methods have been used in classifying ECG data and have achieved superior results than traditional methods. However, in real-world applications, two challenges existing deep learning methods cannot handle well – imbalanced data and model interpretability . In this paper, we propose an ECG classification method named Knowledge-Shot Learning ( KSL ) that can handle with the above two challenges. KSL constructs a novel neural network architecture that can be effectively trained on imbalanced ECG data. Besides, KSL can also extract interpretable feature vectors and give support cases as result explanations. Moreover, KSL can even classify unseen diseases if provided with the necessary medical knowledge. Experiments on real-world ECG data show that KSL improves 10.00\% of F 1 F1 -score on imbalanced classes, and 43.75\% of F 1 F1 -score on unseen classes, compared with the second-best baseline. KSL also provides interpretable results that are consistent with medical domain knowledge.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of manufacturing industry, machine fault diagnosis has become increasingly significant to ensure safe equipment operation and production. Consequently, multifarious approaches have been explored and developed in the past years, of which intelligent algorithms develop particularly rapidly. Convolutional neural network (CNN), as a typical representative of intelligent diagnostic models, has been extensively studied and applied in recent five years, and a large amount of literature has been published in academic journals and conference proceedings. However, there has not been a systematic review to cover these studies and make a prospect for the further research. To fill in this gap, this work attempts to review and summarize the development of the Convolutional Network based Fault Diagnosis (CNFD) approaches comprehensively. Generally, a typical CNFD framework is composed of the following steps, namely, data collection, model construction, and feature learning and decision making, thus this paper is organized by following this stream. Firstly, data collection process is described, in which several popular datasets are introduced. Then, the fundamental theory from the basic CNN to its variants is elaborated. After that, the applications of CNFD are reviewed in terms of three mainstream directions, i.e. classification, prediction and transfer diagnosis. Finally, conclusions and prospects are presented to point out the characteristics of current development, facing challenges and future trends. Last but not least, it is expected that this work would provide convenience and inspire further exploration for researchers in this field.},

Although empirical validity and efficiency of LW-JP have been reported in some works, there lacks theoretical understanding of it. This paper gives some theoretical analysis of LW-JP in the asymptotic setting, where the number of the training samples approaches infinity. Under some regularity assumptions and conditions, the asymptotic validity of LW-JP is proved in the nonlinear regression case with heteroscedastic errors. The proof is an extension of the asymptotic analysis of leave-one-out prediction intervals in linear regression with homoscedastic errors. Based on our analysis, two conformal regressors built on LW-JP are proposed and the experimental results showed that the algorithms are not only valid interval predictors, but also achieve the state-of-the-art performance of conformal regressors.},

If corroborated, it would allow us to acquire information about brain injury and potential brain amyloid deposits in a single examination, using a dual-point protocol. In this work we assess the equivalence between early 18 18 F-Florbetaben (FBB) PET and 18 18 F-FDG PET data using multivariate approaches based on machine learning . In addition, we propose several systems based on data fusion that take advantage of the additional information provided by dual-point amyloid PET examinations. The proposed systems perform an initial dimensionality reduction of the data using a partial-least-square-based algorithm and then combine early and standard PET acquisitions using two approaches: multiple kernel learning (intermediate fusion) or an ensemble of two Support Vector Machine classifiers (late fusion). The proposed approaches were evaluated and compared with other fusion techniques using data from 43 subjects with cognitive impairments . They achieved a good trade-off between sensitivity and specificity and higher accuracy rates than systems based on single-modality approaches such as standard 18 18 F-FBB PET data or 18 18 F-FDG PET neuroimages.},

This requires analytical algorithms to learn and predict this stream of information in real-time. The nature of these systems is non-static and can be explained, among other things, by the fast pace of trends. This creates an environment in which algorithms must recognize changes and adapt. Recent work shows vital research in the field, but mainly lack stable performance during model adaptation. In this work, a concept drift detection strategy followed by a prototype-based adaptation strategy is proposed. Validated through experimental results on a variety of typical non-static data, our solution provides stable and quick adjustments in times of change.},

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of learning weights to coalitions of features whose cardinality can be greater than two, with the help of set-functions. With the more particular property of submodular set-function, we propose to define a metric for continuous features based on Lovasz extension of submodular functions, and then present a dedicated metric learning approach. According to the submodular constraints, it naturally leads to a higher complexity price so that we use the ξ -additive fuzzy measure to decrease this complexity, by reducing the order of interactions that are taken into account. This approach finally gives a computationally, feasible problem. Experiments on various datasets show the effectiveness of the approach.},

Although our ultimate goal is both system identification and control , we only address the problem of identification in this paper. We propose and study a novel neural network architecture called LEAP net, for Latent Encoding of Atypical Perturbation. Our method maps system structure changes to neural net structure changes, using structural actionable variables. We demonstrate empirically that LEAP nets can be trained with a natural observational distribution, very concentrated around a “reference” operating point of the system, and yet generalize to rare (or unseen) structural changes. We validate the generalization properties of LEAP nets theoretically in particular cases. We apply our technique to power transmission grids, in which high voltage lines are disconnected and re-connected with one-another from time to time, either accidentally or willfully. We discuss extensions of our approach to actionable variables, which are continuous (instead of discrete, in the case of our application) and make connections between our problem setting, transfer learning , causal inference, and reinforcement learning .},

We propose SYMOG ( sy mmetric m ixture o f G aussian modes), which significantly decreases the complexity of DNNs through low-bit fixed-point quantization. SYMOG is a novel soft quantization method such that the learning task and the quantization are solved simultaneously. During training the weight distribution changes from an unimodal Gaussian distribution to a symmetric mixture of Gaussians, where each mean value belongs to a particular fixed-point mode. We evaluate our approach with different architectures (LeNet5, VGG7, VGG11, DenseNet) on common benchmark data sets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and we compare with state-of-the-art quantization approaches. We achieve excellent results and outperform 2-bit state-of-the-art performance with an error rate of only 5.71\% on CIFAR-10 and 27.65\% on CIFAR-100.},

  abstract     = {Weightless Neural Networks (WNNs) are Artificial Neural Networks based on RAM memory broadly explored as solution for pattern recognition applications. Memory-oriented solutions for pattern recognition are typically very simple, and can be easily implemented in hardware and software. Nonetheless, the straightforward implementation of a WNN requires a large amount of memory resources making its adoption impracticable on memory constrained systems. In this paper, we establish a foundational relationship between WNN and Bloom filters, presenting a novel unified framework which encompasses the two. In particular, we indicate that a WNN can be framed as a memory segmented Bloom filter. Leveraging such finding, we propose a new model of WNNs which utilizes Bloom filters to implement RAM nodes. Bloom filters reduce memory requirements, and allow false positives when determining if a given pattern was already seen in data. We experimentally found that for pattern recognition purposes such false positives can build robustness into the system. The experimental results show that our model using Bloom filters achieves competitive accuracy, training time and testing time, consuming up to 6 orders of magnitude less memory resources when compared against the standard Weightless Neural Network model.},

Both models were derived from Kolcz and Allinson’s n -Tuple Regression weightless neural model and obtained mean absolute error (MAE) rates of 0.09097 and 0.09173, respectively. Such results are very competitive with the state-of-the-art (0.07983), whilst being four orders of magnitude faster during the training phase. Additionally the models have been tested on three classic regression datasets, also presenting competitive performance with respect to other models often used in this type of task.},

  abstract     = {Advances in machine learning technologies have led to increasingly powerful models in particular in the context of big data. Yet, many application scenarios demand for robustly interpretable models rather than optimum model accuracy; as an example, this is the case if potential biomarkers or causal factors should be discovered based on a set of given measurements. In this contribution, we focus on feature selection paradigms, which enable us to uncover relevant factors of a given regularity based on a sparse model. We focus on the important specific setting of linear ordinal regression, i.e. data have to be ranked into one of a finite number of ordered categories by a linear projection. Unlike previous work, we consider the case that features are potentially redundant, such that no unique minimum set of relevant features exists. We aim for an identification of all strongly and all weakly relevant features as well as their type of relevance (strong or weak); we achieve this goal by determining feature relevance bounds, which correspond to the minimum and maximum feature relevance, respectively, if searched over all equivalent models. In addition, we discuss how this setting enables us to substitute some of the features, e.g. due to their semantics, and how to extend the framework of feature relevance intervals to the setting of privileged information, i.e. potentially relevant information is available for training purposes only, but cannot be used for the prediction itself.},

Our workflow meets privacy specifications of our data partner: (1) the HealthGAN is trained inside a secure environment; (2) the HealthGAN model is used outside of the secure environment by external users to generate synthetic data. This second step facilitates data handling for external users by avoiding de-identification, which may require special user training, be costly, or cause loss of data fidelity. This workflow is compared against five other baseline methods . While maintaining resemblance and utility comparable to other methods, HealthGAN provides the best privacy and footprint. We present two case studies in which our methodology was put to work in the classroom and research settings. We evaluate utility in the classroom through a data analysis challenge given to students and in research by replicating three different medical papers with synthetic data.

From the other side we have to learn from data while preserving the privacy of individual observations. We initially face this issue in the PAC-Bayes framework presenting an approach which trades off and bounds the risk and the fairness of the randomized (Gibbs) classifier. Our new approach is able to handle several different state-of-the-art fairness measures. For this purpose, we further develop the idea that the PAC-Bayes prior can be defined based on the data-generating distribution without actually knowing it. In particular, we define a prior and a posterior which give more weight to functions with good generalization and fairness properties. Furthermore, we will show that this randomized classifier possesses interesting stability properties using the algorithmic distribution stability theory. Finally, we will show that the new posterior can be exploited to define a randomized accurate and fair algorithm. Differential privacy theory will allow us to derive that the latter algorithm has interesting privacy preserving properties ensuring our threefold goal of good generalization, fairness, and privacy of the final model.},

  abstract     = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven successful for unsupervised image generation . Several works have extended GANs to image inpainting by conditioning the generation with parts of the image to be reconstructed. Despite their success, these methods have limitations in settings where only a small subset of the image pixels is known beforehand. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of conditioning GANs when very few pixel values are provided. We propose a modelling framework which results in adding an explicit cost term to the GAN objective function to enforce pixel-wise conditioning. We investigate the influence of this regularization term on the quality of the generated images and the fulfillment of the given pixel constraints. Using the recent PacGAN technique, we ensure that we keep diversity in the generated samples. Conducted experiments on FashionMNIST show that the regularization term effectively controls the trade-off between quality of the generated images and the conditioning. Experimental evaluation on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets evidences that our method achieves accurate results both visually and quantitatively in term of Fréchet Inception Distance, while still enforcing the pixel conditioning. We also evaluate our method on a texture image generation task using fully-convolutional networks. As a final contribution, we apply the method to a classical geological simulation application.},

By rejecting predictions if the uncertainty of the IVAP is too high, we obtain an algorithm that is both accurate on the original test set and resistant to adversarial examples. This robustness is observed on adversarials for the underlying model as well as adversarials that were generated by taking the IVAP into account. The method appears to offer competitive robustness compared to the state-of-the-art in adversarial defense yet it is computationally much more tractable.},

We test our approach extensively on five different datasets, comparing with two well-known baselines coming from graph literature, and two recurrent approaches, one of which holds state of the art performances. Evaluation is conducted considering quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the generated samples. Results show that our approach is able to yield novel, and unique graphs originating from very different distributions while retaining structural properties very similar to those in the training sample.

  abstract     = {Automatically generating meaningful and coherent text has many applications, such as machine translation, dialogue systems , BOT application, etc. Text generation technology has attracted more attention over the past decades. A bunch of excellent methods are proposed; however, there are still challenges to generate text rivals the real one by human, such as most machines output fixed length text, or can only generate text quite the same with the input training text. In this paper, we put forward a novel text generation system, called customizable conditional text generative adversarial network , which is capable of generating diverse text content of variable length with customizable emotion label. It is more convenient for generating actual original text with specific sensitive orientation. We propose a conditional text generative adversarial network (CTGAN), in which emotion label is adopted as an input channel to specify the output text, and variable length text generation strategy is put forward. After generating initial texts by CTGAN, to make the generated text data match the real scene, we design an automated word-level replacement strategy, which extracts the keywords (e.g. nouns) from the training texts and replaces the specific keywords in the generated texts. Finally, we design a comprehensive evaluation metric based on various text evaluations, called mixed evaluation metric. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets testify that our proposed CTGAN behaves better than other text generation methods, i.e., generated text are more real compared with the real text than other generation methods, achieving state-of-the-art generation performance.},

In this paper, based on echo state network optimized by improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (ESN-IFOA), a model is proposed to provide a five-minute forecast of traffic volume. In IFOA, parallel searching strategy and uniform crossover operator are applied to enhance searching range and communication between swarms. Simultaneously, the source allocation strategy is proposed to calculate the number of fruit flies generated by each swarm in the next iteration. The five main parameters of ESN are optimized by the proposed IFOA.

  abstract     = {Most software defect prediction approaches require extensive data from the project under test for training. However, for a new project, enough training data is often not available. It is therefore necessary to build a predictive model using the data from other relevant projects and then use the model to predict defects in the target project. Such direct cross-project prediction performance can still be improved, mainly due to the distribution differences between the source and target projects, as well as the uncertainty in determining which source project should be selected to train the model. In this work, we propose a collective training mechanism for defect prediction (CTDP), which includes two phases: source data expansion phase and adaptive weighting phase. CTDP makes the feature distributions of source and target projects similar to each other by transfer learning , and uses the particle swarm optimization algorithm to comprehensively consider the multiple source projects to predict the target project. The experiments on a total of 28 projects in 5 groups show that our method can improve the performance of cross-project defect prediction, achieving the sate-of-the-art results.},

However, the cooperative control of nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to DoS attack is not well understood. This paper investigates the leader-follower secure consensus for second-order MAS with nonlinear dynamics and event-triggered control strategy under DoS attacks. A novel secure controller is proposed by using event-triggered control scheme. Based on the proposed controller, the upper bounds of the length rate, frequency of DoS attack and parameters conditions of controller are obtained to ensure that the tracking errors between the follower and leader converge to zero under DoS attack. Besides, the Zeno behavior can be excluded due to the trigger interval is designed to be greater than zero. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.},

For such a problem, we first propose a online distributed stochastic (sub)gradient push-sum algorithm by utilizing distributed optimization methods and push-sum protocols. Then we analyze the regret bounds for the proposed algorithm on the cases when the cost functions are convex and strongly convex, respectively. The bound on the expected regret for convex functions grows sub-linearly with order of O ( T ) , O(T), where T is the time horizon. When the cost functions are strongly convex with Lipschitz gradients, the regret bound has an improved rate with order of O ( ln T ) O(lnT) .

It is commonly unsatisfactory to directly employ the SOD approaches designed for nature scene images (NSIs) to RSIs . In this paper, we propose a novel Parallel Down-up Fusion network (PDF-Net) for SOD in optical RSIs, which takes full advantage of the in-path low- and high-level features and cross-path multi-resolution features to distinguish diversely scaled salient objects and suppress the cluttered backgrounds. To be specific, keeping a key observation that the salient objects still are salient no matter the resolutions of images are in mind, the PDF-Net takes successive down-sampling to form five parallel paths and perceive scaled salient objects that are commonly existed in optical RSIs. Meanwhile, we adopt the dense connections to take advantage of both low- and high-level information in the same path and build up the relations of cross paths, which explicitly yield strong feature representations. At last, we fuse the multiple-resolution features in parallel paths to combine the benefits of the features with different resolutions, i.e. , the high-resolution feature consisting of complete structure and clear details while the low-resolution features highlighting the scaled salient objects. Extensive experiments on the ORSSD dataset demonstrate that the proposed network is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {Neural network learning is usually time-consuming since backpropagation needs to compute full gradients and backpropagate them across multiple layers. Despite its success of existing works in accelerating propagation through sparseness, the relevant theoretical characteristics remain under-researched and empirical studies found that they suffer from the loss of information contained in unpropagated gradients. To tackle these problems, this paper presents a unified sparse backpropagation framework and provides a detailed analysis of its theoretical characteristics. Analysis reveals that when applied to a multilayer perceptron , our framework essentially performs gradient descent using an estimated gradient similar enough to the true gradient, resulting in convergence in probability under certain conditions. Furthermore, a simple yet effective algorithm named m emorized s parse b ack p ropagation (MSBP) is proposed to remedy the problem of information loss by storing unpropagated gradients in memory for learning in the next steps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSBP is effective to alleviate the information loss in traditional sparse backpropagation while achieving comparable acceleration.},

  abstract     = {In the past few decades, numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of diet modification in preventing and controlling different chronic diseases, bringing increased attention to the creation of nutritional recipes. Currently, the development of recipes is primarily based on personal experience rather than nutritional specifications. To this end, this paper first uses kernel canonical correlation analysis to demonstrate the relationship between nutrients in food and recipes. Based on this relationship, a new recipe expression method is put forward, which objectively reflects differing importance of an ingredient in differing recipes. Then, recipes are composed using an auto-encoder in deep learning , and a fusion model of two auto-encoders is proposed for better concocting recipes. This paper uses two machine learning methods, namely, non-negative matrix factorization and two-step regularized least squares , to form recipes. To tackle overfitting and instability in non-negative matrix factorization during the training of recipe model, we introduce the Frobenius norm to redefine the objective function and add non-smooth sparse matrices. Similar food has similar taste , but their nutrients might differ. This paper also considers nutrients as a kernel matrix of the two-step regularized least squares , which can effectively avoid the occurrence of different food combinations with similar taste . Experimental results show that developing recipes based on nutrients in food is feasible and effective in the context of machine learning .},

The present study proposed and implemented an EEG-based personality assessment method for quantitative evaluation of people&#39;s Big Five personality. EEG data were collected from 66 participants, while they watched a total number of 28 video clips covering 9 typical emotion categories of amusement, joy, inspiration, tenderness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness and neutral. Regression analyses were performed to predict the participants&#39; Big Five personality trait scores using the EEG responses to these emotional video clips. A nested leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was employed with a sparse feature selection strategy to evaluate the out-of-sample personality assessment performance. The established EEG-based regression models could effectively predict the participants&#39; self-reported personality trait scores. The prediction accuracies, measured as the correlations between the EEG-predicted personality trait scores and the self-reported scores, were 0.71, 0.72, 0.86, 0.71, and 0.82 for agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism , openness and extraversion, respectively. A series of tests from both the internal and external validity perspective further showed that a good reliability of the obtained results. These results suggest the proposed method as a promising alternative to conventional personality questionnaires.},

However, theoretical foundations for understanding the approximation ability of RBMs are lacking. In this paper, we study the representational power of RBMs, with the focus lying on the sufficient number of hidden units of RBMs required to compute some classes of distributions of interest, with a fixed number of inputs. First, it is constructively shown how RBMs can approximate any distribution that depends on the scalar projection of the inputs onto a given vector up to arbitrary accuracy. Then, for any given distribution, we explore how it can be represented as the form that depends on the scalar projection of the inputs onto some vectors, and then study the properties of these vectors, from which a new proof for the universal approximation theorem of RBMs is deduced. Finally, we investigate the representational efficiency of RBMs by providing a description of all the distributions that can be efficiently computed by RBMs. More specifically, it is shown that a distribution can be computed by a polynomial-size RBM with polynomially bounded parameters, if and only if its mass can be computed by a two-layer feedforward network with threshold/ReLU activation functions, whose size and parameters are polynomially bounded.},

The HFICNN model can convert the same feature individuals with different labels to different feature individuals with different labels by constructing an integration method. Our method recognizes the actual environment and operational complexity, and converts the unique occurrence time feature performance as a new feature for feature recognition. HFICNN integrates time-dependent records into a new record to identify a feature, and converts the integrated records to the original label. The integration process plays a good role and effect in the entire process. HFICNN is realized with the aid of function mapping label redefinition (FMLR), adaptive feature integration convolutional neurons (AFICNs), fuzzy classification (FC), and inverse function mapping integrated reduction (IFMIR).

Several existing methods have determined anomaly as a deviation from scene normalcy learned via separate training with/without labeled information. However, owing to rare and sparse nature of anomalous events, any such learning can be misleading as there exist no hardcore segregation between anomalous and non-anomalous events. To address such challenge, we propose an adaptive training-less system capable of detecting anomaly on-the-fly. Our solution pipeline consists of three major components, namely, adaptive 3D-DCT model for multi-object detection-based association, local motion descriptor generation through an improved saliency guided optical flow, and anomaly detection based on Earth mover’s distance (EMD). The proposed model, despite being training-free, is found to achieve comparable performance with several state-of-the-art methods on publicly available UCSD, UMN, CUHK-Avenue and ShanghaiTech datasets.},

  abstract     = {One of the most studied problems in machine learning is finding reasonable constraints that guarantee the generalization of a learning algorithm. These constraints are usually expressed as some simplicity assumptions on the target. For instance, in the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) theory the space of possible hypotheses is considered to have a limited VC dimension One way to formulate the simplicity assumption is via information theoretic concepts. In this paper, the constraint on the entropy H ( X ) H(X) of the input variable X is studied as a simplicity assumption. It is proven that the sample complexity to achieve an ∊ ∊ ∊ - δ δ Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) hypothesis is bounded by ∊ ∊ 2 cH ( X ) / ∊ + log 1 δ a ∊ 2 2cH(X)/∊+log1δa∊2 which is sharp up to the ∊ 1 ∊ 2 1∊2 factor ( a and c are constants). Moreover, it is shown that if a feature learning process is employed to learn the compressed representation from the dataset, this bound no longer exists. These findings have important implications on the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory which had been utilized to explain the generalization power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), but its applicability for this purpose is currently under debate by researchers. In particular, this is a rigorous proof for the previous heuristic that compressed representations are exponentially easier to be learned. However, our analysis pinpoints two factors preventing the IB, in its current form, to be applicable in studying neural networks. Firstly, the exponential dependence of sample complexity on ∊ 1 / ∊ 1/∊ ., which can lead to a dramatic effect on the bounds in practical applications when ∊ ∊ ∊ is small. Secondly, our analysis reveals that arguments based on input compression are inherently insufficient to explain generalization of methods like DNNs in which the features are also learned using available data.},

It can realize photo-realistic image super-resolution (SR) and semi-supervised pattern recognition simultaneously. We consider our pipeline as a four-player optimization-based formulation, which consists of four vital components, i.e., a refiner for image SR and generation, a discriminator for identifying high-resolution (HR) samples and another for identifying true (original) samples, a classifier for label prediction. The refiner and two discriminators characterize the conditional distributions between images and labels, whilst the classifier solely focuses on predicting real image-label pairs. We select those high-quality super-solved images with ground-truth labels for data supplement. We customize the global optimization objective function as well as the training procedure to ensure model approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables given true data in a semi-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that Q-GAN can simultaneously (1) deliver the promising categorization performance among state-of-the-arts, i.e., validation accuracy achieves 92.18\% and testing accuracy achieves 90.63\%, and (2) recover fine-grained textures with high peak signal-to-noise ratios (PNSRs) and structural similarities (SSIMs) from heavily downsampled testing images of hand-crafted dataset and public benchmarks.},

To address this problem, in this paper, we use the improved density peak clustering (DPC) to obtain the number of centers as the pre-assigned parameter for nonnegative matrix factorization. The proposed algorithm first calculates the modified PageRank of nodes as the density indexes and then draws a decision graph to obtain the hubs of the network.

In contrast with traditional formation and containment cases studied in most of the existing literature, apart from accomplishing the expected time-varying formation, the real leaders are required to track the trajectory generated by the virtual leader, and the followers need to get into the convex envelope spanned by the real leaders in finite time. The method for solving the finite-time formation-containment tracking problems is divided into the following steps. First, distributed finite-time observers are designed for each real leader and follower, in order to obtain the estimated states of their neighbor agents. Then, formation-containment tracking protocols are presented by using the neighboring information for both real leaders and followers. Furthermore, based on Lyapunov theory , it is proved that the given formation-containment tracking can be realized in finite time by the multi-agent system under the designed protocols.

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) enables subjects to communicate with the outside world or control equipment using brain signals without passing through muscles and nerves. Many researchers in recent years have studied the non-invasive BCI systems. However, the efficiency of the intention decoding algorithm is affected by the random non-stationary and low signal-to-noise ratio characteristics of the EEG signal. Furthermore, channel selection is another important issue in BCI systems intention recognition. During intention recognition in BCI systems, the unnecessary information produced by redundant electrodes affects the decoding rate and deplete system resources. In this paper, we introduce a recurrent-convolution neural network model for intention recognition by learning decomposed spatio-temporal representations. We apply the novel Gradient-Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) visualization technology to the channel selection. Grad-CAM uses the gradient of any classification, flowing into the last convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map. Since the pixels of the localization map correspond to the spatial regions where the electrodes are placed, we select the channels that are more important for decision-making. We conduct an experiment using the public motor imagery EEG dataset EEGMMIDB. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an accuracy of 97.36\% at the full channel, outperforming many state-of-the-art models and baseline models . Although the decoding rate of our model is the same as the best model compared, our model has fewer parameters with faster training time. After the channel selection, our model maintains the intention decoding performance of 92.31\% while reducing the number of channels by nearly half and saving system resources. Our method achieves an optimal trade-off between performance and the number of electrode channels for EEG intention decoding.},

  abstract     = {Hyperparameter optimization is a challenging process that has the potential to improve machine learning algorithms. Since it creates a remarkable computational burden for machine learning tasks, there have been few works coping with tuning strategies of a specific algorithm. In this paper, an improved Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) based on Fisher Maximization is developed for tuning hyperparameters of an Echo State Network (ESN) which has a wide range of applications. The results of the method are then compared with those of traditional Gradient Descent and Grid Search. According to the obtained results; 1) The scale of the data sets greatly affects the reliability of hyperparameter optimization results; 2) Feature selection is critical in terms of mean error of training when hyperparameter optimization is applied on some methods such as ESN; 3) SGD falls in a good local minima if Fisher Maximization is performed to find a good starting point .},

In this work, we present a high-accuracy pole number recognition framework including a high-performance cascaded CNN-based Detection and Recognition YOLO (DR-YOLO) and a temporal redundancy approach. First, the DR-YOLO utilizes global features for coarse plate detection and local features for accurate number recognition. Next, context-based combination of adjacent frames utilizes the complementarity and consistency of the same pole number recognition results and generates a unique result. The context-based amendment of adjacent poles utilizes the continuity of adjacent poles and corrects the fault or partial missing results caused by blur or occlusions. Extensive experimental testing is performed on 4 datasets representing high-speed train routine working environments.

However, external disturbances are unavoidable in practical solution process of ZNN for the kinematical resolution of redundant manipulators. In this paper, by proposing a robust ZNN (RZNN) model for real-time kinematical resolution, redundant manipulators are capable of achieving path-tracking tasks with high accuracy, even in a noise-disturbed environment. The theoretical analyses about robustness and finite-time convergence are provided to guarantee the superior property of the RZNN model. A numerical example abstracted from the nonlinear mapping of redundant manipulators is first given to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the RZNN model under various external disturbances, by comparing existing two ZNN models. Then, two multi-link robot manipulator-tracking examples are presented to show the applicability of the RZNN model in a noise-disturbed environment, while the existing ZNN model is no longer effective in the same condition.

  abstract     = {Session-based recommendation is to predict the next action of a user based on his current behavior session. Recent studies have focused on designing recurrent neural networks to capture representation of users sequential behaviors from a large number of anonymous sessions. Although these neural models have greatly improved recommendation performance compared with traditional approaches, they have overemphasized the sequential information of sessions, that is, the order of items in each browsing session . We argue that besides the order of items, the set of items in each session can also reflect the general interests of current session and can also be exploited to augment recommendations. To this end, this paper proposes a joint neural model, called SGINM, for jointly learning sequential and general interests of each session for session-based recommendation. In SGINM, we design an attentive recurrent neural network which not only captures self-adaptive weighed representation of each subsequence in a session but also learns a global representation for the whole session. Furthermore, the SGINM adopts a multi-layer neural network with residual connections to learn the general interests of each session. The SGINM uses a softmax layer to jointly decode the two types of interests and output a ranking vector of recommended items for each new session. The proposed model has been extensively experimented with the benchmark datasets from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and CIKM Cup 2016. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the proposed SGINM achieves better recommendation performance in terms of higher predicative accuracy and mean reciprocal rank in almost all experiment cases.},

  abstract     = {Occluded offline handwritten Chinese characters inpainting is a critical step for handwritten Chinese characters recognition. We propose to apply generative adversarial network and self-attention mechanism to inpaint occluded offline handwritten Chinese characters. First, cyclic loss is used to guarantee the cyclic consistency of the uncorrupted area between corrupted images and original real images instead of masks. Second, self-attention mechanism is combined with generative adversarial network to increase receptive field and explore more Chinese character features. Then an improved character-VGG-19 that is pre-trained with handwritten Chinese character dataset is used to calculate content loss to extract character features more effectively and assist generator to generate realistic characters. Finally, adversarial classification loss is used to make our discriminator classify input images instead of just distinguishing real images from fake images in order to learn the distribution of Chinese characters more effectively. The proposed method is evaluated on an occluded CASIA-HWDB1.1 dataset for three challenging inpainting tasks with different portions of blocks, or pixels randomly missing, or pixels randomly adding. Experimental results show that our method is more effective, compared with several state-of-the-art handwritten Chinese character inpainting methods.},

Because of the complexity difference between two domains, the complexity inequality in bidirectional translations is significant. We analyzed and witnessed the limitation of the original CycleGAN in asymmetric translation tasks and proposed an Asymmetric CycleGAN model with generators of unequal sizes to adapt to the asymmetric need in asymmetric translations. An empirical metric was also given to determine the asymmetric task from the aspect of image entropy and could be treated as the auxiliary guidance to design the asymmetric generators. Besides, the edge-retain loss between the input and the generated images was introduced to enhance the structural visual quality. Residual-block-net based and U-net based generators were both applied here to verify the Asymmetric CycleGAN. The performance of different depth of generators for Asymmetric CycleGAN was also discussed on the basis of experiments.

Most pioneering studies either learn from only a single teacher in their distillation learning methods, neglecting the potential that a student can learn from multiple teachers simultaneously, or simply treat each teacher to be equally important, unable to reveal the different importance of teachers for specific examples. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adaptive multi-teacher multi-level knowledge distillation learning framework (AMTML-KD), which consists two novel insights: (i) associating each teacher with a latent representation to adaptively learn instance-level teacher importance weights which are leveraged for acquiring integrated soft-targets (high-level knowledge) and (ii) enabling the intermediate-level hints (intermediate-level knowledge) to be gathered from multiple teachers by the proposed multi-group hint strategy. As such, a student model can learn multi-level knowledge from multiple teachers through AMTML-KD. Extensive results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the proposed learning framework ensures student to achieve improved performance than strong competitors.},

  abstract     = {Course recommendation systems are applied to help students with different needs select courses in a large range of course resources. However, a student’s needs are not always determined by their personal interests, they are also influenced by teachers, peers etc. Unlike online courses, user behavior and user satisfaction of offline courses often have serious sparse and cold start issues, which cause overfitting problems in previous neural network and matrix factorization (MF) models. Additionally, the interpersonal relations, evaluation text and existing “user-item” formatted rating matrix constitute a multi-source and multi-modal data structure , so a systematic data fusion method is needed to establish recommendations based on these heterogeneous characteristics. Therefore, a hybrid recommendation model by fusing network structured feature with graph neural networks and user interactive activities with tensor factorization was proposed in this paper. First, a graph structured teaching evaluation network is proposed to describe students, courses, and other entities by using the students’ rating, commentary text, grading and interpersonal relations. Then, a random walk based neural network is employed to generate the vectorized representation of students by learning their own relational structure . Finally, by recognizing these personalization features as the third dimension of the rating tensor, a Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization-based tensor factorization is applied to learn and predict students’ ratings for classes they have not taken. Experiments on a real-world evaluation of teaching system including 532 participants with 7,453 rating records show that the proposed method outperforms other existing neural network and matrix factorization models including xSVD++, RTTF and DSE with a smaller predictive error as well as better recommendation accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a cooperative-competitive multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy system called E2PAMEA is presented for the extraction of emerging patterns in big data environments . E2PAMEA follows an adaptive schema to automatically employ different genetic operators according to the learning needs, which avoid the tuning of some parameters. It also employs a token-competition-based procedure for updating an elite population where the best set of patterns found so far is stored. In addition, a novel MapReduce procedure for an efficient computation of the evaluation function employed for guiding the search process is proposed. The method, called Bit-LUT employs a pre-evaluation stage where data is represented as a look-up table made of bit sets. This look-up table can be employed later in the chromosome evaluation by means of bitwise operations, reducing the computational complexity of the process. The experimental study carried out shows that E2PAMEA is a promising alternative for the extraction of high-quality emerging patterns in big data. In addition, the proposed Bit-LUT evaluation shows a significant improvement on efficiency with a great scalability capacity on both dimensions of data, which enables the processing of massive datasets faster than other alternatives.},

  abstract     = {Although person re-identification (ReID) has been intensively studied over the past few years, the shortage of annotated training data stands as an obstacle for further performance improvement. To address this issue, many data augmentation methods have been successfully applied to person ReID , such as random scaling, flipping and cropping, which mainly operate on a single image, whilst overlooking the relationship between images. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely used for data augmentation and smoothly migrated to person ReID . However, the cost of training GAN is expensive and the performance improvement is often limited. Moreover, all these methods focus on augmenting samples for existing IDs. This paper proposes a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy based on self-supervised learning to handle these problems, which consists of the offline ID augmentation that can generate new categories and the online instance augmentation. These two components are integrated i nto a unified framework for boosting the ReID performance. Furthermore, a novel Siamese-like network is developed for ReID in conjunction with the proposed data augmentation method. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a clear margin, which verifies the robustness and the effectiveness of our method.

A rotor Hopfield neural network (RHNN) is an extension of CHNN and the weights are represented by matrices. It provides excellent noise tolerance by resolving the rotational invariance. However, an RHNN needs double weight parameters of a CHNN, unlike an HHNN. In this work, we propose a diagonal RHNN (DRHNN), which restricts the weights of RHNN to diagonal matrices and reduces the number of weight parameters. The number of weight parameters in a DRHNN, an HHNN, and a CHNN is same. In addition, a DRHNN resolves the rotational invariance and provides excellent noise tolerance like an RHNN.},

  abstract     = {Fast assessment of damaged buildings is important for post-disaster rescue operations. Building damage detection leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques has become a popular research focus in recent years. Although supervised learning approaches have made considerable improvement for damaged building assessment, rapidly deploying supervised classification is still difficult due to the complexity in obtaining a large number of labeled samples in the aftermath of disasters. We propose an unsupervised self-attention domain adaptation (USADA) model, which transforms instances of the source domain to those of the target domain in pixel space, to address the aforementioned issue. The proposed USADA consists of three parts: a set of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a classifier, and a self-attention module. The GAN adapts source domain images to ensure their similarity to target domain images. Once adapted, the classifier can be trained using the adapted images along with the original images of the source domain to classify damaged buildings. The self-attention module is introduced to maintain the foreground of the generated images conditioned on source domain images for generating plausible samples. As a case study, aerial images of Hurricane Sandy, Maria, and Irma, are used as the source and target domain datasets in our experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that classification accuracies of 68.1\% and 84.1\% are achieved, and our method obtains improvements of 2.0\% and 3.6\% against pixel-level domain adaptation, which is the basis of our model.},

To overcome these challenges, a novel keyphrase generation model named Hierarchical CopyNet with graph attention networks (HCopy-GAT) is proposed. Firstly, the Hierarchical Recurrent Encode-Decoder neural network (HRED) is employed to learn the expressive embeddings of keyphrases in both word-level and phrase-level. Secondly, the graph attention neural networks (GAT) is applied to model the correlation among different keyphrases. Furthermore, we developed a new dataset named SOFTWARE, which can be taken as a new testbed for keyword generation tasks.

To this end, this work proposes an identity-sensitive loss guided and instance feature boosted pipeline to extract deep discriminative feature embedding for person search. First, a prior anchor pre-trained network (PAPN) is designed to obtain proper initial state for the whole deep person search training baseline. Second, a new loss function called instance enhancing loss (IEL) is proposed to learn identity-sensitive features by introducing unlabeled identity information. Specifically, the proposed IEL can selectively utilize unlabeled identities with similar appearances to labeled identities to train the person search network. Third, considering the intra-class compactness of features learned by center loss and contextual inter-class relations, two instance boosting strategies (Boosting) are used to learn more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely CUHK-SYSU and PRW, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this paper, we propose to use transfer learning and two types of prior knowledge to construct a hybrid neural network structure for de-speckling. Firstly, based on a given US image model, the speckle noise is similar to Gaussian distribution in the logarithmic transformation domain , called Gaussian prior knowledge. The distribution parameters are estimated in the logarithmic transformation domain based on four typical traditional US image de-speckling methods with maximum likelihood estimation. Secondly, depending on the prior parameters, a transferable denoising network is trained with clean natural image dataset. Finally, a VGGNet is used to extract the structure boundaries before and after US image de-speckling based on the transfer network, and we call it structural prior knowledge. The structural boundaries of a US image should be unchanged after the de-speckling, and hence we use this constraint to fine-tune the transfer network. The proposed de-speckling framework is verified on artificially generated phantom (AGP) images and real US images, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The study proposes a hybrid HLO-PSO algorithm, which utilizes various combinations of the proposed improved PSO and proposed scheduling strategies to solve FJSP under the algorithm architecture of HLO. With the guidance of HLO, the individual learning ability of every particle is further promoted based on the existed advantage of collective action decision of PSO; and with the help of rule-based scheduling strategies, the search capacity of the proposed improved PSO is also further enhanced. By the detailed exposition and analysis, the proposed HLO-PSO is easily implemented and embedded in other production system software or learning system software.

However, due to the modality gap between multi-style images, standard model of person re-identification cannot achieve satisfactory performance when directly applied to match the virtual images with the real photographs. To address this problem, we propose a modality invariant adversarial mechanism (MIAM) to remove the modality gap between multi-style images. Specifically, the MIAN consists of two parts: a space transformation module to transfer the multi-style person images to a modality-invariant space, and an adversarial learning module “played” between the category classifier and modality classifier to steer the representation learning . The modality classifier discriminates between the real and virtual images while the category classifier predicts the identities of the input transformed images. We explore the space transformation for data augmentation to further bridge the modality gap and facilitate the performance. Furthermore, we build two new datasets for the multi-style Re-ID to evaluate the performance.

  abstract     = {Crowd anomaly detection has been a research hotspot in the field of video surveillance in recent years. In most existing methods, the accuracy of anomaly detection dominantly relies on the acquisition of regions of interest (ROI) and feature extraction. However, the randomness of ROI segmentation and crowd group selection usually cannot guarantee a robust performance and thus may lead to false detection sometimes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a scene perception-based approach combining the fluid forces expression and psychological theory. The proposed method firstly introduces a flow field Visualization technology called line integral convolution to segment the moving pedestrians in the scene. Then, a scene perception-guided clustering strategy is proposed to cluster the consistency crowd group. Scene perception strategy is in line with the psychological criteria of human cognition . In clustering, it makes more reasonable use of various attributes of the pedestrians. To ensure a robust detection of the pedestrian group, we propose a fluid feature concept which considers both mass force and surface force. For each consistency group, two types of features including the image appearance feature and fluid feature are combined to describe pedestrian motion. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in comparison with some existing methods in terms of both frame-level and pixel-level measurements.},

Since the traditional hand-crafted feature based methods usually are not robust enough to handle various complex scenarios, the study of blur detection problem remains to be a challenging task in terms of the accuracy and effectiveness of blur separation. In this paper, instead of seeking a new hand-crafted feature often seen in common approaches, we present a new deep feature-learning method by using feature pyramid network via recurrent Distinction Enhanced Block modules to solve the blur detection problem. We show that the newly introduced Distinction Enhanced Block is able to merge the high-level semantic information with the low-level details effectively, while at the same time, it is capable to keep a desirable identification between the blurry and clear regions. We also develop a new boundary penalty term to refine the boundaries of our results, which leads to more accurate detection and segmentation, compared with current available results in literature. Furthermore, due to the lacking of public datasets for blur detection problems, we have established a new blur detection dataset which may enrich the experimental benchmarks for testing. In terms of efficiency associated with the competitive performance, in particular, our model is shown to have best-in-class evaluation speed, about 0.14 s to evaluate an input image in regular personal laptop. The performance evaluations on both CUHK dataset and our SZU-BD dataset validate that the proposed model outperforms various existing state-of-the-arts methods through commonly used metric indexes.},

In robot control, equipping all the speed sensors not only increases the cost of the system but also risks losing accuracy and reliability. In this paper, it is assumed that the velocities of the nonholonomic mobile robots in this paper are unknown, they are estimated according to the output of the systems by an adaptive observer via a neural network . The designed dynamic surface based on nonlinear transformation errors can achieve the above three control objectives at the same time, avoiding the situation of using multiple potential functions to solve such problems, which will lead to conflicts in the selection of the design parameters. Compared with the existing references about formation tracking to maintain connectivity and avoid collisions, the main contribution of this paper is to design an observer of robot speed estimation and use only a neural network to estimate the unknown nonlinear term of the system itself. The unknown nonlinearity produced in the process of controller design does not need an additional neural network. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation examples.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural P systems with polarizations (PSN P systems) are a class of neural-inspired computation models, where the firing condition of rules is the neuron-associated polarization. It has previously been shown that PSN P systems are Turing universal by using tree types of polarizations, and 164 neurons are needed for constructing a Turing universal PSN P system as a function computing device. In this work, in order to answer the open problem whether this determination mechanism of polarizations can be simplified without the loss of computation power, one more type of object for information encoding, i.e., the anti-spike, is introduced into PSN P systems, thus, PSN P systems with anti-spikes are proposed, abbreviated as PASN P systems. It is proved that two types of polarizations are enough to guarantee the Turing universality of PASN P systems both as number generators and number acceptors. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that 121 neurons are sufficient for a PASN P system with two types of polarizations to achieve universality as a function computing device. These results manifest that anti-spikes are a powerful ingredient of PASN P systems to yield the improvement in computation performance and the reduction in the description complexity necessary to achieve Turing universality.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) for lithium-ion battery (LIB) plays a key role in increasing the reliability and safety of battery related industries and facilities. In this paper, RUL prediction of LIB is investigated by employing a hybrid data-driven method based support vector regression (SVR) and error compensation (EC). Firstly, two health indicators (HIs) are established by using capacity and discharging voltage difference of equal time interval (DVD), respectively. Secondly, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is adopted to preprocess the obtained HIs, which is used to reduce the influence of capacity regeneration and noise. Especially, phase space reconstruction (PSR) with C–C technique is introduced to achieve optimal input sequence selection pattern, it has an important influence on the accuracy of SVR prediction. As an important innovation of the paper, the idea of EC is implemented by combining the predictions of both forecast error and RUL prediction with PSR-SVR. Last but not least, the genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to optimize the key parameters of SVR so as to achieve more accurate RUL prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the real data set of LIBs from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is carried out, and the dominant is emphasized by comparison with other important methods.},

Existing fashion compatibility modeling techniques mainly focus on measuring the compatible preference between fashion items with Deep Neural Networks (DNN), but overlook the generative compatibility modeling. Differently, in this paper, we explore the potential of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in fashion compatibility modeling and thus propose a Multi-modal Generative Compatibility Modeling (MGCM) scheme. In particular, we introduce a multi-modal enhanced compatible template generation network, regularized by the pixel-wise consistency and template compatibility, to sketch a compatible template as the auxiliary link between fashion items. Accordingly, MGCM is able to measure the compatibility between complementary fashion items comprehensively from both item-item and item-template perspectives. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the-art methods.},

The basis of this approach is the original architecture of the neural network, as well as a new procedure for its learning. The developed neural network is called the detector neural network. This network consists of two layers of neurons. The neurons of the first layer are called neurons-pre-detectors and they do not learn. They are designed to highlight the structural elements of recognizable images, as well as to determine their measured parameters. The types of structural elements and their parameters are set a priori and depend on the type and complexity of recognizable images. Neurons of the second layer can be trained. They recognize individual complex images. These neurons are called neurons-detectors (ND). The model of the ND is significantly different from all known models of neurons and has important features: the presence of a dendritic tree model, a new looks at the role and value of synaptic coupling coefficients, an original approach to the formation of a neuron reaction. The training procedure for the ND is called counter learning. In the process of counter learning, an information model – template of the most simplified image structure of a particular class is formed and remembered by the ND. This template is called a concept. The main role in the formation of the concept is played by the model of the dendritic tree of the neuron. During the classification process, the ND tries to simplify the recognizable image until it coincides with the concept. The article provides a comparative analysis of the detector approach and the connectionist paradigm. The advantages of the detector approach, according to the authors, open up new possibilities in the study of the problem of constructing Artificial General Intelligence.},

In the clinical concept extraction task, the existing methods are not satisfactory to obtain accurate labelling results in the face of large-scale and complex clinical information. To solve this problem, we improve and optimize a named entity recognition method based on the LSTM-CRF model. First, the improved deep neural network model uses two optional configurations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) to achieve character-level representation. Then the BLSTM layer obtains the context information of the target word, and the Conditional Random Field (CRF) gives constraints to ensure the standardization of the label. On this basis, Nadam is used to optimize the training process of the network. The experimental results show that our new method has an F1 score of 84.61 on the public dataset of 2010 i2b2/VA concept extraction task, which exceeds the LSTM-CRF model.

A new model based on gate recurrent unit (GRU) neural network and attention mechanism was constructed in our study. A bidirectional GRU network was designed to extract key features from forward and backward well logs data along depth direction, and attention mechanism was introduced to assign different weights to each hidden layer to improve prediction accuracy. We fully consider the trend of well logs data with depth, the correlation of different log series and the actual depth accumulation effect. Compared with other four traditional intelligent models, experiments on actual reservoir dataset show that the constructed model can obtain lower error and higher fitting degree. Implementation of the proposed method can serve as an economical and reliable alternative for oil and gas industry and provides fast and effective data for further geological research combined with artificial intelligence .},

To alleviate this problem, attention mechanism can be integrated into CNN, but this takes up the limited resources. In this paper, we propose to address the misfitting problem from a novel angle - pruning task-irrelevant words from the dataset. The proposed method evaluates the performance of each convolutional filter based on its discriminative power of the feature generated at the pooling layer, and prunes words captured by the poorly-performed filters. Experiment results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the CNN baseline model . Moreover, our proposed model produces performance similar to or better than the benchmark models (attention integrated CNNs) while demanding less parameters and FLOPs , and is therefore a choice model for resource limited scenarios, such as mobile applications.},

To better meet the needs of some practical projects, the problem of synchronization investigated in this paper is defined in finite time and fixed time; namely, by designing a suitable controller, the synchronization error system can converge to zero in a finite/fixed time. Additionally, by combining Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional theory and algebraic inequality methods, a novel criterion of finite/fixed-time synchronization for proposed drive and response systems is derived. Note that the finite-time and fixed-time synchronization criteria are integrated into a unified theorem. Finally, two examples are provided, one is a simple numerical example to account for the feasibility of main results, the other realizes the application of this paper in establishing a spatiotemporal chaotic cryptosystem for image encryption , and the proposed cryptosystem has been illustrated that it has obvious advantages of large key space and high security by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Multi-scale feature fusion has been proven effective in substantial person re-identification (ReID) works. However, the existing multi-scale feature fusion is based on features of different semantic levels. We propose a novel multi-scale and multi-branch feature representation for person ReID, namely Ms-Mb. It merges the features of the same semantic level and integrates attention modules to learn robust and representative feature representations. Through the heterogeneous losses supervision, the final feature representation of the image is more discriminative for person ReID. Sufficient ablation study has proven that the multi-scale feature fusion, the attention module and heterogeneous losses training strategy contribute to the performance boost of Ms-Mb. We have conducted experiments on four mainstream benchmarks including Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03 and MSMT17. Extensive experimental results show that our approach Ms-Mb achieves state-of-the-art performances on Market1501 (Rank-1 = 95.8\% 95.8\% , mAP = 89.9\% 89.9\% ), DukeMTMC-reID (Rank-1 = 90.8\% 90.8\% , mAP = 82.2\% 82.2\% ) and MSMT17 (Rank-1 = 81.9\% 81.9\% , mAP = 59.3\% 59.3\% ) without using additional external data or re-ranking.

This not only makes use of the vision self-attention mechanism and objects salience model to analyze the global information and detailed features of objects, but also designs cross-correlation self-attention module so as to make a balance between the computation efficiency and computational on the one hand and the statistical efficiency and the ability to simulate remote dependencies on the other hand. Based on convolutional long-term and short-term memory network, this paper optimizes the attention feature map so as to highlight the features of objects themselves and improve their generative abilities. Meanwhile, a cooperative learning mechanism between generators is designed, which combines self-constructed generation model and pre-training generation model to form a generation model group. It not only improves effectively the generation ability of the model, improve the computing efficiency, but also restrains the collapse of the model from another angle. In fact, the model proposed here has completed numerical experiments on multiple common standard datasets and self-configuring datasets, and has made comparisons with several mainstream generation antagonistic network models in terms of the performance of image data augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the model has excellent simulation ability to enable itself to effectively realize the augmentation of data, thus making it highly applicable in the future.},

Most existing methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have achieved promising performance for skeleton-based action recognition. However, these approaches are limited in the ability to explore the rich spatial–temporal relational information. In this paper, we propose a new spatial–temporal model with an end-to-end bidirectional LSTM-CNN (BiLSTM-CNN). First, a hierarchical spatial–temporal dependent relational model is used to explore rich spatial–temporal information in the skeleton data. Then a new framework is proposed to fuse CNN and LSTM. In this framework, the skeleton data are built by the dependent relational model and serve as the input of the proposed network. Then LSTM is used to extract the temporal features, and followed by a standard CNN to explore the spatial information from the output of LSTM. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on the NTU RGB+D, SBU Interaction and UTD-MHAD dataset.},

Compared with the previous methods, this paper presents a novel semi-supervised NMF learning framework, called progressive transduction NMF (PTNMF), that learns a robustly discriminative representation by introducing a progressive transduction structure. Specifically, a progressive transduction based scheme is employed to gradually update the representations of unlabeled points according to the similarity between the labeled and unlabeled data points. This is helpful to improve the effectiveness of NMF, especially for the case that labeled data is inadequate. The efficiency of the proposed method is discussed both theoretically and empirically.

With no need to convert input images to sequence representations, we directly connect two-dimensional CNN features to an attention-based sequence decoder which guided by holistic representation. The holistic representation can guide the attention-based decoder focus on more accurate area. As no recurrent module is adopted, our model can be trained in parallel. It achieves 1.5 × to 9.4 × acceleration to backward pass and 1.3 × to 7.9 × acceleration to forward pass, compared with the RNN counterparts.

However, the use of representation learning in the training process of feature fusion has rarely been explored. This study addresses the issue through a new supervised subnetwork-based feature encoding and pattern classification model , termed a wide hierarchical subnetwork-based neural network (Wi-HSNN). In particular, Wi-HSNN is a subnet-based iterative training process in which one pair of subnets is added to the framework in each iteration. Furthermore, instead of learning the optimal representations with the whole dataset, this paper introduces a batch-by-batch parallel scheme of Wi-HSNN to process large-scale datasets, such as Place365 set with more than 1.8 million samples. Extensive evaluations on eight benchmark datasets from food classification to scene image recognition demonstrated that the proposed solution has better representation learning capacity compared to existing encoding methods, and achieves stronger performance than existing approaches for food image classification tasks.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays people join multiple social networks simultaneously to enjoy a variety of social services. Apart from common users, social networks also share other information entities such as organizations/companies. Aligning common information entities across heterogeneous social networks is challenging, but will facilitate many applications. Existing approaches for network alignment do not fully leverage indirect relations among users (i.e., friends of friends). This leads to relatively poor performance, especially when there are little overlapping social relations between different networks. Meanwhile, the mutual promotion between two kinds of information entity alignment is often neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel Matrix Factorization based Representation learning ( MFRep ) framework. MFRep investigates the joint learning for user and employer alignment across different networks. (1). We first compute the cross-network similarities in user attributes to extract seed potential anchor users. Its efficiency can be boosted by considering the similarities in employer properties. (2). Considering social relation differences across networks, we construct user relational matrix to preserve multi-step relational information. This embodies the information propagation from known and seed potential anchor users to other potential anchor users. (3). We extend the user relational matrix to preserve consistent associations between users and employers across networks. (4). We perform semi-supervised user representation learning and unsupervised employer representation learning concurrently via efficient matrix decomposition . The correspondence between users/employers across networks can be inferred based on vector relevance. Extensive experiments on real-world social network datasets justify the utility of MFRep , even with dissimilar social structures across networks. MFRep illustrates the mutual promoted alignments of users and employers with a middle degree of scalability.},

Unlike existing models with complex strategies to keep the patch-matching constrains, our MADRL model can automatically locate the matching patches (multi-attentional subregions) in different vehicle images with the same identification (ID). Furthermore, based on the fine-grained attention and global features we re-calculate the distance between the inter- and intra- classes, and we get better re-ranking results.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a deep learning model , named InfGCN, to identify the most influential nodes in a complex network based on Graph Convolutional Networks . InfGCN takes neighbor graphs and four classic structural features as the input into a graph convolutional network for learning nodes’ representations, and then feeds the representations into the task-learning layers, comparing the ground truth derived from Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) simulation experiments with quantitative infection rate. Extensive experiments on five real-world networks of different types and sizes demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional methods, and can accurately identify influential nodes.},

  abstract     = {Effective representation of objects in irregular and unordered point clouds is one of the core challenges in 3D vision. Transforming point cloud into regular structures, such as 2D images and 3D voxels, are not ideal. It either obscures the inherent geometry information of 3D data or results in high computational complexity . Learning permutation invariance feature directly from raw 3D point clouds using deep neural network is a trend, such as PointNet and its variants, which are effective and computationally efficient. However, these methods are weak to reveal the spatial structure of 3D point clouds. Our method is delicately designed to capture both global and local spatial layout of point cloud by proposing a Local k-NNs Pattern in Omni-Direction Graph Convolution Neural Network architecture, called LKPO-GNN. Our method converts the unordered 3D point cloud into an ordered 1D sequence, to facilitate feeding the raw data into neural networks and simultaneously reducing the computational complexity . LKPO-GNN selects multi-directional k-NNs to form the local topological structure of a centroid, which describes local shapes in the point cloud. Afterwards, GNN is used to combine the local spatial structures and represent the unordered point clouds as a global graph. Experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, ScanNet, and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms most existing methods, which verifies the effectiveness and advantage of our work. Additionally, a deep analysis towards illustrating the rationality of our approach, in terms of the learned the topological structure feature, is provided.

  abstract     = {A large number and diversity of techniques have been offered in the literature in recent years for solving multi-label classification tasks , including classifier chains where predictions are cascaded to other models as additional features. Chaining methods have often providing state of the art results, and the idea of extending it to multi-output regression has already been trialed. However, these ‘regressor chains’ have seen limited applicability, on account of yielding relatively little predictive performance compared to individual regression models, and also limited interpretability . In this work we identify and discuss the main limitations of regressor chains, including an analysis of different base models, loss functions, explainability, and other desiderata of real-world applications. We develop and examine techniques to overcome these limitations. In particular we present Monte Carlo schemes in the framework of probabilistic chains. We show they can be effective, flexible and useful in different areas. Overall, we also place regressor chains in context among general multi-output learning with continuous outputs, and in doing this shed additional light on the applicability of chaining to machine learning tasks.},

  abstract     = {Human parsing , which is a task of labeling pixels in human images into different fine-grained semantic parts, has achieved significant progress during the past decade. However, there are still several challenges in human parsing, due to occlusions, varying poses and similar appearance between the left/right parts. To tackle these problems, a Human Kinematic Skeleton Graph Layer (HKSGL) is proposed to augment regular neural networks with human kinematic skeleton information. The HKSGL has two major components: kinematic skeleton graph and interconnected modular neural layer. The kinematic skeleton graph is a user pre-defined skeleton graph, which models the interconnections between different semantic parts. Then the skeleton graph is passed to the interconnected modular neural layer which is composed of a set of modular blocks corresponding to different semantic parts. The HKSGL is a lightweight, low costs layer which can be easily attached to any existing neural networks. To demonstrate the power of the HKSGL, a new dataset on human parsing in occlusions is also collected, termed the RAP-Occ. Extensive experiments have been performed on four datasets on human parsing, including the LIP, the CIHP, the ATR and the RAP-Occ. And two popular baselines, i.e., the Deeplab V3+ and the CE2P, are agumented by the proposed HKSGL. Competitive performance of the augmented models has been achieved in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Some researchers treat traffic flow as an entirety while predicting short-term traffic flow. Through analyzing real-world traffic flow, we have found that urban traffic shows a stable changing process along with random disturbs. An alternative way is to decompose traffic flow into two components: periodicity and volatility. We propose a hybrid method named Time-Series Analysis and Supervised-Learning (TSA-SL) for short-term traffic flow prediction from the perspective of traffic flow decomposition. In the method, period traffic flow is modeled with a typical TSA method called Fourier Transform (FT), where periodic behaviors are described as the combination of sines and cosines. The volatility of the current location is determined by its surroundings, so spatial–temporal correlations are extracted as input features of SL. Then, three hybrid prediction models, including FT-SVR, FT-GBRT and FT-LSTM, are built with proposed TSA-SL. In the experiment, an Electronic Registration Identification (ERI) dataset including massive real-world individual trajectories is employed. Comparing with classical baseline models , our proposed TSA-SL method has certain superiority. Furthermore, we decompose traffic flow into different components in terms of traveling purposes and vehicle types. The experimental results show that our method performs better in predicting partial traffic flow than predicting all traffic flow.},

  abstract     = {Most deep language understanding models depend only on word representations, which are mainly based on language modelling derived from a large amount of raw text. These models encode distributional knowledge without considering syntactic structural information, although several studies have shown benefits of including such information. Therefore, we propose new syntactically-informed word representations (SIWRs), which allow us to enrich the pre-trained word representations with syntactic information without training language models from scratch. To obtain SIWRs, a graph-based neural model is built on top of either static or contextualised word representations such as GloVe, ELMo and BERT. The model is first pre-trained with only a relatively modest amount of task-independent data that are automatically annotated using existing syntactic tools. SIWRs are then obtained by applying the model to downstream task data and extracting the intermediate word representations. We finally replace word representations in downstream models with SIWRs for applications. We evaluate SIWRs on three information extraction tasks, namely nested named entity recognition (NER), binary and n -ary relation extractions (REs). The results demonstrate that our SIWRs yield performance gains over the base representations in these NLP tasks with 3–9\% relative error reduction. Our SIWRs also perform better than fine-tuning BERT in binary RE. We also conduct extensive experiments to analyse the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by speech recognition, most of the recent state-of-the-art works convert scene text recognition into sequence prediction. Like most speech recognition problems, context modeling is considered as a critical component in these methods for achieving better performance. However, they usually only consider using a holistic or single-scale local sequence context, in a single dimension. Actually, scene texts or sequence contexts may span arbitrarily across a two-dimensional (2-D) space and in any style, not limited to only horizontal. Moreover, contexts of various scales may synthetically contribute to text recognition, in particular for irregular text recognition. In our method, we consider the context in a 2-D manner, and simultaneously consider context reasoning at various scales, from local to global. Based on this, we propose a new Two-Dimensional Multi-Scale Perceptive Context (TDMSPC) module, which performs multi-scale context learning, along both the horizontal and vertical directions, and then merges them. This can generate shape and layout-dependent feature maps for scene text recognition. This proposed module can be handily inserted into existing sequence-based frameworks to replace their context learning mechanism. Furthermore, a new scene text recognition network , called TDMSPC-Net, is built, by using the TDMSPC module as a building block for the encoder, and adopting an attention-based LSTM as the decoder. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the TDMSPC module can substantially boost the performance of existing sequence-based scene text recognizers, irrespective of the decoder or backbone network being used. The proposed TDMSPC-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all the benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are unavoidably degraded by mixed noise, including Gaussian noise and sparse noise. In this paper, we consider a constrained tubal rank and sparsity model (CTSD) to tackle the HSIs mixed noise removal, which characterizes the clean HSIs via the low-tubal-rank constraint and the sparse noise via the l 0 l0 and l ∞ l∞ norm constraints, respectively. Due to the strong non-convexity, the CTSD model is challenging to solve. To tackle the CTSD, we develop the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm via the exact tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) and establish the global convergence under mild assumptions. Since the t-SVD is computationally expensive, especially for large scale images, we further design an efficient inexact PAM algorithm via an inexact t-SVD. The inexact PAM enjoys two advantages: (1) The computational complexity for SVDs of the inexact PAM ( O ( rn 1 n 2 n 3 ) ) (O(rn1n2n3)) is about twofold faster than that of the exact PAM ( O ( min ( n 1 , n 2 ) n 1 n 2 n 3 ) ) (O(min(n1,n2)n1n2n3)) for r ≪ min ( n 1 , n 2 ) r≪min(n1,n2) ; (2) The accuracy of the inexact PAM is theoretically guaranteed. Extensive experiments on HSIs denoising demonstrate that the exact and inexact methods both outperform comparing methods in quantitative evaluation metrics and visual effects, and the inexact PAM can compromise between the accuracy and efficiency for large scale HSIs.},

  abstract     = {Visual semantic parts play crucial roles in still image-based action recognition. A majority of existing methods require additional manual annotations such as human bounding boxes and predefined body parts besides action labels to learn action related visual semantic parts. However, labeling these manual annotations is rather time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, not all manual annotations are effective when recognizing a specific action. Some of them can be irrelevant and even misguided. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-stage deep learning method called Spatial Attention based Action Mask Networks (SAAM-Nets). The proposed method does not need any additional annotations besides action labels to obtain action-specific visual semantic parts. Instead, we propose a spatial attention layer injected in a convolutional neural network to create a specific action mask for each image with only action labels. Moreover, based on the action mask, we propose a region selection strategy to generate a semantic bounding box containing action-specific semantic parts. Furthermore, to effectively combine the information of the whole scene and the sematic box, two feature attention layers are adopted to obtain more discriminative representations. Experiments on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, three discrete-type families of complementarity functions with parameter p ⩾ 3 p⩾3 (where p is odd) based on the NR function were proposed. Using a neural network approach based on these families, it was observed from some preliminary numerical experiments that lower values of p provide better convergence rates. Moreover, higher values of p require larger computational time for the test problems considered. Hence, the value p = 3 p=3 is recommended for numerical simulations, which is rather unfortunate since we cannot exploit the wide range of values for the parameter p of the family of NCP functions . This paper is a follow-up study on the aforementioned results. Motivated by previously reported numerical results, we formulate a continuous-type generalization of the NR function and two corresponding symmetrizations . The new families admit a continuous parameter p &gt; 0 p&amp;gt;0 , giving us a wider range of choices for p and smooth NCP functions when p &gt; 1 p&amp;gt;1 . Moreover, the generalization subsumes the discrete-type generalization initially proposed. The numerical simulations show that in general, increased stability and better numerical performance can be achieved by taking values of p in the interval ( 1 , 3 ) (1,3) . This is indeed a significant improvement of preceding studies.},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep-learning based lane detection methods effectively boost the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Self-Driving Systems. However, these methods only detect lane lines with sketchy bounding boxes while ignore the shape of specific curved lanes. To address the above problems, this paper introduces deep reinforcement learning into cursory lane detection models for accurate lane detection and localization. This model consists of two stages, namely the bounding box detector and landmark point localizer. To be specific, a bounding box level convolution neural network lane detector outputs the preliminary location of lanes in the form of bounding boxes. Then, a reinforcement based Deep Q-Learning Localizer (DQLL) accurately localizes the lanes as a group of landmarks to achieve better representation of curved lanes. Moreover, a pixel-level lane detection dataset named NWPU Lanes Dataset is constructed and released. It contains a variety of real traffic scenes and accurate masks of the lane lines. This approach achieves competitive performance in the released dataset and TuSimple Lane dataset. Furthermore, the codes and dataset will be released on https://github.com/tuzixini/DQLL .},

It has earned intensive attention in the past decade since the seminal work of Fergus et al. [1] for camera shake removal. In spite of the recent great progress in this field, this paper aims to formulate the blind problem with a simpler modeling perspective. What is more important, the newly proposed approach is expected to achieve comparable or even better performance towards the real blurred images. Specifically, the core critical idea is the proposal of a pure gradient-based discriminative prior for accurate and robust blur kernel estimation. Numerous experimental results on both the benchmark datasets and real-world blurred images in various imaging scenarios, e.g., natural, manmade, low-illumination, text, or people, demonstrate well the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Several practical difficulties arise when trying to apply deep learning to image-based industrial inspection tasks: training datasets are difficult to obtain, each image must be inspected in milliseconds, and defects must be detected with 99\% or greater accuracy. In this paper we show how, for image-based industrial inspection tasks, transfer learning can be leveraged to address these challenges. Whereas transfer learning is known to work well only when the source and target domain images are similar, we show that using ImageNet—whose images differ significantly from our target industrial domain—as the source domain, and performing transfer learning, works remarkably well. For one benchmark problem involving 5,520 training images, the resulting transfer-learned network achieves 99.90\% accuracy, compared to only a 70.87\% accuracy achieved by the same network trained from scratch. Further analysis reveals that the transfer-learned network produces a considerably more sparse and disentangled representation compared to the trained-from-scratch network. The sparsity can be exploited to compress the transfer-learned network up to 1/128 the original number of convolution filters with only a 0.48\% drop in accuracy, compared to a drop of nearly 5\% when compressing a trained-from-scratch network. Our findings are validated by extensive systematic experiments and empirical analysis.},

In this paper, we have a gradient preconditioning trick and combine it with mini-batch SGD . The proposed gradient preconditioned mini-batch SGD algorithm boosts indeed the convergence with lower computational cost than that of the data preconditioning technique for ridge regression. Concretely, we use recent random projection and linear sketching methods to randomly low rank approximate the data matrix, then we can achieve a appropriate preconditioner through numerical linear algebra. Finally, we apply obtained preconditioner to the gradient to reduce computational cost.

Transfer learning (TL) has demonstrate edits effectiveness in improving the performance of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, which transfers knowledge from the model of a related imaging modality (source domain (SD)) to that of the diagnosis modality (target domain (TD)). Multiple empirical kernel learning machine (MEKLM) is a newly proposed classifier with superior performance to the conventional classifiers with implicit kernel mapping. In this work, we propose a novel projective model(PM) based sparse MEKLM(PM-SMEKLM) algorithm to learn a cross-domain transformation by PM in way of the parameter-based TL, and then apply it to the neuroimaging-based CAD for brain diseases. Sparse learning is integrated into MEKLM to further select effective information in SD for knowledge transfer and enhance the generalization ability of the classifier in TD. The projection matrix in PM and sparse representations in MEKLM are jointly learned, which effectively improves the performance of PM-SMEKLM. Three experiments are conducted on two neuroimaging datasets for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed PM-SMEKLM algorithm outperforms all the compared algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Pooling layers help reduce redundancy and the number of parameters in deep neural networks without the need of performing additional learning processes. Although these operators are able to deal with both single-label and multi-label problems they are specifically aimed at reducing feature space. However, in the case of multi-label data, this should also be done in the label space. On the other hand, in spite of their success, existing pooling operators are not ideal when handling (multi-label) datasets that do not have an explicit topological organization. In this paper, we present a deep neural architecture using bidirectional association-based pooling layers to extract high-level features and labels in multi-label classification problems. Our approach uses an association function to detect distinct pairs of neurons that will be aggregated into pooled neurons. In the first pooling layer, our proposal computes the Pearson correlation among the variables as the basis to quantify the association values. In addition, we propose an iterative procedure that allows estimating the association degree among pooled neurons in deeper layers without the need of recomputing the correlation matrix . The main advantage of this deep neural architecture is that it allows extracting high-level features and labels on datasets with no specific topological organization. The numerical results show that our bidirectional neural network helps reduce the number of problem features and labels while preserving network’s discriminatory power .},

Our INTEL algorithm is developed based on a full consideration of the duality between online prediction and anomaly detection . We first employ a mixture of weighted Gaussian process models (WGPs) to cover the expected possible temporal structures of the data. Then, based on the rich modeling capacity of this WGP mixture, we develop an efficient technique to instantly learn (capture) the temporal structure of the data that follows a regime shift. This instant learning is achieved only by adjusting one hyper-parameter of the mixture model. A weighted generalization of the product of experts (POE) model is used for fusing predictions yielded from multiple GP models. An outlier is declared once a real observation seriously deviates from the fused prediction. If a certain number of outliers are consecutively declared, then a change point is declared. Extensive experiments are performed using a diverse of real datasets. Results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than benchmark methods for SOP in the presence of outliers and change points.},

This approach can view parts of pair-wise motions with high reliability as an input to estimate the global motions for a multi-view registration. However, reliable pair-wise motions are not easy to confirm in most practical applications without prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose an adaptive low-rank sparse (LRS) weighted motion averaging method for a robust and accurate multi-view registration, which can directly reconstruct high-quality 3D shape models from a set of unordered range scans. Specifically, we first introduce LRS matrix decomposition to automatically compute the initial global motions. The LRS matrix decomposition can recover the initial global models through the full exploration of a set of pair-wise motions. Subsequently, we extend the motion averaging with an adaptive weight computation by developing an optimization strategy using the Lagrange multiplier method , which can adaptively compute the weights of the reliability for each pair-wise relative motion. Accordingly, the proposed method can recover accurate and robust global motions in a set of iterations through weighted motion averaging. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art multi-view registration and 3D scene reconstruction.},

  abstract     = {Many semantic events in team sport activities e.g. basketball often involve both group activities and the outcome (score or not). Motion patterns can be an effective means to identify different activities. Global and local motions have their respective emphasis on different activities, which are difficult to capture from the optical flow due to the mixture of global and local motions. Hence it calls for a more effective way to separate the global and local motions. When it comes to the specific case for basketball game analysis, the successful score for each round can be reliably detected by the appearance variation around the basket. Based on the observations, we propose a scheme to fuse global and local motion patterns (MPs) and key visual information (KVI) for semantic event recognition in basketball videos. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to estimate the global motions from the mixed motions based on the intrinsic property of camera adjustments. And the local motions could be obtained from the mixed and global motions. Secondly, a two-stream 3D CNN framework is utilized for group activity recognition over the separated global and local motion patterns. Thirdly, the basket is detected and its appearance features are extracted through a CNN structure. The features are utilized to predict the success or failure. Finally, the group activity recognition and success/failure prediction results are integrated using the kronecker product for event recognition. Experiments on NCAA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance.},

As the Gaussian distribution is a particular limiting case of α α -stable distribution, the proposed model is a generalization of the widely used GMM.

  abstract     = {Data often exists in subspaces embedded within a high-dimensional space. Subspace clustering seeks to group data according to the dimensions relevant to each subspace. This requires the estimation of subspaces as well as the clustering of data. Subspace clustering becomes increasingly challenging in high dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality which affects reliable estimations of distances and density. Recently, another aspect of high-dimensional spaces has been observed, known as the hubness phenomenon, whereby few data points appear frequently as nearest neighbors of the rest of the data. The distribution of neighbor occurrences becomes skewed with increasing intrinsic dimensionality of the data, and few points with high neighbor occurrences emerge as hubs. Hubs exhibit useful geometric properties and have been leveraged for clustering data in the full-dimensional space. In this paper, we study hubs in the context of subspace clustering. We present new characterizations of hubs in relation to subspaces, and design graph-based meta-features to identify a subset of hubs which are well fit to serve as seeds for the discovery of local latent subspaces and clusters. We propose and evaluate a hubness-driven algorithm to find subspace clusters, and show that our approach is superior to the baselines, and is competitive against state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods . We also identify the data characteristics that make hubs suitable for subspace clustering. Such characterization gives valuable guidelines to data mining practitioners.},

To solve time-varying full-rank Moore–Penrose inverse problems with different noises in real time, some modified zeroing neural network models are developed, analyzed and investigated from the perspective of control. Furthermore, the proposed zeroing neural network models globally converge to the theoretical solution of the full-rank Moore–Penrose inverse problem without noises, and exponentially converge to the exact solution in the presence of noises, which are demonstrated theoretically. Moreover, in comparison with existing models, numerical simulations are provided to substantiate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed modified neural network for online solving time-varying full-rank Moore–Penrose problems with inherent tolerance to noises. In addition, the numerical results infer that different activation functions can be applied to accelerate the convergence speed of the zeroing neural network model. Finally, the proposed zeroing neural network models are applied to the motion generation of redundant robot manipulators, which illustrates its high efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition (FER) has a wide variety of applications ranging from human–computer interaction, robotics to health care. Although FER has made significant progress with the success of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it is still challenging especially for the video-based FER due to the dynamic changes in facial actions . Since the specific divergences exists among different expressions, we introduce a metric learning framework with a siamese cascaded structure that learns a fine-grained distinction for different expressions in video-based task. We also develop a pairwise sampling strategy for such metric learning framework. Furthermore, we propose a novel action-units attention mechanism tailored to FER task to extract spatial contexts from the emotion regions. This mechanism works as a sparse self-attention fashion to enable a single feature from any position to perceive features of the action-units (AUs) parts (eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth). Besides, an attentive pooling module is designed to select informative items over the video sequences by capturing the temporal importance. We conduct the experiments on four widely used datasets (CK+, Oulu-CASIA, MMI, and AffectNet), and also do experiment on the wild dataset AFEW to further investigate the robustness of our proposed method. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. More in details, we give the ablation study of each component.},

In this paper, a novel label propagation algorithm, Label Importance based Label Propagation Algorithm (LILPA), is proposed to discover communities by adopting fixed label update order based on the ascending order of node importance, utilizing label importance based on node importance and node attraction when labels are launched to other nodes and employing label update process based on node importance, node attraction and label importance for improving the instability and enhancing its accurate and efficiency. Meanwhile, Core Drug Discovery for Indications (CDDI) is a popular research field in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Then we apply LILPA in a drug network to discover drug communities and core drugs for treating different indications in TCM. Experimental results on 16 synthetic and 10 real-world networks demonstrate that LILPA obtains better accuracy and stability than state-of-the-art approaches.

Second, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to estimate the unknown external disturbance encountered by quadrotor during flight. Then, novel second order sliding mode surfaces are proposed to design the attitude controller and position controller, which can effectively attenuate the chattering effect without sacrificing the robustness of the controller. In addition, an auxiliary system is developed to eliminate the influence caused by input saturation.

This matrix is sensitive to noise and becomes unreliable, which affects the performance of feature selection. The researches have shown that both the global reconstruction information and local structure information are important for feature selection. To solve the above problem effectively and make use of the global and local information of data simultaneously, a novel algorithm is proposed in this paper, called subspace learning for unsupervised feature selection via adaptive structure learning and rank approximation (SLASR). Specifically, SLASR learns the manifold structure adaptively, thus the preserved local geometric structure can be more accurate and more robust to noise. As a result, the learning of the similarity matrix and the low-dimensional embedding is completed in one step, which improves the effect of feature selection. Meanwhile, SLASR adopts the matrix factorization subspace learning framework. By minimizing the reconstruction error of subspace learning residual matrix, the global reconstruction information of data is preserved. Then, to guarantee more accurate manifold structure of the similarity matrix, a rank constraint is used to constrain the Laplacian matrix . Additionally, the l 2,1/2 regularization term is used to constrain the projection matrix to select the most sparse and robust features. Experimental results on twelve benchmark datasets show that SLASR is superior to the six comparison algorithms from the literature.},

  abstract     = {Weakly-supervised multi-label learning has emerged as a hot topic more recently. Most existing methods deal with such problem by learning from the data where the label assignments are incomplete while the feature information is ideal. However, in many real applications, due to the influence of occlusion, illumination and low-resolution, the acquired features are often noisy, which may reduce the robustness of the learning model. In this paper, to overcome the above shortcoming, we propose a novel weakly-supervised multi-label learning framework called WML-LSC, where the low-rank and sparse constrain schemes are jointly incorporated to capture the desired feature information. Specifically, we first decompose the observed feature matrix into an ideal feature matrix and an outlier matrix. Considering that similar instances usually share similar visual characteristics, we constrain the ideal feature matrix to be low-rank. Meanwhile, a reasonable assumption is that the noise is sparse compared with the feature matrix, which leads outlier matrix to be sparse. In addition, a linear self-recovery model is adopted to reconstruct the incomplete label assignment matrix by exploiting label correlations. Finally, the desired model is trained on the ideal feature matrix and the refined label matrix. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve superior and comparable performance against state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we study such complex visual grounding problem and propose to build a query dependent visual-textual (VT) scene graph to jointly understand the image and query text. To avoid the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth scene graphs, we propose vtGraphNet to effectively learn the bi-modal scene graph in a weakly-supervised way, where the only supervision is the manually annotated grounding region. Specifically, we first use an ARU Tagging model to sequentially tag every query word as either an attribute, a relationship or an auxiliary. If a word is tagged as attribute, we develop an attribute-assigning model to associate it to a region proposal. If a word is tagged as relationship, we develop a relationship-referring model to associate it to a pair of region proposals. A simple yet effective graph consistency loss function is constructed to constrain the above associations to form a feasible compact VT scene graph, from which discriminative region features can be extracted and used to locate the grounding object by classification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our approach in handling both simple and complex visual grounding tasks.},

  abstract     = {In many real world scenarios, it is difficult to capture the images in the visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal (THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding. However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise losses (like L 1 L1 or L 2 L2 ) as the objective function for training. The quality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still not up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective functions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the transformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is introduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the perceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the adversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to judge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR scene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in terms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures.

Moreover, sparsity is another major problem of the most previous recommendation systems.

  abstract     = {In this study, we focus on understanding and mining user’s preferences and intentions via user-based aggregation in the context of a social network. Understanding preference and intention in microblog texts is more difficult and challenging than understanding such characteristics in the context of standard text. The main reason is that search history and click history are difficult to obtain due to data privacy in social networks. Meanwhile, the text is sparse, and the number of background topics in social networks is enormous. To overcome the above challenges, we explore an indirect method of user’s preference and intention understanding by leveraging a user-based aggregation topic model (UATM). Our UATM aims to mine the distributions of user’s preferences and intentions by utilizing user’s preference and intention distributions and followees’ preference and intention distributions. Furthermore, to alleviate the sparsity problem, we discriminatively model common words and topic words and incorporate a user factor into our model. We combine the recurrent neural network (RNN) and inverse document frequency (IDF) as the weight prior to learn word relationships. Moreover, to further weaken the sparsity of context, we leverage word pairs to model topics for all documents. We also propose a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer preference and intention in our UATM. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we collect a Sina Weibo dataset consisting of microblog users and their pushed content to conduct various experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed UATM model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {One recent study in the field of deep learning is extending Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by coupling them to external memory resources. Neural Turing Machine (NTM) and Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) are two counterparts in this field. Research activities fall into two categories of either interacting with memory or choosing controller components. The first approach uses a try and error fashion to provide the controller’s structure that would be a problem when there is no prior knowledge on the controller’s structure for particular tasks. The second approach includes methods for choosing the controller’s structure and weight optimization. NeuroEvolution falls in the second category that automatically and without prior knowledge obtains an appropriate network structure. This research presents Evolutionary Differentiable Neural Computer (EDNC), which uses a novel NeuroEvolution algorithm that is introduced in two types of nested object-oriented encoding called Adaptive Layer NeuroEvolution (ALNE) and Matrix-based one called M_ALNE. These NeuroEvolution algorithms use the following sub-algorithms: Self-Adaptivity in the Initial Population (SAIP), Self-Adaptivity in Evolutionary Structures (SAES), Layer Recombination (LR), Layer Mutation (LM), and Self-Adaptivity in Mutation (SAM). The evolution process starts with SAIP, and then it takes short and long steps to explore a variety of neural structures by SAES algorithm that uses both LR and LM algorithms to provide a variety of structures. Finally, the SAM algorithm guides the selected structures to a target structure. In this research, experiments applied EDNC on well-known tasks, including Facebook bAbI, copy, graph (shortest path), and 8-puzzle. The experiments show that the proposed method in both encodings automatically and without prior knowledge, produces an appropriate controller structure in the shortest time. It though shows that both proposed encodings reduce the evolution time by at least 73\% in comparison with the baseline methods .},

A novel auxiliary dynamic system governed by a smooth piecewise continuous function is constructed to handle the input saturation effect, while promoting to achieve the fixed-time convergence of tracking errors. Moreover, the unknown dynamics of ELSs and the bound vector of unknown external disturbances are synthesized into a compounded uncertain vector in this paper. Here, adaptive neural networks with the ∊ -modification updating laws are employed to only approximate the compounded uncertain vector, rather than each dynamic matrix of ELSs, such that the computational burden of the developed control scheme is significantly reduced. It is theoretically proven that the trajectory tracking is able to be achieved in a fixed time under the developed adaptive neural tracking control scheme, while all signals in the Euler-Lagrange closed-loop tracking control system are bounded. The simulation results on a 2-link robotic manipulator are included to illuminate the effectiveness of our developed tracking control scheme and superiority to a finite-time control scheme.},

  abstract     = {As an ensemble algorithm, network boosting enjoys a powerful classification ability but suffers from the tedious and time-consuming training process. To tackle the problem, in this paper, a broad network gradient boosting system (BNGBS) is developed by integrating gradient boosting machine with broad networks, in which the classification loss caused by a base broad network is learned and eliminated by followed networks in a cascade manner. The proposed system is constructed as an additive model and can be easily optimized by a greedy strategy instead of the tedious back-propagation algorithm, resulting in a more efficient learning process. Meanwhile, triple incremental learning capabilities including the increment of feature nodes, increment of input samples, and increment of target classes are designed. The proposed system can be efficiently updated and expanded based on the current status instead of being entirely retrained when the demands for more feature nodes, input samples, and target classes are proposed. The node-increment ability allows to add more feature nodes into the built system if the current structures are not effective for learning. The sample-increment ability is developed to allow the model to keep learning from the coming batch data. The class-increment ability is used to tackle the issue that the coming batch data may contain unseen categories. In comparison with existing popular machine learning methods, comprehensive results based on eight benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed broad network gradient boosting system for the classification task .},

By utilizing zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) method, a continuous-time ZND (CTZND) model is first proposed for solving the corresponding continuous-time nonlinear optimization (CTNO) problem. Afterwards, three different explicit linear multi-step methods (i.e., explicit linear 3-step, 2-step, and 1-step methods) are respectively presented and investigated. To solve such a DTNO problem, the explicit linear 3-step method is adopted to combine with the CTZND model, and hence a 3-step discrete-time ZND (DTZND) model is proposed. For comparison purposes, 2-step and 1-step DTZND models are also developed. Besides, theoretical analyses indicate the validity and superiority of the proposed 3-step DTZND model. Finally, the numerical experimental results based on a 2-joint robot manipulator and a PUMA560 robot manipulator further verify that the proposed 3-step DTZND model is much superior to the other two DTZND models.},

The entire method includes two modules: a local defect simulation algorithm and a residual-restored-based segmentation algorithm . In order to ensure both structural and local texture consistency of the simulated defects, we design a two-stage simulation algorithm based on generation adversarial net and neural style transfer. The simulation method requires one single defect reference sample for training, and can generate the same type of defect in the specified area. The segmentation algorithm , trained with the simulated images and reference samples, can restore the defect area and yield the predicted label from the residual image. We carry out experiments on the button, road crack, and silicon steel strip datasets. The results show that the proposed method can remarkably improve the defect segmentation accuracy , attaining F1 score of 0.82.},

Most previous studies focus on single-person re-identification (re-id) and ignore the correlations among group members, and they lack a large and comprehensive group retrieval benchmark to associate these two tasks. To address this issue, this paper focuses on solving the group retrieval problem and uses it to improve re-id. First, the paper build a comprehensive benchmark for both group retrieval and the group-aided re-id task by proposing a novel pedestrian group retrieval dataset named “SYSU-Group” and a corresponding group-associated re-id dataset named “Group-reID”, which introduces realistic challenges such as variations of pose, viewpoint, illumination, and intra-group layout. The paper then proposes the Siamese Verification-Identification-based Group Retrieval (SVIGR) method, which combines verification and identification modules in a Siamese network to extract robust person features and follows the principle of minimum distance matching to realize group retrieval. Finally, a group-guided re-id method named group retrieval correlation (GRC) is proposed to improve re-id with additional group information. Experimental results on three various group retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method.},

In this paper, a novel network with boundary information guidance is proposed to distinguish low-contrast areas near the boundary effectively. We design two separate decoding sub-networks including a saliency sub-network and a boundary sub-network to learn saliency and boundary information respectively based on multi-level feature fusion . We further design a connection module to exchange the information between two sub-networks and a fusion module to fuse information of salient objects and boundaries. The boundary sub-network supervised by boundary maps outputs the error map calculated by ground truth to focus on boundary information. The boundary sub-network is only used in training and the optimal weight of the total loss is obtained by experiments to balance the two sub-network losses. With the guidance of boundary information, salient objects are detected accurately. Extensive evaluations on six benchmark and two video datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed model can run at more than 34 FPS.},

  abstract     = {Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a powerful and favorable classifier used in various applications due to its fast speed and good generalization capability. However, when dealing with complex visual tasks, the shallow architecture of ELM makes it infeasible to have good performance when raw image data are directly fed in as input. Therefore, several works tried to make use of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract features before ELM classification. On the other hand, when the depth of DNN is too deep, the ELM classifier may suffer from overfitting problem. To solve this issue, a novel deep and wide feature based Extreme Learning Machine (DW-ELM) has been proposed in this research work. We show that the overfitting problem can be largely remedied by employing a “widened” convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction, in the sense that the number of feature maps for each convolutional layer is increased by factor of k compared to a reference model, i.e. deep residual networks ( ResNets ). While the wide design of residual networks has been shown to benefit image classification in terms of accuracy and efficiency, its application for feature extraction is not fully investigated. We provide an extensive experimental study in this work, showing that when combined with ELM that serves as a classifier, using wide ResNets (WRNs) for feature extraction can produce a performance leap on all benchmark datasets compared to a plain end-to-end trained network over a wide range of selections regardless of architecture choices and ELM designs, while normal ResNets as feature extractors do not provide a performance gain. The gap is even larger when fewer training iterations are employed. This indicates that a good feature extractor for ELM must be wide and deep. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets (CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, STL-10, Flower-102 and Fashion-MNIST) have shown significant accuracy enhancement as well as training stability of the proposed DW-ELM. Ablation studies also demonstrate that the ELM classifier is an important component for DW-ELM which enables superior performance compared with SVM based image classification approaches.},

One experimental study suggested that ACC can enable monkeys to correct errors, but another study found that a legion of ACC did not impair monkeys’ ability to correct errors. Instead, it made monkeys incapable of maintaining their optimal actions. Given the importance of ACC in reward-based decision-making, it is imperative to better understand the functions of ACC in reward-based decision-making. To this end, we sought biologically-plausible mechanisms to account for the two seemingly conflicting results mentioned above by utilizing a computational model . From our simulations, we found that 1) the interplay between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ACC can account for both experimental observations and 2) ACC can correct behavioral responses by reading out and updating motor plans (guiding future motor responses) stored in PFC.},

In other words, every separate group has a fixed overall update rate, yet all units are allowed to have different paces. Information is therefore forced to be latched in a flexible way, which helps the model to capture long-term dependencies in data. Besides having a simpler structure, GDU is demonstrated experimentally to outperform other models such as LSTM and GRU on both pathological problems and tasks on natural datasets.},

  abstract     = {In the personal house renting scenario, customers usually make quick assessments based on previous customers&#39; reviews, which makes such reviews essential for the business. If the house is assessed as popular, a Matthew effect will be observed as more people will be willing to book it. Due to the lack of definition and quantity assessment measures, however, it is difficult to make a popularity evaluation and prediction. To solve this problem, the concept of house popularity is well defined in this paper. Specifically, the house popularity is decided by inter-event timeand rating score at the same time. To make a more effective prediction over these two correlated variables, a dual-gated recurrent unit (DGRU) is employed. Furthermore, an encoder-decoder framework with DGRU is proposed to perform popularity prediction. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed DGRU and the encoder-decoder framework in two-correlated sequences prediction and popularity prediction, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to estimate the reachable set for a class of delayed neural networks (NNs) subject to Markovian jump parameters and bounded disturbance. First, by virtue of delay-partitioning method, the time-varying delay is divided into some delay components. With suitably constructing Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKFs), a less conservative delay-dependent condition of finding an ellipsoid-like set to contain all state trajectories that start from the origin is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then the integrally free-matrix-based inequality approach together with the extended reciprocally convex technique is employed to further reduce the conservatism on characterizing bounds of some integral terms. Thanks to a group of free-connection weighting matrices, the proposed reachable set estimation approach is extended to the case that transition probabilities are partially known. Finally, numerical simulations indicate that the derived results are effective and less conservative.},

Due to limited channel capacity in communication network, the information in routing path suffers a transmission delay. Instead of the game theoretic setting, we formulate the problem as an online quadratic optimization problem subject to stochastic systems involving input delay. Since the probability statistics of system noise is unknown, the decision-maker can not utilize the traditional optimal control strategies. Motivated by online convex optimization theory, we introduce the notion of regret, which measures the cumulative performance difference between the optimal statistics known (offline) index value and the statistics unknown (online) index value. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, utilizing the linear minimum mean square biased estimate, we derive a learning based control policy and then characterize its behavior . Second, under some basic assumptions, we further prove that the regret grows at a sub-linear rate and it is explicitly bounded by O ( ln T ) O(lnT) .},

  abstract     = {Accurate short-term traffic flow prediction is an important basis of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) such as transportation operations and urban planning applications. However, due to the lack of complete directly measured data on urban traffic flow, existing studies cannot adequately mine the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations characterizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Electronic registration identification (ERI), which is an emerging technology for uniquely identifying a vehicle, can help collect the travel records of all vehicles. This inspires us to employ ERI big data for traffic flow prediction . In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatial-temporal feature optimization method with ERI big data for short-term traffic flow prediction based on a gradient–boosted regression tree, called DSTO-GBRT. Firstly, the framework of DSTO-GBRT is built. Secondly, we analyze the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations among the current prediction point and upstream correlative points using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Thirdly, to eliminate the linear correlations among features, we exploit principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the original training data and obtain optimized training data. In the experiment, real-world ERI big data from Chongqing are employed for the proposed DSTO-GBRT method. Compared with ST-GBRT, ARIMA, DSTO-BPNN and DSTO-SVM, the results demonstrate that DSTO-GBRT can provide timely and adaptive prediction even in rush hour, when traffic conditions change rapidly. Furthermore, compared with DSO-GBRT and DTO-GBRT, the results show that the proposed DSTO-GBRT method is more accurate.},

  abstract     = {An attributed graph is a graph where nodes are associated with attributes describing their features. Clustering on an attributed graph is to detect clusters that have not only (1) cohesive structure; but also (2) homogeneous attribute values. We observe that in an attributed graph, different clusters tend to correlate to different attributes. For example, a cluster may show homogeneous values on attribute A but random values on attribute B , while for another cluster the situation could be the reverse. Existing attributed graph clustering methods ignore this phenomenon, thus leading to unsatisfactory clustering results . In this paper, we propose a novel attributed graph clustering framework called C o H omo to detect clusters with different attribute correlation patterns. The objective is to detect clusters that show both high structural cohesiveness and value homogeneity on some of the attributes. C o H omo defines and optimizes a correlation weight vector for each cluster to capture its correlation degrees to different node attributes. We formalize this problem as a bi-objective optimization problem and design an efficient heuristic optimizing method. The correlation weights for a cluster can be updated in two ways, synchronous updating or asynchronous updating, during the process of clustering. C o H omo is parameter-free and has near linear scalability. Theoretical analysis shows that all the results on the Pareto front generated by C o H omo are weak Pareto optimal solutions . Extensive experiments on attributed graphs based on several real world networks verify the effectiveness and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method.},

This embodies the marrow of statistical learning theory, so this modification can improve the performance of classification. Furthermore, to accelerate the computation of RTBSVM and simultaneously inherit the merit of robustness, we construct a least squares version of RTBSVM (called RTBSVM). This formulation leads to a simple and fast algorithm for binary classifiers by solving just two systems of linear equations. Finally, we derive two simple and effective iterative optimization algorithms for solving RTBSVM and FRTBSVM, respectively. Simultaneously, we theoretically rigorously analyze and prove the computational complexity , local optimality and convergence of the algorithms. Experimental results on one synthetic dataset and nine UCI datasets demonstrate that our methods are competitive with other methods. Additionally, the FRTBSVM is directly applied to recognize the purity of hybrid maize seeds using near-infrared spectral data. Experiments show that our method achieves better performance than the traditional methods in most spectral regions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Hashing has become a popular technique used to support large-scale image retrieval , due to its significantly reduced storage, high search speed and capability of mapping high dimensional original features into compact similarity-preserving binary codes. Although effectiveness achieved, most existing hashing methods are still some limitations, including: (1) Many supervised hashing methods only transform the label information into pairwise similarities to guide the hash code learning process, which will lead to the loss of rich semantic information between image pairs. (2) Some pioneer hashing methods use a relaxation-based strategy to solve discrete problems, resulting in a large quantization error . (3) Some supervised hashing methods handle the hashing learning procedure based on an asymmetric learning manner, and although this partially solves the problems of low efficiency and accuracy of symmetric learning strategy, they are all based on the embeddings of equal dimension, which leads to the reduction in the models representation ability and an increase in potential noise. To overcome the above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel yet simple but effective hashing method, named Scalable Deep Asymmetric Hashing (SDAH). Specifically, SDAH is an end-to-end deep hashing method based on a fast iterative optimization strategy , which utilizes two real-valued embeddings of unequal dimensions, i.e., real-valued embeddings of images and labels, to flexibly perform asymmetric similarity computation. It can circumvent the use of the large pairwise similarity matrix by introducing an intermediate label matrix term which results in a remarkable reduction in the memory space cost. By doing this, the learned hash codes are more semantically informative for image retrieval tasks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of SDAH in comparison with many state-of-the-art hashing methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses global Mittag-Leffler lag quasi-synchronization (GMLQS) of fractional-order memristor-based neural networks (FMNNs). Firstly, for a general class of fractional-order nonlinear systems with interval uncertainties, a kind of linear feedback pinning controller, which works by feeding back partial state errors to the partial controlled variables, is designed to achieve global Mittag-Leffler ultimate boundedness (GMUB). Correspondingly, a GMUB criterion in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) is derived with the aid of a Lyapunov function and a newly established fractional-order differential inequality. Then, the linear feedback pinning controller is employed for GMUB of the synchronization error system, which is equivalent to GMLQS of FMNNs. Since there exists the propagation delay between drive-response FMNNs and the synchronization error system can not be obtained straightforwardly, an identical equation about Caputo’s fractional derivatives is established to overcome this difficulty. Moreover, the detailed pinning control scheme design procedures for a prescribed GMLQS performance are presented, where the performance involves both ultimate error bound and transient behavior . In the control scheme, an auxiliary LMI and an optimization objective function are introduced, which can significantly reduce control cost. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the feasibility of the control scheme. The results obtained in this paper have improved the existing criterion on quasi-synchronization of FMNNs, and will also provide a novel insight into pinning control of fractional-order nonlinear systems .},

  abstract     = {Deep neural network (DNN) is inherently vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples , which can easily alter the output of the DNN by adding slight perturbations to the input. The recent study proved that adversarial vulnerability is caused by non-robust features and is not inherently tied to DNN. The paper presents a platform called FoolChecker to evaluate the image robustness against adversarial attacks from the perspective of image itself rather than DNN models. We define the minimum perceptual distance between the original examples and the adversarial ones to quantify the robustness against adversarial attacks . Firstly, differential evolution is applied to generate candidate perturbation units with high perturbation priority. And then, the greedy algorithm tries to add the pixel with the current highest perturbation priority into perturbation units until the DNN model is fooled. Finally, the perceptual distance of perturbation units is calculated as a index to evaluate the robustness of images against adversarial attacks. Experimental results show that the FoolChecker can give proper evaluation of the robustness of images against adversarial attacks with acceptable time.},

  abstract     = {Early prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for delaying its progression. As a chronic disease, ignoring the temporal dimension of AD data affects the performance of a progression detection and medically unacceptable. Besides, AD patients are represented by heterogeneous, yet complementary, multimodalities. Multitask modeling improves progression-detection performance, robustness, and stability. However, multimodal multitask modeling has not been evaluated using time series and deep learning paradigm, especially for AD progression detection. In this paper, we propose a robust ensemble deep learning model based on a stacked convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. This multimodal multitask model jointly predicts multiple variables based on the fusion of five types of multimodal time series data plus a set of background (BG) knowledge. Predicted variables include AD multiclass progression task, and four critical cognitive scores regression tasks . The proposed model extracts local and longitudinal features of each modality using a stacked CNN and BiLSTM network. Concurrently, local features are extracted from the BG data using a feed-forward neural network . Resultant features are fused to a deep network to detect common patterns which jointly used to predict the classification and regression tasks . To validate our model, we performed six experiments on five modalities from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) of 1536 subjects. The results of the proposed approach achieve state-of-the-art performance for both multiclass progression and regression tasks. Moreover, our approach can be generalized in other medial domains to analyze heterogeneous temporal data for predicting patient’s future status.},

  abstract     = {Image deblurring and super-resolution (SR) are computer vision tasks aiming to restore image detail and spatial scale, respectively. Despite significant research effort over the past years, it remains challenging for joint image deblurring and SR via deep networks. Besides, only a few recent literatures contribute to this task, as conventional methods deal with SR or deblurring separately. To rectify the weakness, we propose a novel network that handles both tasks jointly and in this way boosts the SR performance from blurry input greatly. To fully exploit the representation capacity of our model, dual supervised learning is proposed to impose the constraint between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images. Our model consists of three parts: (i) a deblurring module equipped with channel attention residual blocks that removes the fuzziness from input images, (ii) an SR module to super-resolve the image based on the feature maps from the deblurring module serving as input, and (iii) a dual module which exploits the dependencies between LR and HR images. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed attention dual supervised network (ADSN) not only generates remarkably clear HR images, but also achieves compelling results for joint image deblurring and SR task.},

  abstract     = {With the development of deep learning techniques , speaker verification (SV) systems based on deep neural network (DNN) achieve competitive performance compared with traditional i-vector-based works. Previous DNN-based SV methods usually employ time-delay neural network , limiting the extension of the network for an effective representation. Besides, existing attention mechanisms used in DNN-based SV systems are only applied to a single level of network architectures , leading to insufficiently extraction of important features. To address above issues, we propose an effective deep speaker embedding architecture for SV, which combines a residual connection of one-dimensional dilated convolutional layers , called dilated residual networks (DRNs), with a multi-level attention model. The DRNs can not only capture long time-frequency context information of features, but also exploit information from multiple layers of DNN. In addition, the multi-level attention model, which consists of two-dimensional convolutional block attention modules employed at the frame level and the vector-based attention utilized at the pooling layer, can emphasize important features at multiple levels of DNN. Experiments conducted on NIST SRE 2016 dataset show that the proposed architecture achieves a superior equal error rate (EER) of 7.094\% and a better detection cost function (DCF16) of 0.552 compared with state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of dilated convolutions and the multi-level attention on SV tasks.},

It is noted that the proposed noise-tolerance ZND models own the ability to suppress noise and one of those even achieves finite-time convergency. Compared with previous work, the proposed inverse-free ZND models effectively reduce the computation complexity by simplifying the model structure and conquer the problem of solving real-time matrix inverse during the computation process, which is more appropriate for a wider practical application.},

Moreover, due to the characteristics of simple structure and powerful approximation ability, RBF neural network (RBFNN) is introduced to approximate the fault dynamics after the sensor fault is detected. The approximated fault dynamic is utilized to reconstruct the controller. The major feature of this paper is that the whole fault-tolerant tracking controller structure is derived from the dynamic linearization of the ideal controller, rather than the criterion function.

  abstract     = {The brain, a network of spiking neurons, can learn complex dynamics by adapting its spontaneous chaotic activity. One of the dominant approaches used to train such a network, the FORCE method, has recently been applied to spiking neural networks . This method employs a pool of randomly connected spiking neurons, called a reservoir, to create chaos and uses the recursive least square (RLS) method to change its dynamic to what is required to follow a teacher signal. Here, we propose a digital hardware architecture for spiking FORCE with some modifications to the original method. First, to reduce the memory usage in hardware implementation, we show that careful binarization of the reservoir weights could preserve its initial chaotic activity. Second, we generate the connection matrix on-the-fly instead of storing the whole matrix. Third, a single processor systolic array implementation of the RLS using the inverse QR decomposition is exploited to update the readout layer weights. This implementation is not only more hardware-friendly but also more numerically stable in reduced precision than the standard RLS implementation. Fourth, we implement the design in both single and custom-precision floating-point number systems. Finally, we implement a network of 510 Izhikevic neurons on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA with 32, 24, and 18 bits floating-point numbers. To confirm the correctness of our architecture, we successfully train our hardware using three different teacher signals.},

  abstract     = {When the distributions between the source (training) and target (test) datasets are different, the performance of classical statistical learning methods degrades significantly. Domain adaptation (DA) aims at correcting this distribution mismatch and narrowing down the distribution discrepancy. Existing methods mostly focus on correcting the mismatch between the marginal distributions and/or the class-conditional distributions. In this paper, we assume that the distribution mismatch in domain adaptation is the joint distribution mismatch, and propose an Extended Maximum Mean Discrepancy (EMMD) metric to measure the distance between joint distributions. Based on this metric, we propose the Joint Distribution Matching Embedding (JDME) approach, which finds a mapping matrix to project the samples into a latent space, where the EMMD between the source and target joint distributions is minimized. The resultant orthogonal-constrained optimization problem can be solved in the form of an unconstrained problem on the Grassmann manifold. After the joint distribution matching, we can expect the classical statistical learning methods to perform well on the target dataset. Experiments on object recognition, face recognition, and spam filtering demonstrate that our method statistically outperforms the state-of-the-art shallow methods and is also on par with the deep learning methods .},

Specifically, to learn a discriminative representation, RSNMF explores both the global structure via considering the data variance and the local structure via exploiting the data neighborhood. To well address the problem of noise and outliers, it imposes joint L 2,1 -norm minimization on both the loss function of NMF and the regularization of the basis matrix. The geometric structure and the joint L 2,1 -norm are formulated as an optimization model, which is solved by the proposed iterative algorithm .

  abstract     = {Many existing solutions perform document-level sentiment classification based on local document only, ignoring other texts that might contribute to better classification accuracy . In this paper, we propose a novel speculative sentiment classification model named SSC. In SSC, we speculate that users with similar rating behaviours are more likely to write documents of similar sentiments toward a product. The motivation of SSC, therefore, is to exploit those speculative similar documents for improving classification accuracy . The proposed SSC model consists of three main components, namely, user-product interaction (UPI) component, document encoding (DE) component, and speculative similar document (SSD) component. The UPI component models user-product interactions, and encodes user/product ratings behaviours into user/product embeddings. The DE component utilizes learned user/product embeddings to capture the informative word vectors for comprising more accurate document representations. The SSD component aggregates documents written by similar users toward the same product for speculative sentiment classification. Because the user similarities are calculated based on user embeddings that encode user rating behaviours, the aggregated documents are more likely to have similar sentiments. The three components are seamlessly integrated into a unified model. In the unified manner, these three components are jointly optimized, and they mutually complement each other to enhance sentiment classification. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and demonstrate the advantage of the proposed SSC model over state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {With the development of the Internet, more and more creators publish articles on social media. How to automatically filter high quality content from a large number of multimedia articles is one of the core functions of information recommendation, search engine, and other systems. However, existing approaches typically suffer from two limitations: (1) They usually model content as word sequences, which ignores the semantics provided by non-consecutive phrases, long-distance word dependency, and visual information. (2) They rely on a large amount of manually annotated data to train a quality assessment model while users may only provide labels of interest in a single class for a small number of samples in reality. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Graph Convolutional Networks (MGCN) to model the semantic representations in a unified framework for High Quality Content Recognition. Instead of viewing text content as word sequences, we convert them into graphs, which can model non-consecutive phrases and long-distance word dependency for better obtaining the composition of semantics. Besides, visual content is also modeled into the graphs to provide complementary semantics. A well-designed graph convolutional network is proposed to capture the semantic representations based on these graphs. Furthermore, we employ a non-negative risk estimator for high quality content recognition and the loss is back-propagated for model learning. Experiments on real datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.},

The basic principle of these algorithms is to preserve the similarities in the original networks as much as possible. However, in heterogeneous information networks, existing algorithms are not sufficiently expressive to capture detailed semantic patterns between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous information network embedding algorithm called the relational triplet network (RTN). In the data sampling phase, meta-schema-based random walks are performed to extract semi-hard quadruplets based on the node type and degree. In the representation learning phase, a relational triplet loss is designed to optimize the distance of triplet embeddings on diverse heterogeneous relationships. The empirical results demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain multiple types of representations and outperform other state-of-the-art methods in node classification and link prediction.},

However, how to effectively propagate features in the learning layer and how to fuse low-level visual features and high-level semantic features , is still a challenging task. In addition, with the rapid development of the neural network , an increasing need of running Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with limited computing power and memory resource. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-path adaptive fusion network. More specifically, we apply the idea of “skip connection” in ResNets to the dense block so as to effectively reserve and propagate more low-level visual features. A contiguous memory mechanism has been realized by adopting direction connections from the state of preceding dense block to all layers of current dense block in the network. Then, a multi-path adaptive fusion dense block was adopted in the up-sampling process to adaptively adjust the low-level visual feature and then to fuse with high-level semantic features . By evaluating the proposed framework on the challenging BRATS2015 dataset, it can be proven that this framework achieves state-of-the-art results by comparing with other counterpart methods. Moreover, parameters of the proposed framework are much less than most published methods.},

  abstract     = {Human identification is an important task that can help protect information security. Building deep learning models for human identification from Electrocardiogram (ECG) data is one of the highly promising technique. It has several unique advantages such as liveness detection, insensitive, easy to collect, higher security and so on. However, existing classifier-based methods only support closed-set identification, while existing matching-based methods are limited to high computational complexity . Besides, almost all methods only consider one-shot identification, which might be affected by occasional noise. In this paper, we propose CardioID to solve the above problems. CardioID learns binary codes from continuous ECG data which can identify faster than existing methods. It also supports identifying new person without the need to reconstructed or re-train the model. Besides, it can theoretically guarantee the recognition accuracy by introducing statistical hypothesis testing for making an identification decision. Experiments on real world ECG data show that CardioID can achieve 9.84\% higher identification accuracy while saving 30.90\% of running time compared with each of the second best baselines.},

Based on the idea of event-trigger and impulsive control theory, an event-based impulsive control strategy is proposed to achieve synchronization of leader–follower coupled dynamical networks, where a class of forced impulse sequence is introduced to promote the synchronization. Moreover, the possible accumulations of event-times (i.e., Zeno behaviour) in control strategy can be excluded. Unlike classical event-triggered control that involve control inputs incessantly based on the sampled information in last event-triggered instant, the proposed control inputs are only carried out at some discrete event-triggered instants. In other words, it is not necessary to activate the sensor and control computation and/or communication between leader and followers when the controls do not need attention. The proposed event-triggered conditions in control strategy can be derived by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a chaotic neural network is discussed to illustrate the application of our proposed results.},

In this paper, we establish a first-of-its-kind infrared head pose (IRHP) database and propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture IRHP-Net on the IRHP database. The IRHP database contains 145 kinds of IR head pose images of subjects, and benchmark evaluations are conducted on our database by the facial features-based standard HPE classification methods to prove the usability and effectiveness of IRHP database. To extract the adaptive features for the IR images, a novel multi-scale feature fusion descriptor is developed in the proposed IRHP-Net model. Quantitative assessments of the proposed method on the IRHP images demonstrate the significant improvements over the traditional methods.

However, deep learning networks have weak adaptability to small sample sizes.Usually, deep learning networks require tens of thousands of samples to avoid overfitting. In contrast, the kernel method can deal with small sample sizes. In this paper, we use only dozens of samples to train a successful classifier. Deep multiple kernel learning (DMKL) has emerged in recent years. It combines the ideas of deep learning and multiple kernel learning . Unfortunately, the DMKL network with a fixed structure cannot adapt to data of different dimensions and sizes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel depth-width-scaling multiple kernel learning (DWS-MKL) algorithm. It has the ability to adjust the architecture according to the input data. We optimize the estimation of leave-one-out error by using the span bound instead of the dual objective function. Finally, we choose a large number of data sets from the UCI benchmark data sets for classification tasks . We also evaluate DWS-MKL on the MNIST data set. The experimental results show that different frameworks have different performances on the same dataset. Our DWS-MKL algorithm obtains better classification results than the state-of-the-art kernel learning algorithms, as determined by a thorough comparison. The encouraging results demonstrate that our method has the potential to improve generalization performance of the model.},

Compression noise can cause significant artifacts in compressed video, such as blocking, ringing, and blurring, which seriously affects the visual quality of videos and the value of videos for content analysis. In compressed video quality enhancement, few methods based on deep learning fully consider the relationship between video content and compression noise or the possibility of uniting the encoder or the decoder to enhance the quality of compressed video. In an approach different from existing methods, we propose a video quality enhancement framework based on the distribution characteristics of compression noise. The proposed framework consists of two parts: at the encoder, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based in-loop filtering network combined with noise distribution (IFN-ND) characteristics for the I frame instead of high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard in-loop filters; at the decoder, we propose a CNN-based quality enhancement network combined with the noise distribution characteristics (PQEN-ND) for the P frames. The noise characteristics are extracted from the code stream to further improve the performance of the proposed networks. The experiments show that the proposed method can significantly improve the quality of HEVC compressed video, achieving an average 12.84\% reduction in the BD rate and up to a 1.0476 dB increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).},

To overcome this situation, most previous works tend to focus on skip-based architecture to integrate hierarchical information of different scales and layers. However, a simple concatenation of high-level features and low-level features is not all-powerful because cluttered and noisy information can cause negative consequences. Concerning the issue mentioned above, we propose a Multi-Attention guided Feature-fusion network (MAF) which can alleviate the problem from two aspects. For one thing, we use a novel Channel-wise Attention Block (CAB) to in charge of message passing layer by layer from a global view, which utilizes the semantic cues in the higher convolutional block to instruct the feature selection in the lower block. For another, a Position Attention Block (PAB) also works on integrated features to model pixel relationships and capture rich contextual dependencies. Under the guidance of multi-attention, discriminative features are selected to conduct a new end-to-end densely supervised encoder-decoder network which detects salient objects more uniformly and precisely. As the experimental results on five benchmark datasets show, our methods perform favorably against other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {High efficiency video coding (HEVC) greatly outperforms previous standards H.264/AVC in terms of coding bit rate and video quality. However, it does not take into account the human visual system (HVS), that people pay more attention to specific areas and moving objects. In this paper, we present a content-aware rate control scheme for HEVC based on static and dynamic saliency detection . The proposed strategy mainly consists of three techniques, static saliency detection , dynamic saliency detection, and adaptive bit rate allocation. Firstly, we train a deep convolution network (DCN) model to extract the static saliency map by highlighting semantically salient regions . Compared to traditional texture-based or color-based region of interest (ROI) extraction techniques, our models are more in line with the HVS. Secondly, we develop a moving object segmentation technique to automatically extract the dynamic salient regions for each frame. Furthermore, according to the fusion saliency map, a coding tree unit (CTU) level bit control technique is exploited to realize flexible and adaptive bit rate allocation. As a result, the quality of salient regions is improved by allocating more bits, while allocating fewer bits to the non-salient regions. We verified the proposed method on both the JCT-VC recommended data set and eye-tracking data set. Experiment results show that the PSNR of salient regions can improve by an average of 1.85 dB without adding bit rate burden, which significantly improves the visual experience.},

  abstract     = {Object detection is a pivotal task for many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Compared to general scenes, the objects in aerial images are typically much smaller. For this reason, most general object detectors suffer from two critical challenges while dealing with aerial images: 1) The widely exploited Feature Pyramid Network works by integrating high-level features to lower levels progressively. However, this manner does not transfer equivalent information from each level of backbone network to the generated features, and the shared detection head faces an unbalanced sources of information flow, damaging the detection accuracy. 2) Up-sampling is commonly used to expand feature resolution for feature fusion or feature aggregation. However, existing up-sampling methods are ineffective to reconstruct high resolution feature maps. To address these two challenges, two works are proposed: 1) An up-scale feature aggregation framework that fully utilizes multi-scale complementary information, and 2) a novel up-sampling method that further improve detection accuracy. These two proposals are integrated into an end-to-end single-stage object detector namely HawkNet. Extensive experiments are conducted on VisDrone-DET2018, UAVDT and DIOR datasets. Compared to the RetinaNet baseline, our HawkNet achieves absolute gains of 6.0\%, 1.2\% and 5.9\% in average precision (AP) on VisDrone-DET2018, UAVDT and DIOR datasets, respectively. For a 800 × × 1333 input on the UAVDT dataset, HawkNet with ResNet-50 backbone surpasses existing methods for single-scale inference and achieves the best performance (37.4 AP), while operating at 10.6 frames per second on a single Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU.},

  abstract     = {Missing values widely exist in time-series data owing to sensor or communication failure. It is indispensable to impute the missing data for equipment state monitoring and advanced data analysis. In this study, we propose a deep spatiotemporal time-series missing data imputation model, called LSTM-AE s , to enhance the imputation performance and handle multiple missing patterns. Generally, it is practically challenging to determine when, which, and how many sensors fail. Most previous algorithms cannot handle multiple-sensor missing data owing to insufficient attributes. As different missing patterns require different models and may appear simultaneously, it is inadvisable to employ a large number of models for handling all these patterns. A deep auto-encoder (DAE) can eliminate the diversity of missing patterns by restoring the information from the sensor data. The proposed model combines DAE and LSTM for extracting spatio-temporal features to estimate missing values in multiple time series. Moreover, a smoothing regularization term is added into the combined model, leading to a more stable estimation. Experiments are conducted on three types of sensor data: the Tennessee Eastman process simulation data, gas turbine data from the offshore oil Corporation, and power plant simulation data. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique is effective for different missing patterns and provides more accurate predictions than the existing techniques.},

The LBP features extract image texture information and then catch the small movements of the faces, which can improve the network performance. Attention mechanism can make the neural network pay more attention to useful features. We combine LBP features and attention mechanism to enhance the attention model to obtain better results. In addition, we collected and labelled a new facial expression dataset of seven expressions from 35 subjects aged from 20 to 25. For each subject, we captured both RGB images and depth images with a Microsoft Kinect sensor. For each image type, there are 245 image sequences, each of which contains 110 images, resulting in 26,950 images in total.

All subnetworks work in parallel to process the allocated features, and the structure of each subnetwork is designed to be self-organized by using a growing and pruning algorithm based on the contribution of hidden neurons. An improved Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm using a sliding window is conducted to update the parameters of SORMNN, which makes SORMNN available for solving online problems. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, SORMNN is tested on chaotic benchmark time series prediction, four UCI benchmark problems and a practical problem for biochemical oxygen demand prediction in wastewater treatment process. Experimental results demonstrate that SORMNN exhibits both a higher training accuracy and a better generalization ability for nonlinear system modeling than other modular neural networks, and the inter-module connections have a positive effect on the superior performance of the proposed model and can make the network structure compact.},

Besides, there exist complex dependencies among subtasks. For instance, law article prediction could guide charge prediction and term of penalty prediction. Nonetheless, the majority of previous approaches usually capture in-depth semantic information of fact description inadequately or neglect the dependencies among subtasks. In this paper, we propose a novel gated hierarchical multi-task learning network, named GHE-DAP, to jointly model multiple subtasks in JDP. Specifically, GHE-DAP combines a Gated Hierarchical Encoder (GHE) to extract in-depth semantic information of fact description from multiple perspectives, and a Dependencies Auto-learning Predictor (DAP) to learn the dependencies among subtasks dynamically.

The need for an automated and accurate anomaly detection method for PCG has thus become imminent. To determine the state-of-the-art PCG classification algorithm , 48 international teams competed in the PhysioNet (CinC) Challenge in 2016 over the largest benchmark dataset with 3126 records with the classification outputs, normal (N), abnormal (A) and unsure – too noisy (U). In this study, our aim is to push this frontier further; however, we focus deliberately on the anomaly detection problem while assuming a reasonably high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) on the records. By using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks trained with a novel data purification approach, we aim to achieve the highest detection performance and real-time processing ability with significantly lower delay and computational complexity . The experimental results over the high-quality subset of the same benchmark dataset show that the proposed approach achieves both objectives. Furthermore, our findings reveal the fact that further improvements indeed require a personalized (patient-specific) approach to avoid major drawbacks of a global PCG classification approach .},

In recent years, most of deep learning based methods utilize multi-level features and obtain inferred saliency map in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, how to learn and represent powerful features is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel FCN-like approach named attentive feature integration network (AFINet) for pixel-wise salient object detection, which results saliency maps with explicit boundary and uniform highlighted regions. Specifically, it adopts feature enhancement module (FEM) to extract rich and enhanced features from backbone net. A feature discrimination module (FDM) is designed to utilize the predicted saliency map generated by deeper layer to help shallower layer learn useful and discriminative attentive features. Moreover, we introduce the saliency information from deeper layer to the shallower one in saliency prediction module (SPM), which helps shallow side outputs accurately locate salient regions . In addition, we design a saliency fusion module (SFM) to integrate different side outputs for utilizing multi-level features. Finally, a fully connected CRF scheme can be optimally incorporated for obtaining saliency results with a higher accuracy. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons and evaluations conducted on five publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach compares favorably against 17 state-of-the-art approaches.},

Recently, there has been more and more attention to underdetermined BSS. In the study of underdetermined BSS, it is a challenging problem to separate the source signals efficiently while without knowing the number of sources. On the one hand, the number of sources is unknown in practice. On the other hand, most traditional blind separation algorithms encounter highly computational complexity leading to poor separation performance. To remedy the shortcomings of traditional algorithms, in this paper, a novel algorithm based on p -norm-like ( l ( 0 (l(0&amp;lt;p≤1)) diversity measures is proposed to solve the underdetermined BSS problem. First of all, we propose an improved information theory criteria method to detect the number of sources in the underdetermined case.

In many real-life applications, however, informative user profiles are not available. Instead, the system recommends by relying on the current user activities within an ongoing session, leading to the emergence of session-based recommendation methods. Among techniques used in such situations, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) present a natural choice thanks to their ability to model the order of session events and capture long-term dependencies. Recently, methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also shown their potential in modeling session data, especially in extracting complex local patterns that are predictive of the user target. In this work, we propose a recurrent convolutional architecture that takes the advantages of both complex local features extracted by CNNs and long-term dependencies learned by RNNs from session sequences. Our model has two main layers: the lower layer consists of convolutional filters applied over consecutive session event embeddings, and the upper layer is a gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN that takes as input the CNN’s output. This hybrid approach provides a flexible and unified network architecture for modeling various important features of session sequences. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over pure RNNs and CNNs models as well as state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the set-membership state estimation problem for a class of artificial neural networks subject to time-delays and mixed malicious attacks . Both Denial-of-Service (DoS) and deception attacks are taken into consideration. The objective of the addressed problem is to design the state estimation algorithm for the artificial neural networks under investigation in spite of the existence of the malicious mixed attacks. By means of the set-membership approach in combination with certain convex optimization algorithm , the sufficient condition is established for the existence of the desired state estimator in terms of the solvability of a recursive matrix inequality. The resulting state estimation error is confined within certain pre-specified ellipsoidal region. An optimization problem is then formulated with the purpose of seeking the filtering parameters guaranteeing the locally optimal performance. Finally, the developed theoretical results are verified via an illustrative numerical example.},

However, previous approaches suffer from limited timeliness since they overlook dynamic features of items and temporal semantic information, which results in inappropriate prediction. In this study, we propose an attention-based model named Timeliness Enhanced Attention Network (TEAN). It first extracts features of user and item from static and dynamic perspectives and then employs temporal semantic information by a time-cross mechanism. Our model is capable of ranking items based on timeliness enhanced features. Besides, we apply a pre-training method based on word2vec to learn embedding vector for users, items and temporal semantic information in an elegant way. Experiments on three datasets of different domains demonstrate that our approach improves performance opposed to other methods.},

  abstract     = {In general, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have a network structure with special methods applied to neuron models and information transmission to mimic humans biologically. However, the existing SNN structures have two problems, such as fixed existing Artificial Neural Network structures and difficulty in learning due to lack of spike information during information transfer. Recently, many approaches of learning SNNs have been proposed in order to alleviate those two drawbacks. However, it is very difficult to overcome the drawbacks only by the learning method without the fundamental solution for the structure. In order to solve the problem of structure and learning method, we propose a novel flexible network construction method using neurogenesis-based cell proliferation concept and Triple Simultaneous- Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (TS-STDP) which is improved learning method through neuroplasticity-based spike timing. We build the network flexibly and automatically by employing the concept that not only one neuron exists in the neural network, but also that various cells proliferate and transform from stem cells to function. In addition, TS-STDP is designed by considering the correlation of signal response among several neurons to solve the lack of information due to spike sparsity , which is a disadvantage of STDP. In the experimental section, we demonstrate and analyze our method using Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology image data. Our method is 2.7× better in memory efficiency and 1.7× better in computational efficiency than the existing method. In particular, the research that automatically constructs the network structure is the first to my knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial networks have been used to learn transferable representations in many domain adaptation methods. However, there is no theoretical guarantee that two distributions are identical, even if the discriminator is fully confused. Therefore, a more elaborate domain adversarial method to better align distributions is desirable. In this paper, we propose two groups of multiple adversarial networks for domain-invariant and class-distinguishable feature learning : i) class-wise domain adversarial networks based on sample locations and ii) sample adversarial networks. We analyze the impact of the sample’s intra-class distribution on transfer learning and reveal that the distance between a sample and its cluster center affects the role of that sample in transfer learning. Domain adversarial learning is conducted separately on samples located near the cluster center (central samples) and samples located far away from cluster center (non-central samples) in order to align the distributions of the source domain and target domain better. However, separate domain adversarial learning on central and non-central samples ignores the relationship between them, because all these samples belong to the same class. We therefore propose a method called sample adversarial learning to convert the distribution of non-central samples to the distribution of central samples. In this way, the relationship between central samples and non-central samples is rebuilt. Sample adversarial learning solves the problem that arises in the sperate domain adversarial learning. Sample adversarial learning also enables us to obtain a class-distinguishable feature representation because of the reduction in intra-class distance. Experimental results show that our method extracts more transferable and class-distinguishable features than existing methods and achieves start-of-the-art results on several datasets. The significant contribution of this paper is to show how separate domain adversarial learning based on sample locations and sample adversarial learning together enhance positive transfer by maximally matching the multimodal structures underlying the data distributions across domains.},

Specifically, the proposed framework consists of an identity agent, an age agent and a generative adversarial network . It takes two images as input – an identity reference and an age reference – and outputs a new image that shares corresponding features with each.

This paper proposes a novel architecture called Attention-based Mixture of Experts (Att-MoE) for nuclear and cytoplasmic segmentation in fluorescent histology images, which integrates multiple Expert networks using a single Gating network. Expert networks complement each other to accomplish sub-tasks under the direction of the Gating network, which enforces the adaptive use of multiple networks to complete the segmentation task . The Att-MoE also introduces attention gates and residual blocks in the Expert networks to improve segmentation accuracy . The attention gate is used to emphasize useful features and suppress irrelevant features for segmentation in a self-adaptive manner. On the other hand, residual blocks are employed to enhance gradient flow in training and improve the stability and segmentation accuracy of the network. Experiments on fluorescent histology images of mouse liver show that Att-MoE is superior to recent segmentation methods and has the potential for cancer diagnosis based on histology images.},

While bottom-up signals are thought to be critical in generating perception, functions of top-down signals have not been clearly delineated. One popular theory is that top-down inputs modify the activity of specific cell assemblies to modulate responses to bottom-up inputs. However, a different line of studies proposes that not all top-down inputs are specifically delivered. As the leading theories cannot account for nonspecific top-down inputs, we seek potential functions of nonspecific top-down signals using network models in our study. Our simulation results suggest that top-down inputs can regulate low-order area responses by providing temporal information even without spatial specificity. Specifically, the temporal information in nonspecific top-down inputs can weaken the undesired bottom-up connections, contributing to bottom-up connections’ learning. Further, we found that cortical rhythms (synchronous oscillatory neural responses) are critical in the proposed learning process of bottom-up connections in our model.},

It has recently been validated that reranking can achieve remarkable performance improvements in person ReID systems. However, current reranking approaches either require feedback from users or suffer from burdensome computational costs. In this paper, we propose to exploit a density-adaptive smooth kernel technique to achieve efficient and effective reranking. Specifically, we adopt a smooth kernel function to formulate the neighbor relationships among data samples with a density-adaptive parameter. Based on this new formulation, we present two simple yet effective reranking methods, termed inverse density-adaptive kernel based reranking (inv-DAKR) and bidirectional density-adaptive kernel based reranking (bi-DAKR), in which the local density information in the vicinity of each gallery sample is elegantly exploited. Moreover, we extend the proposed inv-DAKR and bi-DAKR methods to incorporate the available extra probe samples and demonstrate that when and why these extra probe samples are able to improve the local neighborhood and thus further refine the ranking results. Extensive experiments are conducted on six benchmark datasets, including: PRID450s, VIPeR, CUHK03, GRID, Market-1501 and Mars. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposals are effective and efficient.},

  abstract     = {In generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), it is imperative to solve the bias problem due to extreme data imbalance between seen and unseen classes, i.e., unseen classes are misclassified as seen classes. We alleviate the bias problem by generating synthetic images of unseen classes. The most challenging part is that existing GAN methods are only focused on producing authentic seen images, so realistic unseen images cannot be generated. Specifically, we propose a novel zero-shot generative adversarial network (ZSGAN) which learns the relationship between images and attributes shared by seen and unseen classes. Unlike existing works that generate synthetic features of unseen classes, we can generate more generalizable realistic unseen images . For instance, generated unseen images can be used for zero-shot detection, segmentation, and image translation since images have spatial information.

  abstract     = {Distance metric learning aims to learn a measure of the pairwise distance between data instances, which is essential for various machine learning algorithms and applications. However, existing linear metric learning methods based on linear transformations fail to capture nonlinear relationships between instances, while most existing kernel-based metric learning algorithms may ignore the correlation between the kernel function and the target learning task during model selection, which results in a suboptimal selection of kernels. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a method named Kernel Alignment based Metric Learning with Random Fourier Approximation ( KAML RFA KAMLRFA ). Specifically, on one hand, we utilize the random Fourier features to approximate the shift-invariant kernel function for distance metric learning. On the other hand, we attempt to maximize the degree of agreement between the kernel function and the target learning task. In this way, distance metric learning is performed in a discriminative feature space. Compared with those kernel metric learning algorithms whose kernel functions fall into a suboptimal, KAML RFA KAMLRFA achieves the optimal kernel function for the target task and improves classification accuracy . We develop an efficient solution to solve the proposed optimization problem . Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets including NUS-WIDE-LITE, USPS, MNIST, LETTER and 10 UCI datasets to verify the effectiveness of KAML RFA KAMLRFA compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

The spatial pooling purpose is to combine neighbouring descriptors to obtain a single descriptor for a given region (local or global). The resultant combined vector must be as discriminant as possible, in other words, must contain relevant information, while removing irrelevant and confusing details. Maximum and average are the most common aggregation functions used in the pooling step. To improve the aggregation of relevant information without degrading their discriminative power for image classification , we introduce a simple but effective scheme based on Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) aggregation operators. We present a method to learn the weights of the OWA aggregation operator in a Bag-of-Words framework and in Convolutional Neural Networks, and provide an extensive evaluation showing that OWA based pooling outperforms classical aggregation operators.},

Our network mainly consists of three subnetworks : ground plane estimation network, region proposal network and adaptive fusion network. The ground plane estimation network extracts features of point cloud and predicts the parameters of a plane which are used for generating abundant 3D anchors. The region proposal network generates features of image and bird’s eye view maps to output region proposals. To integrate heterogeneous image and point cloud features, the adaptive fusion network explicitly adjusts the intensity of multiple local features and achieves the orientation consistency between image and LiDAR data by introducing an azimuth-aware fusion module.

The performance drops significantly when datasets are unlabeled, which limits the scalability of Re-ID algorithms in practical applications. Despite some unsupervised methods are proposed to address the scalability problem of Re-ID, it’s hard to learn discriminative feature representations due to the lack of pairwise labels in different camera views. To overcome this problem, we propose an end-to-end network named Adaptive Attention-Aware Network for unsupervised person re-identification. Specifically, we propose a novel adaptive attention-aware module that could be easily embedded into Re-ID architecture. The proposed module focuses on learning strong expressive relationship among channels of feature maps, and alleviating the key problems of Re-ID, e.g., occlusion and local deformation. In addition, we extract the camera-invariant features by adopting camera-style transfer feature learning since matching pairs in Re-ID suffers from appearance changes under different camera views. Besides, unsupervised hard negative mining is introduced to learn large intra-person appearance variance and discriminate high inter-person appearance similarity in an unlabeled target dataset with an auxiliary labeled dataset. Comprehensive experiments on three public available Re-ID datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art results of unsupervised Re-ID and is competitive with supervised learning.},

The residual scaling factor used in the Inception-ResNet module is a manually set fixed value. We believe that changing the value to a trainable parameter and initializing it to a small value can improve the stability of the model training. We further adopted a small trick of alternating the ReLU activation function with the Leaky ReLU and PReLU. The proposed model slightly increased the number of training parameters but improved training stability and performance significantly. Extensive experiments are conducted on VGGFace2, MS1MV2, IJBB and LFW datasets.

Two paralleled branches are followed with first ten layers of VGG16 model to extract different scales features from input image. And a dynamic weighting strategy is used to fuse the density maps generated from the different branches to get the final high quality density map. In addition, our model adopts attention mechanism to modify the density map of each branch. Our method has been evaluated on different datasets (ShanghaiTech, WorldExpo’10, UCF-QRNF and UCF_CC_50).

Though a few works has discussed this problem, the function of channel-wise features is still not sufficiently exploited. For investigating the beneficial effect of channel-wise feature on improving details representation ability, we design a Hybrid Pyramid Pooling (HPP) structure to explicitly exploit the channel-wise features. Through utilizing different scales of depthwise dilated convolution, segmentation networks can fully utilize the superiority of channel-wise features to improve the details representation ability. For deeply developing the advantages of the channel-wisely calculated features by HPP, we design another Stacked Pyramid Structure (SPS), which contains stacked pyramid pooling structures. The SPS distributes sufficient sampling points in each finely divided sampling area, and fuses features from a large range of receptive fields to produce rich feature representation. Finally, the combination of HPP and SPS can not only maintains both the advantages of features calculated from a particular channel and all input channels, but also provides sufficiently enriched receptive fields for depicting details in the final result.},

  abstract     = {It is a prevailing trend that the user-generated content (UGC) on social media is shifting toward mobile video and micro content. Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition extract the opinions expressed in UGC and are important to understand the fast-growing mobile micro-videos. Although extensive research efforts have been devoted to it, most of the existing studies pre-processed the video before extracting sentiment features, pre-sampling as an example. Due to the rather unstructured nature of user-generated videos and the sparsely expressed emotions, sampling before sentiment analysis can remove visual contents important to understand the video. In this paper, a novel unsupervised sentiment key frame extraction (SKFE) model based on low-rank and sparse representation is proposed. Sparsity is the important characteristic distinct to a video frame. The low-rank constraint is helpful to improve the robustness to noise and outliers. The l 2 , 1 l2,1 -norm sparsity is adopted to improve the robustness via different indexes running through the feature dimensions and among the video frames. To better characterize the relationship between the local features and alleviate the sensitiveness of sparse coding, a regularization term based on the Laplacian matrix is introduced to preserve the consistency of sparse codes for similar local features . The experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SKFE model.},

Classical CS algorithms using the Bayesian framework generally impose a sparseness-promoting prior on the signal, which may not characterize the real signals with diversity. Moreover, estimating the parameters involved in the prior is challenging especially for non-i.i.d. signals. In this paper, we propose an efficient prior-agnostic Bayesian matching pursuit for sparse signal recovery, which avoids the risk of imposing mismatched prior on the signals and enjoys lower complexity than Bayesian approaches due to the elimination of prior parameter estimation. Specifically, we utilize the noise model and the reduced exponential embedded family (EEF) to obtain an approximate likelihood of interest, and then find the most dominant supports with maximum approximate likelihoods in a greedy manner to give an approximate minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate for the sparse signal. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves lower normalized mean squared error (NMSE) while higher efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

The purpose of text-independent speaker verification is to determine whether two given uncontrolled utterances originate from the same speaker or not. Extracting speech features for each speaker using deep neural networks is a promising direction to explore and a straightforward solution is to train the discriminative feature extraction network by using a metric learning loss function. However, a single loss function often has certain limitations. Thus, we use deep multi-metric learning to address the problem and introduce three different losses for this problem, i.e., triplet loss, n-pair loss and angular loss. The three loss functions work in a cooperative way to train a feature extraction network equipped with Residual connections and squeeze-and-excitation attention. We conduct experiments on the large-scale VoxCeleb2 dataset, which contains over a million utterances from over 6 , 000 6,000 speakers, and the proposed deep neural network obtains an equal error rate of 3.48\% 3.48\% , which is a very competitive result.

However, existing approaches model the temporal and spatial features of traffic flow inadequately. To address these limitations, a novel deep learning traffic forecasting framework based on graph attention network (GAT) and temporal convolutional network (TCN) is presented in this paper, termed as graph attention temporal convolutional networks (GATCN). More specifically, GATCN deal with the spatial features by GAT, and the temporal features by TCN. The layer fused by GAT and TCN enables the proposed model to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics that lie in traffic flow, while considering exogenous factors. In addition, nodes in the graph can capture the information of their neighborhoods by stacking multiple layers. Precision and robustness of the proposed method have been evaluated through testing on the real-world dataset. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other baselines.},

  abstract     = {The exploitation of brain signals for biometric recognition purposes has received significant attention from the scientific community in the last decade, with most of the efforts so far devoted to the quest for discriminative information within electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Yet, currently-achievable recognition rates are still not comparable with those granted by more-commonly-used biometric characteristics, posing an issue for the practical deployment of EEG-based recognition in real-life applications. Within this regard, the present study investigates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in extracting distinctive features from EEG signals. Both convolutional and recurrent neural networks , as well as their combinations, are employed as strategies to derive personal identifiers from the collected EEG data. In order to assess the robustness of the considered techniques, an extensive set of experimental tests is conducted under very challenging conditions, trying to determine whether it is feasible to identify subjects through their brain signals regardless the performed mental task, and comparing acquisitions collected at a temporal distance greater than one year. The obtained results suggest that the proposed networks are actually able to exploit the dynamic temporal behavior of EEG signals to achieve high-level accuracy for brain-based biometric recognition.},

  abstract     = {Micro-expression, for its high objectivity in emotion detection, has emerged to be a promising modality in affective computing . Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully introduced into the micro-expression recognition area. Whilst the higher recognition accuracy achieved, substantial challenges in micro-expression recognition remain. The existence of micro expression in small-local areas on face and limited size of available databases still constrain the recognition accuracy on such emotional facial behavior . In this work, to tackle such challenges, we propose a novel attention mechanism called micro-attention cooperating with residual network . Micro-attention enables the network to learn to focus on facial areas of interest covering different action units. Moreover, coping with small datasets, the micro-attention is designed without adding noticeable parameters while a simple yet efficient transfer learning approach is together utilized to alleviate the overfitting risk. With extensive experimental evaluations on three benchmarks (CASMEII, SAMM and SMIC) and post-hoc feature visualizations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed micro-attention and push the boundary of automatic recognition of micro-expression.},

In this article, a neural fuzzy-based model predictive tracking scheme (NFMPC) for reliable tracking control is proposed to the developed four wheel-legged robot, and the fuzzy neural network approximation is applied to estimate the unknown physical interaction and external dynamics of the robot system. Meanwhile, the advanced parallel mechanism of the four wheel-legged robot (BIT-NAZA) is introduced. Finally, co-simulation and experiment results using the BIT-NAZA robot derived from the proposed hybrid control strategy indicate that the methodology can achieve satisfactory tracking performance in terms of accuracy and stability. This research can provide theoretical and engineering guidance for lateral stability of intelligent robots under unknown disturbances and uncertain nonlinearities, and facilitate the control performance of the wheel-legged robot in a practical system.},

Glottal variations from speech production representing the vocal folds behavior will be mainly discussed. We believe that emotion of the human subject has specific impact on the behavior of the vocal folds, which may result in the variations in glottal flow. This paper investigates the physiological characteristics of the vocal folds through variation in the glottal flow under different emotions. A modified algorithm, Pitch Synchronous Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering using Average Magnitude Difference Function based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (AMDFEMD-PSIAIF), is proposed to estimate the glottal flow. Glottal flow is discussed and measured by parameters representing the variations in the vibration behavior of the vocal folds. The physical parameters characterizing the muscle tension and viscosity of the vocal folds are estimated using a speech production model, and a fitting method using the glottal flow is proposed. Through an evaluation on a dataset containing over 1200 voice signals, the glottal and physical parameters are measured to verify the variation mode in vocal folds vibration. We obtain the true positive rate and the average sensitivity of each 9 parameter in 6 different emotional modes. Experimental results show that vocal folds present obvious physical changes when under different emotional modes. The CT muscle of the vocal folds is contracting for fear, happy, angry and surprise mode. The TA is relaxing for happy, angry and sad, while contracting when the speaker is under surprise. Fear and surprise make the surface of the vocal folds sticker, while viscosity reduction occurs when the speaker is experiencing sadness. Therefore, the vibration mechanism and physiological properties of the vocal folds corresponding to emotion modes are preliminarily explored.},

To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel model called Randomized Multi-Label Subproblems Concatenation via Error Correcting Output Codes (RMSC). In order to reduce the imbalance problem and enhance the diversity between base classifiers , in our model, the original multi-label problem is transformed into an ensemble of many multi-label sub-problems and the one-vs-all encoding strategy is conducted on these sub-problems and finally corresponding coding matrices are concatenated into a whole coding matrix.

Besides, the Conv-LSTM and FC-LSTM are employed to handle the long-duration sequential features with different temporal context information. To reinforce the spatial-temporal attention ability, a temporal attention module (TAM) and a joint spatial-temporal attention module (JSTAM) are implemented. Through the principle components analysis (PCA) and features fusion, the potential of STDAN is effectively explored and weighted.

However, current prognosis using multi-sensor data faces the following challenges: (i) Manual feature selection and extraction and exploration of degradation failure mechanism for a complex domain require a substantial amount of human labor and expertise from the practitioner, which is seldom available. (ii) Data fusion and prognosis are usually divided into two separate steps, resulting in the lack of intrinsic relationship between the two tasks. (iii) The end-to-end prediction methods directly based on deep learning behave like the black-box and provide no information for degradation progression. To overcome these drawbacks, a prediction framework comprising two deep learning models is proposed in this paper. Through the proposed supervised joint training scheme, the framework not only provides a continuous visualization progression of system degradation but also ensures that the generated fusion signal effectively performs in RUL prediction. As a framework application, a joint model of RUL estimation based on an ordinary long short-term memory network is designed. In the experiment section, a simulation study is firstly performed to show its RUL prediction performance. Then, a case study is conducted using two public experimental data sets (the aircraft turbofan engine data and the milling). Furthermore, the advantage of the proposed joint model is validated by carrying out a comparison with other methods based on the same experimental data sets.},

Sometimes experts have to observe continuous frames to determine the existence of an impurity. In recent years, region-based convolutional neural networks have gained incremental successes in common object detection tasks. However, sequential impurity detections present more challenging issues than detecting targets in a single frame, because consecutive motions and appearance changes of impurities cannot be captured using those common object detectors. In this paper, we propose a simple and controllable ensemble architecture to alleviate this problem. Specifically, a siamese fusion network is used to generate impurity proposals, then an attention model based on visual features and trajectories is proposed to localize a unique region proposal in each frame, finally, a sequential region proposal classifier using a long-term recurrent convolutional network is applied to refine impurity detection performances.

In this paper, a cascade based tracking algorithm is proposed to promote the robustness of the tracker and reduce time consumption. First, we propose a novel deep network for feature extraction. Since some pruning strategies are applied, the speed of the feature extraction stage can be more than 50 frames per second. Then, a cascade tracker named DCCT is presented to improve the performance and enhance the robustness by utilizing both texture and semantic features . Similar to the cascade classifier , the proposed DCCT tracker consists of several weaker trackers. Each weak tracker rejects some false candidates of the tracked object, and the final tracking results are obtained by synthesizing these weak trackers. Intensive experiments are conducted in some public datasets and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Classification is a fundamental technique in hyperspectral image understanding field, which is to give each pixel a specific semantic label based on its characteristics automatically. Recently, even though convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been applied to hyperspectral image classification, their performances are not in accordance with our expectation. The reason is that, most of the existing methods can not exploit the intrinsic characteristics of different pixels in hyperspectral image effectively, they often ignore the inherent relationships among different spatial pixels, different spectral bands and different category dependencies. Specifically, the relationships among different spatial pixels mean that the similarities of attribute and location information among different pixels. The relationships among different spectral bands mean that the different contributions of them to the final classification. The relationships among different categories mainly mean that the severe sample imbalance problem in hyperspectral image classification task . To address the aforementioned problems, a deep convolutional network based multidimensional relation learning method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose a weighted gaussian mask based spatial relation learning module to alleviate the spatial diffusion issue. Besides, we propose a channel attention alike spectral relation learning module to alleviate the interferences from noisy and redundant bands. Additionally, we propose an integrated decision based category relation learning module to alleviate the ill-conditioned classifying issue from imbalanced samples. Finally, we test the proposed method on four public and challenging datasets, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.},

  abstract     = {Differential network analysis has become an important approach in identifying driver genes in development and disease. However, most studies capture only local features of the underlying gene-regulatory network topology. These approaches are vulnerable to noise and other changes which mask driver-gene activity. Therefore, methods are urgently needed which can separate the impact of true regulatory elements from stochastic changes and downstream effects. We propose the differential network flow (DNF) method to identify key regulators of progression in development or disease. Given the network representation of consecutive biological states, DNF quantifies the essentiality of each node by differences in the distribution of network flow, which are capable of capturing comprehensive topological differences from local to global feature domains. DNF achieves more accurate driver-gene identification than other state-of-the-art methods when applied to four human datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and three single-cell RNA-seq datasets of murine neural and hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, we predict key regulators of crosstalk between separate networks underlying both neuronal differentiation and the progression of neurodegenerative disease , among which App is predicted as a driver gene of neural stem cell differentiation . Our method is a new approach for quantifying the essentiality of genes across networks of different biological states.},

EMD is used to decompose input time series data into components with several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual, to capture the trends in the input data. SVR is used to forecast separately IMFs and the residual owing to its effectiveness in solving nonlinear regression and time series problems. The KH algorithm is used to select the parameters in the SVR models. The Tent chaotic mapping function is hybridized with the KH algorithm to prevent premature convergence and increase the accuracy of the whole model. Two real-world datasets from the New South Wales (NSW, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, USA) are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed EMD-SVRCKH model.

  abstract     = {In recent years, many Unsupervised Domain Adaptation ( UDA ) methods have been proposed to tackle the domain shift problem. Most existing UDA methods are derived for Close Set Domain Adaptation ( CSDA ) in which source and target domains are assumed to share the same label space. However, target domain may contain unknown class different from the known ones in the source domain in practice, i.e., Open Set Domain Adaptation ( OSDA ). Due to the presence of unknown class, aligning the whole distribution of the source and target domain for OSDA as in the previous methods will lead to negative transfer. Existing methods developed for OSDA attempt to assign smaller weights to target samples of unknown class. Despite promising performance achieved by existing methods, the samples of the unknown class are still used for distribution alignment, which makes the model suffer from the risk of negative transfer. Instead of reweighting, this paper presents a novel method namely Thresholded Domain Adversarial Network ( ThDAN ), which progressively selects transferable target samples for distribution alignment. Based on the fact that samples from the known classes must be more transferable than target samples of the unknown one, we derive a criterion to quantify the transferability by constructing classifiers to categorize known classes and to discriminate unknown class. In ThDAN, an adaptive threshold is calculated by averaging transferability scores of source domain samples to select target samples for training. The threshold is tweaked progressively during the training process so that more and more target samples from the known classes can be correctly selected for adversarial training . Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation and open set recognition approaches on benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {The acceleratinnsional nodal attributes in various data mining tasks highlights the significance of feature selection on the networked data. Due to the lack of class labels of nodes, many feature selection methods are proposed in semi-supervised or unsupervised manners in various scenarios instead of supervised ones. More often than not, features and (pseudo) labels are correlated in a nonlinear way that is more intricate than linearity. In these circumstances, the vast majority of existing linear algorithms could not work well since they select features according to how well the feature can linearly explain the variance of labels. Moreover, although some methods focus on nonlinear feature selection, with the neglect of the link relations between data, they are difficult to be applied to attributed networks directly. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve nonlinear feature selection on attributed networks with the help of both labeled and unlabeled data . Methodologically, we first propose a novel semi-supervised nonlinear framework FS-GCN based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to select high-quality features, which can elaborately catch the nonlinear dependency between nodal attributes and class labels. To verify the importance of nonlinearity precisely, we further explore the possibility of totally removing the label information so that a variant of FS-GCN is proposed in the unsupervised form, referred to as UFS-GCN. Besides, experimental results on several real-world datasets validate the superiority of FS-GCN as well as UFS-GCN in terms of the quality of selected features, suggesting their robustness in the condition of extremely low even zero label ratio.},

Due to the close topological relevance between communities and structure hole spanners, the two tasks can work out synchronously, but most studies address the two tasks independently. In recent years, deep learning has been applied in the field of community detection. However, so far no deep learning model can solve both community and SH detection at the same framework. In this paper, we first analyze why a previous model named Harmony Modularity (HAM) can working for joint community and SH spanners detection task, which is the only one previous work that solve two task synchronously. Then we discuss the deficiency of HAM. For purpose of overcoming the shortcoming of HAM, we propose a deep learning model for finding both communities and structural holes simultaneously. Because the main framework used in our model is graph convolutional neural network based Auto-Encoder, we shorten it for ComSHAE. Specifically, ComSHAE learn the eigenvectors of weighted Spectral Ratio-Cut Partitioning and the nonlinear representation of adjacent matrix. We infer the community assignments and top-k SH spanners from eigenvectors . Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real networks show that our model outperform the baseline HAM and some state-of-the-art methods. When compare ComSHAE with HAM on synthetic data, ComSHAE shows great effects but HAM can not work. We use Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) to measure performance on detecting communites. ComSHAE shows abort 0.05 NMI improvement than HAM on real data and abort 0.63 NMI improvement on synthetic data. We measure the cross-community transmission capacity through structural hole influence index (SHII).

  abstract     = {Facial landmark tracking often adopts static models to generically fit per frame of video. This is considered inappropriate since such models ignore the informative correlation between previous and current frames. Moreover, most of these methods fail to balance the speed and accuracy for video-based facial landmark tracking simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an efficient online framework for video-based face alignment, named Incrementally Cascaded Broad Learning framework (ICBL). ICBL aims to continuously enhance the prediction capability of tracking model for sequential data. It is capable of learning the spatial appearance on specific-person statistics from continuous facial frames and using such knowledge to incrementally tune a cascade of regressors in parallel. To achieve this goal, we approximate the facial shape space by sampling from a dynamic distribution which is continuously updated by person-specific statistics from the tracked facial frames. This dramatically facilitates cascade regression to incrementally update all cascade-regressors in parallel, thus allowing a fast update of the whole model. Furthermore, we successfully incorporate both the linear and non-linear mappings into our parallel cascade framework and introduce Broad Learning (BL) algorithm as a solution for them simultaneously. Experimental results on the most popular and large-scale benchmark for facial landmark tracking show highly competitive performance of proposed ICBL in comparisons with the state-of-the-arts.

In practical applications, the fuzzy rule base extracted from numerical data is often incomplete, which makes a fuzzy system less robust. To address this problem, a non-linear function is used as the consequent of each fuzzy rule based on fuzzy-rule clustering to enhance the approximation ability of the fuzzy rule base. In addition, exact matching of fuzzy rules is employed based on the fuzzy rule’s antecedent for prediction. By doing so, only one rule will be triggered in each layer, which is very efficient. Experimental results from two simulated functions and three practical applications confirm that our proposed multi-layer fuzzy model can outperform other well-established fuzzy models in terms of accuracy and robustness without sacrificing efficiency.},

The propagation of information in the modular brain network can be modeled by a feedforward network (FFN). Although studies in this area have yielded many important results, neuronal diversity has rarely been considered. In the current work, we investigate the complex interactions between the intrinsic properties of neurons and the FFN structure in the propagation of spiking activity. Here, four typical types of cortical neurons reproduced by the Izhikevich neuron model are introduced. A homogeneous FFN composed of a single type of excitatory neuron (regular spiking, mixed model, or tonic bursting) can propagate spiking activity. However, an FFN with fast spiking neurons does not propagate spiking activity. By modifying the network structure and synaptic weights , the spiking propagation of the homogeneous FFNs can vary from synchronous transmission (with a high firing rate) to asynchronous transmission (with a low firing rate). Among the homogeneous FFNs, both the firing rate and the synchrony of the FFN with tonic bursting neurons are the highest, but those of the FFN with regular spiking neurons is lowest, even when implementing the same FFN structure. For the FFN with mixed neuronal types, interestingly, the spiking propagation is very sensitive to the composition of the four types of neurons. By introducing fast spiking neurons into the homogeneous FFN composed of excitatory neurons, spiking propagation can be modified from synchronous to asynchronous. Similarly, changing the proportion of any of the types of neuron affects the spiking propagation, even for very small changes. The underlying mechanism of these observed results has also been discussed.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a strategy for network simplification and acceleration. First, we propose to generate a suitable resized image using multiscale patching in the first convolutional layer, which can then be used for the rest of the network. We use p convolutional filters that operate on patches of size m × n, and we first select all the possible non-superposed m × n patches from the available images. If the number of such patches is not sufficient, the remaining ones are collected using scales a × b or c × d such that ab = cd  = mn or a = 2 m or b = 2n. Patches generated from the former condition are directly extracted from the images, while the downsampled results are used in the latter case. We also introduce a 2-dimensional decomposition for patch compression, by stacking all the available image patches along the columns and applying a 2D PCA decomposition. Finally, a layer weight decomposition technique followed by module-based finetuning is adopted, for a new fast module-based CNN model. Extensive evaluations using public data sets like MNIST, Pascal VOC, and WebCASIA, and with different state-of-the art CNN architectures like Open-Face, VGG and DarkNet verify that our proposed model is able to accelerate the training process and even to provide higher classification accuracies for small-sized datasets. We obtain 8\% increase in Top-1 and Top-5 recognition rates, and 5\% increase in F1 score over general interpolation-based resizing.},

Instead of using σ σ -modification to design the adaptive laws, gradient descent algorithm is adopted to train the weight parameters of neural networks such that high function approximation precision can be achieved. By resorting to Lyapunov stability criterion, it can be proved that the reference signals are tracked by the aircraft’s outputs with small errors.

Using landmarks from the input frontal and profile mugshots of a subject, our method reconstructs his ⧹ ⧹ ⧹ her 3D face shape via either linear or nonlinear regressors. The texture of the mugshot images is mapped to the reconstructed 3D face shape via an efficient seamless texture recovery scheme. Compared with existing 3D face reconstruction methods, the proposed method more effectively utilizes the three-view mugshot face images collected during booking. The reconstructed 3D faces are used to generate realistic multi-view face images to enlarge the gallery and facilitate arbitrary view face recognition. Evaluation experiments have been done on BFM and Bosphorus databases in terms of reconstruction accuracy , and on Multi-PIE and Color FERET databases in terms of recognition accuracy. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the 3D face reconstruction error of the best competitive method from 2.31 mm to 1.88 mm, and improve the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning based face matchers by as much as ~4\% on Multi-PIE and ~2\% on Color FERET despite the high baseline set by them.},

  abstract     = {Low-rank representation (LRR) is a very competitive technique in various real-world applications for its powerful capability in discovering latent structure of noisy or corrupted data set. However, traditional low-rank models treat each data point and feature equally so that noisy data cannot be detected and suppressed effectively and have obvious deterioration in performance, especially in heavy noisy scenario. In this paper, to address this problem, we develop a method of feature and sample scaling for low rank representation. The importance of data points and their features in both feature and sample spaces are considered, as such, clean data points and noisy data points and their features can be distinguished. In addition, based on the observation that noisy data points are usually deviated far away from the principal projection of the data set, a cosine similarity metric between data vector and the principal projection vector is developed to measure the importance of each sample. Applying our method into two classical low rank models such as Low Rank Representation (LRR) and Bilinear Factorization (BF), we can learn better low-rank structure of clean data, while the outliers or missing data being suppressed. Extensive experimental results on ORL, COIL20 and video surveillance, demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art low rank methods in image clustering tasks with various levels of corruptions, especially in a heavy noisy scenario.},

To address these challenges, we propose a scale-communicative aggregation network (SCANet) for crowd counting. Our model is characterized by three aspects: (i) It contains different streams of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where each stream consumes an individual scaled version of the input image and communicates complementarily to produce a high-resolution density map. (ii) Each CNN stream obtains robust feature presentation via our proposed multi-scale feature encoders (MSFEs) with dilated convolutional layers , and skip connections are adopted to exploit multi-stage feature aggregation. (iii) A multi-scale structural similarity metric along with Euclidean distance is introduced for optimizing the quality of generated density maps.

  abstract     = {In multi-category classification task , some categories have strong inter-categories similarity, while others do not. Therefore, it is unreasonable to treat all these categories equally. One possible way is to organize all categories into a hierarchical structure and train a hierarchical classifier based on it. The general convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be seen as a flat classifier on hierarchical feature representations. Therefore, it is natural to combine the hierarchical structure and deep neural networks . However, for hierarchical classification, one open issue is how to build a reasonable hierarchical structure which characterizes the inter-relations between categories. An effective approach is to utilize hierarchical clustering to build a visual tree structure, but the critical issue is how to determine the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering . In this paper, a hierarchical cluster validity index (HCVI) is developed for supporting visual tree learning. Before clustering of each level begins, we will measure the impact of different numbers of clusters on visual tree building and select the most suitable number of clusters. Based on this visual tree, a hierarchical convolutional neural network (HCNN) can be trained for achieving more discriminative capability. Our experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed hierarchical cluster validity index (HCVI) can guide the building of a more reasonable visual tree structure, so that the hierarchical convolutional neural network can achieve better results on classification accuracy .},

Firstly, we frame this optimization process as a reinforcement learning problem and then employ an agent to tune hyperparameters sequentially. In addition, a model that learns how to evaluate an algorithm is used to speed up the training. However, model inaccuracy is further exacerbated by long-term use, resulting in collapse performance. We propose a novel method for controlling the model use by measuring the impact of the model on the policy and limiting it to a proper range. Thus, the horizon of the model use can be dynamically adjusted. We apply the proposed method to tune the hyperparameters of the extreme gradient boosting and convolutional neural networks on 101 tasks. The experimental results verify that the proposed method achieves the highest accuracy on 86.1\% of the tasks, compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the average ranking of runtime is significant lower than all methods by using the predictive model.},

To improve the detection performance of the object contour in the complex scenes, we proposed a novel lateral refinement network (LRNet) that extracts feature information from multiple refinement modules. In addition, we modified LRNet to train an effective contour detector, called lateral refinement contour (LRC). LRNet expands the generic refinement architecture and has different refinement levels that make the refinement network deeper to extract richer convolutional features. The low-level refinement modules explicitly exploit information available along the side output of the down-sampling process, and the high-level refinement modules attempt to fuse the low-level output features. The proposed method improves the performance of image-to-image predictions by deep-stacking all the meaningful refinement levels in a holistic manner. Using the pre-trained VGG16 network and Resnet network as backbones to train LRNet, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on several available datasets.

However, neural networks with binarized inputs and binarized weights suffer from low accuracy in pattern recognition or inefficiency in hardware implementation. This work proposes a spatio-temporal binary neural network (STBNN) to solve this problem. STBNN has binary network input/output, binary neuron input/output, and binarized weights, and it integrates the computationally expensive batch normalization (BN) operation widely used in previous BNNs into the neuron threshold. STBNN can largely save computing resources and storage space while maintaining high accuracy (e.g., 98.0\% on the MNIST test set). Using binary input (0 or 1) and binarized weight (±1), the product of input and weight can be realized by a 1-bit Signed AND operation instead of multiplication operation in hardware implementation, thus significantly reducing computing resources, memory requirements, and power consumption. The results show that compared with a 32-bit multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based hardware design, the STBNN-based hardware design typically reduces these three indicators by 84.2\%, 96.4\%, and 96.7\%, respectively.

In this paper, to tackle these challenges, a novel model with the correlation emotion label distribution learning is proposed for near-infrared (NIR) facial expression recognition which associates multiple emotions with each expression depend on the similarity of expressions. Firstly, the similarities of the seven basic expressions are calculated, and then guide the correlation emotion label distribution by predicting the latent label probability distribution of the expression. Furthermore, the proposed model can be learned in an end-to-end manner via a constructed convolutional neural network to classify the six basic facial expressions.

Further, TC is fostered by the blooming of mobile (mostly encrypted) traffic volumes, fueled by the huge adoption of hand-held devices. While researchers and network operators still rely on machine learning to pursue accurate inference, we envision Deep Learning (DL) paradigm as the stepping stone toward the design of practical (and effective) mobile traffic classifiers based on automatically-extracted features, able to operate with encrypted traffic, and reflecting complex traffic patterns. In this context, the paper contribution is fourfold. First, it provides a taxonomy of the key network traffic analysis subjects where DL is foreseen as attractive. Secondly, it delves into the non-trivial adoption of DL to mobile TC, surfacing potential gains. Thirdly, to capitalize such gains, it proposes and validates a general framework for DL-based encrypted TC. Two concrete instances originating from our framework are then experimentally evaluated on three mobile datasets of human users’ activity.

Furthermore, input constraint is imposed on the elastic joint robot to guarantee the normal operation. A high gain observer is also adopted to estimate the unmeasurable variables. With the given adaptive laws of the critic neural network and actor neural network, through the Lyapunov direct method, the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are achieved and the tracking errors are ultimately uniformly bounded.

In this paper, a local discriminant preserving extreme learning machine autoencoder (LDELM-AE) is proposed to learn data representations with the local geometry and local discriminant exploited from the input data. Specifically, LDELM-AE utilizes two graphs to enhance the within-class compactness and between-class separability, respectively.

  abstract     = {The present paper aims to improve the collective interpretation realized by compressing multi-layered neural networks and to make the interpretation as natural and stable as possible. We collectively interpret the final representations by maximizing mutual information between inputs and neurons, expecting that mutual information maximization can disentangle complex features into simpler ones. However, we have had difficulty in increasing mutual information and in obtaining interpretable features for several data sets. By examining closely the processes of information maximization, we found that, in addition to the information maximization, we need to consider the cost associated with this information maximization. Thus, we try to maximize not simply mutual information but the ratio of mutual information to the cost, and this method can be called “cost-conscious mutual information maximization.” The cost-conscious method aims to extend Linsker’s maximum information preservation principle to a variety of data sets by more directly taking into account the cost associated with the process of information maximization. The method was applied to two data sets: the artificial and symmetric data set and the credit default data set. First, by using the symmetric data set injected with random noises, the cost-conscious information maximization method could extract the symmetric property almost perfectly against the random noises. In the experimental results on the credit default data set, the present method could make it possible to interpret the final results the most naturally, showing why and how the credit default could occur very naturally. The experimental results show that the neural networks can be used to interpret data sets more naturally than the conventional methods such as the logistic regression analysis.},

However, the existing ANE methods cannot effectively embed attributed sparse networks which are important real-world scenarios, and/or are not scalable to large-scale networks. To tackle these challenges, we first integrate network topology and node attributes to reconstruct an enriched denser network, and then learn node embeddings upon the denser network. In above two steps, the techniques such as Ball-tree K-Nearest Neighbors and random walks based Skip-Gram model are adopted to guarantee the scalability, which is demonstrated via theoretical complexity analysis.

Furthermore, the consensus of multi-agent systems with control input delay and discontinuous communication are much more similar to the practical engineering situation, which further increases the difficulties of consensus control. Based on these discussions, two consensus problems, including leader following case and leaderless case, are studied in this paper. A prediction of the system’s state information over the delay time is approximated by the zero input solution of the agent system model. We also propose a new discontinuous communication mode, which combines event triggered mechanism and a uniform quantization method. Unlike the existing discontinuous communication method, our proposed control protocols ensure that each agent decides when to transport its state information to its neighbors such that continuous communication between any two agents is no longer needed. In addition, through the non-smooth analysis of the closed-loop systems, the uniformly bounded consensus results are guaranteed, and the bound of the consensus error can be adjusted by choosing appropriate parameters.},

  abstract     = {Face presentation attack detection (PAD) has become a clear and present threat for face recognition systems and many countermeasures have been proposed to mitigate it. In these countermeasures, some of them use the features directly extracted from well-known color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV and YCbCr) to distinguish the fake face images from the genuine (“live”) ones. However, the existing color spaces have been originally designed for displaying the visual content of images or videos with high fidelity and are not well suited for directly discriminating the live and fake face images. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep-learning system, called CompactNet, for learning a compact space tailored for face PAD. More specifically, the proposed CompactNet does not directly extract the features in existing color spaces, but inputs the color face image into a layer-by-layer progressive space generator. Then, under the optimization of the “points-to-center” triplet loss function, the generator learns a compact space with small intra-class distance, large inter-class distance and a safe interval between different classes. Finally, the feature of the image in compact space is extracted by a pre-trained feature extractor and used for image classification . Reported experiments on three publicly available face PAD databases, namely, the Replay-Attack, the OULU-NPU and the HKBU-MARs V1, show that CompactNet separates very well the two classes of fake and genuine faces and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for PAD.},

  abstract     = {The planetary gearbox plays an important role in many advanced electromechanical mechanisms. The mechanical fault is a major factor that threatens the service performance of a planetary gearbox. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely used to identify faults and health status of industrial equipment. However, owing to diversified equipment structures, variable working conditions and disparate data acquisition, the service performance of DL-based methods may degrade significantly when applied to different industrial sites. Domain adaptation emerges as a promising idea that aims to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a different but related target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep domain-adaptive multi-task learning model Y-Net, which is exploited to enable domain-adaptive diagnosis of faults in planetary gearboxes. The SE-Res modules are utilized to reduce the redundancy of the model and improving the separability of deep features. Furthermore, a soft joint maximum mean discrepancy (SJMMD) is introduced to link the two pipeline in order to reduce both the marginal and conditional distribution discrepancy of the learned features, with the enhancement of auxiliary soft labels. The domain adaption between different planetary gearbox under variant operating condition is realized by the Y-Net. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SJMMD over conventional maximum mean discrepancy, especially when the datasets of different domains suffer different imbalances.},

  abstract     = {Online Signature Verification (OSV) techniques have been deployed in production systems for decades, yet training the model for efficient classification of the test signature from fewer training signature samples is still an open challenge. The advancements in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) enormously boosted the effectiveness of OSV systems . However, learning subtle and discriminating representations from few training samples to classify the genuineness of test signature has not been explored fully. In this paper, a Convolution Autoencoder (CAE) is used to obtain high-level feature representations from the input signature and these high level features are fused with handcrafted features to constitute a hybrid feature set. The hybrid set of features is presented as an input to an Online Signature Verification framework made up of Depth-wise Separable Convolutional Neural Network (DWSCNN). DWSCNN effectively learn deep feature representations with fewer training samples and parameters than traditional CNNs resulting in a light weight OSV framework. Thorough experimental analysis on three benchmark datasets MCYT-100 (DB1), SVC-2004-Task2 and SUSIG-Visual corpus confirm that the proposed hybrid fusion of feature set and DWSCNN based OSV framework achieve higher classification accuracies and outperforms many contemporary and state-of-the art OSV models.},

Two kinds of quasi-synchronization scenarios are discussed. One is self-synchronization and the other is tracking-synchronization. In order to lower the communication loads and reduce the control resource consumption, we propose a new control scheme called intermittent control of reginal division to make the synchronization error within a bounded scope. In this novel control scheme, the non-negative real region is divided into three subregions in advance and an auxiliary Lyapunov function is imported to decide the work time and the rest time by its relationship with three subregions. Moreover, by using rigorous mathematic analysis, we obtain sufficient conditions for the two kinds of quasi-synchronization modes of DENNs under the as-proposed control scheme. Nonidentical term in the network is viewed as external disturbance about to be compensated by the controller. The result shows that the upper bound of synchronization error will be progressively regulated by the parameters in chosen divided region. Several numerical examples are also presented to verify the validity of our theory.},

  abstract     = {Sparse representation and dictionary learning have been successfully applied in hyperspectral image classification. Generally, it is more effective to learn the sub-dictionary for each class and utilize multiple scale strategy. However, the sub-dictionary may only consider the within-class information and ignore the discriminative information. For multiscale sparse representation, the shape of the regions would not adaptively change according to context structure. This paper proposes a discriminative sub-dictionary learning algorithm and an adaptive multiscale superpixel classification strategy under sparse representation framework for hyperspectral image classification. In dictionary learning stage, the global constraint term can ensure the learnt sub-dictionaries contain more discriminative information. In sparse representation stage, the adaptive multiscale superpixel strategy can exploit the spatial context according to the structural information. The combination of the two strategies can further explore the spatial and spectral information in hyperspectral image. Experiments on four hyperspectral image datasets prove that the proposed method has a significant improvement in both quantitative and qualitative analysis comparing with state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can produce satisfactory results for the imbalanced data problem involved in hyperspectral image.},

Also, SRP is the general method for the attention mechanisms without any additional parameters or computation. It can be widely applied to attention networks without modifying the network structure.

Although the precise spike-timing based encoding scheme has long been recognised, the exact mechanism that underlies the learning of such precise spike-timing in the brain remains an open question. Most of the existing learning methods for spiking neurons are based on synaptic weight adjustment. However, biological evidences suggest that synaptic delays can also be modulated to play an important role in the learning process. This paper investigates the viability of integrating synaptic delay plasticity into supervised learning and proposes a novel learning method that adjusts both the synaptic delays and weights of the learning neurons to make them fire precisely timed spikes, that is referred to as synaptic delay-weight plasticity. Remote Supervised Method (ReSuMe) and Perceptron Based Spiking Neuron Learning Rule (PBSNLR), two representative supervised learning methods, are studied to illustrate how the synaptic delay-weight plasticity works. The performance of the proposed learning method is thoroughly evaluated on synthetic data and is further demonstrated on real-world classification tasks . The experiments show that the synaptic delay-weight learning method outperforms the traditional synaptic weight learning methods in many ways.},

We propose a non-specific ensemble classification algorithm that uses multi-objective optimization instead of relying on heuristics and fragile user-defined parameters. Only two user-defined parameters are included, with both being found to have large windows of values that produce statistically indistinguishable results, indicating the low level of expertise required from the user to achieve good results. Additionally, when given a large initial set of trained base-classifiers, we demonstrate that a multi-objective genetic algorithm aiming to optimize prediction accuracy and diversity will prefer particular types of classifiers over others. The total number of chosen classifiers is also surprisingly small – only 10.14 classifiers on average, out of an initial pool of 900. This occurs without any explicit preference for small ensembles of classifiers. Even with these small ensembles, significantly lower empirical classification error is achieved compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

However, in this paper we study the modeling of uncertainty in recurrent networks for the application of student response modeling, more specifically, knowledge tracing. Knowledge tracing is an application of time series machine learning . It consists of inferring the mastery level of a skill for a student as they navigate a question bank, thus adjusting curriculum for efficient learning. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) takes the deep learning approach for knowledge tracing and has achieved better results than models like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and Performance Factor Analysis (PFA). However, the opaqueness of these deep knowledge tracing models also brings some criticisms. Providing an uncertainty score for each prediction helps mitigate this opaqueness. To investigate uncertainty modeling in DKT, we first examine a popular way of modeling data dependent uncertainties using Monte Carlo and show how it is insufficient to model variance in data. Second, we show how to incorporate sensible uncertainties by explicitly regularizing the cross entropy loss function. Third, we evaluate our method both in three different real datasets and in a more controlled way using synthetic data. Using synthetic data allows us to quantitatively understand the generated uncertainties. The results show that our method provides comparable results with standard deep knowledge tracing models as well as meaningful prediction uncertainties.},

Recently, many supervised deep hashing approaches for multi-label image retrieval have been proposed to generate high-quality binary codes. However, most such methods are only introduced to learn simple similarity based on these image characteristics, therein ignoring complex multilevel semantic similarity with fine-grained features. In this paper, we propose a framework named deep hashing with fine-grained feature learning (DH-FFL) to preserve complex multilevel semantic similarity between multi-label image pairs. In this proposed model, compact bilinear pooling convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with normalization are adopted to extract fine-grained feature descriptors . In addition, a novel multilevel contrastive loss is designed to preserve multilevel semantic similarity by introducing a zero-loss parameter. Moreover, a multi-label classification loss is used to maintain the unique semantic structure of each image and maximize the distinguishing ability of binary codes. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DH-FFL achieves promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art multi-label image retrieval applications.},

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successfully applied to fault diagnosis tasks and achieved promising results. However, one is that two datasets (in source and target domains) of similar tasks are with different feature distributions because of different operational conditions; another one is that insufficient or unlabeled data in real industry applications (target domains) limit the adaptability of the source domain well-defined models. To solve the above problems, the concept of transfer learning should be adopted for domain adaptation , in the meantime, a network performs both supervised and unsupervised learning is required. Inspired by Wasserstein distance of optimal transport, in this paper, we propose a novel Wasserstein Distance-based Deep Transfer Learning (WD-DTL) network for both supervised and unsupervised fault diagnosis tasks. WD-DTL learns domain feature representations (generated by a CNN based feature extractor) and minimizes distributions between the source and target domains through an adversarial training process. The effectiveness of the proposed WD-DTL is verified through 16 different transfer tasks. Results show that WD-DTL achieves the highest diagnostic accuracies when compared to the existing Maximum Mean Discrepancy and CNN networks in almost all transfer tasks.},

The proposed method has two main advantages. (1) It considers the asymmetry of a pedestrian’s body shape in pedestrian detection. The rectangular anchors are used to generate various rectangular proposals that have a height greater than the width. In addition, asymmetric rectangular convolution kernels are adopted for capturing the compact features of the pedestrian body. (2) The proposed AMS-Net gradually rejects the non-pedestrian boxes according to coarse-to-fine features in a three-stage framework. The proposed AMS-Net significantly improves the performance of pedestrian detection on the Far subset of the Caltech testing set (the miss rate decreases from 60.79\% to 51.36\%).

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework, termed as motion-aid feature calibration network (MFCN), for video object detection. The key idea is to leverage on the temporal coherence of video features while considering their motion patterns as captured by optical flow. To boost detection accuracy, the framework aggregates the calibrated features both at pixel and instance levels across frames to achieve improved robustness despite appearance variations. The aggregation and calibration are efficiently and adaptively conducted based on an integrated optical flow network. Meanwhile, the entire architecture of the proposed method is end-to-end, thus significantly improving its training and inference efficiency when compared to multi-stage methods for video object detection. Evaluations on KITTI and ImageNet VID indicate that MFCN can improve the results of a strong still-image detector by 11.2\% and 7.31\% respectively. MFCN also outperforms other competitive video object detectors and achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and runtime speed, demonstrating its potential for use in autonomous driving systems.},

  abstract     = {Since the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) was proposed by Zhang and Li in 2007, this interesting framework has attracted a considerable attention from researchers. In MOEA/D, a multiobjective optimization problem is decomposed into a series of aggregated subproblems, which are optimized simultaneously in a collaborative way by using the information from their neighboring subproblems. The decomposition approach has significant impact on MOEA/D as it directs the evolutionary search. Many improved MOEA/D variants proposed various kinds of decomposition approaches and have shown promising performance for different kinds of problems. In this paper, we give a survey of decomposition approaches, which are classified into five categories, i.e., the tradition decomposition, the modified Tchebycheff decomposition, the modified penalty-based boundary intersection decomposition, the constrained decomposition, and other special cases of decomposition. Moreover, discussions are further given in this paper to analyze the performance of different decomposition approaches. One clarifies the difference between Tchebycheff decomposition and Pareto-based domination. The other one compares the performance of various decomposition approaches on different benchmark problems. Experiments results have demonstrated that the Tchebycheff decomposition and its varieties are robust on solving most problems while some specific decomposition approaches are very effective for some problems with special features.},

In order to make the proposed LSTM framework work, the meteorological element observation data returned hourly is transferred into time series data . Based on these time series data, four datasets are created for short-term fog forecasting. In order to evaluate the proposed LSTM framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments with different machine learning algorithms . Compared with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, the experimental results show that the proposed LSTM framework achieves best prediction performance in four evaluation criteria. Especially in TS-Score, the proposed LSTM framework achieve 1.1\%, 11\%, 3\%, and 11\% higher performance than the best traditional machine learning algorithm.},

This additional local graph structure is generated by finding additional corner pixel points through bilinear interpolation of neighborhood pixels. These corner pixels lead to most stable features and information related to local deformation of the image. In this proposed ensemble system, three classifiers, namely K-nearest neighbor, Chi-square and correlation coefficient are used. Further the proposed approach fuses the decisions obtained from individual classifiers through OR rule, majority voting and AND rule. To evaluate the performance of proposed ensemble system, the experiment is conducted with three face databases viz. AT&amp;T (formerly The ORL Database of Faces), UFI and LFW face database. The ensemble face recognition system on the use of novel dense local graph structure has reached the accuracy of 100\% on AT&amp;T, 99.3488\% on UFI and 87.3372\% on LFW face database. Further, the templates of D-LGS are optimized using Genetic algorithm (GA) as part of ‘curse-of-dimensionality’ and the reduced number of templates give accuracies of 100\% on AT&amp;T and 99.2165\% on LFW face database.},

Recently, with global warming, biodiversity loss, rapid urban development and environmental damage, people have been seriously destroying the natural environments, which results in that a large number of plant species constantly dying and even dying out every year. It is essential to protect plant species. The first step of protecting plants is to recognize them and understand what they are and where they come from. But there are a large number of plant species that have been named on Earth, and many are still unknown yet, it is difficult to identifiy each species. To handle such huge information, develop a quick and efficient classification method has become a significant research. Plant species can be recognized by its leaf, flower, skin, fruit and seed, etc. Relatively speaking, using leaf to recognize plant species is very simple and convenient, and many leaf based plant species recognition methods have been proposed. In this paper, we mainly summarize the existing leaf based plant species identification methods, including plant leaf characteristic, public databases, feature extraction based methods, subspace learning based methods, sparse representation based methods, and deep learning based methods. The aim is to emphasize the importance of plant species identification, train people to know about plant species, and provide guidance and comprehensive study for the beginners in this field, in turn, to treasure and protect plant species.},

Human face also undergoes irreversible changes due to aging. These factors makes the process of face recognition non trivial and hard. This paper also provides a review of the facial recognition approaches individually dealing with these issues. Applications of face recognition in the forensic domain sometimes needs identification using a scanned facial image . The scenario is quite useful to get investigative leads. Important approaches for the same are also been discussed in the manuscript. Recent developments in the low-cost image capturing devices has flooded the facial image databases with a lot of images, at the same time availability of GPU based compute power has helped develop deep learning approaches to handle the face recognition at a very accurate and massive level.

  abstract     = {Considering the labeled samples may be difficult to obtain because they require human annotators, special devices, or expensive and slow experiments. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has tremendous practical value. Moreover, graph-based SSL methods have received more attention since their convexity, scalability and effectiveness in practice. The convexity of graph-based SSL guarantees that the optimization problems become easier to obtain local solution than the general case. The scalable graph-based SSL methods are convenient to deal with large-scale dataset for big data. Graph-based SSL methods aim to learn the predicted function for the labels of those unlabeled samples by exploiting the label dependency information reflected by available label information. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive study of graph-based SSL. Specifically, the concept of the graph is first given before introducing graph-based semi-supervised learning. Then, we build a framework that divides the corresponding works into transductive graph-based SSL, inductive graph-based SSL, and scalable graph-based SSL. The core idea of these models is to impose graph constraints to the optimal function, which guarantees the smoothness over the graph. Next, several representative graph-based SSL methods are conducted on the three data sets, including two face data sets and a natural image data set. Finally, we outlook several directions for future work of graph-based SSL, and hope our review on graph-based SSL will offer insights for further research.},

Traditional methods highly rely on human intervention and cannot adapt to the varying environment. Meanwhile, adaptive neural network based control strategies are encountered with dilemmas of local minima, slow convergence, huge time consumption, and low efficiency. To overcome such challenges, in this paper, a novel Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) based adaptive control is discussed. In contrast, no a prior human experience or off-line training phase is required. It also has fast training speed thanks to randomly generated parameters of the hidden layer and Moore–Penrose pseudo-inverse. Moreover, the performance of the system is guaranteed even in the presence of time-varying dynamics and uncertainties through a learning mechanism in an online manner. The stability of the closed-loop system is shown strictly and extensive comparison case studies substantiate the feasibility of the scheme.},

In this paper, we consider the issue from a different perspective when the training and inference of deep reinforcement learning are required to be performed with limited computing resources. Mainly, we propose two efficient neural network architectures of deep reinforcement learning: Light-Q-Network (LQN) and Binary-Q-Network (BQN). In LQN, The depth-wise separable CNNs are utilized in memory and computation saving. While, in BQN, the weights of convolutional layers are binary that help in shortening the training time and reduce memory consumption. We evaluate our approach on Atari 2600 domain and StarCraft II mini-games. The results demonstratethe efficiency of the proposed architectures. Though performances of agents in most games are still super-human, the proposed methods advance the agent from sub to super-human performance in particular games. Also, we empirically find that non-standard convolution and non-full-precision networks do not affect agent learning game strategy.},

  abstract     = {Automated nuclear segmentation in histopathological images is a prerequisite for a computer-aided diagnosis framework. However, it remains a challenging problem due to the nucleus occlusion or overlapping, shape variation, and image background complexity. Recently, deep learning techniques are widely used in analyzing digital histopathology . We present a computerized image-based method for automatically segmenting nuclei using an integration of a deep learning model and an improved concave point detection algorithm . A modified atrous spatial pyramid pooling U-Net (ASPPU-Net) is derived to capture multi-scale nuclei features and obtain nuclei context information without reducing the spatial resolution of feature map. A weighted binary cross entropy loss function with Dice loss function is used to better handle the data unbalance problem. An accelerated concave point detection method allows to effectively and accurately segmenting highly overlapping nuclei. Our ASPPU-Net based method was tested on four independent data cohorts and achieved the highest Dice similarity coefficient of 0.83, and pixel wise accuracy of 0.95. The experimental results suggested that the combination of ASPPU-Net model and concave point detection method was able to gain improved performance in separating both isolated and touching clustered nuclei in histopathology .},

  abstract     = {Multi-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images are acquired by changing the echo times (for T2 weighted) or relaxation times (for T1 weighted) of scans. The resulting (multi-echo) images are usually used for quantitative MR imaging. Acquiring MR images is a slow process and acquiring multi scans of the same cross section for multi-echo imaging is even slower. In order to accelerate the scan, compressed sensing (CS) based techniques have been advocating partial K-space (Fourier domain) scans; the resulting images are reconstructed via structured CS algorithms. In recent times, it has been shown that instead of using off-the-shelf CS, better results can be obtained by adaptive reconstruction algorithms based on structured dictionary learning. In this work, we show that the reconstruction results can be further improved by using structured deep dictionaries. Experimental results on real datasets show that by using our proposed technique the scan-time can be cut by half compared to the state-of-the-art.},

However, the fact is that we know very little yet about the electrophysiological marker for assessing diver sleepiness . Previous studies and our researches have shown that alpha blocking phenomenon and alpha wave attenuation-disappearance phenomenon represent two different sleepiness levels, the relaxed wakefulness and the sleep onset, respectively. This paper proposes a novel model for driver sleepiness detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. Our model aims to track the change in alpha waves and differentiate the two alpha-related phenomena. Continuous wavelet transform is adopted to extract features from physiological signals in both time and frequency domains. Meanwhile, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is introduced to deal with temporal information of EEG and EOG signals. To deal with insufficient physiological sample problem, generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to augment the training dataset. Experimental results indicate that the F1 score for detecting start and end points of alpha waves reaches to around 95\%. And Conditional Wasserstein GAN (CWGAN) we adopted was effective in augmenting dataset and boost classifier performance. Meanwhile, our LSTM classifier achieved a mean accuracy of 98\% for classifying end points of alpha waves under leave-one-subject-out cross validation.},

An important component of BCI, electroencephalography (EEG) is in general sensitive to noise and rich in all kinds of information from our brain. In this paper, we study the feature fusion problem in electroencephalography (EEG). We introduce (1) a discriminative feature extractor which can classify multi-labels from short-term EEG signals, and (2) a new strategy to filter out unwanted features from EEG signals based on our feature extractor. Filtering out signals relating to one property of the EEG signal while retaining another is similar to the way we can listen to just one voice during a party, which is known as the cocktail party problem in the machine learning area. Built based on the success of short-term EEG discriminative model, the feature filter is an end-to-end framework which is trained to map EEG signals with unwanted features directly to EEG signals without those features. Our experimental results on an alcoholism dataset show that our novel model can filter out over 90\% of alcoholism information on average from EEG signals, with an average of only 4.2\% useful feature accuracy lost, showing effectiveness for our proposed task.},

However, they are usually unable to ensure the required intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in the kernel space. These are known to be important in pattern recognition for achieving both robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose to integrate a kernelized Min-Max objective in the DNN training in order to explicitly enforce both kernelized within-class compactness and between-class margin. The involved kernel space is implicitly mapped from the feature space associated with a certain upper layer of DNN by exploiting a kernel trick, while the Min-Max objective in this space is interpolated with the original DNN loss function and finally optimized in the training phase. With a very small additional computation cost, the proposed strategy can be easily integrated in different DNN models without changing any other part of the original model. The comparative recognition accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated with multiple DNN models (including shallow CNN, deep CNN and deep residual neural network models) on two benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the integration of kernelized Min-Max objective in the training of DNN models can achieve better results compared to state-of-the-art models, without incurring additional model complexity.},

Hence, the distributed controller is to be designed such that all the agents can reach to a collection behavior to some degree. It is supposed that each agent can obtain full state of itself and receive its neighbors’ state with additive noises. For each agent, the consensus protocol is designed based on the error between the estimated state of its neighbors’ and full state of itself. By means of Kalman filtering and matrix analysis, the bound of consensus is given via the solution of a Lyapunov equation.

In this procedure, vehicle detection and distance measurement are core components, requiring accurate localization and estimation. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient forward vehicle collision warning framework by aggregating monocular distance measurement and precise vehicle detection. In order to obtain forward vehicle distance, a quick camera calibration method which only needs three physical points to calibrate related camera parameters is utilized. As for the forward vehicle detection, a multi-scale detection algorithm that regards the result of calibration as distance prior is proposed to improve the precision. What’s more, traditional deterministic FCW approaches cannot be personalized for different drivers, which will lead to false warnings when drivers are in diverse driving status. Therefore, abnormal driver behaviors are introduced to make FCW adaptive. Specifically, the proposed adaptive FCW generates warnings by considering the different behaviors of the driver. Intensive experiments are conducted in our established real scene dataset and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the influence of inner-coupling functions on the synchronized regions with respect to intra- and inter-layer coupling strength in two-layer multiplex networks composed of linearly coupled Rössler oscillators with identical or nonidentical intra-layer topological structures . We focus on three typical inner-coupling matrices, representing the classical bounded, unbounded and empty synchronized regions. We numerically investigate intra-layer synchronization (synchronization of nodes within each layer), inter-layer synchronization (synchronization of node pairs across layers) and global synchronization (synchronization of all nodes) in duplex networks with identical or nonidentical intra-layer structures, for all the combinations of the three typical inner-coupling matrices. Interestingly, we find that whatever the inner-coupling matrices are, the intra-layer synchronized regions of the two layers will become the same type in most cases, which should be due to the interaction between layers. Particularly, the inner-coupling matrix that leads to an empty synchronized region in an isolated network does not necessarily result in empty synchronized regions within or across layers, though it will lead to empty global synchronized regions while working as the inter-layer inner-coupling function. Numerical results also imply that structural difference of the two intra-layer networks will weaken inter-layer as well as intra-layer synchronizability.},

Such phenomenon could be emulated in the electronic synaptic device, which is the critical unit for hardware implementation of Spiking Neural Network (SNN). To the best of our knowledge, however, forgetting phenomenon has rarely been applied in weights update of traditional SNNs based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In this work, we propose a novel SNN training algorithm using forgetting phenomenon. The weights update procedures are composed of potentiation and forgetting, and implemented by single-polarity pulses and time intervals between training samples. Benchmarked with the MNIST handwriting dataset, we demonstrate the algorithm’s performance by a single-layer perceptron with 784  ×  10 synapses. Besides, the influence of some non-ideal factors are taken into consideration to analyze the robust performance of enhanced SNN. The simulation result indicates the proposed SNN with forgetting phenomenon exhibits faster convergence speed and higher recognition rate (88.07\%) than traditional SNN with similar network scale. Moreover, it shows a good tolerance to the non-linear conductance response and variation while it has less endurance requirement of electronic synaptic devices.},

Firstly, appropriate distributed control protocols are designed for first-order and second-order networked agents, respectively. Particularly, the effects of switching communication networks and time-varying delays on model performance are investigated in this paper. Secondly, an augmented system approach based on algebraic graph theory and non-negative matrix theory is adopted to solve the proposed scaled consensus problem.

  abstract     = {The spiking neural network provides a potential computing paradigm for simulating the complex information processing mechanism of the brain. Even though there are many theoretical and practical achievements, several crucial problems remain to be addressed for the existing spiking learning algorithm. In this paper, a Probabilistic Spike Response Model (PSRM), of which ignition mode is determined neither by the difference between the threshold and membrane voltage nor in the form of pulses, is proposed from a probabilistic perspective. The PSRM reconstructs a probability relationship between the membrane voltage and neuron ignition to transmit information in the form of probabilities and redefines pulses. The expression of the pulse sequence makes the PSRM model continuous and differentiable so as to avoid the difficulty in using supervised learning algorithms. In our study, the single-layer learning algorithm and multilayer learning algorithm based on the PSRM model are also given. As shown in our experiments, the proposed method is of theoretical and practical value.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated dominant performance in person re-identification (Re-ID). Existing CNN based methods utilize global average pooling (GAP) to aggregate intermediate convolutional features for Re-ID. However, this strategy only considers the first-order statistics of local features and treats local features at different locations equally important, leading to sub-optimal feature representation. To deal with these issues, we propose a novel weighted bilinear coding (WBC) framework for local feature aggregation in CNN networks to pursue more representative and discriminative feature representations, which can adapt to other advanced methods and improve their performance. In specific, bilinear coding is used to encode the channel-wise feature correlations to capture richer feature interactions. Meanwhile, a weighting scheme is applied on the bilinear coding to adaptively adjust the weights of local features at different locations based on their importance in recognition, further improving the discriminability of feature aggregation. To handle the spatial misalignment issue, we use a salient part net to derive salient body parts, and apply the WBC model on each part. The final representation, formed by concatenating the WBC encoded features of each part, is both discriminative and resistant to spatial misalignment. Experiments on three benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 evidence the favorable performance of our method against other outstanding methods.},

The goal of this paper is to reduce the resources required to build and operate CNNs. To achieve this goal, a CNN architecture based on Residue Number System (RNS) and the new Chinese Remainder Theorem with fractions is proposed. The new architecture gives an efficient solution to the main problem of RNSs associated with restoring the number from its residues, which determines the main contribution to the CNN structure. In accordance with the results of hardware simulation on Kintex7 xc7k70tfbg484-2 FPGA, the use of RNS in the convolutional layer of a neural network reduces hardware cost by 32.6\% compared to the traditional approach based on the binary number system . In addition, the use of the proposed hardware-software architecture reduces the average image recognition time by 37.06\% compared to the software implementation.},

Most of the action recognition methods in sports mainly focus on recognizing which sport is being performed. However, recognizing of the specific action in videos is important for the analysis of some sports video such as tennis matches. Hence, in this paper, we proposed a deep historical long short-term memory network for video-based tennis action recognition and general action recognition. First, the spatial representations are extracted from each frame using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). To describe the temporal information, a stacked multi-layer long short-term memory network (LSTM) was used. The historical information of the past frames is important for modeling the action. So we propose a historical information layer that is added to the top of the multi-layered LSTM network. A historical feature of each video is generated for classification by hybridizing the hidden state of LSTM at time t and the historical updated feature at time t-1 with an updating scheme and utilized for classification. Experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method that using only simple raw RGB video can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines for both general action recognition and tennis action recognition.},

In practice, the weights of neural networks are generally obtained indirectly using iterative training methods. Such methods are inefficient and problematic in many respects. Besides, neural networks trained end-to-end by such methods are typical black box models that are hard to interpret. Thus, it would be significantly better if the weights of a neural network could be calculated directly. In this paper, we located the key for calculating the weights of a neural network directly: assigning proper targets to the hidden units. Furthermore, if such targets are assigned, the neural network becomes a white box model that is easy to interpret. Thus, we propose a framework for solving the weights of a neural network and provide a sample implementation of the framework. The implementation was tested in various classification and regression experiments. Compared with neural networks trained using traditional methods, the constructed ones using solved weights had similar or better performance on many tasks, while remaining interpretable. Given the early stage of the proposed approach, many improvements are expectable in future developments.},

Existing density map based methods excessively focus on the individuals’ localization which harms the crowd counting performance in highly congested scenes.

In this paper, we propose Relevant Region Prediction (RRP) for crowd counting, which consists of the Count Map and the Region Relation-Aware Module (RRAM). Each pixel in the count map represents the number of heads falling into the corresponding local area in the input image, which discards the detailed spatial information and forces the network pay more attention to counting rather than localizing individuals. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Region Relation-Aware Module is proposed to capture and exploit the important region dependency. The module builds a fully connected directed graph between the regions of different density where each node (region) is represented by weighted global pooled feature, and GCN is learned to map this region graph to a set of relation-aware regions representations. Experimental results on three datasets show that our method obviously outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Automated classification of epileptic seizures surrogates the manual interventions required for analyzing long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and helps to speed up the treatment in epilepsy patients. Developing a patient independent algorithm is a great challenge due to the differences in EEG characteristics. Feature distribution among many subjects results in inter-subject variability, which leads to poor classification performance. Therefore, in order to overcome this limitation, we have proposed a novel adaptive median feature baseline correction (AM-FBC) method to update the feature distribution. Two recently proposed features referred to as successive decomposition index (SDI) and matrix determinant (MD) were extracted from 40 intensive care unit patients EEG at a segmentation length of 4 s with 50\% overlap. We have investigated the influence of outliers removal and correction, AM-FBC, and post-processing of classifier output to improve the seizure detection results. The classification was performed using a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. With the application of above-mentioned methods, the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9663 (sensitivity S + = 0.9661, specificity ( S − = 0.8446) and 0.9812 S + = 0.9822, S − = 0.8705) was achieved using SDI and MD features respectively. Further, the AUC of 0.9593 ( S + = 0.9069, S − = 0.8695) was achieved when both SDI and MD features were used with the application of the outliers correction method. The findings of the study suggest (1) Outliers correction method does not improve results (2) AM-FBC enhances the results (3) Post-processing method improved the classification results at least 2 to 5\% and reduced false detections (4) Lowering the outlier removal factor showed good AUC at the cost of loss of feature samples.},

Event prediction is related to event detection, since salient information of events is universal between the tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model for joint event detection and prediction, which classifies the events to predefined types as well as predicts the next probable event by generating a sequence of words describing it.

However, in some multi-condition circuit fault diagnoses, the presence of numerous faults and heterogeneity of the training data make the computational efficiency, classification accuracy, and selection of the pattern neuron samples of the PNN challenging. To overcome these difficulties, this study proposes a novel analog circuit fault diagnosis method based on density peaks clustering and a dynamic weight PNN. In this method, density peaks clustering is performed to determine the number of pattern neuron classes. Based on the results of clustering, a priority function is defined, and a novel two-step pattern neuron optimization algorithm incorporating local density and gravity is proposed. Accordingly, the representative boundary data are selected as the pattern neuron samples and numerous redundant samples are reduced. Moreover, a dynamic grey correlation weight determination (GCWD) algorithm between the input and pattern layers is proposed, to determine which classes of the pattern neurons need to be activated and involved in the diagnostic calculation. In addition, a dynamic proportion-amplified weight determination (PAWD) algorithm between the pattern and summation layers is suggested to reduce the adverse effect of the heterogeneity. This not only reduces the number of calculations in the diagnostic process, but also improves the accuracy of the diagnostic model. Case study on a filter circuit clearly demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve high classification accuracy with only a few pattern neurons.},

With a pre-trained model that is pre-trained on the fully annotated synthetic dataset , i.e. , SynthText, we investigate the inductive and transductive semi-supervised learning on the unannotated dataset respectively. For inductive learning, the pre-trained model is applied to the unannotated training dataset to search for more training examples, which are further combined with SynthText to fine-tune the pre-trained model and achieve a superior detection model. For transductive learning , the unannotated training dataset is replaced with the unannotated test dataset. Meanwhile, for the aim of real-world applications, we adopt Mask R-CNN to detect text with arbitrary shapes and exploit context information to suppress false positives . Extensive experiments on different datasets show that the performance of our text detection method can be clearly improved under both inductive and transductive semi-supervision.

  abstract     = {Spiking neural network (SNN) system that uses rank order coding (ROC) as input spike encoding, generally suffers from low recognition accuracy and unnecessary computations that increase complexities. In this paper, we present a Spiking convolutional neural network (Spiking CNN) architecture that significantly improves recognition accuracy as well as computation efficiencies based on a novel ROC and modified kernel sizes. The proposed ROC generates spike trains based on maximum input value without sorting operations. In addition, as the recognition accuracy is affected by the reduced number of spikes as layers become deeper, the proposed ROC is inserted just before the final layer to increase the number of input spikes. The 2 × 2 pooling kernels are also replaced with 4 × 4 to reduce the network size. The hardware architecture of the proposed Spiking CNN has been implemented using 65 nm CMOS process. Neuron-centric membrane voltage update approach is also efficiently exploited in convolutional and fully connected layers to improve the hardware energy efficiencies. The Spiking CNN processor is seamlessly processing 2.85 K classifications per second with 6.79 uJ/classification. It also achieves 90.2\% of recognition accuracy for MNIST dataset using unsupervised learning with STDP .},

However, the imprecise features of synaptic weight encoding by memristor devices generally result in catastrophic failures of the network in situ training. Learning schemes that consider all of the imprecise memristor network properties were rarely reported, such as variations from device-to-device (D2D) and pulse-to-pulse (P2P), weight programming without reading, pulse number rounding, etc. In this work, we have considered all major imprecise proprieties and designed a learning scheme that integrates stochastic sparse updating with momentum adaption (SSM) to efficiently train the imprecise memristor networks with high classification accuracy . With the SSM scheme, experiments show that the classification accuracy on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) improves from 26.12\% to 90.07\% and from 65.98\% to 92.38\%, respectively. Meanwhile, the total numbers of weight updating pulses decrease 90\% and 40\% in MLP and CNN, respectively, and the convergence rates are both 3 × faster. The SSM scheme provides a high-accuracy, low-power, and fast-convergence solution for the in situ training of imprecise memristor networks, which is crucial to future neuromorphic intelligence systems.},

We argue that the head poses may better be modelled by discrete distribution sampled from a smooth continuous curve rather than one-hot coding or some other kinds of binned classification vector, since pose angles in practice are arbitrary. In this paper, we propose a deep head pose estimation scheme by regressing between predicted probabilistic labels and discrete Gaussian distribution. Such Gaussian distribution aims at modelling the arbitrary state of true head poses and supervises the deep network through maximum mean discrepancy loss. Besides, we also propose a spatial channel-aware residual attention structure for enhancing intrinsic pose features to further improve the prediction accuracy and speed up training convergence. Experiments on two public datasets AFLW2000 and BIWI show the proposed method outperforms all previous methods, and its individual components yield substantial improvements.},

  abstract     = {Moving a finger around the boundary edge is one of the important strategies followed by humans for ascertaining the shape and size of an object by touch. Tactile response from thousands of mechanoreceptors in the human hand offers a high spatiotemporal resolution to perceive the edge orientation quickly ( &amp;lt;50 ms) and accurately (acuity of &amp;lt;3° ). Inspired by the computational efficiency of biological tactile system, we present a neuromorphic approach to artificial tactile sensing that mimics the spike-based spatiotemporal tactile response of Fast Adapting type I (FA-I) mechanoreceptors . We propose a novel, model-based spatiotemporal correlation matching method to estimate the orientation of the boundary edge while a piezoresistive tactile sensor array attached to robotic arm palpates over the object. Results highlight the ability of the proposed method to efficiently leverage spatial and temporal information, by obtaining very precise orientation estimates ( ± ± 1.67° error for edges oriented from 10° to 90°, with a step of 5°) in spite of a low-resolution sensor (169 mm 2 , 4 × 4 4×4 resolution). A comparison with both spatial and spatiotemporal based classifiers indicates that the proposed method achieves 20\% 20\% lower mean absolute error (MAE) than its closest counterparts, all of which required supervised training. Furthermore, we show that even with a ten-fold loss of spike time precision (1 ms–10 ms), MAE is maintained at 2°. This work highlights that even with a modest sensor size and resolution, spatiotemporal similarity metrics can be used to obtain very precise estimates of orientation. Such an approach has potential applications towards improving the tactile sensing capability in robotic/prosthetic hands where knowledge of spatial edge orientation information is paramount for object manipulation, and sensor contact area is often sparse and small.},

In this paper, a novel form of the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) is developed to underpin effective and efficient fault diagnosis using cost sensitive active learning. Specifically, BGRU is devised to consider the dynamic behavior of a complex process. In the training phase of BGRU, the idea of weighting each training example is proposed to reduce the effect of class imbalance. Besides, in order to explore the unlabeled data , cost sensitive active learning is utilized to select the candidate instances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Tennessee Eastman (TE) dataset and a real plasma etching process dataset.

  abstract     = {How to design deep neural networks (DNNs) for the representation and analysis of high dimensional but small sample size data is still a big challenge. One solution is to construct a sparse network. At present, there exist many approaches to achieve sparsity for DNNs by regularization , but most of them are carried out only in the pre-training process due to the difficulty in the derivation of explicit formulae in the fine-tuning process. In this paper, a log-sum function is used as the regularization terms for both the responses of hidden neurons and the network connections in the loss function of the fine-tuning process. It provides a better approximation to the L 0 L0 -norm than several often used norms. Based on the gradient formula of the loss function, the fine-tuning process can be executed more efficiently. Specifically, the commonly used gradient calculation in many deep learning research platforms, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, can be accelerated. Given the analytic formula for calculating gradients used in any layer of DNN, the error accumulated from successive numerical approximations in the differentiation process can be avoided. With the proposed log-sum enhanced sparse deep neural network (LSES-DNN), the sparsity of the responses and the connections can be well controlled to improve the adaptivity of DNNs. The proposed model is applied to MRI data for both the diagnosis of schizophrenia and the study of brain developments.

The classification performance of LSR based methods depends heavily on the discriminative capability of the label transformation. In this work, we aim to enhance the discriminative capability of the label transformation by imposing a new class-induced structure constraint. Specifically, we propose to regularize the label transformation matrix by the difference of l 2 , 1 l2,1 norm and l 2 , 2 l2,2 norm of the predicted labels of each class. The major advantage of the new regularity is that, it can guarantee the ideal discrimination of the label transformation matrix and make the classification more stable. For better generalization capability, we adopt the existing ε ε -dragging technique to relax the binary label. Leveraging the new regularity term and the label relaxation, we give a group discriminative least square regression (GDLSR) training model to learn the label transformation for multicategory classification. To solve the proposed model, we present an ADMM-like iteration algorithm, which we can guarantee a weak convergency. Experiments on several commonly used datasets show that our method outperforms both related LSR-based methods and some traditional methods.},

This is unlike the previous approaches that solve a regularized problem where an approximate incoherence promoting term, instead of the mutual coherence, is used to encourage low-coherency. Then, a new solver is proposed for constrained low-coherence DL problem, i.e., a DL problem with an explicit constraint on the mutual coherence of the dictionary. As opposed to current methods, which follow a suboptimal two-step approach, the new algorithm directly solves the associated DL problem. Using previous studies, convergence of the new schemes to critical points of the associated cost functions is also provided. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed algorithms have lower iteration complexity than existing algorithms. Our simulation results on learning low-coherence dictionaries for natural image patches as well as image classification based on discriminative over-complete dictionary learning demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared with the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract     = {The current paper presents a neural network-based hybrid strategy that combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Dual Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) for efficiently and accurately solving the quadratic -Bi-level Programming Problem (BLPP). In this model, the GA is used to handle the upper-level decision problem by choosing desirable solution candidates and passing them to the lower-level problem. Subsequently, in the lower-level, the parameterized-DRNN is used to determine possible optimal solutions. This combination offers several benefits such as being a parallel computing structure, the RNN offers faster convergence to the optimum for the lower-level decision problem and it also helps to quickly and accurately determining the global optimal. Moreover, the GA can quickly reach the global optima and can search without becoming stuck to the local optimal. Additionally, by choosing desirable initialization of parameters, the proposed algorithm reaches the optimum with higher accuracy. Apart from that, there are still a few utilizations of hybrid NN-based methods for solving BLPPs. Hence, we believe the proposed algorithm will contribute to solving quadratic -BLPPs involved in various engineering, management, and finance applications. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method have been found better than the existing and widely used approaches, while doing experimental verification using four well-known examples used in prior works.},

However, the amount of labeled fault samples is limited in industrial field, also the samples are filled with complex environmental noise. Thus, a model with strong generalization and robustness is required. To tackle these challenges, an adversarial denoising convolutional neural network (ADCNN) is proposed in this paper. Moving maximum is firstly applied to the frequency spectrum of the vibration signal to enhance the anti-noise performance of the training samples. Then the enhanced training samples are erased with dynamic probability to simulate noise interference. Meanwhile, adversarial training is utilized to expand the labeled samples until Nash equilibrium is reached. These processes improve the robustness and generalization of ADCNN, and avoid over-fitting with limited amount of labeled samples. In our two experiments, when signal to noise ratio(SNR) is -12 dB , the ADCNN achieves a diagnosis accuracy of 94.05\% and 94.47\%, respectively. Besides, ADCNN can maintain a high diagnosis accuracy under limited sample size case, and has the best adaptation performance across different load domains. The comparison studies with respect to other models demonstrate the applicability and superiority of ADCNN.},

  abstract     = {Converting gray-scale images to colorful ones is one of the challenging tasks in the Computer Vision area, and various approaches based on neural network architectures have been proposed to generate colorful images. However, most of the suggested colorization frameworks use a single model for colorization regardless of the diversity of colors in images of various datasets. We claim that since such a structure is responsible for generating all types of images, it results in producing either faint-colored images or some artifacts in the images. We addressed this issue by proposing parallel colorization models, each of which is customized for generating images with similar contexts or color themes. Our proposed architecture consists of two stages as follows. The first stage includes a single colorization network that generates an initial colored image and simultaneously selects one of the specialist networks of the second stage for each image. The second stage consists of several specialist networks, whose tasks are improving the quality of the initial colored image and produce real-looking, plausible images. Our goal is to assign images to specialist networks in a way that each one of the specialist networks deals with contextually similar images so that the networks become more confident in generating vibrant colors and high-quality images. Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network structure is utilized in our architecture since it has demonstrated great potential in creating plausible images in the literature. The proposed model is evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, and the results stand for the effectiveness of employing context-aware specialists for colorization.},

However, the huge search space and the sparsity of anomaly events make it difficult to solve this problem effectively and efficiently. This paper presents a general framework, namely anomalous connected subgraph scanning (GraphScan) which optimizes a large class of sophisticated nonlinear nonparametric scan statistic functions, to solve this problem in attributed social media networks. We first transform the sophisticated nonlinear nonparametric scan statistics functions into the Price-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) problem with provable guarantees for evaluating the significance of connected subgraphs to indicate the ongoing or forthcoming events. Then, we use tree decomposition technique to divide the whole graph into a set of smaller subgraph bags, and arrange them into a tree structure, through which we can reduce the search space dramatically. Finally, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm to solve the problem of anomalous subgraph detection using the tree of bags. With two real-world datasets from different domains, we conduct extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

In this paper, we propose a Supervised Attention based Natural Language Inference (SA-NLI) framework to solve this problem. In our framework, the intra attention module is trained to focus on syntactically related tokens, while the inter attention module is constrained to capture alignment between sentences. Moreover, the supervised training of intra attention module and inter attention module are unified with the training of the NLI model by multi-task learning and transfer learning , respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple NLI datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our supervised attention based method.

While most existing methods tackle this task by predicting frame-wise probabilities and adjusting them via high-level temporal models, recent approaches classify every video frame directly with temporal convolutions. However, there are limits to generate high quality predictions due to ambiguous information in the video frames. In this paper, in order to address the limitations of existing methods in temporal action segmentation task , we propose an end-to-end multi-stage architecture, Gated Forward Refinement Network (G-FRNet). In G-FRNet, each stage makes a prediction that is refined progressively by next stage. Specifically, we propose a new gated forward refinement network to adaptively correct the errors in the prediction from previous stage, where an effective gate unit is used to control the refinement process. Moreover, to efficiently optimize the proposed G-FRNet, we design an objective function that consists of a classification loss and a multi-stage sequence-level refinement loss that incorporates segmental edit score via policy gradient. Extensive evaluation on three challenging datasets (50Salads, Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), and the Breakfast dataset) shows our method achieves state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Real-world information systems are naturally dynamic, and they are usually represented as a time-evolving attributed network ( i.e., a sequence of static attributed networks). Recently, there is a surge of research interests in finding anomalous nodes upon attributed networks due to its significant implications in many high-impact applications, such as financial fraud detection, network intrusion detection , and opinion spam detection, to name a few. Despite the importance of anomaly detection in time-evolving attributed network, a vast majority of existing methods fail to capture the evolution of the underlying networks properly, as they regard the whole system as static and neglect the evolution process. Meanwhile, they treat all the attributes and the instances equally, ignoring the existence of noisy which may lead to the adverse effects to the detection results. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic anomaly detection framework on time-evolving attributed networks on the basis of residual analysis, namely AMAD. Under the assumption of temporal smoothness property, AMAD leverages the small smooth disturbance between two consecutive time stamps to characterize the evolution of networks for incrementally update. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world time-evolving attributed networks show the superiority of our proposed method in detecting anomalies . Moreover, our method is competitive in terms of efficiency compared to the existing work.},

However, the data distribution shift is inevitable in the practical scene due to changes in internal and external environments, it is still challenging to establish an effective fault diagnosis model that can eliminate the same distribution assumption. In light of the above demands, a novel transfer learning framework based on deep multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) is presented in this paper. First, a novel multi-scale module is ingenious established based on dilated convolution, which is used as the key part to obtain differential features through different perceptual fields. Then, in order to further reduce the complexity of the proposed model, a global average pooling technology is adopted to replace the traditional fully-connected layer. Finally, the architecture and weights of the MSCNN pre-trained on source domain are transferred to the other different but similar tasks with proper fine-tuning instead of training a network from scratch. The proposed MSCNN is evaluated by different transfer scenarios constructed on two famous rolling bearing test-bed. Three case studies show that the proposed framework not only has excellent performance on the source domain, but also has superior transferability on variable working conditions and domains.},

In this paper, a sparse modeling framework is proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Spectral blocks are introduced to be used along with spatial groups to jointly exploit spectral and spatial redundancies. To reduce the computational complexity of sparse modeling, spectral blocks are used to break the high-dimensional optimization problems into small-size sub-problems that are faster to solve. Furthermore, the proposed sparse structure enables to extract the most discriminative spectral blocks and further reduce the computational burden. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Pavia University, Indian Pines and Salinas images verify that the proposed method leads to a robust sparse modeling of hyperspectral images and improves the classification accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method requires less processing time.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition as an identity authentication has been widely used in commodity mobile systems. However due to increasing attacks against face recognition algorithms , mobile systems users begin to concern about the security of face recognition modules in their mobile devices . In this paper, we focus on synthetic and adversarial face image attack on both Baidu and Face++ face comparison APIs. To make a fair comparison, we also tested on Google facenet as the baseline. The results show Both APIs are vulnerable to synthetic and adversarial attacks . Although liveness detection mechanisms could mitigate the synthetic attack in our experiment, not all APIs have this feature. The API without liveness detection mechanism(Face++) is vulnerable to presentation attack. The accept rate in Baidu API could be affected by security level of liveness detection control. Both dodging and impersonation adversarial image attacks are correlated to the perturbation level, the higher perturbation level the more likely to be successful in dodging attack, in the contrast,the lower perturbation level is more likely to lead a successful impersonation attack. In our experiment, Baidu Liveness detection mechanism can detect adversarial images as synthetic images and reject a majority of adversarial image attacks.},

  abstract     = {Ridesharing platforms, as typical applications of spatial crowdsourcing, are becoming more and more popular in the era of mobile internet and sharing economy. One of the most fundamental issues on ridesharing platforms is to assign orders to drivers, which can be naturally modeled as online bipartite matching problem. However, conventional online matching algorithms usually lack data privacy protection mechanisms. This has become a serious issue since the spatiotemporal data of passengers is often sensitive. New policies such as EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also enforce protection of sensitive data, which further exacerbate the privacy issues. To deal with the problems, in this paper we propose a framework based on differential privacy (DP) techniques to preserve the privacy of individuals on ridesharing platforms. Specifically, we devise a novel approach to perturb locations in online minimum bipartite matching problem and theoretically show that the performance of the perturbed matching algorithm has the same magnitude with the unperturbed one. Experiments conducted on real datasets have also shown the effectiveness of proposed framework.},

In this paper, we propose a novel spectral clustering algorithm to improve clustering performance by separately improving these two steps in a same learning framework. Specifically, we first utilize two dimensionality reduction methods to learn the robust low-dimensional spectral representation, and a hypergraph structure to make the spectral representation keep the high-order relation of original data. Furthermore, a spectral rotation clustering method is embedded into the spectral representation learning model to conduct one-step clustering, which effectively reduces the deviation of clustering and obtains a reliable clustering performance. Besides, an effective optimization algorithm is further proposed to solve the objective problem to have a fast convergence. Experimental analysis on real data sets showed that our proposed clustering method outperformed the classical and state-of-the-art spectral clustering methods in terms of four frequently-used clustering metrics .},

  abstract     = {The recently released chest X-ray dataset, ChestX-ray14, has attracted more and more attention on automatic detection of thoracic diseases. In this work, we use deep learning techniques to develop a multi-class classifier. Given a chest X-ray image as input, the classifier outputs a vector of probability values, of which each component corresponds to the probability of having one specific thoracic disease. The merit of our proposed solution is based on several major observations of the ChestX-ray14 data. First, the diversity in ChestX-ray14 is much smaller than that in other natural image datasets such as ImageNet due to very similar global outlines of chest X-ray images. Second, ChestX-ray14 is much more imbalanced than the datasets considered in most existing studies. The size of the largest class is 87.57 times larger than that of the smallest class. Third, from the application perspective, the task is not really cost-sensitive to misclassifications, thus it is difficult to manually fix weights for different misclassifications. To deal with these difficulties, we propose an adaptive sampling method that monitors the performance of the model during training and automatically increase the weight of relatively poorly performed classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Final destination prediction based on initial partial trajectories plays an important role in location-based services (LBSs) and urban computing. Several studies on destination prediction make use of extra information which is often unavailable and reveal privacy of data owners. Many existing approaches are based on various Markov chain models , while they have significant drawbacks due to the Markov property . In general, the solution based on neural networks performs much better than the above approaches, in which Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) provide an effective temporal processing capacity for destination prediction. The Echo State Network (ESN) is the state-of-the-art approach for the design of efficiently trained RNNs, which provides an architecture and supervised learning principle. In this work, we adapt the deep Echo State Network (deepESN) model to taxi destination prediction, which uses only historic trajectories and achieves good results. Based on the original deepESN, we propose a novel model called deepESN with Dual Input (deepESN-DI) to optimize the time complexity of deepESN in training with large amount of data, and combine the Reservoir Computing (RC) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to improve the prediction accuracy, which achieves better prediction results. Experimental results using the dataset provided by the Kaggle taxi trajectory prediction challenge show that our deepESN-DI and deepESN-DI-MLP approaches outperform other destination prediction models based on neural networks , namely MLP, RNN and the shallow ESN architectures.},

Recently, considering the power of generating adversarial network, some methods propose to use GAN to synthesize visual representation by using class attribute or semantic embedding . In this paper, we propose a novel method, named similarity preserving GAN (SPGAN), which can generate unseen visual features from random noises concatenating with semantic descriptions . Specifically, we train a conditional Wasserstein GAN that takes semantic descriptions about an unseen class as input and generates synthesized visual features for this class. For the GAN-based approaches, we hope that the generator can generate as real features as possible. However, the unconstrained training process makes the sample generated by the model deviate greatly from the real sample. To avoid this problem, we propose a similarity preserving loss to regularize the generative network, which helps to minimize the distance between synthesized samples and real samples. Furthermore, we use an ensemble method in the test stage which integrates nearest neighbor classifier and linear softmax classifier. Concretely, in the first stage, we use the nearest neighbor method to pick out the real features that are highly similar to the generated ones, then combine the selected real features with generated features to train the final softmax classifier. Experiments on four popular datasets show that our method can surpass all the most state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {One of the fundamental problems that hinders the current blockchain systems for industrial use is scalability. Lightning Network has been proposed to address this challenge, which executes massive amount of transactions off -chain via pre-constructed payment channels, and only records the final state when a payment channel is closed. However, current Lightning Network heavily rely on the single path payment. When the payment value exceeds the deposit of each individual path, the customer has to close all the existing payment channels and construct a new one from scratch, which we term as the overload issue. In addition, the single path payment bears the inherent risk of sensitive information (e.g., payment value) leaking. In this paper, we propose a multi-path off -chain payment mechanism, termed Rapido , which explicitly addresses the overload and privacy leaking issues by splitting and distributing payment to multiple paths. Specifically, a new smart contract , D-HTLC, is equipped with Rapido to encode multi-path payment protocol. We also theoretically prove that the VDP (Value Distributing Problem) is NP-hard. Finally, extensive experiments show that our approach not only resolves the overload issue but also mitigates the skewness of payment channels. Quantitative results further reveal that with the restriction of no adding new payment channels, the success rate of Rapido is more than 3 times higher than that of the Lightning Network. The implementation will be released upon acceptance.},

  abstract     = {Image semantic segmentation is a basic and challenging computer vision task , where each pixel in an image is classified into a semantic class. In recent years, deep neural networks have settled many computer vision problems such as semantic segmentation , image classification , object detection. A lot of approaches based on deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance on different benchmarks. However, most of them are restricted by the scale of elaborate labeled data to train a deep neural network, especially on image semantic segmentation. Collecting pixel-level annotated images is an extremely time-consuming process. Thus, utilization of synthetic data is becoming prevalent. Nevertheless, simply applying the models trained on synthetic data leads to a dramatic performance drop on real images due to the domain shift. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning method for domain adaptation from the perspectives of both image-level and feature-level. The former adapts images from two domains to appear as if drawn from one domain and the latter attempts to learn similarities between the source and target domains in feature-level common space. To further enhance the adapted model, we introduce a self-training strategy using pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted under various settings and experiment results indicate our unsupervised method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

Due to the fundamental significance, it has drawn much attention in the field of network analysis and mining. Some related works appeared in recent years have significantly advanced our understanding of how to predict the strong and weak ties in the social networks. However, most of the proposed approaches are scenario-aware methods heavily depending on some special contexts and even exclusively used in social networks. As a result, they are less applicable to various kinds of networks. In contrast to the prior studies, here we propose a new computational framework called Neighborhood Estimating Weight (NEW) which is purely driven by the basic structure information of the network and has the flexibility for adapting to diverse types of networks. In NEW, we design a novel index, i.e., connection inclination, to generate the representative features of the network, which is capable of capturing the actual distribution of the tie strength. In order to obtain the optimized prediction results, we also propose a parameterized regression model which approximately has a linear time complexity and thus is readily extended to the implementation in large-scale networks. The experimental results on six real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed predictive model outperforms the state of the art methods, which is powerful for predicting the missing tie strengths when only a part of the network’s tie strength information is available.},

However, the SPCN method suffers from the high computational complexity of dictionary learning, and its official implementation relies on Matlab and CPU. This research proposes the StainCNNs method to simplify the process of stain feature extraction, and imply a GPU-enabled realization to accelerate the learning of stain features in the Tensorflow Framework. What’s more, the StainCNNs method is able to perform the stain normalization quickly in dataset level, more efficient than the SPCN method which is unable to make use of the stain feature distribution in dataset. Stain normalization experiments are conducted on the Camelyon16 dataset and the ICPR2014 dataset, evaluated by the QSSIM score and the FSIM score.

  abstract     = {Activation functions play important roles in determining the depth and non-linearity of deep learning models . Since the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) was introduced, many modifications, in which noise is intentionally injected, have been proposed to avoid overfitting. Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) and their variants, with trainable parameters, have been proposed to reduce the bias shift effects which are often observed in ReLU-type activation functions. In this paper, we propose a novel activation function, called the Elastic Exponential Linear Unit (EELU), which combines the advantages of both types of activation functions in a generalized form. EELU has an elastic slope in the positive part, and preserves the negative signal by using a small non-zero gradient. We also present a new strategy to insert neuronal noise using a Gaussian distribution in the activation function to improve generalization. We demonstrated how EELU can represent a wider variety of features with random noise than other activation functions, by visualizing the latent features of convolutional neural networks . We evaluated the effectiveness of the EELU approach through extensive experiments with image classification using the CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Our experimental results show that EELU achieved better generalization performance and improved classification accuracy over conventional activation functions, such as ReLU, ELU, ReLU- and ELU-like variants, Scaled ELU, and Swish. EELU produced performance improvements in image classification using a smaller number of training samples, owing to its noise injection strategy, which allows significant variation in function outputs, including deactivation.},

The EDSE criteria includes passivity state estimation, dissipativity state estimation, H ∞ state estimation and L 2 − L ∞ L2−L∞ state estimation performances. Sufficient conditions for EDSE criteria are established by choosing Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals (LKF) and using linear matrix inequality (LMIs) technique. New stochastic double integral inequality is applied for the integral term in the derivative of the chosen LKF in main results, which helps to establish EDSE criterion for delayed stochastic neural networks .

  abstract     = {Modern visual pattern recognition methods are based on convolutional networks since they are able to learn complex patterns directly from the data. However, convolutional networks are computationally expensive in terms of floating point operations (FLOPs), energy consumption and memory requirements, which hinder their deployment on low-power and resource-constrained systems. To address this problem, many works have proposed pruning strategies, which remove neurons (i.e., filters) in convolutional networks to reduce their computational cost. Despite achieving remarkable results, existing pruning approaches are ineffective since the accuracy of the network is degraded. This loss in accuracy is an effect of the criterion used to remove filters, as it may result in the removal of the filters with high influence to the classification ability of the network. Motivated by this, we propose an approach that eliminates filters based on the relationship of their outputs with the class label, on a low-dimensional space. This relationship is captured using Partial Least Squares (PLS), a discriminative feature projection method. Due to the nature of PLS, our method focuses on keeping discriminative filters. As a consequence, we are able to remove up to 60\% of FLOPs while improving network accuracy. We show that our criterion is superior to existing pruning criteria, which include state-of-the-art feature selection techniques and handcrafted approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art pruning strategies, our method achieves the best tradeoff between drop/improvement in accuracy and FLOPs reduction.},

Although many state-of-the-art models have been proposed recently, non-adversarial and adversarial domain adaptation , as two major types of deep domain adaptation frameworks, cannot fully address this concern. In this paper, our proposed deep domain adaptation model attempts to address this challenge by leveraging the desired structural properties of both non-adversarial and adversarial models . Our contributions are two-fold: We solve the domain shift problem via domain-specific deep feature generator; we further adapt the generated features to the classification task by introducing task-specific attention learning. We name the proposed framework as ‘Xnet’, given the X- shape of the proposed deep neural network . The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model both on traditional digit recognition tasks and the newly proposed satellite-to-aerial scene adaptation task.

  abstract     = {Data-driven methods for machinery health monitoring and prediction, such as machine learning and statistical pattern recognition techniques, normally requires high quality (less noised), frequently-sampled and large volume time-series data to estimate proper models between system inputs and outputs. However, most of the industrial time-series are highly noisy and only few types of sensory data are available, which challenges the estimation accuracy. This paper proposes a data-driven spectral decomposition framework (denoted as Koopman-CBM) for the machinery health monitoring and prediction problem. Specifically, considering noisy industrial signals in the form of one dimensional time-series, we use the higher-order dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) embeds time-lagged snapshots to increase the spatial complexity of low-dimensional time series and use the total-least-square algorithm to compensate the effect of measurement noise, thereby, extracting accurate dynamical features. The obtained de-noised model characteristics (i.e., eigenvalues, eigenfunctions , Koopman operator) is effective in predicting the system health stages. In parallel, using the Koopman operator as the linear predictor associated with the nonlinear dynamics, we can then perform remaining useful life (RUL) predictions with high accuracy. The experimental validation of the proposed framework is carried out on a rolling bearing datasets for degradation health-stage inspection and RUL prediction. Results show that– compared with other mainstream methods– our approach is capable of identifying the critical degradation stages and achieving higher RUL prediction accuracies.},

Attention is focused on the design of a recursive state estimator in the presence of fading measurements. In terms of the solutions to two sets of matrix difference equations, an upper bound on the estimation error covariance is firstly obtained, and such an upper bound is then minimized through adequately designing the estimator gain.

  abstract     = {Recent work showed neural-network based approaches to reconstructing images from compressively sensed measurements offer significant improvements in accuracy and signal compression . Such methods can dramatically boost the capability of computational imaging hardware. However, to date, there have been two major drawbacks: (1) the high-precision real-valued sensing patterns proposed in the majority of existing works can prove problematic when used with computational imaging hardware such as a digital micromirror sampling device and (2) the network structures for image reconstruction involve intensive computation, which is also not suitable for hardware deployment. To address these problems, we propose a novel hardware-friendly solution based on mixed-weights neural networks for computational imaging. In particular, learned binary-weight sensing patterns are tailored to the sampling device. Moreover, we proposed a recursive network structure for low-resolution image sampling and high-resolution reconstruction scheme. It reduces both the required number of measurements and reconstruction computation by operating convolution on small intermediate feature maps. The recursive structure further reduced the model size, making the network more computationally efficient when deployed with the hardware. Our method has been validated on benchmark datasets and achieved state of the art reconstruction accuracy . We tested our proposed network in conjunction with a proof-of-concept hardware setup.},

  abstract     = {Seeking reliable correspondences has been always the key of achieving image matching task in computer vision. The recent work LFGC aims to achieve this goal by training a binary correspondence classifier, which infers the probabilities of correspondences being inliers and regresses the relative camera pose via learning the input correspondence data. Specially, the LFGC employs multi-layer perceptrons to extract features and context normalization to model underlying contextual relation of correspondences. Nevertheless, the contextual relation obtained by context normalization is easily interfered by outliers, which limits the accuracy and robustness of the correspondence classifier. To address this limitation, based on the observation that the contextual relation in spatial neighborhood is generally well preserved on most scenarios, this paper proposes an improved strategy, i.e. , maximizing local neighborhood consensus to establish robust neighborhood context. Specifically, we construct the neighborhood for correspondences and preserve neighbors’ features similar to their medoids, where the neighborhood information is embedded. Subsequently, we combine this neighborhood structure with multi-layer perceptrons to classify the correspondences as inliers or outliers, simultaneously potential inliers are employed to regress the relative camera pose encoded by the essential matrix. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the improved network can effectively promote performance in outlier removal and camera pose estimation comparing with the baseline.},

Even though collection-based image style transfer methods were proposed to address the single artwork problem, they ignored the relation between the subject and the style of an artwork, which is an important factor in mimicking an artist’s creation mechanism. Based on this consideration, we assume the semantic relationship between the content and style by constructing a subject-related photo-artwork dataset and seek to learn that relationship. We propose a dual-consistency loss to train an encoder decoder network with adversarial discriminator . The dual-consistency loss encourages the output to be semantically and stylistically consistent with subject-related content and style image pair. Thus the visual appearance of the stylized outputs would adapt to the subject of the content image, which increased the diversity of the generated results.

  abstract     = {Recently, object proposal generation has shown value for various vision tasks, such as object detection, semantic instance segmentation , multi-label image classification , and weakly supervised learning, by hypothesizing object locations. We are motivated by the fact that many traditional proposal methods generate dense proposals to cover as many objects as possible but that i) they usually fail to rank these proposals properly and ii) the number of proposals is very large. For example, the well-known object proposal generation methods, Edge Boxes and Selective Search, can achieve high detection recall with thousands of proposals per image. But the large number of generated proposals makes subsequent analyses difficult due to the large number of false alarms and heavy computation load. To significantly reduce the number of proposals, we design a computationally lightweight neural network to refine the initial object proposals. The refinement consists of two parallel processes, re-ranking and box regression. The proposed network can share convolutional features with other high-level tasks by joint training, so the proposal refinement can be very fast. We show a joint training example of object detection in this paper. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a few proposals compared with some well-known proposal generation methods.},

  abstract     = {3D facial landmark detection is a crucial step for many computer vision applications , such as 3D facial expression analysis, 3D face recognition , and 3D cephalometry. Pose variations, expression changes and self-occlusion yet make 3D facial landmark detection a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Facial Landmark Localization Network ( 3DLLN ), which is robust to the above challenges. Different from existing methods, the proposed 3DLLN utilizes the position maps as an intermediate representation, from which 3DLLN detects 3D landmark coordinates. Further, we demonstrate the usage of a deep regression architecture to improve the accuracy and robustness of a large number of landmarks. The proposed scheme is evaluated on two public datasets FRGCv2 subset and BU-3DFE, and is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Product quantization (PQ) and its variations are popular and attractive in approximating nearest neighbor search (ANN) due to their lower memory usage and faster retrieval speed. PQ belongs to a divide-and-conquer algorithm, which decomposes the high-dimensional vector space into disjoint low-dimensional subspaces and employs k -means on them. However, when there is large variance in the average amplitude of the components of the data points, directly utilizing PQ on the data points would result in poor performance. To the end, we propose a novel approach, namely, mean-removed product quantization (MRPQ) to address this issue in this paper. In fact, the average amplitude of a data point or the mean of a data point can be regarded as statistically independent on its residuals. Thus we can learn a separate scalar quantizer of the means of the data points and apply the PQ to their residuals. It is worth noting that our approach can achieve substantial improvements in terms of Recall and MAP over some known methods as shown in our comprehensive experiments. Moreover, our approach is general which can be combined with PQ and its variations. Due to the unbalanced variances of the means among different subspaces, we have developed an adaptive subspace mean-removed product quantization (ASMRPQ) to achieve better performance.},

During training, it is not necessary to specify the target position and movement path of each robot. MRCDRL learns the actions of each robot by training the neural network . MRCDRL uses the neural network structure that was modified from the Duel neural network structure. In the Duel network structure, there are two streams that each represents the state value function and the state-dependent action advantage function, and the results of the two streams are merged. The proposed method can solve the resource competition problem on the one hand and can solve the static and dynamic obstacle avoidance problems between multi-robot in real time on the other hand.

However, the importance of feature embedding, i.e ., exploring the relationship among training samples, is neglected. In this work, we present a simple yet powerful baseline for few-shot classification by emphasizing the importance of feature embedding. Specifically, we revisit the classical triplet network from deep metric learning, and extend it into a deep K -tuplet network for few-shot learning, utilizing the relationship among the input samples to learn a general representation learning via episode-training. Once trained, our network is able to extract discriminative features for unseen novel categories and can be seamlessly incorporated with a non-linear distance metric function to facilitate the few-shot classification. Our result on the miniImageNet benchmark outperforms other metric-based few-shot classification methods. More importantly, when evaluated on completely different datasets (Caltech-101, CUB-200, Stanford Dogs and Cars) using the model trained with miniImageNet, our method significantly outperforms prior methods, demonstrating its superior capability to generalize to unseen classes.},

  abstract     = {In compressed sensing (CS) signal recovery tasks, employing prior constraints to exploit the inherent properties in the signal is critical to the recovery performance. Recently, multiple constraints were employed to improve the reconstruction for video sequence and multi-view image CS reconstruction since they can exploit intra- and inter-image properties simultaneously. However, correlation and dependencies among constraints were not taken into account in existing methods. This drawback prevents the multi-constraint technique from improving the reconstruction performance further. In this paper, we propose to employ local and nonlocal constraints in the CS recovery model to reconstruct video sequences and multi-view images. In the proposed CS recovery model, a pixel-wise total variation constraint is utilized to exploit the spatial local piecewise smoothness in the image. Meanwhile, a patch-based low-rank constraint is applied for the nonlocal inter-image similarity property . These two types of constraints are proposed to be applied in different dimensions with different granularities so as to alleviate the dependency and correlation between the constraints and exploit the intra- and inter-image features in images sufficiently. Besides, an efficient augmented Lagrange multipliers and alternating direction method is presented to solve the proposed local and nonlocal constraint-based CS recovery model (LNLC-CS). Experiments on test video sequences and multi-view images at various sampling rates have demonstrated the great advantages of applying independent constraints in different granularities and dimensions. The proposed method can outperform the existing state-of-the-art CS recovery approaches a lot in both the objective and the subjective quality of the recovered image. Experiments also show the proposed method has made a remarkable improvement over other competing constraint-based methods in the convergence speed and reconstruction time.},

During motion compensation, unlike previous methods directly stacking input images or features for merging, we use learnable attention mechanism to guide the merging, which suppresses undesired components caused by misalignment and enhances desirable fine details. During feature fusion , in contrast to most previous approaches where global-level non-local self-similarity existing in space or time is usually considered, we propose region-level spatial and temporal non-local operations for exploiting temporal correlations and enhancing similar spatial structures. The proposed modules can effectively avoid the computational burden caused by existing global-level non-local operations based on our analysis, and enhance correlated structure information. In addition, we propose a channel attention-guided residual dense block (CRDB), in which a second-order channel attention mechanism is applied to adaptively rescale the channel-wise features for more discriminative representations.

  abstract     = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are believed to be a powerful neural computation framework inspired by the vivo neurons. As a class of recurrent SNNs, liquid state machines (LSMs) are biologically more plausible models imitating the architecture and functions of the human brain for information processing . However, few LSM models can outperform conventional analogue neural networks for solving real-world classification or regression problems , which can mainly be attributed to the sensitivity of the training performance to the architecture of the reservoir and the parameters in the spiking neuron models. Most recently, many algorithms have been proposed for automated machine learning that aims to automatically design the architecture and parameters of deep neural networks without much human intervention. Although automated machine learning and neural architecture search have been extremely successful in conventional neural networks, little research on search for an optimal architecture and hyperparameters of LSMs has been reported. This work proposes on a surrogate-assisted evolutionary search method for optimization of the hyperparameters and neural architecture of the reservoir of LSMs using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). For reducing the search space, the architecture of the LSM is encoded by a connectivity probability together with the hyperparameters in the spiking neuron models. To enhance the computational efficiency, a Gaussian process is adopted as the surrogate to assist the CMA-ES. The proposed GP-assisted CMA-ES is compared with the canonical CMA-ES and a Bayesian optimization algorithm on two popular datasets including image and action recognition. Our results confirm that the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective in optimizing the parameters and architecture of LSMs.},

An effective and efficient representation model is the key to text classification. However, most existing representation models either learn insufficient structural information or just rely on pre-defined structures, resulting in degradation of performance and generalization capability. We propose a novel Sandwich Neural Network (SNN), which is able to learn local semantic and global structural representations automatically without parsers. To combine semantic and structural representations sensibly, we propose four fusion methods incorporated with SNN: Static Fusion, Adaptive Learning, Self-Attention , and Knowledge Attention methods. Static Fusion weights semantic and structural representations equally, Adaptive Learning learns the weights at corpus level, and Self-Attention learns the weights at instance level. More importantly, within Knowledge Attention fusion method, external semantic and structural knowledge are incorporated into SNN to improve the attention procedure and further boost the performance of SNN. Evaluated with four mainstream datasets: Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), SUBJectivity (SUBJ), Movie Reviews (MR) and Stanford Sentiment Treebank with Five Labels (SST-5), the proposed Knowledge Attention Sandwich Neural Network(KA-SNN) model achieves very competitive performance. Specifically, the accuracies achieve 96.2\% (TREC), 94.1\% (SUBJ), 82.3\% (MR) and 51.5\% (SST-5). Moreover, the proposed Knowledge Attention reduces the structural complexity of attention module by 77.66-81.43\% with a computing time reduction of 21.47-34.05\%, compared with Self-Attention fusion method.},

To avoid the artifacts caused by the missing part of image, we flexibly use the gating mechanism and propose an interleaved gated residual block (IGRB) to encourage the useful information flow through the neural network .

In this paper, a novel semidefinite-relaxation-based target localization method is presented by utilizing an adaptive threshold correction scheme. First, whether the measurement is in NLOS propagation is identified according to the prediction stage of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) algorithm. Then, the objective function and constraints are, respectively, constructed according to the measurement model of time of arrival (TOA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) ranging method. By employing the semidefinite relaxation method, the original problem is converted into the SDP problem, in which the corrected measurement information is obtained and thus the accuracy is improved. In addition, a correction method for NLOS propagation threshold is proposed by which an optimal threshold is obtained quickly. Different from the traditional simulation environment without the consideration of obstacles, in this paper, obstacles are set so as to make it closer to the engineering practice.

  abstract     = {Complex networks are widely used in the research of social and biological fields. Analyzing real community structure in networks is the key to the study of complex networks. Modularity optimization is one of the most popular techniques in community detection. However, due to its greedy characteristic, it leads to a large number of incorrect partitions and more communities than in reality. Existing methods use the modularity as a Hamiltonian at the finite temperature to solve the above problem. Nevertheless, modularity is not formalized as a statistical model in the method, which makes many statistical inference methods limited and cannot be used. Moreover, the method uses the sum-product version of belief propagation (BP) and its performance is not as good as the max-sum version, since it calculates per-variable marginal probabilities rather than the joint probability . To address these issues, we propose a novel Markov Random Field (MRF) method by formalizing modularity as an energy function based on the rich structures of MRF to represent properties and constraints of this problem, and use the max-sum BP to infer model parameters. In order to analyze our method and compare it with existing methods, we conducted experiments on both real-world and synthetic networks with ground-truth of communities, showing that the new method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning (DL) applications have redefined the state of the art performance for bearing data driven fault detection and identification, a crucial demand of modern industrial systems. The success of DL methods, in the field of automatic fault diagnosis, is based on the usage of raw sensor data, contrary to conventional machine learning (ML) approaches in which manual extraction of features, from prior expertise knowledge, is necessary. However, DL approaches require a large amount of training data samples to be effective and to outperform competitive ML methods. In this study, we overcome this drawback by proposing the Attentive Dense Convolutional Neural Network (ADCNN), a DL network, which considers the temporal coherence of the data samples, by the combination of Dense Convolutional blocks with an attention mechanism . The proposed neural scheme has fewer unknown learning parameters and achieves accurate results with less training data as it appears from simulation cases on two famous rolling bearings fault detection benchmarks.},

Supervised approaches, especially those in deep learning framework, have demonstrated their effectiveness in video summarization. However, these approaches mainly focus on one of the challenges, and seldom pay close attention to both challenges simultaneously. To this end, we propose to pay close attention to this deficiency by incorporating the ideas of both the encoder-decoder attention and semantic preserving loss in a deep Seq2Seq framework for video summarization. Moreover, we also introduce Huber loss to replace the popular mean square error loss to enhance the robustness of the model to outliers. Extensive experiments on two benchmark video summarization datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.},

However, the network model of these methods is a fully convolutional neural network, which is limited to exploit the differentiated contextual information over the global region in the input image because of the weight sharing in convolution height and width extent. In this paper, we discuss a new SISR method where features are extracted in the low-resolution (LR) space, and then we use a fully connected layer which learns an array of upsampling weights to reconstruct the desired high-resolution (HR) image from the final obtained LR features. By doing so, we effectively exploit the differentiated contextual information over the input image, whilst maintaining the low computational complexity for the overall SR operations. In addition, we introduce an edge difference constraint into our loss function to preserve edges and restore textures. Extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art SISR methods.},

  abstract     = {Model-free control based on the idea of Reinforcement Learning is a promising approach that has recently gained extensive attention. However, Reinforcement-Learning-based control methods solely focus on the regulation problem or learn to track a reference that is generated by a time-invariant exo-system. In the latter case, controllers are only able to track the time-invariant reference dynamics which they have been trained on and need to be re-trained each time the reference dynamics change. Consequently, these methods fail in a number of applications which obviously rely on a trajectory not being generated by an exo-system. One prominent example is autonomous driving . This paper provides for the first time an adaptive optimal control method capable to track arbitrary reference trajectories that are provided on a moving horizon. The main innovation is a novel Q-function that directly incorporates the given reference trajectory. This new Q-function exhibits a particular structure which allows the design of an efficient, iterative, provably convergent Reinforcement Learning algorithm that enables optimal tracking. Two real-world examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method.},

This study proposes a flexible cascade architecture: the lower unit divides the sentence into segments and obtains their distributed representation vector; the upper rhetoric-based long short-term memory unit aggregates the information of every segment and applies the concrete hierarchical relation information to perform sentiment analysis . Auxiliary techniques, namely, data augmentation and relation clustering, are also proposed for preventing overfitting. The experiment results prove that the proposed cascade architecture and auxiliary techniques improve the traditional approaches in most cases, which shows 3.17\% accuracy growth in the fine-grained classification and 1.41\% in the binary tasks at most.

This leads to learning similar vectors for words that share most of their contexts, while expressing different meanings. Therefore, the complex characteristics of words cannot be fully learned by using such models. One of the natural language processing applications that suffers from this problem is sentiment analysis . In this task, two words with opposite sentiments are not distinguished well by using common pre-trained word embeddings . This paper addresses this problem and proposes two simple, but empirically effective, approaches to learn word embeddings for sentiment analysis . The both approaches exploit sentiment lexicons and take into account the polarity of words in learning word embeddings. While the first approach encodes the sentiment information of words into existing pre-trained word embeddings, the second one builds synthetic sentimental contexts for embedding models along with other semantic contexts. The word embeddings obtained from the both approaches are evaluated on several sentiment classification tasks using Skip-gram and GloVe models. Results show that both approaches improve state-of-the-art results using basic deep learning models over sentiment analysis benchmarks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel proposal generation network named RFP-Net by mimicking human visual system for high-quality proposals generation. Specifically, RFP-Net takes receptive fields (RFs) as reference boxes to remove many hyper-parameters of anchor boxes that have large sensibility to object detection results. During network training, we select positive samples using an effective RF (eRF) rule instead of the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) rule, which only requires the centroid of a ground truth box to be within the eRF region. This renders RFP-Net learn the representation of region proposals not limited to be of a fixed range of scales and accurately localize the bounding boxes of region proposals around the eRF. RFP-Net also solves the imbalance problem between negative and positive samples with less computational cost. The proposed RFP-Net significantly improves multiply state-of-the-art two-stage and multi-stage detectors. For example, it achieves 43.1\% AP by combined it with Cascade RCNN on MS COCO dataset, outperforming previous approaches.},

Following the visual perceptual posterior probability theory, local monocular superpixel spatial entropy and the natural scene statistics (NSS) features are firstly utilized to present the high level semantic perceptual mechanism and image naturalness. Then the binocular biological models are applied to extract the binocular features to simulate the inner binocular interaction information, which well complement with the monocular features. Finally, a support vector regression (SVR) model is utilized to predict the objective quality score. Experiments are conducted on four popular stereoscopic image Databases, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model obtains a good consistency with the subjective scores, and has more reliable performance than previous works in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization capability.},

Considering the local geometric structures and the correlations among global variables of the original dataset, ILTSA algorithm is proposed to obtain the projection matrix from original space to feature one. Firstly, since the similarities in both spatial and temporal scales of streaming data cannot be neglected, time weighted distance is defined as the measurement of neighborhoods determination in ILTSA. Secondly, the objective function of ILTSA is reconstructed by introducing mutual information (MI) matrix of global variables. Finally, SVDD algorithm is adopted to establish the monitoring model.

  abstract     = {Nonlocal self-similarity and group sparsity have been widely utilized in image compressive sensing (CS). Most existing methods utilize either internal priors or external priors. However, when the sampling rate is low, the internal prior information of degraded images is not enough for accurate restoration, resulting in loss of image edges and details. And external prior, which learned from clean data, may be not adaptive to the images. In this paper, we propose a joint group and residual sparse coding method for CS image recovery (JGRSC-CS). In the proposed JGRSC-CS, patch group is treated as the basic unit of sparse coding. Different from the idea of encoding a group with a single dictionary (e.g. DCT, Curvelet or K-SVD dictionary), two dictionaries (namely internal and external dictionaries) are applied to exploit the sparse representation of each group simultaneously. The internal self-adaptive dictionary is used to remove artifacts, and an external Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dictionary, learned from clean training images, is used to enhance details and texture. To make the proposed method effective and robust, the split Bregman method is adopted to reconstruct the whole image. Experimental results manifest that with acceptable computational complexity and good convergence property , the proposed JGRSC-CS algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and visual quality.},

To recognize new classes in addition to the learned ones, CNN requires a complete re-training based on earlier and new data samples. This training process of CNN is time consuming. The proposed CFMNN is designed to address this problem without the need of re-training. The CFMNN can learn new data classes in an online mode. In this work, the concept of hyperbox fuzzy set is introduced for CNN to add the online learning proficiency. Four different CNN architectures are considered to verify the robustness of CFMNN performance. The proposed method is evaluated on standard datasets MNIST, Caltech-101, Plant seedlings and CIFAR-100. Accuracy and training time are used as performance metrics. The experimental results show that CFMNN with online learning capability has tremendously reduced training time and it gives compatible or better accuracy than the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {For the past few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have played a dominant role in content-based remote sensing image retrieval (CBRSIR) because of their markedly superior performance. However, most of the CNN models used for CBRSIR were originally meant for image classification instead of for image retrieval . We argue that triplet networks designed in the context of metric learning are more natural and suitable for CBRSIR. However, they only use information about whether or not two input images belong to the same class, and fail to fully exploit class labels. Besides, all existing CNN-based CBRSIR methods ignore prior knowledge about interclass relationship, which, if used properly, can greatly improve retrieval performance . To address these issues, we introduce an easy way to organize semantic relationship among classes as a category tree, and propose a novel CNN model called tree-triplet-classification (T-T-C) network , the key characteristics of which can be summarized as follows: firstly, a T-T-C network integrates metric learning with classification prediction, simultaneously learning similarity measurement and categorizing images and, hence, taking advantage of the complementary capabilities of the existing CNN-based approaches; secondly, the loss functions coupled with a T-T-C network lay emphasis on the structure of a category tree, using prior semantic knowledge to adaptively adjust the “pull-push” mechanism during training; finally, a T-T-C network is lightweight, and its features are very compact. We carry out extensive experiments over publicly available datasets, and achieve a state-of-the-art retrieval performance .},

The LSGAN can expand the dataset to address the issue of overfitting when only limited OCT training samples are available. Specifically, our LSGAN consists of three components: generator, discriminator , and classifier. The generator generates synthetic unlabeled images that are similar to the real OCT images, while the discriminator distinguishes whether the synthetic images are real or generated. To train the classifier with both real labeled images and synthetic unlabeled images, we design artificial pseudo labels as label smoothing for the synthetic unlabeled images. Thus, the mixing of the synthetic images and real images can be used as training data to improve the classification performance. Experimental results on two real OCT datasets demonstrate the superiority of our LSGAN method over several well-known classifiers, especially under the condition of limited training data.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are increasingly attracting attention in the computer vision, natural language processing , speech synthesis and similar domains. Arguably the most striking results have been in the area of image synthesis . However, evaluating the performance of GANs is still an open and challenging problem. Existing evaluation metrics primarily measure the dissimilarity between real and generated images using automated statistical methods. They often require large sample sizes for evaluation and do not directly reflect human perception of image quality. In this work, we describe an evaluation metric we call Neuroscore , for evaluating the performance of GANs, that more directly reflects psychoperceptual image quality through the utilization of brain signals. Our results show that Neuroscore has superior performance to the current evaluation metrics in that: (1) It is more consistent with human judgment; (2) The evaluation process needs much smaller numbers of samples; and (3) It is able to rank the quality of images on a per GAN basis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based neuro-AI interface is proposed to predict Neuroscore from GAN-generated images directly without the need for neural responses. Importantly, we show that including neural responses during the training phase of the network can significantly improve the prediction capability of the proposed model.

This paper aims to design an innovative framework to characterize in-vehicle activities using ubiquitous WiFi devices for the safety benefits of drivers. In our presented device-free system, driver’s activities are investigated as multi-class classification problem leveraging Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signals. In this novel approach, we have examined the capability of the Sparse Least Square Support Vector Machine (SLS-SVM) with Baye’s maximum likelihood estimation for better discrimination of in-vehicle activities. In this framework, multiple classifiers are arranged in a multi-layer hierarchy for higher scalability as compared to conventional single-layer methods. This sophisticated scheme leads to address the problem of driver’s activity recognition with significant improvement in performance. The proposed low-cost solution can provide an average recognition accuracy of 91.5\% for valuable insight into the design of an autonomous driving system.},

It is essential towards the development of intelligent machines that can adapt to their surroundings. In this work we focus on a lifelong learning approach to unsupervised generative modeling, where we continuously incorporate newly observed distributions into a learned model. We do so through a student-teacher Variational Autoencoder architecture which allows us to learn and preserve all the distributions seen so far, without the need to retain the past data nor the past models. Through the introduction of a novel cross-model regularizer, inspired by a Bayesian update rule, the student model leverages the information learned by the teacher, which acts as a probabilistic knowledge store. The regularizer reduces the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when we learn over sequences of distributions. We validate our model’s performance on sequential variants of MNIST, FashionMNIST, PermutedMNIST, SVHN and Celeb-A and demonstrate that our model mitigates the effects of catastrophic interference faced by neural networks in sequential learning scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble models achieve high accuracy by combining a number of base estimators and can increase the reliability of machine learning compared to a single estimator. Additionally, an ensemble model enables a machine learning method to deal with imbalanced data , which is considered to be one of the most challenging problems in machine learning. In this paper, the capability of Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is integrated with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to design a new machine learning method, AdaBoost-CNN, which can deal with large imbalanced datasets with high accuracy. AdaBoost is an ensemble method where a sequence of classifiers is trained. In AdaBoost, each training sample is assigned a weight, and a higher weight is set for a training sample that has not been trained by the previous classifier. The proposed AdaBoost-CNN is designed to reduce the computational cost of the classical AdaBoost when dealing with large sets of training data, through reducing the required number of learning epochs for its ingredient estimator. AdaBoost-CNN applies transfer learning to sequentially transfer the trained knowledge of a CNN estimator to the next CNN estimator, while updating the weights of the samples in the training set to improve accuracy and to reduce training time. Experimental results revealed that the proposed AdaBoost-CNN achieved 16.98\% higher accuracy compared to the classical AdaBoost method on a synthetic imbalanced dataset. Additionally, AdaBoost-CNN reached an accuracy of 94.08\% on 10,000 testing samples of the synthetic imbalanced dataset, which is higher than the accuracy of the baseline CNN method, i.e. 92.05\%. AdaBoost-CNN is computationally efficient, as evidenced by the fact that the training simulation time of the proposed method is 47.33 s, which is lower than the training simulation time required for a similar AdaBoost method without transfer learning, i.e. 225.83 s on the imbalanced dataset. Moreover, when compared to the baseline CNN, AdaBoost-CNN achieved higher accuracy when applied to four other benchmark datasets including CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST. AdaBoost-CNN was also applied to the EMNIST datasets, to determine its impact on large imbalanced classes, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to CNN.},

Therefore, we propose a new Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Privileged Information (PI-DCNN) for photo aesthetic assessment by utilizing the prior knowledge of photo and photographic elements as privileged information. This paper is the first to systematically summarize all the attributes (i.e., photo and photographic attributes) related to aesthetics assessment. Specifically, we first explore the privileged information of photo and photography attributes, which is available at the training stage but it is not available for the test set. After that, we transfer the probabilistic dependency relations as constraints, and formulate photo aesthetics assessment in a deep convolutional neural network. Lastly, we propose a new pair-wise ranking loss that can exploit the relationship of photo aesthetic quality within a pair of photos.

First, the constrained robustness of partly-unknown systems problems can be transformed into event-triggered optimal control problems with a suitable value function. Second, the identifier network and the critic network are applied to approximate the partly-unknown system and the cost function, respectively. In addition, the stability proof of the closed-loop system is addressed by Lyapunov theory with an appropriate triggering condition and the uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system is proved under the event-triggered mechanism. Moreover, the simulation experiments results show the superiority of the event-triggered mechanism via adaptive dynamic programming. The optimal control pair are only updated at the aperiodic sampling times determined by the event triggering condition, which can greatly improve the efficiency of communication resource utilization and save computing storage space.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, outstanding image-based object detectors were extended for video object detection. Such extension requires to address two challenging problems in videos, namely, scale variation and deformation anomaly. Most image-based works deal with scale variation by resizing the input image for multi-scale training and testing. Such way incurs very high computational cost, which becomes even higher in videos. For deformation anomaly, low-quality RoI feature can be caused by motion blur, video defocus and rare poses, resulting to poor detection accuracy in videos. In this paper, an end-to-end scale-aware coupling-structure network (SCNet) focusing on the two issues is proposed for video object detection with high accuracy and affordable computation. In SCNet, a lightweight scale-aware module is structured to flexibly model the object scale variation, which mainly consists of a set of dilated convolutional layers with parameter constraint. Furthermore, a coupling-structure RoI (region of interest) module is designed to extract robust RoI feature with position-sensitive and context-sensitive information for accuracy improvement. Besides, the feature aggregation strategy is simplified for efficiency. Experiments are conducted on the ImageNet VID dataset. SCNet achieves the state-of-the-art detection performance, exactly 79.5\% mAP, with 5.9 points improvement compared to the strong single-frame baseline.},

Correspondingly, three kinds of relationships exist between neighboring agents in the network. Furthermore, consider that only agents in the first layer are pinned by virtual leaders, then based on the graph theory, Lyapunov function method, and optimization technique, some criteria for realizing group consensus of the network under fixed topology and switching topologies are established, which mainly depend on the topology and time intervals of the switching signal. It is found out that when the group consensus is achieved, the agents in the first layer follow the leaders asymptotically, while the agents in the second layer converge to opposite states of the leaders.

In the past decades, many algorithms have been proposed for this emerging machine learning paradigm. However, these methods often focus on designing new classification strategies. If the original input data with a high dimensionality , it will suffer from the curse of dimensionality and get highly biased estimates. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel feature construction approach named Structured Feature (SF), which can achieve a discriminant representation for multi-label data by exploiting the local and global geometric structures. These structures are characterized by the reconstruction coefficients of data in manifold and sparse subspaces. Since reconstruction coefficients reflect the data similarity relationships, and the similar data usually has the common class labels, SF incorporates the similarity relationships and supervised information into the feature representation. The SF contains supervised information , thus, even though classifier design ignores the correlations and interdependences between labels, it is able to obtain satisfactory classification performance.SF combines manifold and sparse structures in the feature representation for multi-label learning. Extensive experiments validate that SF can achieve comparable to or even better results than other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Network pruning has been proven to be an effective approach for relieving such burdens. However, the pruning ratio and accuracy of the existing methods need to be improved. In this paper, a scheme of network channel pruning, based on sparse learning and the genetic algorithm, is proposed to achieve a better balance between the pruning ratio and accuracy. A gradient-limited L 1/2 regularization is introduced into the model training, to achieve channel-level sparsity . In addition, a dynamically adjustable evaluation factor is proposed to evaluate the importance of channels and the genetic algorithm is utilized to acquire a suitable subnetwork from the sparse model.

Then, the extracted features are fed to SCLD for acquiring spatial context information from different depths of the network. Specially, SCLD consists of three dilated attention modules (DAM). Each DAM applies channel attention mechanism (CA) and spatial attention mechanism (SA) to process extracted features for obtaining spatial context information from the channel and spatial dimensions, respectively. Finally, the features with spatial context information are processed by DRM for crowd density estimation. Experiments are conducted on the ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, UCF-QNRF datasets, and the performance of our method is competitive to the other state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we also evaluate SCLNet on the crowd localization task with the UCF-QNRF dataset, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

However, face occlusion is still the key problem in person identification, such as in the field of anti-terrorism, criminal cases and public security. To solve this problem, an improved end-to-end deep generative adversarial network (named EyesGAN) has been proposed to synthesize human face from human eyes in this paper, which can be used as a potential scheme for masked face recognition. BicycleGAN is chosen as the baseline and effective improvements have been achieved. First, the self-attentional mechanism is introduced so that the improved model can more effectively learn about the internal mapping between human eyes and face. Second, the perceptual loss is applied to guide the model cyclic training and help with updating the network parameters so that the synthesized face can be of higher-similarity to the ground truth face. Third, EyesGAN has been designed by getting the utmost out of the performance of the perceptual loss and the self-attentional mechanism in GANs. A dataset of eyes-to-face synthesis has been reconstructed based on the public face datasets for training and testing. Finally, the faces synthesized by EyesGAN have been quantitatively and qualitatively compared with the results of existing methods. Extensive experiments demenstrate that our proposed method has performed better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of Average Euclidean Distance , Average Cosine Similarity , Synthesis Accuracy Percentage, Fréchet Inception Distance, and Baidu face recognition rate (the accuracy achieved 96.1\% 96.1\% on 615 test data of CelebA database).

However, considering the complex dependencies of crowd flows prediction, the current models generally neglected the multi-scale correlation of spatial view and weakened the influence of external features on crowd flows data. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework, called MV-RANet, to deal with them and further improve the prediction performance. Firstly, a double-branch residual attention network was utilized to model the spatial correlation between fine-grained regions and coarse-grained functional areas separately with different branch. And furthermore, some human mobility pattern information were incorporated in MV-RANet to capture the correlation between functional areas in a different view. And as for the impact of external factors, we combined them with crowd flows data by multi-channel mechanism, which can make the external factors and spatio-temporal crowd flows data one-to-one mapping, to refine their influence on the crowd flows. We evaluated our model with two different datasets, a large scale Call Detail Records (CDRs) data and Beijing taxicabs’ trajectories data (TaxiBJ) (Zhang et al., 2017). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MV-RANet consistently outperforms all the baselines.},

Data-driven methods are an effective way to enhance the visual realism of crowd simulation. However, the existing work mainly focuses on training models for specific scenarios and applies them to the same scenario, so it lacks consideration of scene adaptability. To address this problem, we present a residual network based scene-independent crowd simulation (ResNet-SICS) framework to simulate crowd motion. First, a data-driven crowd properties quantization (DCPQ) method is proposed. This method divides crowd properties into physical properties and social properties: the physical properties (such as the position and the velocity) are extracted from a large number of real videos, and the social properties (such as local cohesiveness and global collectiveness) are then quantified according to the physical properties of crowds. Second, a residual network for crowd behavior properties learning (ResNet-CBPL) motion prediction model is established. This model takes the crowd properties as parameters to construct the residual network, and uses real data to learn the movement rules of the crowd. The ResNet-CBPL motion prediction model can fit the movement behavior of the crowd more accurately than can other models. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system based on ResNet-CBPL to visualize the results of theoretical analysis in a graphical way. The experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate the crowd motion more realistically, and the trained crowd simulation framework can be applied to various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The discrete-time fault-tolerant control method for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) is investigated for the first time in this paper based on adaptive fuzzy theory, where the designed controllers consider faults containing both loss of effectiveness and bias. Firstly, with the help of Euler method , the discrete-time model of PMSMs is obtained. Secondly, adaptive fuzzy theory is used to realize fault-tolerant control of PMSMs. Next, dynamic surface control is used to resolve the problems of “explosion of complexity” and noncausal in discrete-time systems caused by backstepping. It is proved that the proposed method can guarantee all signals and states in the closed-loop system are semi-global uniform ultimate bounded when the faults occur and the position tracking error can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed control method has strong fault-tolerant performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Given the importance of a diverse and vast amount of realistic and labeled electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in improving the performance of biomedical signal processing algorithms , and the situation of severe lack of the signals, three generative models based on deep learning are introduced for the generation of ECG signals: The WaveNet-based model, the SpectroGAN model, and the WaveletGAN model. The WaveNet-based model adopts μ -law companding transformation as a preprocessing method and then is followed by a sequence of convolutional layers with dilation; SpectroGAN and WaveletGAN use short-term Fourier transform (STFT) and stationary wavelet transform (SWT) respectively to obtain suitable input form for the generative adversarial networks (GAN). Our proposed models are capable of generating ECG signals containing three different heartbeat types: normal beat, left bundle branch block beat and right bundle branch block beat. The synthetic ECG signals generated by our models are more realistic since deep artificial neural networks can discover intricate structure and characteristics of real ECG signals instead of manually setting specific parameters for synthesis. Besides, ECG signals produced by one of our proposed models could be naturally continuous and be up to more than 20 seconds. Furthermore, we first provide an evaluation approach for quantitatively demonstrating the performance of ECG generative models . The study demonstrates that deep learning is a feasible and effective method for ECG generation. Our proposed ECG generative models can be utilized to assess biomedical signal processing algorithms so as to improve their performance in clinical trials.},

EEG is very susceptible to a variety of physiological signals , which brings great difficulties to the research and analysis of EEG signals. Therefore, removing noise from EEG signals is a key prerequisite for analyzing EEG signals. In this paper, a one-dimensional residual Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-ResCNN) model for raw waveform-based EEG denoising is proposed to solve the above problem. An end-to-end (i.e. waveform in and waveform out) manner is used to map a noisy EEG signal to a clean EEG signal. In the training stage, an objective function is often adopted to optimize the model parameters and in the test stage, the trained 1D-ResCNN model is used as a filter to automatically remove noise from the contaminated EEG signal. The proposed model is evaluated on the EEG signal from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, and the added noise signals are obtained from the database. We compared the proposed model with the independent of the composite analysis (ICA), the fast independent composite analysis (FICA),Recursive least squares(RLS) filter,Wavelet Transform (WT) and Deep neural network(DNN) models. Experimental Results show that the proposed model can yield cleaner waveforms and achieve significant improvement in SNR and RMSE.Meanwhile, the proposed model can also preserve the nonlinear characteristics of EEG signals.},

  abstract     = {In many machine learning tasks, learning a good representation of the data can be the key to building a well-performant solution. This is because most learning algorithms operate with the features in order to find models for the data. For instance, classification performance can improve if the data is mapped to a space where classes are easily separated, and regression can be facilitated by finding a manifold of data in the feature space. As a general rule, features are transformed by means of statistical methods such as principal component analysis, or manifold learning techniques such as Isomap or locally linear embedding. From a plethora of representation learning methods, one of the most versatile tools is the autoencoder . In this paper we aim to demonstrate how to influence its learned representations to achieve the desired learning behavior . To this end, we present a series of learning tasks: data embedding for visualization, image denoising , semantic hashing, detection of abnormal behaviors and instance generation. We model them from the representation learning perspective, following the state of the art methodologies in each field. A solution is proposed for each task employing autoencoders as the only learning method. The theoretical developments are put into practice using a selection of datasets for the different problems and implementing each solution, followed by a discussion of the results in each case study and a brief explanation of other six learning applications. We also explore the current challenges and approaches to explainability in the context of autoencoders. All of this helps conclude that, thanks to alterations in their structure as well as their objective function, autoencoders may be the core of a possible solution to many problems which can be modeled as a transformation of the feature space.},

Numerous algorithms have been proposed; however, a better assessment performance is still expected by the market. Nowadays, there are more available relevant data from various sources in urban areas, which have a potential impact on the house value. In this paper, we propose to fuse urban data, i.e., metadata and imagery data, with house attributes to unveil the market value of the property in Philadelphia. Specifically, two deep neural networks , i.e., metadata fusion network and image appraiser, are proposed to extract the representations, i.e., expected levels, from metadata and street-view images, respectively. A boosted regression tree (BRT) is adapted to estimate the market values of houses with the fused metadata and expected levels. The experimental results with the data collected from the city of Philadelphia demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The research presented in this paper also provides the real estate industry a new reference to the property value assessment with the data fusion methodology.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks with multiple branches have recently been proved highly effective in person re-identification (re-ID). Researchers design multi-branch networks using part models, yet they always attribute the effectiveness to multiple parts. In addition, existing multi-branch networks always have isomorphic branches, which lack structural diversity. In order to improve this problem, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Branch and Multi-level Classification Network (HBMCN), which is designed based on the pre-trained ResNet-50 model. A new heterogeneous branch, SE-Res-Branch, is proposed based on the SE-Res module, which consists of the Squeeze-and-Excitation block and the residual block. Furthermore, a new multi-level classification joint objective function is proposed for the supervised learning of HBMCN, whereby multi-level features are extracted from multiple high-level layers and concatenated to represent a person. Based on three public person re-ID benchmarks (Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03), experimental results show that the proposed HBMCN reaches 94.4\%, 85.7\% and 73.8\% in Rank-1, and 85.7\%, 74.6\% and 69.0\% in mAP, achieving a state-of-the-art performance. Further analysis demonstrates that the specially designed heterogeneous branch performs better than an isomorphic branch, and multi-level classification provides more discriminative features compared to single-level classification. As a result, HBMCN provides substantial further improvements in person re-ID tasks.},

The essence of most CNN-based models is to learn the non-linear mapping between low-resolution patches and corresponding high-resolution ones. However, numerous convolutions are applied to implement this mapping, which directly contributes to large model sizes and huge graphics memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a lightweight feature enhancement residual network (FERN) to achieve prominent performance by incorporating lightweight non-local operations into the residual block. By taking advantage of utilizing this non-locally enhanced residual block, the proposed model can capture long-range dependencies. For further improving performance, we design the structure-aware channel attention layer that explicitly boosts feature maps with more structural and textural details. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed approach performs favorably against the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in terms of visual quality and inference time.},

However, existing methods suffer from great challenges due to time-consuming optimization and lack of ground truth. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid retinal image registration, which directly learns the mapping from a retinal image pair to their corresponding deformation field without any supervision such as ground truth registration fields. Specifically, we formulate the complex mapping as a parameterized deformation function, which can be represented and optimized by a deep neural network . Furthermore, the Structure-Driven Regression Network (SDRN) framework is applied to compute the multi-scale similarity combined with contextual structures (e.g., vessel distribution, optic disk appearance, and edge information) to guide the end-to-end learning procedure more effectively with unlabeled data . Given a new pair of images, our method can quickly register images by directly evaluating the parametric function using the learned parameters, which runs faster than traditional registration algorithms. Experimental results, performed on the public challenging dataset (FIRE), show that our method achieves an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.753 with short execution times (0.021 s), which is more accurate and robust than existing approaches and promises to significantly speed up retinal image analysis and processing.},

However, most methods applied to decode SSVEPs are limited to CCA and some extended CCA-based methods. This study proposed a comparing network based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was used to learn the relationship between EEG signals and the templates corresponding to each stimulus frequency of SSVEPs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing it with the standard CCA and other state-of-the art methods for decoding SSVEPs (i.e., CNN and TRCA) on the actual SSVEP datasets collected from 23 subjects. The comparison results indicate that the CNN-based comparing network can significantly improve the classification accuracy . Furthermore, the comparing network with TRCA achieved the best performance among three methods based on comparing network with the averaged accuracy of 91.24\% (data length: 2s) and 86.15\% (data length: 1s). The study validated the efficiency of the proposed CNN-based comparing network in decoding SSVEPs. It suggests that the comparing network with TRCA is a promising methodology for target identification of SSVEPs and could further improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI system.},

  abstract     = {Mobile robots have a crucial role in many domains. Currently, service robots can be found in our homes, transportation robots in warehouses, logistic robots in factories and even on Mars, where rovers are exploring its surface. These intelligent machines are becoming increasingly autonomous, as they have to achieve longer and longer missions. Thus, to maintain autonomy and to guarantee material security, Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) is a mandatory task. A fault causes a mission to fail or, worse, it may damage materials and operators if the robot goes out of control. In this paper, we propose to address the FDI process. First, we present two modified versions of two known methods based on parameter estimation. Then, a mixed version of Particle Filter (PF) which combines a standard PF and a Gaussian PF to generate a better performing FDI method is proposed. These methods are studied in the case of a wheel block fault. Simulation and real robot experimentation results prove the added value of our proposed FDI method over the other two approaches.},

  abstract     = {Natural language processing is a useful processing technique of language data, such as text and speech. Sequence labeling represents the upstream task of many natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text classification , and sentiment classification. In this paper, the focus is on the sequence labeling task, in which semantic labels are assigned to each unit of a given input sequence. Two frameworks of latent variable conditional random fields (CRF) models (called LVCRF-I and LVCRF-II) are proposed, which use the encoding schema as a latent variable to capture the latent structure of the hidden variables and the observed data. Among the two designed models, the LVCRF-I model focuses on the sentence level, while the LVCRF-II works in the word level, to choose the best encoding schema for a given input sequence automatically without handcraft features. In the experiments, the two proposed models are verified by four sequence prediction tasks, including named entity recognition (NER), chunking, reference parsing and POS tagging. The proposed frameworks achieve better performance without using other handcraft features than the conventional CRF model. Moreover, these designed frameworks can be viewed as a substitution of the conventional CRF models. In the commonly used LSTM-CRF models, the CRF layer can be replaced with our proposed framework as they use the same training and inference procedure. The experimental results show that the proposed models exhibit latent variable and provide competitive and robust performance on all three sequence prediction tasks.},

The practical WMR model with coupled inputs as two torques for each wheel is difficult for the designed controllers to achieve finite-time convergence. A novel adaptive finite-time tracking control strategy is proposed by satisfying the time-varying constraints and utilizing barrier Lyapunov functions . It is proved that the controllers we designed are finite-time stable, and each tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the original states in a finite time without violation of the full state constraints. Finally, a simulation based on a practical WMR model is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed tracking control method . By using the exponential-decayed time-varying constraints, the simulation results show that the tracking control effect is very optimistic, which means that the control method proposed in this paper has great significance in engineering.},

  abstract     = {The past years have witnessed the successful development of intelligent machinery fault diagnostic methods. Besides the basic data-driven fault diagnosis tasks where the training and testing data are collected from the same distribution, the more practical cross-domain problems have also attracted much attention considering variations of machine operating conditions. In the literature, most existing studies generally assume the availability of testing data during model training, thus facilitating explicit domain adaptations. However, this assumption poses obstacles in the application on real-time cross-domain fault diagnosis, where the testing data can not be obtained in advance. This paper proposes a deep learning-based domain generalization method for machinery fault diagnosis. A domain augmentation method is adopted to expand the available dataset. Domain adversarial training is implemented, and generalized features can be learned from different domains, which hold in new working scenarios without assuming the availability of testing data. Distance metric learning is also used to further enhance model robustness in fault classifications. Through experiments on two rotating machinery datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated, which is promising in on-line cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks.},

Few of them conduct systematic research on object detection. However, object detection is different from classification, which requires not only semantic information but also localization information. In this paper, based on discrimination-aware channel pruning (DCP) which is state-of-the-art pruning method for classification, we propose a localization-aware auxiliary network to find out the channels with key information for classification and regression so that we can conduct channel pruning directly for object detection, which saves lots of time and computing resources. In order to capture the localization information, we first design the auxiliary network with a contextual RoIAlign layer which can obtain precise localization information of the default boxes by pixel alignment and enlarges the receptive fields of the default boxes when pruning shallow layers. Then, we construct a loss function for object detection task which tends to keep the channels that contain the key information for classification and regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On MS COCO, we prune 70\% parameters of the SSD based on ResNet-50 with modest accuracy drop, which outperforms the-state-of-art method.},

Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful and flexible models for modeling time-series data. However, the high time complexity of GPs limits their applications in online anomaly detection. Attributed to some internal or external changes, concept drift usually occurs in time-series data, where the characteristics of data and meanings of abnormal behaviors alter over time. Online anomaly detection methods should have the ability to adapt to concept drift. Motivated by the above facts, this paper proposes the method of sparse Gaussian processes with Q-function (SGP-Q). The SGP-Q employs sparse Gaussian processes (SGPs) whose time complexity is lower than that of GPs, thus significantly speeding up online anomaly detection. By using Q-function properly, the SGP-Q can adapt to concept drift well. Moreover, the SGP-Q makes use of few abnormal data in the training data by its strategy of updating training data, resulting in more accurate sparse Gaussian process regression models and better anomaly detection results. We evaluate the SGP-Q on various artificial and real-world datasets. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the SGP-Q.},

  abstract     = {Breast ultrasonography is currently considered the first-line examination in the diagnosis of breast lesions or other abnormalities. Many automated breast cancer diagnosis methods have been developed for ultrasonography images; however, most previous automated methods used only a single breast ultrasonography image. This is inconsistent with the real-world situation, as breast cancer is heterogeneous, and it can lead to high false negative rates. Generally, sonographers diagnose a lesion by reviewing multiple planes. In this paper, we formulate the diagnosis of breast cancer on ultrasonography images as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, diagnosing a breast nodule by jointly analyzing the nodule on multiple planes. An attention-augmented deep neural network is then developed to solve this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a MIL framework on such data. A large breast ultrasonography image dataset was constructed to train and evaluate the model; this contained 10,464 images from 3700 lesions labeled as benign or malignant, which originated from 2568 patients. The high classification accuracy achieved demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The MIL based method obtained superior performance to single instance methods in this breast cancer diagnosis task. Notably, the proposed attention-augmented network allowed us to find key instances, which can be provided the region of interest (ROI) in the final diagnosis given to a doctor. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art MIL methods.},

To solve this problem, an improved algorithm called BLW-ELM, which integrates LW-ELM into the Boosting ensemble learning framework, is presented in this paper. Specifically, BLW-ELM designates the appropriate cost for each training label belonging to each training instance according to the iterative feedbacks of the training results, further gets rid of exploring the intricate distribution of multi-label data directly.

We propose a Channel-wise Spatio-Temporal Representation learning block (CSTR), which is trained to discriminate between salient spatio-temporal patterns and non-salient spatio-temporal patterns in separated channels. A whole CNN architecture based on this block is constructed for video salient object detection. This architecture combines dynamic saliency learned from CSTR and static saliency learned from a constructed Multi-scale Dilated Convolution block (MDC), deriving the final saliency detection results. This intuitive combination improves feature representation capability which contributes to more precise detection results. Compared with previous works that leverage optical flow or RNNs (LSTM, GRU etc.) to utilize temporal cues, the proposed method is simple to implement and offers an intuitive way to understand how spatio-temporal patterns are correlated with salient regions .

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match the photos of suspects in the gallery database by a query photo. Under Re-ID, the input is usually a query photo of the target person, however, in a realistic setting, such a photo is not always available. In this paper, we study the problem of Sketch Re-ID, which is not based on a person&#39;s photo but the professional sketch of the target person. We use a full-body sketch of a target person drawn by a professional to find the photo with the same ID in the gallery. This problem is very challenging because photos and sketches belong to two completely different domains. Specifically, a sketch is a highly abstract description of a person, which only contains some rough outline information. We address the Sketch Re-ID problem by proposing a novel framework to jointly model photos and sketches into a common embedding space. Our framework uses a triplet classification network as a base network. We propose to use a spatial attention module and combine high-level and mid-level output features of CNN to represent the input images. Moreover, we design a novel domain-invariant feature by using a gradient reverse layer (GRL) to solve the domain gap problem. We validated our approach on the Sketch Re-ID dataset, which contains 200 persons, each of whom has a sketch and two photos from different cameras associated. To evaluate the generalization of our method, we also performed experiments on some other public Sketch-based Image Retrieval (SBIR) datasets. The extensive experimental results show that our method can get higher performance than state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Discovering the relationship between two entities in a sentence is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing . Due to the superior feature learning capacity, deep learning-based relationship extraction methods have become prevailing. However, most of them rely on the features provided by tools such as dependency parser , part-of-speech tagger, or named entity recognizers. Moreover, although models such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks have their merits in text feature extraction, the semantic representation of entities’ relationships are still far from optimal. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end multi-level semantic representation enhancement network (MLSREN). MLSREN can enhance the semantic representation of entities from word, phrase, and context level. Furthermore, to extract deeper semantic information of phrases with fewer network parameters, a LightText-CNN is proposed for local feature extraction. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval-2010 task 8 dataset, the results demonstrate that our model significantly improves state-of-the-art performance. To better understand performance achieved by MLSREN, we also analyze the contribution of each network component as well as the problems in the feature selection of the current relationship extraction models.},

  abstract     = {An accurate blur kernel is key to blind image deblurring and kernel estimation heavily relies on strong edges in the observed image [ 1 , 2, 3]. Previous methods [4] [5] leveraging image gradient prior with i.i.d statistics can hardly restrict strong edges in a noisy-blurred image, since both noise and strong edges are presented as strong gradients. In this paper, we propose a dynamic structure prior (DSP) to distinguish strong edges from noise by a non local total variation regularization . Our method measures accumulated intensity change of each pixel along all possible directions within its neighborhood. In this case, the structural contents with less change in certain directions, i.e .strong edges, will be accumulated lower than non-structural contents such as noise. By contrast, the previous image gradient priors only measure the changes in horizontal and vertical directions, which is not capable to present the directional characteristic of image edges. Moreover, in our method, the prior changes the weight dynamically with regard to local structures to impose fewer penalties on pixels with large changes. As a result, strong edges are preserved while fine textures are suppressed by large penalties. At last, a cost function containing the dynamic structure prior and L 0 gradient prior that sharpens the preserved edges is proposed to estimate blur kernels from noisy-blurred images. Comprehensive experimental results show that our method outperforms previous methods in both commonly used datasets with various noise levels and real world images, from monochrome image to color image.},

However, the relationships among objects of the real world are often high-order rather than pairwise. Naively applying pairwise grouping methods to high-order grouping tasks will not always obtain the desired clustering results since there is a loss of information. In this paper, we propose a fast hypergraph clustering algorithm via the Nyström Extension. As the hyperedge of the hypergraph allows us to join any number of vertices, high-order relationships among objects can be captured. In contrast to some previous works in the Nyström research focusing on the error bound for the Nyström-approximated kernel matrix, we present an error bound for the approximated eigenvectors associated with the Nyström Extension of hypergraph Laplacian. In addition, a novel formulation for sampling size selection is provided. Our experiments on a series of UCI data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly speeding and lower storage. Specifically, our algorithm outperforms the pairwise spectral grouping method based on the Nyström method in terms of accuracy, computation time and space occupation.},

Then, a kind of leader–follower particle swarm optimization (LFPSO) algorithm is put forward to optimize the parameters of the SVM algorithm such that the probability trapping into the local optimum is effectively reduced. Next, the proposed LFPSO-SVM approach is employed to further classify and recognize the features extracted from the pipeline leakage data via the SAE network. Moreover, the performance of the SAE-LFPSO-SVM approach is quantitatively evaluated by three performance indicators, i.e., sensitivity, positive predictive value and total classification accuracy .

  abstract     = {Hashing has been widely used for large-scale multimedia retrieval because of its advantages in storage and retrieval efficiency. Traditional supervised hash methods represent an image as a feature vector and then perform a separate quantization step to generate a binary code. Due to the difficulty of discrete optimization of hash codes, continuous relaxation is generally used to replace discrete optimization . However, the process of continuous relaxation leads to inevitable quantization error . To avoid this drawback, a deep balanced discrete hashing method is proposed, which uses discrete gradient propagation with the straight-through estimator. The proposed method does not use the traditional continuous relaxation strategy, thereby reducing the quantization error caused by continuous relaxation. And the proposed method uses supervised information to directly guide the discrete coding and deep feature learning process. In the proposed method, the last layer of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) outputs the binary code directly. In the loss function, discrete values are calculated by combining the pairwise loss and a balance controlling term. The learned binary hash code maintains the similar relationship and label consistency at the same time. While maintaining the pairwise similarity , the proposed method keeps the balance of hash codes to improve retrieval performance . Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods on four image retrieval benchmark datasets.},

In this paper, weighted sum complete synchronization and quasi-synchronization are both investigated by designing feedback controller and aperiodically intermittent controller, respectively. Meanwhile, a flexible control scheme is designed for the proposed model by utilizing some switching parameters and can improve anti-interference ability of control system. By applying Lyapunov method and some differential inequalities, some effective criteria are derived to ensure the synchronizations of memristive neural networks.

Environmental noise and short utterance pose two challenges for accurate speaker identification. In this paper, a network model with new feature extraction methods and a new bi-directional long short-term memory network is proposed to identify the speaker. Specifically, this paper proposes to combine the mel-spectrogram and cochleagram to generate two new features, named MC-spectrogram and MC-cube. They have stronger robustness and can obtain more abundant voiceprint feature in the short utterance. Then, multi-dimensional CNNs are applied to process MC-spectrogram and MC-cube features correspondingly. They contain multi-dimensional convolution kernels , which can learn the voiceprint features more efficiently. In addition, the context information is ignored by CNN. And the forward voiceprint features are more crucial because the voiceprint features concentrate on the back part in the short utterance. Asymmetric bi-directional long short-time memory network (ABLSTM) is proposed to further learn the voiceprint features in global feature learning. It can improve the accuracy of speaker identification. According to the diverse dimension of input, the proposed network model can manifest diverse patterns, which are named Audio-1DCNN-ABLSTM, MCS(MC-spectrogram)-2DCNN-ABLSTM and MCC(MC-cube)-3DCNN-ABLSTM. From the experimental results, it is shown that the diverse patterns can achieve superior accuracy and robustness in the short utterance with extra environmental noise.

Whereas, existing research on individual mobility prediction mainly focuses on next location prediction and short-term dependencies between traveling locations. Long-term location sequence prediction is of great importance for long-time traffic planning and location advertising, and long-term dependencies exist as individual mobility regularity typically occurs daily and weekly. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical temporal attention-based LSTM encoder-decoder model for individual location sequence prediction. The proposed hierarchical attention mechanism captures both long-term and short-term dependencies underlying in individual longitudinal trajectories, and uncovers frequential and periodical mobility patterns in an interpretable manner by incorporating the calendar cycle of individual travel regularities into location prediction. More specifically, the hierarchical attention consists of local temporal attention to identify highly related locations in each day, and global temporal attention to discern important travel regularities over a week. Experiments on individual trajectory datasets with varying degree of traveling uncertainty demonstrate that our method outperforms four baseline methods on three evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the interpretability of the proposed model in understanding individual daily, and weekly mobility patterns by visualizing the temporal attention weights and frequent traveling patterns associated with locations.},

To employ the proposed algorithm, an integrated multi-layer neural network (INN) is designed for the value function and the control variables. Only one single neural network requires adaption. This avoids the iterative learning of two separate networks in the heuristic dynamic programming-based methods. Simulation for linear and non-linear optimal control problems is studied. Comparing to the optimal solutions resulting from the linear quadratic regulator and dynamic programming (DP), the proposed INN design can lead to closer control performance than the ones with action dependent heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP). Furthermore INN is applied to optimize the energy management strategy of hybrid electric vehicles for fuel economy. The fuel consumption based on INN is lower than the one from ADHDP and much closer to the optimal results by DP. The result indicates the near fuel-optimality and an effective practical application.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the H ∞ filtering problem is addressed for a class of nonlinear stochastic discrete-time systems subject to Round-Robin protocol, measurement outliers, randomly occurring parameter uncertainties and randomly occurring nonlinearities. First of all, the considered system is influenced by the parameter uncertainties, nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances. Next, mutually independent Bernoulli-distributed white sequences are employed to describe the phenomena of randomly occurring parameter uncertainties and nonlinearities, respectively. Besides, the Round-Robin protocol is introduced to prevent the occurrence of data collisions during the signal transmission. Moreover, a filter with adaptive saturation is constructed to weaken the impact of the measurement outliers. Through constructing a suitable Lyapunov function , sufficient conditions are established to ensure that the error system dynamics is exponentially mean-square stable and satisfies the H ∞ performance. Subsequently, the filter gains are designed by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the filtering scheme proposed in this paper.},

In addition, it turns out that these tools can also be used to estimate the stability of networks regarding disturbances. Prototype based networks gain more and more attraction in current research because of their inherent interpretability and robust behavior . Popular prototype-based classifiers are support vector machines and the heuristically motivated Learning Vector Quantizer (LVQ). The Generalized Matrix LVQ (GMLVQ) is an extension of LVQ which can be interpreted as a special multilayer network containing a projection and a prototype layer. First in this paper, we extend the linear projection layer of GMLVQ to a non-linear mapping by employing different non-linear activations functions . Second, we compare the classification decision stabilities of the linear and the non-linear GMLVQ regarding DropConnect while taking the neural network perspective. Thus we can adopt DropConnect ideas known from multilayer perceptron learning to investigate stability and robustness of GMLVQ. To this end, the evaluation of the stability is done in terms of a information theoretic stability measure based on the Shannon-Entropy. We demonstrate the approach for three real world data sets from Raman spectroscopy , multi-spectral remote sensing and the well-known MNIST data set.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, aided by deep neural networks (DNNs), reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been achieving great success in more and more tasks. In general, model-free RL algorithms are widely applicable, but sometimes suffer from low sample efficiency. Although the environment dynamics can be incorporated into model-free RL algorithms to enhance sample efficiency, which can be transformed into the joint algorithm of model-free and model-based RL algorithms, the model bias of dynamics model may still hurt the performance. Another attractive study direction for RL algorithms, is using parallel strategy. Meanwhile, parallel RL algorithms can achieve outstanding results under less time cost, but are still with low sample efficiency, because most of such algorithms are vanilla model-free ones. Therefore, aiming to enhance the model performance for RL algorithms with DNNs, in this paper, we propose a novel parallel model-augmented framework, called PMA-DRL, to combine the dynamics model and parallel RL algorithms together. First, we introduce a local dynamics model (LDM) for each local agent model (LAM) in parallel RL algorithms. Next, we propose to build a better LDM by using an ensemble of LDMs, and such ensemble can help to reduce model bias, because the experienced observations under different LAMs are always diverse. Then, the observation diversity can be further increased by employing LDMs to explore. Finally, we implement experiments on classic control tasks (CCTs) and Atari games, which demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Deceptive games are games that utilize the reward structure to keep the agent away from the global optimization and have been grown up to become a huge challenge in the field of deep reinforcement learning intelligent exploration. Most of the cutting-edge exploration approaches, such as count-based and curiosity-driven, even with intrinsic motivation, which achieves better performance in the sparse reward game, still easily fall into local optimal traps in the deceptive game. To address this shortfall, we introduce a further exploration approach called Maximum Entropy Explore (MEE). Based on entropy rewards and the off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm, we divided the agent exploration policy into two independent parts, namely, the target policy and the explorer policy. The explorer policy, taking the maximum entropy of the target policy as the optimization goal, is used to interact with the environment and generated trajectories for the target policy. The target policy regards the maximization of external reward as the optimization goal to achieve the global solution. To alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem which leads to the training of the agent not stabilized during the off-policy exploration phrase, the optimal experience replay is applied. An on-policy mode switch trick is used to validly prevent the unstable and diverge which caused by the deadly triad. We conduct experiments comparing our approach with state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm and exploration methods in the grid world and StarCraft II environments with deceptive reward. The experiment indicates that the MME approach sets out to be in the present paper effectively avoids the deceptive reward trap and learns the global optimal strategy .},

Moreover, although researchers have borrowed transferring knowledge to alleviate the dependence on labeling, the bias among various domains remains an open problem. Accordingly, motivated by the observation that reducing the style and background differences between domains can promote the generalization capability of the learning model, this paper proposes an unsupervised model, namely, person component decomposition and synthesis generative adversarial network (PCDS-GAN), to minimize the distribution gap among multiple person re-ID datasets. More specifically, we first disentangle the pedestrian image into foreground, background and style features, then use these features to synthesize person images with various backgrounds from the target domain. Finally, the synthesized images are used to train person re-ID models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model can effectively reduce the domain gap, and also outperforms state-of-the art methods on the Market-1501 and CUHK03 benchmarks.},

Theoretically, if one neuron is built by memristors only, the technique process will be simpler and learning framework will be more like biological brain. In this paper, a fully memristive spiking-neuron learning framework is introduced, in which a neuron structure is just built of one drift and one diffusion memristive models and spikes are used as transmission signals. The learning framework and spiking coding mode are simple and direct without any complicated calculation on hardware. To verify its merits, a feedforward neural network for pattern recognition and a cellular neural network for edge detection are designed. Experimental results show that compared to other memristive neural networks, processing speed of the proposed framework is very high, and the hardware resource is saved in pattern recognition. Further, due to the dynamic filtering function of diffusion memristor model in our learning framework, its peak signal noise ratio (PSNR) is much higher than traditional algorithms in edge detection.},

In this paper, we argue that it is more reasonable to utilize the high-level manifold consensus rather than the low-level coefficient matrix consensus (as conducted in state-of-the-art approaches) to better capture the underlying clustering structure of the data. For this purpose, we propose MMRSC (Multiple Manifold Regularized Sparse Coding), which aims to preserve the consensus over multiple manifold structures from different views. Experimental results on two publicly available real-world image datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches for the multi-view image clustering task .

  abstract     = {Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a widely used algorithm due to its fast speed and good generalization. But ELM performs well under the assumption that the data is balanced. Because in binary classification with high imbalanced ratio data, the accuracy of samples from the minority class tends to be ignored easily due to the disadvantage in quantity. Therefore, weighted ELM (W-ELM) was proposed for imbalance learning. When samples are transformed through the hidden layer of W-ELM, W-ELM needs to calculate suitable weights to classify the samples linearly. But it is difficult for W-ELM to achieve a good learning performance when the dispersion of the transformed samples is high enough. Besides, W-ELM is limited by its two weighting schemes. Many W-ELM-based methods, such as boosting W-ELM, deep W-ELM and ensemble W-ELM, were also proposed with the limitations of W-ELM. Class-specific cost regulation ELM (CCR-ELM) is an alternative approach to learn imbalanced data . However, to a certain degree, CCR-ELM is similar to ELM. Therefore, in this paper, we will propose variances-constrained weighted extreme learning machine (VW-ELM) to replace W-ELM. VW-WLM takes the dispersion of training results into consideration. From theoretical view, VW-ELM’s learning performance is no lower than W-ELM. We use 21 benchmark datasets to test the learning ability of VW-ELM. Experimental results demonstrate that VW-ELM has an obvious advantage to handle classification problem of imbalanced data, comparing with the state-of-the-arts.},

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel hierarchical neural network model based on dynamic word embeddings ( HieNN-DWE ) for document level sentiment classification. Specifically, the dynamic word embeddings are produced by ELMo (Embedding from Language Models), which can deeply exploit the semantic information for polysemous words. The embeddings are then fed into HieNN-DWE which is a two-layer hierarchical neural network model. Note that the first layer utilizes bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) as well as attention mechanism to encode sentences. The second layer uses both BiGRU and convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture global and local features from sentence representations. Thus, the final document representations are constructed by concatenating the outputs from BiGRU and CNN. Moreover, experimental results have shown that HieNN-DWE outperforms existing competitive methods on four public datasets for document level sentiment classification.},

  abstract     = {Image decomposition and sparse representation (SR) based methods have achieved enormous successes in multi-source image fusion. However, there exists the performance degradation caused by the following two aspects: (i) limitation of image descriptions for decomposition based methods; (ii) limited ability in detail preservation resulted by divided overlap patches for SR based methods. In order to address such deficiencies, a novel method based on Taylor expansion and convolutional sparse representation (TE-CSR) is proposed for image fusion. Firstly, the Taylor expansion theory, to the best of our knowledge, is for the first time introduced to decompose each source image into many intrinsic components including one deviation component and several energy components. Secondly, the convolutional sparse representation with gradient penalties (CSRGP) model is built to fuse these deviation components, and the average rule is employed for combining the energy components. Finally, we utilize the inverse Taylor expansion to reconstruct the fused image. This proposed method is to suppress the gap of image descriptions in existing decomposition based algorithms. In addition, the new method can improve the limited ability to preserve details caused by the sparse patch coding with SR based approaches. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the TE-CSR method.},

  abstract     = {The goal of salient region detection is to identify the regions of an image that attract the most attention. Many methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance levels on this task. Recently, salient instance segmentation has become an even more challenging task than traditional salient region detection; however, few of the existing methods have concentrated on this underexplored problem. Unlike the existing methods, which usually employ object proposals to roughly count and locate object instances, our method applies salient objects subitizing to predict an accurate number of instances for salient instance segmentation . In this paper, we propose a multitask densely connected neural network (MDNN) to segment salient instances in an image. In contrast to existing approaches, our framework is proposal-free and category-independent. The MDNN contains two parallel branches: the first is a densely connected subitizing network (DSN) used for subitizing prediction; the second is a densely connected fully convolutional network (DFCN) used for salient region detection. The MDNN generates both saliency maps and salient object subitizing. Then, an adaptive deep feature-based spectral clustering operation segments the salient regions into instances based on the subitizing and saliency maps. The experimental results on salient instance segmentation datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our framework. Its AP reaches 57.32\%, which surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by about 5\%.},

Second, a reinforcement learning method, Q -learning, is adopted to adaptively adjust the servo gain in order to improve the convergence speed and stability. Compared with other methods, ELM has better generalization performance , faster operation speed and a unique optimal solution.

Nevertheless, there exists a semantic-spatial gap between low-level and high-level features in some methods, i.e., high-level features represent more semantics and less spatial details , while low-level ones have less semantics and more spatial details . In this paper, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Fusion Network (SSFNet) for human parsing to shrink the gap, which generates the accurate high-resolution prediction by aggregating multi-resolution features. SSFNet includes two models, a semantic modulation model and a resolution-aware model. The semantic modulation model guides spatial details with semantics and then effectively facilitates the feature fusion , narrowing the gap. The resolution-aware model sufficiently boosts the feature fusion and obtains multi-receptive-fields, which generates reliable and fine-grained high-resolution features for each branch, in bottom-up and top-down processes. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, PASCAL-Person-Part, LIP and PPSS, show that SSFNet achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.},

It is because current intra-relationship methods are trying to learn all the intra-relationships, regardless of their importance. In this paper, a novel self-attention based VQA module named Selective Residual learning (SelRes) is proposed. SelRes processes the residual learning selectively in self-attention networks. It measures the importance of the input vectors by the attention map and limits residual learning, except in the selected regions which related to the correct answer. Selective masking is also proposed, which can ensure that the selection in SelRes is preserved in the multi-stack structure of the VQA network.

Since the development of Deep Learning , especially after the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC-GAN) methods, facial image synthesis and SR problem had been solved in many circumstances. But most of the existing works were focused on natural-looking of the synthesized result rather than keeping facial information of the original image. Our paper presented an end-to-end method of getting high-resolution photo-realistic facial images from low-resolution (LR) in-the-wild images without losing the facial identity details. The pipeline used a flexible stacked GAN structure for the SR process with different target image resolutions on different upscaling factors. To avoid getting blur or nonsensical image output and realize the flexibility, “U-Net” architecture and upsampling layers with residual learning blocks were stacked. The stacked network structure makes applying different loss functions in different parts of the network possible, which helps to solve the two problems of keeping identical facial details of the LR input image and generating high-quality output images simultaneously. By using 3 different loss functions in different positions of the stacked network separately, through experimental comparison, we found the best stacked residual block parameters which could get the best output image quality. Experimental results also explicated that the network had a good SR ability compare to state of the art methods in different resolution and upscaling factor.},

In order to reduce the decision delay and to improve the robustness for the UAV, a two-stage end-to-end obstacle avoidance architecture is designed, where a forward-facing monocular camera is used only. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model is adopted as the prediction mechanism. Utilizing three effective operations, namely depthwise convolution, group convolution and channel split, the model predicts the steering angle and the collision probability simultaneously. In the second stage, the control mechanism maps the steering angle to an instruction that changes the yaw angle of the UAV. Consequently, when the UAV encounters an obstacle, it can avoid collision by steering automatically. Meanwhile, the collision probability is mapped as a forward speed to maintain the flight or stop going forward. The presented automatic obstacle avoidance scheme of quadrotor UAV is verified by several indoor/outdoor tests, where the feasibility and efficacy have been demonstrated clearly. The novelties of the method lie in its low sensor requirement, light-weight network structure, strong learning ability and environmental adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Identification of rigid-body objects from point clouds is a well-studied topic and one of the most important utilities of 3D computer vision in robotics, industrial automation, unmanned systems and autonomous vehicle applications. However, simultaneous retrieval of both identity and pose of objects is still an open problem because of the challenges attributed to the vast search space of all possible poses of an object. Further, the precision of pose retrieval is inherently hard to improve because the resolution of the pose database is limited. This paper presents a point cloud retrieval method that finds the object ID and pose, simultaneously. Unlike the traditional learning-based methods that retrieve the point cloud by matching high dimensional feature vectors, we solve the point cloud retrieval problem using an end-to-end point cloud convolution neural network (CNN) model that linearly projects the 3D point cloud onto a unique discriminating 2D view using an energy-based loss function. Based on the proposed mechanism of the projection network , the rigid-body pose is obtained using the reduced QR factorization. As a result, the object ID retrieval problem is simplified because the within-class differences caused by various poses of the object are removed. The projection results exhibit strong discriminating features based on shapes while the precision of pose retrieval is improved thanks to the generalization ability of the network model. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method yields considerably more robust and accurate object ID retrieval, and at the same time significantly improves the precision of pose retrieval compared to the descriptor-based methods as well as two commonly used learning-based methods.},

Reward Shaping and Curriculum Learning algorithms are always used to solve this challenge, but Reward Shaping is prone to sub-optimal policies and Curriculum Learning easily suffers from the catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Parallel Multi-Environment Shaping (PMES), where several sub-environments are built based on human knowledge to make the agent aware of the importance of intermediate steps, each of which corresponds to a key intermediate step. Specifically, the learning agent is trained under these parallel multiple environments including the original environment and several sub-environments by synchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm. And the PMES algorithm has the mechanism of adaptive reward shaping to adjust the reward function. In this way, PMES algorithm effectively incorporates human experience by multiple different environments rather than only shaping the reward function, which combines the benefits of Reward Shaping and Curriculum Learning algorithms while avoiding their drawbacks. Extensive experiments on the mini-game ‘Build Marines’ of StarCraft II environment show that our proposed algorithm is more effective than Reward Shaping, Curriculum Learning, and PLAID algorithms, which is almost close to the level of human Grandmaster.

First, a novel observer-based consensus algorithm is designed to solve the semi-global output consensus problem. It is worth noting that the consensus is semi-global since the set of initial states is bounded. Then, the low gain feedback technique is utilized based on the solution of a parametric algebraic Riccati equation . Moreover, sufficient conditions of output consensus for heterogeneous fractional-order multi-agent systems are derived by using algebraic graph theory, matrix theory and the stability theory of fractional-order systems. It can be proven that the output signals of followers can reach synchronization with the leader’s. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our conclusions.},

Furthermore, we probe its working mechanism in three ways: (i) we prove that the decoding weights and the raw samples are of linear relationship under the transformation of a certain invertible function; (ii) the proposed method can sample from a larger range in both feature dimensions and label dimension, which can be interpreted as a broader distribution vicinity compared with those by other approaches; (iii) the model trained with our data augmentation approach has better representation capability, which is reflected by the higher Fisher’s criteria value in deep feature space. We conduct extensive experiments on image and tabular dataset with multiple network architectures . The proposed method provides significant generalization performance improvement compared with the baseline and better or comparable performance compared with the other state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches.},

  abstract     = {The tuning of proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers has been extensively used in the industry, this adjustment is performed by means of conventional methods, such as the Ziegler–Nichols and trial-and-error that often fails to address inherent complexity of industrial processes. To overcome these problems of PID tuning, a neurocomputing adaptive novel methodology is presented in this paper. The proposed methodology is based on a structured artificial neural network (S-ANN) and a propagation matrix of PID actions that was developed to support the tuning. The problem formulation and S-ANN-based solution are tightly connected, i.e., the nodes and layers of S-ANN topology are ruled by the order of the propagation matrix. For given operational conditions of the plant and disturbance in its parameters, the performance of the trained network is evaluated for tasks within the scope of learning on a bulk resumption process in ore mining system, focusing the control system output accuracy and convergence of the S-ANN algorithm.},

Similarly, the metadata information related to the products, about the reviews and about the users who have written the reviews has rarely been exploited for recommender systems . These heterogeneous information sources have the potential to alleviate the cold start and sparsity problems and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a joint deep recommendation model (JDRM) that consists of two parallel neural networks , learning lower-order feature interactions of users and items separately and higher-order feature interactions jointly using a shared last layer. Each of the networks is further composed of two sub-networks. One of the sub-networks focus on exploiting product reviews (of user/item) and the other sub-network learns user preferences/items properties leveraging metadata information along with the ratings. The learned latent features in each network are concatenated, thus producing the user and item latent feature vectors. We combine the two networks by introducing a shared layer on the top, which is a dense fully connected layer used to learn higher level latent features obtained from the two networks and produces final ratings. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that JDRM significantly outperforms state of the art recommendation models.},

Hence the classification techniques such as the convolution neural network are not applicable to point cloud analysis directly. To solve this problem, we propose a novel network to extract point clouds feature, named attention-based graph convolutional network (AGCN). Taking the learning process as a message propagation between adjacent points, we specifically introduce attention mechanism to construct a point attention layer for analyzing the relationship between local points feature. The object classification is implemented by stacking multiple layers of point attention layer. In addition, the proposed network is extended to an attention-based encoder-decoder structure for segmentation tasks . We also introduce an additional global graph structure network to compensate for the relative location information of the individual points in the graph structure network. Experimental results show that our network has lower computational complexity and faster convergence speed.

To overcome the first problem, we use a 3D atrous-convolution with a single stride to replace pooling/striding and build the backbone for feature learning . For the second problem, a 3D atrous-convolution feature pyramid is designed and added to the end of the backbone. By integrating with contextual features, this structure improves the discriminating ability of the overall model to segment tumors with various sizes. Finally, a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field is constructed as a post-processing step for the network’s output to obtain structural segmentation of both the appearance and spatial consistency. Abundant ablation experiments carried on Magnetic Resonance Imaging datasets demonstrate that lossless feature computation and multi-scale information fusion driven by our method are feasible to address the above problems.

In this paper, we present an image inpainting method based on GANs with reconstructive sampling and multi-granularity generative adversarial strategy . The key idea is to solve unstable training and vanishing gradient by proposed reconstructive sampling, in which we sample from reconstructive distribution than low-dimension noise. It has been proved that reconstructive sampling is effective to avoid unstable training and gradient vanish. Then, multi-granularity generative adversarial strategy , which is decomposed into two steps, is adopted to make inpainted image more continuous and realistic in texture structure and vision, respectively.

Our method aims to minimize distances between similar examples, while maximizing distances between those that are dissimilar under a stochastic selection rule. Additionally, we propose a simple sampling strategy, which focuses on maintaining locally the similarity relationships of examples in their neighborhoods. This technique aims to reduce the local overlap between different classes in different parts of the embedded space.

  abstract     = {In the BCI rehabilitation system, the decoding of motor imagery tasks (MI-tasks) with dipoles in the source domain has gradually become a new research focus. For complex multiclass MI-tasks, the number of activated dipoles is large, and the activation area, activation time and intensity are also different for different subjects. The means by which to identify fewer subject-based dipoles is very important. There exist two main methods of dipole selection: one method is based on the physiological functional partition theory, and the other method is based on human experience. However, the number of dipoles that are selected by the two methods is still large and contains information redundancy, and the selected dipoles are the same in both number and position for different subjects, which is not necessarily ideal for distinguishing different MI-tasks. In this paper, the data-driven method is used to preliminarily select fully activated dipoles with large amplitudes; the obtained dipoles are refined by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to best reflect the differences among the multiclass MI-tasks, thereby yielding a subject-based dipole selection method, which is named PRDS. PRDS is further used to decode multiclass MI-tasks in which some representative dipoles are found, and their wavelet coefficient power is calculated and input to one-vs.-one common spatial pattern (OVO-CSP) for feature extraction, and the features are classified by the support vector machine. We denote this decoding method as D-CWTCSP, which enhances the spatial resolution and also makes full use of the time-frequency-spatial domain information. Experiments are carried out using a public dataset with nine subjects and four classes of MI-tasks, and the proposed D-CWTCSP is compared with the relevant methods in sensor space and brain-source space in terms of the decoding accuracy, standard deviation, recall rate and kappa value. The experimental results show that D-CWTCSP reaches an average decoding accuracy of 82.66\% among the nine subjects, which generates 8–20\% improvement over other methods, thus reflecting its great superiority in decoding accuracy.},

Low price, high price and close price constitute the inputs, but the importance of these three features is quite different. Traditional methods and the classical CNN can’t deal with these three features separately, but in our method, a designed depth convolution is proposed to deal with these three features separately. In a virtual currency market, the price rise only occurs in a flash. Traditional methods and CNN networks can’t accurately judge the critical time. In order to solve this problem, a three-dimensional attention gating network is proposed and it gives higher weights on rising moments and assets. Under different market conditions, the proposed system achieves more substantial returns and greatly improves the Sharpe ratios. The short-term risk index of the proposed system is lower than those of the traditional algorithms.

Usually, networks trained by life-cycle labeled dataset would possess similar RUL predicting accuracies, because the network training algorithm could ensure the network optimality for the whole training dataset. However, for networks trained by non-life-cycle labeled samples, the network uncertainty caused by different training conditions could lead to degradation prediction uncertainty for some local points. Further, the RUL predicting results that are computed by these uncertain local points may shows relatively large differences. Therefore, in order to obtain an accurate RUL prediction with networks trained by non-life-cycle labeled samples, our paper proposes a novel network model averaging method to deal with the network uncertainty. What is more, to learn the temporal correlation information of training samples sufficiently, we adopt the Bi-LSTM network to illustrate the application of the proposed network model averaging method.

  abstract     = {Effective person re-identification (Re-ID) is often required in real applications. While most exiting approaches either assume the detected pedestrian bounding box well-aligned or utilize limited human structural information (pose, attention, segmentation) to calibrate the misalignment. However, the value of utilizing attributes for pedestrian alignment is still under explored. Furthermore, the hierarchy of attributes in previous works has been largely ignored, appearance feature and attribute feature are often fused in a rigid way. This directly limits the discriminatory and robustness of feature representation. In this paper, we propose a Refined Attribute-aligned Network (RAN), which consists of a coarse-alignment and a fine-alignment module. First, the pre-trained part and attribute predictor are used to generate body parts and candidate attributes. Then the body parts are used for coarse alignment and the attributes are selected by an agent. The agent is optimized with policy gradient algorithm, which can maximize the accumulative reward to increase the probability of proper attribute selection. Finally, for the fine-alignment, the attribute maps and body part features are aggregated by a bilinear-pooling layer to support accurate Re-ID. Extensive experimental results based on multiple datasets including CUHK03, DukeMTMC and Market-1501 demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Abnormal electricity consumption (AEC) caused huge economic losses to power supply enterprises in the past years, and also posed severe threats to the safety of peoples’ daily live. An accurate AEC detection is crucial to reducing the non-technical losses (NTLs) suffered by power supply enterprises and the State Grid. Comparing with the huge amount of electricity data flow, AEC data are relative few, that makes the AEC detection a typical imbalanced learning problem. To address this issue, two effective AEC detection algorithms from the perspective of data balancing and data weighting, respectively, are studied in this paper: (i) the K-means clustering and synthetic minority oversampling (K-means SMOTE) technique combining with the artificial neural network (ANN) trained by kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), and (ii) the deep weighted ELM (DWELM), that builds on an improved multiclass AdaBoost imbalanced learning algorithm (AdaBoost-ID) and an enhanced deep representation network based ELM (EH-DrELM). Experiments on the electricity consumption data of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Corporation are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Comparisons to many state-of-the-art methods are provided for the superiority demonstration.},

  abstract     = {Gait has emerged as an important biometric feature which is capable of identifying individuals at distance without requiring any interaction with the system. Various factors such as clothing, shoes, and walking surface can affect the performance of gait recognition . However, cross-view gait recognition is particularly challenging as the appearance of individual’s walk drastically changes with the change in the viewpoint. In this paper, we present a novel view-invariant gait representation for cross-view gait recognition using the spatiotemporal motion characteristics of human walk. The proposed technique trains a deep fully connected neural network to transform the gait descriptors from multiple viewpoints to a single canonical view. It learns a single model for all the videos captured from different viewpoints and finds a shared high-level virtual path to project them on a single canonical view. The proposed deep neural network is learned only once using the spatiotemporal gait representation and applied to testing gait sequences to construct their view-invariant gait descriptors which are used for cross-view gait recognition. The experimental evaluation is carried out on two large benchmark cross-view gait datasets, CASIA-B and OU-ISIR large population, and the results are compared with current state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in cross-view gait recognition.},

  abstract     = {Hashing methods have been widely applied to approximate nearest neighbor search in large-scale image retrieval due to its fast search speed and efficient storage space. In practice, most images are with multiple category-aware objects, i.e., multi-label images. This paper focuses on hash code learning for multi-label image retrieval . Most existing hashing methods directly extract one patch such as a downsized crop from each image as a training example, which ignores the multi-label characteristic of images and leads to suboptimal representations for multi-label images. Some researches have proved that each multi-label image follows a multi-instance assumption, where each image is represented as a bag of category-aware proposals (instances). However, existing multiple-instance learning methods use predefined statistical functions with limited learning capability to construct bag features, and they are designed for classification or pairwise-similarity preserving. Thus, directly applying existing multiple-instance learning methods into deep hashing framework still leads to suboptimal hash codes for retrieval. In this paper, we pose hashing learning for multi-label image retrieval as a problem of multiple-instance ranking learning. To solve this problem, we present an end-to-end deep hashing framework, referred to as Deep Multiple-Instance Ranking based Hashing (DMIRH). In DMIRH, we design a category-aware bag feature construction module, which jointly assigns the learned instances into categories and aggregates the selected instance features into a bag feature representation that can capture the multi-label information of each image. In addition, we propose a novel learning objective, which consists of an Inner Product distance based quantization loss to control the hash quality and a listwise ranking loss to preserve the ranking relationships. Experimental results on public benchmarks show the superiority of DMIRH over several state-of-the-art hashing methods.},

Previous researches on answer selection usually conduct it by isolated word-level interaction between questions and answers. In these methods, the abundant contextual information is hardly captured, which affects the choice of the correct answer. To overcome this problem, we propose to exploit a Multiple Fragment-level Interactive Network (MFIN) for this task. The MFIN can extend the search space from word-level to fragment-level, which is conducive to obtaining more contextual information. In MFIN, we apply the multiple fragment-level attention mechanism to select key fragment pairs and achieve multiple fragment-level interaction. Meanwhile, we utilize the recurrent representation encoding to integrate multiple interactive information to reduce noise. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is efficient compared to the existing methods on the WikiQA and SemEval-2016 CQA datasets.},

In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical self-diffusion saliency (HSDS) method for detecting vehicle targets in large scale SAR images. To reduce the influence of cluttered returns on saliency analysis, we learn a weight vector from the training set to capture optimal initial saliency of the superpixels during saliency diffusion. By accounting for the multiple sizes of background objects, the saliency analysis is implemented in multi-scale space, and a saliency fusion strategy employed to integrate the multi-scale saliency maps. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can produce a more accurate and stable detection performance, with decreased false alarms, compared to benchmark approaches.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-path adaptive modulation network (MAMNet). Specifically, we propose a multi-path adaptive modulation block (MAMB), which is a lightweight yet effective residual block that adaptively modulates residual feature responses by fully exploiting their information via three paths. The three paths model three types of information suitable for SR: 1) channel-specific information (CSI) using global variance pooling, 2) inter-channel dependencies (ICD) based on the CSI, 3) and channel-specific spatial dependencies (CSD) via depth-wise convolution. We demonstrate that the proposed MAMB is effective and parameter-efficient for image SR than other feature modulation methods . In addition, experimental results show that our MAMNet outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods with a relatively small number of parameters.},

The proposed network consists of a feature extraction block, N channel-fusion enhancement blocks (CFEBs) and an upscale block. In order to reduce model parameters and computation complexity, each CFEB adopts group convolution operation and channel-fusion strategy to fuse image information from different channels.

  abstract     = {Traditional fingerprint recognition systems are vulnerable to attacks, such as the use of artificial fingerprints, and poor performance will be achieved if the captured surface fingerprints are of low-quality. Developing high-security and robust fingerprint recognition systems is of increasing concern in modern society. The introduction of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for fingerprint imaging opens up a new research domain for fingerprint recognition due to its ability to capture the depth information of skin layers. This paper proposes a fingerprint recognition system based on OCT. The research first establishes a database with normal, worn-out, artificial and degraded fingerprints imaged by our custom-built, in-house OCT device. Then, we propose to reconstruct three layers of subsurface fingerprints by considering diverse skin layer information. For each of the subsurface fingerprints divided according to the physical structure of the fingertip, we propose a simple yet effective projection-based reconstruction method. Finally, a pixel-level fusion strategy based on the local image quality is proposed to the fuse the three levels of subsurface fingerprints for robust fingerprint recognition. In our experiments, we show that as much diverse fingerprint information can be retained as possible by the proposed subsurface fingerprint reconstruction method. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it with existing state-of-the-art internal fingerprint reconstruction approaches. The robustness and high anti-spoofing ability of the proposed system is verified by comparing the matching performance evaluated on the established OCT-based database and another database with the same fingerprints imaged by a commercial optical sensor. The best EER and FMR100 evaluated on OCT-based fingerprints are 0.42\% and 0.36\%, respectively. The best EER and FMR100 evaluated on traditional 2D surface fingerprints are 8.05\% and 18.18\%, respectively, which shows the vast potential of the proposed system in current automated fingerprint recognition systems (AFRSs).},

  abstract     = {Visual object tracking is a challenging and fundamental research topic in the field of computer vision. Recent years, many subspace-learning based methods have been proposed for visual object tracking with promising results. These methods reconstruct candidate states by a set of basis vectors and select the best state with minimum reconstruction error. It is well known that the accuracy of reconstructed results is seriously affected by partial occlusion. Besides, updating with occlusions is likely to mislead the tracker to drift away. Existing methods either do not consider these situations or find occlusion regions only by current observation and reconstruction. In fact, occlusion regions usually come from the background regions in previous frames, which are neglected in existing methods. Under this assumption, a novel object tracking algorithm called Partial Occlusion by Background Alignment (POBA) is proposed, which aims to find the best candidate state with an accurate occlusion mask. The POBA tracker treats current observation as a combination of object appearance and occlusion regions. The object appearance is modelled by basis vectors through incremental PCA over grayscale images. Then the occlusion region is reconstructed from last frame under the assumption that the backgrounds between two consecutive frames are almost identical. Besides, most candidate states are different from the object obviously, which can be filtered by some predefined occlusion masks so that computational complexity can be further reduced. Finally, the POBA tracker was analyzed on 8 challenge sequences and evaluated on two challenging datasets including OTB2015 and Temple Color. It gets an AUC of 0.456, a success rate score of 0.538 and a precision score of 0.626 in OPE on OTB2015 dataset. All indicators are increased by more than 23\% compared with the 6 classical trackers.},

Detecting the type of social relationships is fundamental to improve performance on many applications in social networks. Existing studies mainly focus on predicting social relationships in the same network based on its own abundant information. However, there are few works on predicting social relationships across different networks. In this paper, we study a tri-training model to predict the labels of social relationships across different networks based on BP neural networks . Firstly, we aim to obtain the hidden common characteristics between two different networks. Depending on these hidden common characteristics, unlabeled target samples are assigned pseudo labels by training two BP neural networks. Then we capture the special features for the target network by analyzing the structural characters. Finally, combining with the special and common features, we optimize the third BP neural network by training the pseudo labeled target samples. After training, we can use the third optimized BP neural network to predict the types of social relationships in the target network. We evaluate the model and compare it with some existing methods on six real online social networks. The experimental results indicate that our model can effectively exploit the unlabeled target sample and outperform the existing methods on multiple metrics, and also show that the special features in the target network can help to enhance the learning performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we first established the fractional order memristive multidirectional associative memory neural networks (FMMAMNNs) model, and then considered its fixed-time synchronization control problem. On the basis of sliding model control and Lyapunov stability theorem, a fractional order sliding mode controller is constructed. By adding this controller to the response system, the error of the driver-response systems gradually converges to 0 in a fixed time. Compared with the previous researches, this paper considers a more complex model, and the proposed control theories can ensure that the setting time is only related to the model and controller, but not to the initial states of the system. Besides, the control theories are also applicable to the integer order models. Finally, two numerical simulations are given, the results show the validity of the theories.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the H ∞ control problem is investigated for a time-delayed two-dimensional (2-D) network under the random access protocol (RAP). The control input is transmitted to the actuator via a network with communication constraint, where only one signal obtains the network access at each transmission instant, and the RAP is adopted here to schedule the data transmission which is depicted by an independent and identically distributed sequence. The randomly occurring uncertainty, nonlinearity and unknown time delays are all introduced in the underlying 2-D system. The aim of the addressed problem is to design an observer-based controller so that the considered 2-D system has a predefined H ∞ performance index. Sufficient condition is given to ensure the H ∞ performance of the closed-loop system via the Lyapunov theory and stochastic analysis . Moreover, the observer-based controller is dexterously designed to ensure the achievement of the H ∞ performance, under which the controller gains are designed by solving certain matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Image attribute editing is a challenging problem that has been recently studied by many researchers using generative networks. The challenge is in the manipulation of selected attributes of images while preserving the other details. The method to achieve this goal is to find an accurate latent vector representation of an image and a direction corresponding to the attribute. Almost all the works in the literature use labeled datasets in a supervised setting for this purpose. In this study, we introduce an architecture called Cyclic Reverse Generator (CRG), which allows learning the inverse function of the generator accurately via an encoder in an unsupervised setting by utilizing cyclic cost minimization. Attribute editing is then performed using the CRG models for finding desired attribute representations in the latent space. In this work, we use two arbitrary reference images, with and without desired attributes, to compute an attribute direction for editing. We show that the proposed approach performs better in terms of image reconstruction compared to the existing end-to-end generative models both quantitatively and qualitatively. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on both real images and generated images in CelebA dataset.},

A well-known drawback concerning the (original) MLM model formulation is the lack of sparseness.The most recent efforts on this problem strongly rely on the selection of reference points before training and prediction steps in MLM, all based on some supposition regarding the data. In the opposite direction, here, we explore another formulation of MLM in which we do not rely on any assumption regarding the data for prior selection. Instead, our proposal, named Lightweight Minimal Learning Machine (LW-MLM), builds a regularized system that imposes sparseness. We thrive in such a sparse criterion, not by selection but instead using a piece of weighted information into the model. We validate the contributions of this paper through four types of experiments to evaluate different aspects of our proposal: the prediction error performance, the goodness-of-fit of estimated vs. measured values, the norm values which are related to the sparsity , and finally, the prediction error in high dimensional settings. Based on the results, we show that LW-MLM is a valid alternative since achieved similar or higher accuracy rates against other variants being all seen as statistically equivalent.},

Previous works treat all feature channels and training samples equally during training. This ignores channel interdependencies and foreground–background data imbalance, thus limiting the tracking performance. To tackle these problems, we introduce channel attention and focal loss into the network design to enhance feature representation learning . Specifically, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block is coupled to each convolutional layer to generate channel attention. Channel attention reflects the channel-wise importance of each feature channel and is used for feature weighting in online tracking. To alleviate the foreground–background data imbalance, we propose a focal logistic loss by adding a modulating factor to the logistic loss, with two tunable focusing parameters. The focal logistic loss down-weights the loss assigned to easy examples in the background area. Both the SE block and focal logistic loss are computationally lightweight and impose only a slight increase in model complexity. Extensive experiments are performed on three challenging tracking datasets including OTB100, UAV123 and TC128. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced tracker achieves significant performance improvement while running at a real-time frame-rate of 66 fps.},

Secondly, a closed-loop system with a Wiener filter-based decoder, an auxiliary controller based on model predictive control (MPC) and a network of Izhikevich neurons is formulated based on the improved model, and the used network of Izhikevich neurons is more time efficient than the existing one. Finally, in this closed-loop system, the intracortical micro-stimulation (ICMS) technology is introduced to feedback the information from the MPC controller in real time.

  abstract     = {The electromyogram (EMG) signals from an individual’s muscles can reflect the biomechanics of human movement. The accurate classification of individual and combined finger movements using surface EMG signals is able to support many applications such as dexterous prosthetic hand control. The existing research of EMG-based hand gesture classification faces the challenges of inaccurate classification, insufficient generalization ability and weak robustness. To address these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning model that combines convolutional auto-encoder and convolutional neural network (CAE+CNN) to classify an EMG dataset consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures. The proposed method shrinks the inputs into a smaller latent space representation using CAE and the resultant compressed features are served as inputs of CNN, which reduces the redundancy of EMG signals and improves the classification accuracy and training efficiency. Besides, to enhance the robustness and generalization ability for classification, a data processing approach is proposed which combines the windowing method and majority voting of the obtained results from the classifier. In addition, comprehensive comparative study is carried out with 8 widely applied and state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of classification accuracy , robustness subject to noise and statistical analysis (sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 Score and Matthews correlation coefficient). The results demonstrates that the integration of windowing method, CAE+CNN and majority voting achieves the best performance (99.38\% test accuracy for the data without adding noise, which is 3.78\% higher than the best classifier used for comparison), strongest robustness (achieved 98.13\% test accuracy when Gaussian noise of level 1e-5 is added to the raw dataset, which is 4.07\% higher than the best classifier used for comparison) and statistical properties compared to other classifiers, which shows the potential for healthcare applications such as movement intention detection and dexterous prostheses control.},

Many graph learning methods focus on optimizing a global constraint on sparsity , low-rankness or weighted pair-wise distances, but they often fail to consider local connectivities. We demonstrate the importance of locality by generalizing the Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) for unsupervised learning . Each data sample is expressed as a representation of its nearest neighbors, which naturally leads to a combination of distance regularized features and a Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) decomposition. The representation enforces a locally sparse connection on the data graph that exhibits high discrimination power and is easy to optimize. To improve the learned graph structure and incorporate cluster information, a rank constraint is further imposed on the Laplacian matrix of the data graph so that the connected components match the class number. The obtained representations are smoothed via manifold regularizations on a predefined graph which serves as a prior for graph learning. Finally, we utilize unsupervised Extreme Learning Machine (US-ELM) to learn a flexible and discriminative data embedding. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms graph learning counterpart methods on a wide range of benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Deep-learning based image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms usually use the transfer learning method that transfers a pre-trained network for classification task to handle IQA task. Although it can overcome the problem of having insufficient IQA databases to some extent, it cannot distinguish between the important and unimportant deep features for the IQA task, which potentially leads to inaccurate prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a no-reference IQA method based on modelling of deep feature importance. A SE-VGG network is developed by using adaptive transfer learning method.

Moreover, the structure of the SE-VGG is investigated to improve the accuracy of the image quality assessment on a small IQA database.

In fact, speech impairment is one of the earliest Parkinson’s disease symptoms, and may be used for early diagnosis. We present an experimental study of identification of Parkinson’s disease and assessment of disease progress from speech using Gaussian processes , which is further combined with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) for efficient feature selection. Hyperparameters of ARD covariance functions are learned for each individual feature; therefore, can be used for evaluation of their importance. In that way only a small subset of highly relevant acoustic features is selected, leading to models with better performance and lower complexity. The performance of the proposed method was assessed on two datasets: Parkinson’s disease detection dataset, which contains a range of biomedical voice measurements obtained from 31 subjects, 23 of them suffering from Parkinson’s disease and 8 healthy subjects; and Parkinson’s telemonitoring dataset, containing biomedical voice measurements collected from 42 Parkinson’s disease patients for estimation of the disease progress. Gaussian process classification with automatic relevance determination is able to successfully discriminate between Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy controls with 96.92\% accuracy, outperforming Support Vector Machines and decision tree ensembles (random forests, boosted and bagged decision trees). The usability of Gaussian processes is further confirmed in regression task for tracking the progress of the disease.},

  abstract     = {Recently, Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR) systems are seriously threatened by adversarial audio examples. The defense against adversarial audio examples has become an urgent issue. Different from adversarial image examples whose target is limited in the finite categories, the target of adversarial audio examples can be any combination of the words in a language. Adversarial audio examples aim to change the semantic of the audio. The semantic is explicitly represented in transcription distance, which affects the adversarial perturbation. This paper analyzes the relationship between semantic difference and adversarial perturbation. Quantization and local smoothing are calibrated to evaluate their performance. We observe that, for adversarial audio examples with different transcription distance levels, the capability of different denoising strategies varies. Therefore, we first introduce the wavelet filter, which denoises the signal in the transformed domain. Then we explore the defense capability of combined filters. Finally, a new intelligent noise reduction method–INOR is proposed to improve the denoising performance of audios under different levels of transcription distance. Experimental results show that INOR is effective in mitigating the adversarial perturbations for adversarial examples with different transcription distance levels. The average CER and WER is reduced by 33\% and 55\%.},

  abstract     = {Kernel trick is widely applied to Support Vector Machine (SVM) to deal with linearly inseparable data which is known as kernel SVM. However, kernel SVM always has high computational cost in practice which makes it unsuitable to handle large scale data. Moreover, kernel SVM always brings hyper-parameters, e.g. bandwidth in Gaussian kernel . Since the hyper-parameters have a significant influence on the final performance of kernel SVM and are pretty hard to tune especially for large scale data, one may need to put lots of effort into finding good enough parameters, and improper settings of the hyper-parameters often make the classification performance even lower than that of linear SVM. Inspired by recent progresses on linear SVM for dealing with large scale data, we propose a well-designed classifier to efficiently handle large scale linearly inseparable data, i.e., Decision Tree SVM (DTSVM). DTSVM has much lower computational cost compared with kernel SVM, and it brings almost no hyper-parameters except a few thresholds which can be fixed in practice. Comprehensive experiments on large scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The widespread popularization of vehicles has facilitated all people’s life during the last decades. However, the emergence of a large number of vehicles poses the critical but challenging problem of vehicle re-identification (reID). Till now, for most vehicle reID algorithms, both the training and testing processes are conducted on the same annotated datasets under supervision. However, even a well-trained model will still cause fateful performance drop due to the severe domain bias between the trained dataset and the real-world scenes. To address this problem, this paper proposes a domain adaptation framework for vehicle reID (DAVR), which narrows the cross-domain bias by fully exploiting the labeled data from the source domain to adapt the target domain. DAVR develops an image-to-image translation network named Dual-branch Adversarial Network (DAN), which promotes the images from the source domain (well-labeled) to learn the style of the target domain (unlabeled). Specially, DAN doesn’t need any annotation and can preserve identity information from source domain before and after translation. Furthermore, the generated images are employed to train the vehicle reID model by a proposed attention-based feature learning network. Through the proposed framework, the well-trained reID model has better generalization ability for various scenes in real-world situations. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed DAVR can achieve excellent performances on benchmark datasets VehicleID and VeRi-776.},

Besides, the generalization ability of pre-trained detectors across different datasets remains to be improved. Both of these issues can be attributed to insufficient training data coverage. To cope with this, we present an efficient data augmentation scheme by transferring pedestrians from other datasets into the target scene with a novel Attribute Preserving Generative Adversarial Networks (APGAN). The proposed methodology consists of two steps: pedestrian embedding and style transfer. The former step can simulate pedestrian images of various scale and occlusion, in any pose or background, thus greatly promoting the data variation. The latter step aims to make the generated samples more realistic while guarantee the data coverage. To achieve this goal, we propose APGAN, which pursues both good visual quality and attribute preserving after style transfer. With the proposed method, we can make effective sample augmentations to improve the generalization ability of the trained detectors and enhance its robustness to scale change and occlusions. Extensive experiment results validate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid developments of deep neural networks related applications, approaches for accelerating computationally intensive convolutional neural networks , such as network quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation , have attracted ever-increasing attention. Network binarization is an extreme form of network quantization technique, which binarizes the network weights and/or activation values to save computational resources. However, it often introduces noises into the network, and requires larger model size (more parameters) to compensate for the loss of representation capacity. To address the model complexity reduction challenges and further improve the network performance, this paper proposes an approach: slimming binarized neural networks ( SBNN ), which reduces complexity of binarized networks with acceptable accuracy loss. SBNN prunes the convolutional layers and fully-connected layer in a binarized network. Then it is refined by the proposed SoftSign function, knowledge distillation and full-precision computation to enhance the network accuracy. The proposed SBNN can be also conveniently applied to a pre-trained binarized network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several state-of-the-art binarized models. For AlexNet and ResNet-18 on ILSVRC-2012 dataset, SBNN obtains negligible accuracy loss but even a better accuracy than the pre-pruning model while using only 75\% of original filters.},

We assume that the information exchange among the vehicles is limited by some given communication radius. Under the limited communication range, connectivity maintenance and collision avoidance between the leader and follower are considered in the formation tracking control design. To compensate for the modeling uncertainties, we employ neural network (NN) approximators to estimate uncertain dynamics. Based on the dynamic surface control technique, backstepping procedure, NN-based observers, tan-type barrier Lyapunov functions , and control Lyapunov synthesis, a decentralized adaptive output-feedback formation tracking controller is presented to achieve the boundedness of the signals in the closed-loop system, while guaranteeing connectivity maintenance and collision avoidance between the leader and follower during whole operation.

It is well recognized that the content adaptivity which adopted in steganography should also be considered for steganalysis to improve detection accuracy, and thus the embedding locations are weighted (so called selection channel) to build steganalytic detectors. However, the existing selection channels incorporated into steganalysis are all manually designed and keep constant even in the whole training stage of deep learning based steganalysis. Therefore, the handcrafted and fixed selection channels leave much room for improvement in steganalysis. In this paper, we propose to learn the selection channels in an end-to-end manner. Our steganalytic scheme has two parts: selection channel network and steganalysis network. These two networks are trained together. The selection channel network learns and outs the selection channels for the steganalysis network, and the steganalysis network integrated with the learned selection channels predicts the final steganalysis results. Our experiments under various conditions show that the learned selection channels considerably improve the detection accuracy of steganalytic schemes against content-adaptive steganography, and also exhibit high universality and robustness in real-world environments.},

Different from traditional PQ-based methods, we analyze quantization errors after learning the first PQ codebook, and then part of training vectors with larger quantization errors are found and selected to relearn a second PQ codebook. When encoding the database offline, all database vectors are firstly quantized using both of dual codebooks in each subspace, and the encoding mode of a database vector is determined after comparing the two quantization errors based on dual codebooks. Moreover, database vectors with the same encoding mode are grouped as a sub-database and can be more efficiently searched.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network model for ordinal regression by considering a family of probabilistic ordinal link functions in the output layer. The link functions are those used for cumulative link models, which are traditional statistical linear models based on projecting each pattern into a 1-dimensional space. A set of ordered thresholds splits this space into the different classes of the problem. In our case, the projections are estimated by a non-linear deep neural network . To further improve the results, we combine these ordinal models with a loss function that takes into account the distance between the categories, based on the weighted Kappa index. Three different link functions are studied in the experimental study, and the results are contrasted with a statistical analysis. The experiments run over two different ordinal classification problems and the statistical tests confirm that these models improve the results of a nominal model and outperform other robust proposals considered in the literature.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, SiamFC-based trackers have received much attention because of their great potentials in balancing tracking accuracy and speed. However, the robustness of most such trackers is greatly affected by the large deformations of targets. We argue that in the cross-correlation operation which is widely used by modern SiamFC-based trackers, the static correlation between the template kernel and the feature maps of test sample is difficult to adapt to the large deformation of the target object. In this paper, we propose a Siamese deformable cross-correlation network (SiamDCN), which introduces the deformable cross-correlation operation into SiamFC in an online self-adaptive way, for robust visual tracking. Compared to the previous SiamFC-based trackers, our SiamDCN is more robust to the large deformations of targets through dynamically and adaptively adjusting the location of correlation calculation for each element of the template kernel in the cross-correlation operation. Moreover, we build a twofold Siamese network , named SiamDCN+, which consists of a SiamDCN branch and a SiamFC branch, for accurate and real-time visual tracking after observing that the features learned in SiamFC are static and discriminative, whereas those in SiamDCN are dynamic and robust, and they complement each other. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, OTB2015, VOT2016, and VOT2017, show that the proposed SiamDCN achieves superior localization accuracy than its baseline tracker SiamFC and the proposed SiamDCN+ achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art real-time trackers, while running beyond 40 FPS.},

In this method, we cast the segmentation task as a Markov Random Field (MRF) labeling problem. Different from the conventional MRF models , our model uses an additional term of higher-order potential to better propagate the global consistency among frames. The higher-order potential presented in this paper is significant for the proposed method because of its capability to keep the long-range consistency during segmentation. In order to make the MRF energy minimized, we also introduce a smart skill that makes the intractable higher-order potential “invisible” during the optimization so that the problem can be solved simply by applying a standard graph cut algorithm. Besides, the entire process is operated in a bilateral space, where the labeling can be inferred efficiently on the vertices that are sampled regularly from the bilateral grid. The results of a comparison of our method with a number of recently developed methods show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on multiple benchmark data sets in view of accuracy and achieves a much faster runtime performance.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a general framework for autonomous root-cause fault diagnosis in a complex process. In this framework, as a prerequisite step after conducting fault detection, the potential root-cause candidates are selected using a contribution score-based method (e.g. accumulative rate contribution scores). Then a fully automated procedure is proposed to determine the root-cause(s) of the detected fault amongst potential candidates without a priori knowledge of the base-line model or intervention of an expert. To locate the root-cause variable(s), firstly symbolic dynamic-based normalized transfer entropy (SDNTE) is proposed to generate an initial causal graph of root-cause candidates. Then symbolic dynamic-based normalized direct transfer entropy (SDNDTE) is proposed and utilized for pruning the initial graph (i.e. discard indirect and spurious causal edges). To this aim, explicit definitions of immediate intermediate variables (IIV) and source intermediate variables (SIV) are given and systematic algorithms are developed to find them efficiently. At last, a topological approach is proposed to locate the root-cause variables according to the pruned causal graph. The proposed generalized SDNDTE approach overcomes the computational complexity in the calculation of normalized direct transfer entropy (NDTE) using conventional multi-dimensional kernel probability density functions (PDFs) fitting, which enables real-time root-cause fault diagnosis. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability, the proposed autonomous scheme is tested on a numerical example at first, and its computational complexity is analysed and compared to other existing works. Finally, it is validated on the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) benchmark model .},

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed significant advances in deep learning based object detection. Despite being extensively explored, most existing detectors are designed to detect objects with relatively low-quality prediction of locations, i.e., they are often trained with the threshold of Intersection over Union (IoU) set as 0.5. This can yield low-quality or even noisy detections. Designing high quality object detectors which have a more precise localization (e.g. IoU &gt; 0.5) remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel single-shot detection framework called Bidirectional Pyramid Networks (BPN) for high-quality object detection. It comprises two novel components: (i) Bidirectional Feature Pyramid structure and Anchor Refinement (AR). The bidirectional feature pyramid structure aims to use semantic-rich deep layer features to enhance the quality of the shallow layer features, and simultaneously use the spatially-rich shallow layer features to enhance the quality of deep layer features, leading to a stronger representation of both small and large objects for high quality detection. Our anchor refinement scheme gradually refines the quality of pre-designed anchors by learning multi-level regressors, giving more precise localization predictions. We performed extensive experiments on both PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO datasets, and achieved the best performance among all single-shot detectors. The performance was especially superior in the regime of high-quality detection.},

This paper aims at designing resilient filters against DoS attacks to estimate neuronal states in the sense of dissipative. For this goal, a switched filter is introduced to cope with DoS attacks and unavailability of state information. In order to save precious communication resources, an event-triggered communication scheme is devised to transmit only necessary information to the filter. With such setting, the filtering error system is modeled as a switched system with time-delay. By employing the piecewise Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality techniques, some criteria on the existence of suitable filters are presented against aperiodic DoS attacks while suitable filtering performance can be ensured. It should be mentioned that since a generalized dissipative performance index is introduced, several kinds of resilient event-based filtering issues, such as H ∞ filtering, passive filtering, mixed H ∞ and passive filtering, ( Q, S, R )-dissipative filtering are solved in a unified framework in the presence of aperiodic DoS attacks.

Furthermore, with the help of the quartic Lyapunov function , it is proved that all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system remain bounded in probability and the containment error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the sense of mean square by a suitable choice of parameters. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.},

The neural network learning framework is introduced to manifest the characteristics of nonlinear systems to obtain better performances. The system nonlinearities include more complicated non-strict feedback structure and full-state dependent unmodeled dynamics. In virtue of the nonlinear decomposition technique and the finite-time criterion, an adaptive learning strategy is developed step by step. Under the proposed strategy, a common Lyapunov function for all the subsystems is constructed to guarantee that in finite time all the signals of the switched system converge to a small domain near the origin under arbitrary switchings.

  abstract     = {Clustering is an important unsupervised learning method in machine learning and data mining. Many existing clustering methods may still face the challenge in self-identifying clusters with varying shapes, sizes and densities. To devise a more generic clustering method that considers all the aforementioned properties of the natural clusters, we propose a novel clustering algorithm named Anchor Points based Clustering (APC). The anchor points in APC are characterized by having a relatively large distance from data points with higher densities. We take anchor points as centers to obtain intermediate clusters, which can divide the whole dataset more appropriately so as to better facilitate further grouping. In essence, based on the analysis of the identified anchor points, the relationship among the corresponding intermediate clusters can be better revealed. In short, the difference in local densities (densities within neighboring data points) of the anchor points characterizes their different properties, that is to say, all the intermediate clusters may fall into one or multiple identified levels with different densities. Finally, based on the properties of anchor points, APC spontaneously chooses the appropriate clustering strategies and reports the final clustering results . To evaluate the performances of APC, we conduct experiments on twelve two-dimensional synthetic datasets and twelve multi-dimensional real-world datasets. Moreover, we also apply APC to the Olivetti Face dataset to further assess its effectiveness in terms of face recognition. All experimental results indicate that APC outperforms four classical methods and two state-of-the-art methods in most cases.},

Human head area is naturally a strong cue because of its stable appearance, visibility and relative location to body. Inspired by it, we adopt an extra branch to conduct semantic head detection in parallel with traditional body branch. Instead of manually labeling the head regions, we use weak annotations inferred directly from body boxes, which are named as ‘semantic head’. In this way, the head detection is formulated into using a special part of labeled box to detect the corresponding part of human body, which surprisingly improves the performance and robustness to occlusion. Moreover, the head-body alignment structure is explicitly explored by introducing Alignment Loss, which functions in a self-supervised manner. Based on these, we propose the head-body alignment net (HBAN) in this work, which aims to enhance pedestrian detection by utilizing the human head prior. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of HBAN on CityPersons dataset. HBAN achieves about 5\% increase for heavily occluded pedestrians over baseline and reaches the state-of-the-art performance.},

For this purpose, we divide the environment into environment nodes according to the result of scene understanding. The semantic map of the outdoor environment is obtained by generating topological relations between the environment nodes. In the semantic map, only the information of the nodes is saved, so that the storage space can be kept at a very small level with the increasing size of environment. When the UGV receives a new local semantic map, we evaluate the similarity between local map and global map to determine the possible position of the UGV according to the categories of the left and right nodes and the distance between the current position and the nodes. In order to validate the proposed approach, experiments have been conducted in a large-scale outdoor environment with a real UGV. Depending on the semantic map, the UGV can redefine its position from different starting points.},

  abstract     = {The classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a early stage of Alzheimer’s disease and is associated with brain structural and functional changes, is still a challenging task. Recent studies have shown great promise for improving the performance of MCI classification by combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter volume and clustering coefficient . However, extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to improve the performance of MCI classification have always been challenging problems. To address these problems, in this study we propose a new method to enhance the feature representation of multi-modal MRI data by combining multi-view information to improve the performance of MCI classification. Firstly, we extract two structural features (including grey matter volume and cortical thickness) and two functional features (including clustering coefficient and shortest path length) of each cortical brain region based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas from both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each subject. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful in distinguishing MCI subjects, an improved multi-task feature selection method, namely MTFS-gLASSO-TTR, is proposed. Finally, a multi-kernel learning algorithm is adopted to combine multiple features to perform the MCI classification task . Our proposed MCI classification method is evaluated on 315 subjects (including 105 LMCI subjects, 105 EMCI subjects and 105 NCs) with both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.5\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.897 for LMCI/NC classification, an accuracy of 82.7\% and an AUC of 0.832 for EMCI/NC classification, and an accuracy of 79.6\% and an AUC of 0.803 for LMCI/EMCI classification, respectively. In addition, by comparison, the accuracy and AUC values of our proposed method are better than those of some existing state-of-the-art methods in MCI classification. Overall, our proposed MCI classification method is effective and promising for automatic diagnosis of MCI in clinical practice.},

In this study we present a systematic work-flow for the configuration of spiking-neuronal-network-based learning systems including evolutionary algorithms for information transmission optimization, advanced visualization tools for the validation of the best suitable configuration and customized scripts for final quantitative evaluation of the learning capabilities. By integrating both grouped action potential information and stimulation-related events, the proposed visualization framework provides qualitatively assessment of the evolution of the learning process in the simulation under study. The proposed work-flow has been used to study how receptive fields emerge in a network of inhibitory interneurons with excitatory and inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity when it is exposed to repetitive and partially overlapped stimulation patterns.

We substitute the commonly used soft matting technique in assessing the refined transmission map for haze removal, by adaptive nearest neighbor classifier . We assume that the actual color of the haze-free pixels in the image is approximated by a set of discrete colors. We discover the haze-free pixels using the Nearest-Neighbor ( NN ) regularization . Finally, unlike the state-of-the-art methods, we approximate the additional airlight present in the image patch and eliminate that to clear the haze, instead of estimating the transmission of the medium. The proposed nearest neighbor regularization technique automatically changes the patch size, which helps in dealing with the high depth region (e.g., sky region) of the image. We experimented on standard synthetic and real hazy image datasets and observed that, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially for images with sky regions.},

That is, can we create a dynamical system that in a general but mathematically rigorous way, is readily ‘usable’ by an unknown agent. We are especially interested in the synthesis of neuronal dynamics that are maximally labile with respect to afferent inputs. That is, can we create neural dynamics that propagate information well. To do so, we blend ideas from control and information theories , by turning specifically to the notion of empowerment, or the information capacity of a dynamical system in an input-to-state sense. We devise a strategy to optimize the dynamics of a system using empowerment over its state space as an objective function. This results in dynamics that are generically conducive to information propagation. For example, the optimized environment would be expected to perform well as an encoder (of afferent input distributions). We outline the key technical innovations needed in order to perform the optimization and, by means of example, discuss emergent dynamical characteristics of systems optimized according to this principle.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a topology of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based on a metaheuristic optimization algorithm for the tracking control of mobile-manipulator while enforcing nonholonomic constraints. Traditional approaches for tracking control of mobile robots usually require the computation of Jacobian-inverse or linearization of its mathematical model. The proposed algorithm uses a nature-inspired optimization approach to directly solve the nonlinear optimization problem without any further transformation. First, we formulate the tracking control as a constrained optimization problem . The optimization problem is formulated on position-level to avoid the computationally expensive Jacobian-inversion. The nonholonomic limitation is ensured by adding equality constraints to the formulated optimization problem. We then present the Beetle Antennae Olfactory Recurrent Neural Network (BAORNN) algorithm to solve the optimization problem efficiently using very few mathematical operations. We present a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and show that its computational cost is linear with respect to the degree of freedoms (DOFs), i.e., O(m). Additionally, we also prove its stability and convergence. Extensive simulation results are prepared using a simulated model of IIWA14, a 7-DOF industrial-manipulator, mounted on a differentially driven cart. Comparison results with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are also presented to prove the accuracy and numerical efficiency of the proposed controller. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is several times (around 75 in the worst case) faster in execution as compared to PSO , and suitable for real-time implementation. The tracking results for three different trajectories; circular, rectangular, and rhodonea paths are presented.},

  abstract     = {Recently deep cross-modal hashing (CMH) have received increased attention in multimedia information retrieval, as it is able to combine the benefit from the low storage cost and search efficiency of hashing, and the strong capabilities of feature abstraction by deep neural networks . CMH can effectively integrates hash representation learning and hash function optimization into an end-to-end framework. However, most of existing deep cross-modal hashing methods use a one-size-fits-all high level representation resulting in the loss of the spatial information of data. Also, previous methods mostly generated fixed length hashing codes. Here, the significance level of different bits are equally weighted thereby restricting their practical flexibility. To address these issues, we propose a self-constraining and attention-based hashing network (SCAHN) for bit-scalable cross-modal hashing. SCAHN integrates the label constraints from early and late-stages as well as their fused features into the hash representation and hash function learning. Moreover, as the fusion of early and late-stages features is based on an attention mechanism , each bit of the hashing codes can be unequally weighted so that the code lengths can be manipulated by ranking the significance of each bit without extra hash-model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed SCAHN outperforms the current state-of-the-art CMH methods. Moreover, it is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes well-preserve the discriminative power with varying code lengths and obtain competitive results comparing to the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Due to technological advances, machines are increasingly present in people’s daily lives. Thus, there has been more and more effort to develop interfaces that provide an intuitive way of interaction, such as dynamic gestures. Currently, the most common trend is to use multimodal data, as depth and skeleton information, to enable dynamic gesture recognition . However, it would be more interesting if only color information was used, since RGB cameras are usually available in almost every public place, and could be used for gesture recognition without the need of installing additional equipment. The main problem with such approach is the difficulty of representing spatio-temporal information using just color. With this in mind, we propose a technique capable of condensing a dynamic gesture, shown in a video, in just one RGB image . We call this technique star RGB. This image is then passed to a classifier formed by two Resnet CNNs, a soft-attention ensemble, and a fully connected layer, which indicates the class of the gesture present in the input video. Experiments were carried out using Montalbano, GRIT, and isoGD datasets. For Montalbano dataset, the proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 94.58\%. Such result reaches the state-of-the-art when considering this dataset and only color information. For GRIT dataset, our proposal achieves more than 98\% of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, outperforming the authors’ approach by more than 6\%. Regarding the large scale isoGD dataset, the proposal achieved 52.18\% of accuracy. However, taking into account the complexity of the dataset (eight different gestures categories) and the amount of classes (249), we consider that our approach is competitive with previous ones, since we employed only color information to recognize gestures instead of all the multimodal data available, usually used by other methods.},

  abstract     = {With the prosperity of the location-based social networks, next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation has become an increasingly significant requirement since it can benefit both users and business. Obtaining insight into user mobility for the next POI recommendations is a vital yet challenging task. Existing approaches to understanding user mobility mainly gloss over the check-in sequence, making it fail to explicitly capture the subtle POI–POI interactions across the entire user check-in history and distinguish relevant check-ins from the irrelevant. In this paper, we proposed a novel recommendation approach, namely geographical-temporal awareness hierarchical attention network (GT-HAN) to resolve those issues. We first establish a geographical-temporal attention network to simultaneously uncover the overall sequence dependence and the subtle POI–POI relationships. Then, a context-specific co-attention network was designed to learn to change user preferences by adaptively selecting relevant check-in activities from check-in histories, which enabled GT-HAN to distinguish degrees of user preference for different check-ins. Finally, we make a POI recommendation using a conditional probability distribution function. Experimental results on real world datasets (obtained from Foursquare and Gowalla) show that the GT-HAN model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, and demonstrating the benefits produced by new technologies incorporated into GT-HAN.},

Since labels come from different sources, their annotations may have different degrees of reliability (e.g., noisy labels, supersets of labels, complementary labels or annotations performed by domain experts), and we must make sure that the addition of potentially inaccurate labels does not degrade the performance achieved when using only true labels. For this reason, we consider each group of annotations as being weakly supervised and pose the problem as finding the optimal combination of such collections. We propose an efficient algorithm based on expectation-maximization and show its performance in both synthetic and real-world classification tasks in a variety of weak label scenarios.},

Because of the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication , the concerned quaternion-valued models separated into four real-valued parts to form the equivalent real-valued systems. Based on M-matrix properties and homomorphism mapping theories, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the system. Conditions for ensuring the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of the system are obtained on the basis of the vector Lyapunov function method instead of the linear matrix inequality method. Using a similar method, the mixed-delay QVNNs with parameter uncertainties are also studied, and the conditions for ensuring the global robust exponential stability of the system are established directly. The adopted approach and the obtained results in this paper complement already the existing ones. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility and the less level conservatism of the main results.},

In this way, we develop a forecasting model called the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Grey Cognitive Map (IFGCM).

  abstract     = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is limited in practice by its poor explainability, which is responsible for insufficient trustiness from users, unsatisfied interpretation for human intervention, inadequate analysis for future improvement, etc. This paper seeks to partially characterize the interplay between dynamical environments and a previously-proposed Disturbance OBserver net (DOB-net). The DOB-net is trained via RL and offers optimal control for a set of Partially Observable Markovian Decision Processes (POMDPs). The transition function of each POMDP is largely determined by the environments (excessive external disturbances). This paper proposes an Attention-based Abstraction (A 2 ) approach to extract a finite-state automaton, referred to as a Key Moore Machine Network (KMMN), to capture the switching mechanisms exhibited by the DOB-net in dealing with multiple such POMDPs. A 2 first quantizes the controlled platform by learning continuous-discrete interfaces. Then it extracts the KMMN by finding the key hidden states and transitions that attract sufficient attention from the DOB-net. Within the resultant KMMN, three patterns of cyclic switchings (between key hidden states) are found, and saturated controls are shown synchronized with unknown disturbances. Interestingly, the found switchings have previously appeared in the control design for often-saturated systems. They are interpreted via an analogy to the discrete-event subsystem of hybrid control.},

  abstract     = {The main issue in incremental nonnegative matrix factorization (INMF) is how to update base matrix and coefficient matrix . The re-training scheme(RT-NMF) and the scheme proposed by Bucak and Gunsel(BG-INMF) are two common methods. However, both of them have problems in balancing root mean square error(RMSE) and time cost when incremental samples appear in a batch form. In this paper, a three-stage method(3S-INMF) is proposed to derive a good balance between RMSE and time cost. In the first stage, only the coefficient matrix of incremental samples is updated while the base matrix and the coefficient matrix of old samples are fixed. If the RMSE does not meet the required precision after this stage, the second stage, i.e. BG-INMF, is carried out. In the second stage, the base matrix and the coefficient matrix of incremental samples are updated alternatively while the coefficient matrix of old samples is fixed. If the RMSE still does not meet with the required precision after BG-INMF, the coefficient matrix of old samples will be updated in the third stage while the base matrix and the coefficient matrix of incremental samples are fixed. In the three consecutive stages, the initial values of base matrix and coefficient matrix in each stage are the corresponding output values in the previous stage. In addition, extensive experiments on the three popular datasets show that 3S-INMF obtains the best balance between RMSE and time cost compared with RT-NMF and BG-INMF. Furthermore, the 3S-INMF is extended to graph nonnegative matrix factorization(GNMF) and kernel nonnegative matrix factorization(KNMF), which also has a superior performance examined by further experiments.},

In the objective function, we adopt the newly emerged tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to characterize the global low-rankness prior of multi-dimensional images. We also formulate an implicit regularizer by plugging a denoising neural network (termed as deep denoiser), which is convinced to express the deep image prior learned from a large number of natural images. The resulting model can be solved by the alternating directional method of multipliers algorithm under the plug-and-play (PnP) framework.

This work proposes a novel method to visualise basins of attraction together with the associated stationary points via gradient-based stochastic sampling. The proposed technique is used to perform an empirical study of the loss surfaces generated by two different error metrics: quadratic loss and entropic loss. The empirical observations confirm the theoretical hypothesis regarding the nature of neural network attraction basins. Entropic loss is shown to exhibit stronger gradients and fewer stationary points than quadratic loss, indicating that entropic loss has a more searchable landscape. Quadratic loss is shown to be more resilient to overfitting than entropic loss. Both losses are shown to exhibit local minima, but the number of local minima is shown to decrease with an increase in dimensionality. Thus, the proposed visualisation technique successfully captures the local minima properties exhibited by the neural network loss surfaces, and can be used for the purpose of fitness landscape analysis of neural networks.},

To further explore contextual information and conform the spatial structure as far as possible, we employ shape-adaptive algorithm to construct a shape-adaptive region for each test pixel at the same time. Then, we design adaptive kernel sparse representation (AKSR) method by applying kernel joint sparse pattern to address the linearly inseparable problem of classification in multiple feature space and make the pixels with the same distribution more easily grouped and linearly separable. Moreover, composite kernel constructed by multiple kernel learning (MKL) is embedded into AKSR to effectively construct base kernels for different feature descriptors and determine the weights of base kernels optimally, which can take the similarity and diversity of different types of feature descriptor into full consideration. Experimental results on three widely used real HSI data demonstrate that the proposed AKSR-MFL classifier outperforms several state-of-the-art classification methods.},

To this end, we propose a novel attention-based deep learning framework consisting of a feature extraction module and an attention module. The feature extraction module is based on a two-branch architecture with a trunk branch and a mask branch. The trunk branch extracts shallow features, while mask branch is intermediately supervised to generate coarse masks with rough geometric information . An attention module is designed to select relevant features from trunk features under the guidance of geometric information from the coarse masks. The above attention module helps increase robustness of our framework to unconstrained faces while reducing complexity of our deep network. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmark datasets, 300-W and AFLW. Ablation studies indicate its superior performance on challenging faces. Comparing with the state of the art, our method provides a competent trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our approach achieves 3.35\% mean error with 0.29\% failure rate on 300-W fullset, and 1.44\% mean error with 0.40\% failure rate on AFLW-Full datasets. Meanwhile, our method is capable of processing images at real-time speed (13ms) on 300-W with 68 landmarks.},

The methods based on a combination of episodic memory (several stored samples) and semantic memory (sampling of posterior probability function) show superiority compared to other recent methods devoted to CI prevention.

It can measure the similarity between two image patches, which coincides with the principle of the matching-based tracking algorithm. In this paper, a variant Siamese network based tracker is proposed to introduce attention module into traditional Siamese network, and relocate the object with some auxiliary relocation methods, when the proposed tracker runs under an untrusted state. Firstly, a novel attention shake layer is proposed to replace the max pooling layer in Siamese network. This layer could introduce and train two different kinds of attention modules at the same time, which means the proposed attention shake layer could also help to improve the expression power of Siamese network without increasing the depth of the network. Secondly, an auxiliary relocation branch is proposed to assist in object relocation and tracking. According to the prior assumptions of visual object tracking, some weights are involved in the auxiliary relocation branch, such as structure similarity weight, motion similarity weight, motion smoothness weight and object saliency weight. Thirdly, a novel response map based switch function is proposed to monitor the tracking process and control the effect of auxiliary relocation branch. Furthermore, in order to discuss the effect of pooling layer in Siamese network, 9 pooling and attention architectures are proposed and discussed in this paper. Some empirical results are shown in the experiment part. Comparing with the state-of-the-art trackers, the proposed tracker could achieve comparable performance in multiple benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental issue in smart cities and plays an important role in urban traffic planning and management. An accurate predictive model can help individuals make reliable travel plans and choose optimal routes while efficiently helping administrators maintain traffic order. Road speed prediction, which is a sub-task of traffic flow forecasting, is challenging due to the complicated spatial dependencies characterizing road networks and dynamic temporal traffic patterns. Given the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in learning temporal relations and graph neural networks (GNNs) in integrating graph-structured and node-attributed features, in this paper, we design a novel graph LSTM (GLSTM) framework to capture spatial-temporal representations in road speed forecasting. More specifically, we first present a temporal directed attributed graph to model complex traffic flow. Then, to take advantage of the structure properties and graph features, we employ a message-passing mechanism for feature aggregation and updating. Finally, we further implement several variants of LSTMs with a GN block under the encoder-decoder framework to model spatial-temporal dependencies. The experiments show that our proposed model is able to fully utilize both the road latent graph structure and traffic speed to forecast the road state during future periods. The results on two real-world datasets show that our GLSTM can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods by up to 32.8\% in terms of MAE , 43.2\% in terms of MAPE and 23.1\% in terms of RMSE.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modal retrieval has attracted considerate attention due to the rapid development of Internet and social media, and cross-modal hashing has been widely and successfully used in this domain. However, most existing hashing methods consider much little the semantic similarity levels between instances, whereas simply classified the semantic relationship as either similar or dissimilar. Besides, the issue of preservation of semantic similarity of original data between the extracted features is less explored from the existing methods. Due to the heterogeneity between different modalities, similarity of different modality features cannot be calculated directly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep semantic similarity adversarial hashing (DSSAH) for cross-modal retrieval. We first calculate semantic similarity by using both label and feature information to provide a more accurate value for similarity between instances. And then an adversarial modality discriminator is introduced to establish a common feature space where similarity of each modality features can be calculated. Finally, two loss functions referring to inter-modal loss and intra-modal loss are designed to generate high quality hash codes. Experiments on three common datasets for cross-modal retrieval show that DSSAH outperforms state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods in cross-modal retrieval applications.},

The salient regions of a mesh are those that geometrically stand out from their contexts and therefore are semantically important for geometry processing and shape analysis. However, a suitable definition of region contexts for saliency detection remains elusive in the field, and the previous methods fail to produce saliency maps that agree well with human annotations. We address these issues by computing saliency in a global manner and enforcing sparsity for more accurate saliency detection . Specifically, we represent the geometry of a mesh using a metric that globally encodes the shape distances between every pair of local regions. We then propose a sparsity-enforcing rarity optimization problem , solving which allows us to obtain a compact set of salient regions globally distinct from each other. We build a perceptually motivated 3D eye fixation dataset and use a large-scale Schelling saliency dataset for extensive benchmarking of saliency detection methods. The results show that our computed saliency maps are closer to the ground-truth. To showcase the usefulness of our saliency maps for geometry processing, we apply them to feature point localization and achieve higher accuracy compared to established feature detectors.},

First, HFO candidates (HFOCs) are obtained by the root mean square method. Next, a time-frequency analysis method is applied to eliminate spikes from HFOCs, which consists of the Stockwell transform, SVD combined with the k -medoids clustering algorithm , Stockwell inverse transform , and threshold method. Then, four kinds of distinctive features, i.e. mean singular values, line lengths, power ratios and spectral centroid of the rest of HFOCs, are extracted and augmented as feature vectors. These vectors are used as the input of the improved FCM clustering algorithm optimized by the simulated annealing algorithm combined with the genetic algorithm. Finally, the localization of SOZs is accomplished based on the concentrations of the detected HFOs. The superiority of the devised detector over other five existing ones is demonstrated by comparing their localization performance.},

Despite the recent advances, there are still many unsolved problems in this area. In this paper, we propose a novel OSSL method based on learning vector quantization (LVQ). LVQ classifiers, which represent the data of each class by a set of prototypes, have found their usage in a wide range of pattern recognition problems and can be naturally adapted to the online scenario by updating the prototypes with stochastic gradient optimization. However, most of the existing LVQ algorithms were designed for supervised classification . To extract useful information from unlabeled data , we propose two simple and computationally efficient methods based on clustering assumption. To be specific, we use the maximum conditional likelihood criterion for updating prototypes when data sample is labeled, and the Gaussian mixture clustering criterion or neural gas clustering criterion for adjusting prototypes when data sample is unlabeled. These two criteria are utilized alternatively according to the availability of label information to make full use of both supervised and unsupervised data to boost the performance. By extensive experiments, we show that the proposed method exhibits higher accuracy compared with the baseline methods and graph-based methods and is much more efficient than graph-based methods in both training and test time.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) of optimal policies against an opponent agent also with learning capability is still challenging in Markov games. A variety of algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem such as the traditional Q-learning-based RL (QbRL) algorithms as well as the state-of-the-art neural-network-based RL (NNbRL) algorithms. However, the QbRL approaches have poor generalization capability for complex problems with non-stationary opponents, while the learned policies by NNbRL algorithms are lack of explainability and transparency. In this paper, we propose an algorithm X-OMQ( λ ) that integrates eXtended Classifier System (XCS) with opponent modelling for concurrent reinforcement learners in zero-sum Markov Games. The algorithm can learn general, accurate, and interpretable action selection rules and allow policy optimization using the genetic algorithm (GA). Besides, the X-OMQ( λ ) agent optimizes the established opponent’s model while simultaneously learning to select actions in a goal-directed manner. In addition, we use the eligibility trace mechanism to further speed up the learning process. In the reinforcement component, not only the classifiers in the action set are updated, but other relevant classifiers are also updated in a certain proportion. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the hunter prey problem and two adversarial soccer scenarios where the opponent is allowed to learn with several benchmark QbRL and NNbRL algorithms. The results show that our method has similar learning performance with the NNbRL algorithms while our method requires no prior knowledge of the opponent or the environment. Moreover, the learned action selection rules are also interpretable while having generalization capability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a precise Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm which is a RGB information supplemented registration method based on correntropy measurement, which can overcome noise and outliers to complete precise point cloud registration. Firstly, in order to achieve accurate point set registration of single structure geometry point cloud with a large number of planes information rather than geometry information, we add the RGB information to our initial method as information compensation, which greatly ensure our algorithm could achieve accurate registration. Secondly, due to the noise and outliers existed in RGB-D data can easily cause deviations in registration, in order to achieve precise registration in RGB-D data, we introduced the correntropy measurement method into the initial model. Experimental results on our scene dataset demonstrate the proposed algorithm can achieve precise point set registration in RGB-D scene data well.},

Both the linear and kernel versions of the MCM solve a linear programming problem , in order to minimize a bound on the VC dimension. This paper proposes a new quadratic programming formulation, termed as the Quadratic MCM (QMCM), that minimizes a tighter bound on the VC dimension. We present two variants of the QMCM, that differ in the norm of the error vector being minimized. We also explore a scalable variant of the QMCM for large datasets using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and present the use of the QMCM as a viable featureselection method, in view of the the sparse nature of the models it learns. We compare the performance of the QMCM variants with LIBLinear, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) library; as well as against Pegasos and the linear MCM for large datasets, along with sequential feature selection methods and ReliefF. Our results validate the superiority of the QMCM in terms of statistically significant improvements on benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been applied to various application scenarios including Web searching , Q&amp;A, recommendation system, natural language processing and so on. However, the vast majority of Knowledge Bases (KBs) are incomplete, necessitating a demand for KB completion (KBC). Methods of KBC used in the mainstream current knowledge base include the latent factor model, the random walk model and recent popular methods based on reinforcement learning , which performs well in their respective areas of expertise. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants model temporal data by remembering information for long periods, however, whether they also have the ability to use the information they have already remembered to achieve complex reasoning in the knowledge graph. In this paper, we produce a novel framework (ALSTM) based on the Attention mechanism and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which associates structure learning with parameter learning of first-order logical rules in an end-to-end differentiable neural networks model. In this framework, we designed a memory system and employed a multi-head dot product attention (MHDPA) to interact and update the memories embedded in the memory system for reasoning purposes. This is also consistent with the process of human cognition and reasoning, looking for enlightenment for the future in historical memory. In addition, we explored the use of inductive bias in deep learning to facilitate learning of entities, relations, and rules. Experiments establish the efficiency and effectiveness of our model and show that our method achieves better performance in tasks which include fact prediction and link prediction than baseline models on several benchmark datasets such as WN18RR, FB15K-237 and NELL-995.},

  abstract     = {Recently, spectral clustering (SC) has been gaining more and more attention due to its excellent performance in unsupervised learning . However, the computational complexity of the SC is high. Also, the adjacency graph matrix of the SC is ofen constructed by the Gaussian kernel , so the clustering result is sensitive to the kernel parameter σ . Since most large-scale datasets are high-dimensional and sparse, it is a great challenge to apply the SC to these data. Therefore, a fast adaptive neighbor clustering method based on the embedded clustering (FANCEC) is proposed. First, m anchors are selected from raw data. Next, a bipartite graph matrix Z connecting the raw data and anchors is constructed in a parameter-free manner. Then, the graph embedded data are obtained from raw data by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The graph embedded data extracts and combines valid information from raw data while discarding the redundant information. After that, m anchors are selected from graph embedded data, and the adjacency matrix S is initialized. Finally, the adaptive neighbor strategy is used to update matrix S until optimal function convergences. The clustering result of the FANCEC can be obtained directly without the post-processing that is required in the k -means method. The experimental results show that the proposed FANCEC can reduce time-consumption for large-scale data and obtain a good comprehensive clustering effect compared with the traditional SC methods.},

It is more assistance for radiologists reflections on the disease based on the pathogenesis when the lesion area and its adjacent structures are detected. Obviously, the multiple structures of the spine are directly interdependent and influential, and the multi-tasks under a deep convolutional neural network framework can also influence each other. Multi-task joint optimization in the spinal global mode is a direct outlet to seek the dynamic balance of the above potential correlation. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Multi-task Multi-structure Correlation Learning Network (MMCL-Net) for the detection, segmentation, and classification (normal, slight, marked, and severe) of three types of spine structure: disc, vertebra, and neural foramen simultaneously. And the model is locally optimized to achieve a more stable dynamic equilibrium state. Extensive experiments on T1/T2-weighted MR scans from 200 subjects demonstrate that MMCL-Net achieves high performance with mAP of 0.9187, the classification accuracy of 90.67\%, and dice coefficient of 90.60\%. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art methods.},

The inference of iTM-VAE is modeled by neural networks such that it can be computed in a simple feed-forward manner. We also describe how to introduce a hyper-prior into iTM-VAE so as to model the uncertainty of the prior parameter. Actually, the hyper-prior technique is quite general and we show that it can be applied to other AEVB based models to alleviate the collapse-to-prior problem elegantly. Moreover, we also propose HiTM-VAE, where the document-specific topic distributions are generated in a hierarchical manner. HiTM-VAE is even more flexible and can generate topic representations with better variability and sparsity . Experimental results on 20News and Reuters RCV1-V2 datasets show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. The advantages of the hyper-prior technique and the hierarchical model construction are also confirmed by experiments.},

This degradation of HSI data affects the subsequent applications of these images.

Assuming that the latent clean HSI holds the low-rank (LR) property while the noisy component does not, we propose a two-step Spatial-Spectral Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (SSWNNM) algorithm for HSI Denoising. Considering the LR property across the spectra, a Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (WNNM) algorithm is conducted to recover the spectral LR structure. In the spatial domain, nonlocal similar cubic patches are found and stacked into an LR matrix, which contains the local detailed spatial texture information. We further utilize Multi-channel Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (MCWNNM) to recover this spatial LR matrix. Experiments conducted on simulated and real HSI data demonstrate that the proposed denoising method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both in terms of visual quality and several quantitative assessment indices.},

Vehicle detection and recognition, which is one of the most important aspects of intelligent transportation, plays a very important role in various areas of our daily life; one such important area is criminal investigation. In the fine-grained vehicle type detection and recognition, several difficult issues such as problems in data acquisition and tagging, dramatic variance in the data of different vehicle types, and challenges in identifying vehicles of the same brand with highly similar appearances remain unsolved. For the problems of data acquisition and tagging, this paper presents a strategy for automatic data acquisition and tagging based on object detection that can label the vehicle images efficiently while rapidly acquiring all types of fine-grained models. Considering the problem of data imbalance in the training process, this paper proposes a Faster-RCNN based data equalizing strategy (Faster-BRCNN), thereby improving the performance of object detection. In view of the severe information attenuation caused by the feature information transfer obstruct between layers in the traditional deep learning network, the lack of mutual dependency of these features, and the inability of the network to focus on the important region and characteristics, we propose an intensive dense attention network (DA-Net). Through its intensive connection and attention unit, we enhance the model&#39;s detection ability. The proposed method achieves mAP of 94.5\% and 95.8\% in the Stanford Cars and FZU Cars datasets, respectively, thereby verifying its effectiveness.},

A novel CS-based hyperspectral image fusion framework is presented by combining structure tensor and matting model in this paper. The proposed scheme not only accurately estimates the missing spatial components of the HS images by using structure tensor , but also effectively preserves their spectral components by combining the advantages of structure tensor and matting model. Specifically, a structure-tensor-based adaptive weighted fusion strategy is proposed for generating the alpha channel. The high-resolution HS image is obtained by substituting the original alpha channel of the interpolated HS image with the generated alpha channel.

However, evaluating flow properties requires the acquisition of a large number of representative images, which is often unfeasible. Stochastic reconstruction methods are algorithms able to generate novel, realistic rock images from a small sample, thus avoiding a large acquisition process. A more convenient approach would use only two dimensional images, replacing 3D scans with images of the rock cuttings made during the drilling. This would extend the technique to media having pores smaller than the resolution of the micro-CT, but that can be imaged by microscopy. We introduce a novel method for 2D-to-3D reconstruction of the structure of porous media by applying generative adversarial neural networks . We compare several measures of pore morphology between simulated and acquired images. Experiments include bead pack, Berea sandstone, and Ketton limestone images. Results show that our GANs-based method can reconstruct three-dimensional images of porous media at different scales that are representative of the morphology of the original images. Also, compared to classical stochastic methods of image reconstruction, the generation of multiple images is much faster.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral images usually have small number of labeled samples because of the labeling cost and process difficulty. In conventional classification algorithms , classifier performance is depending on the number training samples. In this study, a deep learning based semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to solve this limited labeled sample size problem by utilizing power of labeled and unlabeled samples. The main aim of the study is constructing a general purpose deep model for a specific hyperspectral sensor type and using the model with little effort for all data sets obtained from this sensor type. In proposed framework, the model is trained with a data set from a hyperspectral sensor subsequently it is fine-tuned and evaluated with another data set acquired from the same sensor. Linearly separable deep features of the evaluation data set are extracted from the fine-tuned general deep model. Additionally, a new data formation method is proposed in the transition from hyperspectral data sub-cubes to the deep neural network input. Besides that, three different clustering methods have been used for selecting the initial labeled samples in the semi-supervised learning phase to observe the effects of the sample selection comparatively. As an another contribution of the study, a new semi-supervised sparse representation classifier ( S 3 RC ) is proposed with labeled and unlabeled sample information by using linearly separable deep features. The performance of the proposed framework is proven by the experimental results with using small sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {Recent work on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) is presented. The paper reviews and extends some of these methods while carefully analyzing a fundamental feature in numerical PDEs and nonlinear analysis: irregular solutions. First, the Sod shock tube solution to the compressible Euler equations is discussed and analyzed. This analysis includes a comparison of a DNN-based approach with conventional finite element and finite volume methods , and demonstrates that the DNN is competitive in terms of degrees of freedom required for a given accuracy. Further, the DNN-based approach is extended to consider performance improvements and simultaneous parameter space exploration. Next, a shock solution to compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is solved for, and used in a scenario where experimental data is utilized to enhance a PDE system that is a priori insufficient to validate against the observed/experimental data. This is accomplished by enriching the model PDE system with source terms that are then inferred via supervised training with synthetic experimental data. The resulting DNN framework for PDEs enables straightforward system prototyping and natural integration of large data sets (be they synthetic or experimental), all while simultaneously enabling single-pass exploration of an entire parameter space.},

  abstract     = {Image hashing based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), deep hashing, has acquired breakthrough in image retrieval . Although deep features from various CNN layers have various levels of information, most of the existing deep hashing methods extract the feature vector only from the output of the penultimate fully-connected layer, focusing primarily on semantic information whilst ignoring detailed structure information. This calls for research on multi-level hashing, utilizing multi-level features to exploit different levels of CNN characteristics. To fill this gap, a novel image hashing method, Multi-Level Supervised Hashing with deep feature (MLSH), is proposed in this paper to further exploit multiple levels of deep image features . It uses a multiple-hash-table mechanism to integrate multi-level features extracted from an individual deep convolutional neural network. It takes advantage of the complementarity among multi-level features from various layers of a single deep network. High-level features reveal the semantic content of the image, while low-level features provide the structural information that is missing in high-level features. Instead of simple concatenation, several hash tables are trained individually using different levels of features from different layers, which are then integrated for efficient image retrieval. The method has been systematically evaluated through experiments on three image databases, including CIFAR-10, MNIST and NUSWIDE, and has thus been demonstrated to set a new state of the art in image hashing, outperforming several state-of-the-art hashing methods. Furthermore, the recall and precision can be balanced and improved simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {Accurate left ventricle landmark localization in cardiac MRI plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis of heart disease. Typical classification models hardly deal with artifacts and low discrimination of landmark regions by using only local image information, while regression models suffer from ambiguity between random samples and label, also the imbalance of samples. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a left ventricle landmark localization and identification method in cardiac MRI based on deep distance metric learning and CNN (convolutional neural network) regression. The method includes sample generation and regression stages, where super-pixel over-segmentation and unsupervised deep metric learning are integrated to extract the embedding information of local images, then a dual-channel salient sample mining module is designed by integrating specific super-pixel patches and grid patches extracted by the embedded triplet network. The weights of this triplet network are fed to build the CNN regression model, and the salient samples are employed to predict the landmark coordinate point cloud clusters. Furthermore, the centroid of each point cloud cluster is refined as landmark by Mean Shift iteration. The proposed method and close related methods were thoroughly evaluated on the CAP (cardiac atlas project) data set, and experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the competitive accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art classification and regression-based models.},

We propose the NN-Stacking method (NNS), which generalizes Breiman’s method by allowing the linear parameters to vary with input features. This improvement enables NNS to take advantage of the fact that distinct base models often perform better at different regions of the feature space. Our method uses neural networks to estimate the stacking coefficients.

  abstract     = {Recently, many machine learning and statistical models such as non-linear regressions, the Single Index, Multi-index, Varying Coefficient Index Models and Two-layer Neural Networks can be reduced to or be seen as a special case of a new model which is called the Stochastic Linear Combination of Non-linear Regressions model. However, due to the high non-convexity of the problem, there is no previous work study how to estimate the model. In this paper, we provide the first study on how to estimate the model efficiently and scalably. Specifically, we first show that with some mild assumptions, if the variate vector x is multivariate Gaussian, then there is an algorithm whose output vectors have ℓ 2 -norm estimation errors of O ( p n ) O(pn) with high probability, where p is the dimension of x and n is the number of samples. The key idea of the proof is based on an observation motived by the Stein’s lemma. Then we extend our result to the case where x is bounded and sub-Gaussian using the zero-bias transformation, which could be seen as a generalization of the classic Stein’s lemma. We also show that with some additional assumptions there is an algorithm whose output vectors have ℓ ∞ -norm estimation errors of O ( 1 p + p n ) O(1p+pn) with high probability. We also provide a concrete example to show that there exists some link function which satisfies the previous assumptions. Finally, for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases we propose a faster sub-sampling based algorithm and show that when the sub-sample sizes are large enough then the estimation errors will not be sacrificed by too much. Experiments for both cases support our theoretical results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies and provides theoretical guarantees for the stochastic linear combination of non-linear regressions model.},

However, existing methods face two critical limitations: 1) most existing works directly exploit user-defined attributes to transfer knowledge across classes, yet the importance to learn discriminative attributes is neglected; 2) previous studies typically consider the semantic similarity embedding, while there are limited research efforts on exploring the visual similarity embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for ZSR to address the above issues. Specifically, we develop a simple yet effective strategy to learn discriminative attributes via regressing from labels, which yields superior performance in the semantic similarity space. Meanwhile, to our best knowledge, we are among the first to consider the visual similarity embedding, which fully explores the discriminative information of visual features to benefit the final performance. Moreover, we combine the visual and semantic similarity embeddings, which enriches the information in the joint similarity space and greatly reduces the gap between visual features and semantic attributes. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both conventional and generalized zero-shot recognition tasks.},

Oversampling methods, such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), generate synthetic data to achieve data balance for imbalanced classification. However, such kind of oversampling methods generates unnecessary noise when the data are not well separated. On the other hand, there are many applications with inadequate training data and vast testing data, making the imbalanced classification much more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling framework to achieve the following two objectives. (1) Improving the classification results of the SMOTE based oversampling methods; (2) Making the SMOTE based oversampling methods applicable when the training data are inadequate. The proposed framework utilizes the Laplacian eigenmaps to find an optimal dimensional space, where the data are well separated and the generation of noise by SMOTE based oversampling methods can be avoided. The construction of graph Laplacian not only explores the useful information from the unlabeled testing data to facilitate imbalanced learning, but also makes the learning process incremental. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Traditional full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are designed for natural scene images, and they cannot work well on SCIs, because they do not take account of characteristics of different visual content/regions between NSIs and SCIs. Inspired by early eye movement study that human visual system samples the world non-completely or non-uniformly, we observe that human brain perceive different image content at different scales. Given these discoveries, we propose a non-uniform scale adaptive sampling model (NUSM) which dedicates to preprocess the input images for IQA methods, enabling traditional NSI IQA models to predict the quality of SCIs effectively. The proposed sampling model applies different sample scales into different regions to generate pre-sampled image pairs, then send to existing IQAs to evaluate the quality of images. The experimental results demonstrate that our model has achieved a promising performance on both NSIs and SCIs.},

It is rigorously proved that fuzzy approximation is valid based on a compact set, full-state constraints aren’t violated for all time.

To be specific, we first exploit the human cues with the help of the off-the-shelf semantic segmentation models. Then more powerful representations MDF are constructed by concatenating activations at the last convolutional layer and fully connected layer. Finally, the proposed framework termed ER-MKL is presented to learn a robust classifier for fusing human-region MDF and whole-region MDF. In addition to combining multiple kernels derived from features of heterogeneous image regions, ER-MKL also considers the sets of pre-learned classifiers and incorporates prior knowledge of different regions.

It has been applied in a variety of practical domains and achieved great success. Despite being empirically efficient and powerful, Thompson sampling has eluded theoretical analysis. Existing analyses of Thompson sampling only provide regret upper bound of O ˜ ( d 3 / 2 T ) O˜(d3/2T) for linear contextual bandits, which is worse than the information-theoretic lower bound by a factor of d d . In this paper, we design and analyze self-accelerated Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem. Our analysis establishes that the regret upper bound of self-accelerated Thompson sampling is O ˜ ( d T ) , O˜(dT), which is the best upper bound achieved by any efficient contextual bandit algorithm in infinite action space. Our experiment on simulated data and real-world dataset shows that self-accelerated Thompson sampling outperforms standard Thompson sampling in both convergence rate and prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) models are effective and efficient in extracting useful knowledge from various types of probabilistic distribution with multi-way information. Current NTF models are mostly designed for problems in computer vision which involve the whole Matricized Tensor Times K h a t r i − R a o Khatri−Rao Product (MTTKRP). Meanwhile, a Sparse NTF (SNTF) proposed to solve the problem of sparse Tensor Factorization (TF) can result in large-scale intermediate data. A Single-thread-based SNTF (SSNTF) model is proposed to solve the problem of non-linear computing and memory overhead caused by large-scale intermediate data. However, the SSNTF is not a generalized model. Furthermore, the above methods cannot describe the stream-like data from industrial applications in mainstream processors, e.g, Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and multi-GPU in an online way. To address these two issues, a Generalized SSNTF (GSSNTF) is proposed, which extends the works of SSNTF to the Euclidean distance , KullbackLeibler (KL)-divergence, and ItakuraSaito (IS)-divergence. The GSSNTF only involves the feature elements instead of the entire factor matrices during its update process, which can avoid the formation of large-scale intermediate matrices with convergence and accuracy promises. Furthermore, GSSNTF can merge the new data into the state-of-the-art built tree dataset for sparse tensor, and then online learning has the promise of the correct data format . At last, a model of Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) parallelizing GSSNTF (CUGSSNTF) is proposed on GPU and Multi-GPU (MCUGSSNTF). Thus, CUGSSNTF has linear computing complexity and space requirement, and linear communication overhead on multi-GPU. CUGSSNTF and MCUGSSNTF are implemented on 8 P100 GPUs in this work, and the experimental results from real-world industrial data sets indicate the linear scalability and 40X speedup performances of CUGSSNTF than the state-of-the-art parallelized approachs.},

The designed adaptive chattering-free controller and the sufficient conditions can be applicable to not only the fixed-time stochastic synchronization of double-layered multi-weighed undirected networks , but also the fixed-time stochastic synchronization of double-layered multi-weighted directed networks.

  abstract     = {Hashing techniques have been widely used for large-scale image retrieval because of its low storage cost and high query speed. Hashing maps similar data onto binary codes with a smaller Hamming distance , which is essentially a discrete optimization problem with constraints. Recently, several discrete hashing methods have begun focusing on minimizing the discrete loss between hash codes and continuous values but ignoring the hidden structure among data points in the original space. Following these efforts, we propose a locality-constrained discrete graph hashing (LCH) method that attempts to minimize the similarity distance of the data points in the original space by softening the hash codes’ hard constraint into two spaces: the discrete constraint space and the bit-balanced, bit-uncorrected constraint space. Furthermore, both spaces maintain the neighbourhood structure of the data points in the original space, and the best hash codes are found by minimizing the similarity distance between the two spaces. This is consistent with the nature of hashing for similarity preservation. Experiments on four real image datasets show that LCH obtains superior search accuracy over state-of-the-art hashing methods .},

The proposed method includes three steps: (1) Key frame extraction using image similarity measurement is performed on the UAV imagery to accelerate the successive object detection procedure; (2) Deep features are extracted by PeleeNet, a lightweight CNN, to achieve the coarse object detection on the key frames; (3) LiteFlowNet and objects prior knowledge is utilized to analyze the deep motion saliency map, which further helps to refine the detection results. The detection results on key frames propagate to the temporally nearest non-key frames to achieve the fine detection. Five experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on Stanford drone dataset (SDD).

The biggest challenge is that datasets from the source and target domains have different distributions, thus the general classification model trained on the source domain can not perform well on the target domain data . The classic methods solve this problem mainly by narrowing the distance between the source and target domains. Those methods, however, is not optimal since the nonlinear feature space may not match the kernel-based learning machine . In this paper, we design a new method called bi-adapt kernel learning (BAKL) to learn a domain-invariant kernel by transferring the source and target domains to each other simultaneously. Specifically, we derive the new source and target domain kernel matrix according to the Mercer’s theorem. The domain-invariant kernel machines are then constructed by minimizing the approximation error between the newly generated kernel matrices and the ground truth source domain kernel matrices. Experiments on benchmark tasks of text and object recognition demonstrate that it significantly improves classification accuracy compared to the state-of-art methods.},

To address this issue, we exploit conditional GAN (CGAN) for SISR, which leverages the ground-truth high-resolution (HR) image as its conditional variable to guide to learn a more stable model . To better reconstruct image with a large-scale factor, we further design an enhanced Laplacian pyramid network (ELapN) as the generator model of CGAN, which progressively reconstructs HR images at multiple pyramid levels. The proposed ELapN fuses low-and high-level features for the residual image learning achieves better generalization than those only based on high-level information. Finally, we train the proposed network via deep supervision using a combination of multi-level CGAN, VGG and robust Charbonnier loss functions to obtain high-quality SR results. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets including Set5, Set14, B100 demonstrate superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM and visual effect.},

In this paper, we propose a robust method for template matching with large angle localization. The basic idea is to iteratively search the corresponding patch-features and updating the template location with rotation transformation. The method firstly employs the intensity centroid to rectify local patches as rotation-invariant features. And then, Best-Buddies Pairs (BBPs) are extracted to find corresponding features between template and target images. To further enhance the robustness against outliers, a robust objective function is presented to register features based on the Maximum Correntropy Criterion and optimized for the transformation with translation and rotation parameters.

To capture the inner correlation between sequential traffic flow data, a novel learning method involving the relevance vector machine is employed for the traffic flow forecasting. To optimise the kernel parameters of the relevance vector machine, a combination of the chaos theory and a simulated annealing algorithm is adopted. The proposed model is verified with the real-world data of six roads in a Minnesotan city. Then, the forecasting results of the new model are compared with those of some state-of-the-art models.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a new representation learning method by learning the discriminative supplementary features to implement semantic attribute augmentation for novel-category image classification . Most of previous methods based on semantic attributes explore the manually defined attributes, which limits their performance and applications. Because the number of manually defined attributes is limited in practice. Besides, these attributes are incomplete and may be not discriminative for image classification . To address the problems, one intuitive solution is to automatically expand the semantic attribute representation. However, it is challenging to guarantee that the supplementary features are more effective and discriminative. Towards this end, we propose a new Discriminative Supplementary Feature Learning (DSFL) method to expand the manually defined attributes by learning discriminative supplementary features. To make the learned features discriminative, the supplementary features and the classifiers for the novel-categories are jointly learned with the column sparsity constraints for the optimal compatibility of the representations and classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves encouraging performance.},

Different from most previous methods that only modeled the spatial connectivity of every region is modeled using k -regular graph, and do not consider the deficiency between multi-layer super pixel segmentations based on manifold ranking, we propose a multi-scale approach. First, we tackle an image from a scale point of view and use a multi-scale approach to analyze saliency cues. Second, through building a graph model which is on the basis of k -regular graph, we connect the nodes belonging to the same cluster and located in the same spatial connected area with edges, to highlight the whole goal more uniformly and evenly, then used manifold ranking to generate multi-layer saliency map. Finally, the final saliency map is got through weighted linear fusion. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate efficiency of the proposed method against the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, affected by occlusions, features in person re-identification cannot be detected and the traditional person re-identification methods can not accurately deal with it. In order to solve this problem, we propose to match query and gallery by combining different modes from two-stream network with sparse reconstruction to realize partial person re-identification. For acquiring features, bilinear pooling is applied to fuse the two different modes from the appearance network and pose network aiming at better performance. For matching query and galley, the robust sparse representation reconstructs the features extracted by the network for flexible solution, using the parameters learned from galley. The reconstruction process achieves arbitrary size images in partial person re-identification. In addition, we extract mid-level feature and fuse it with the high-level feature for more accuracy.

However, the existing general action representations cannot work well to recognize fine-grained actions, which usually share high similarities in both appearance and motion pattern. To solve this problem, we introduce the visual attention mechanism into the proposed descriptor, termed Actionness-pooled Deep-convolutional Descriptor (ADD). Instead of pooling features uniformly from the entire video, we aggregate features in sub-regions that are more likely to contain actions according to actionness maps. This endows ADD with the superior capability of capturing the subtle differences between fine-grained actions. We conduct experiments on HIT Dances dataset, one of the few existing datasets for fine-grained action analysis. Quantitative results have demonstrated that ADD remarkably outperforms traditional CNN-based representations. Extensive experiments on two general action benchmarks, JHMDB and UCF101, have additionally proved that combining ADD with end-to-end ConvNet can further boost the recognition performance. Besides, taking advantage of ADD, we reveal the sparsity characteristic existing in actions and point out a potential direction to design more effective action analysis models by extracting both representative and discriminative action patterns.},

There still lacks an automatic approach to determine the optimal positions of the features to face deformation, and current face deformation methods are incapable of providing fine-grained local geometric characteristics . This paper proposes a novel scheme for face animation in which an active learning method based on Locally Linear Reconstruction algorithm is exploited to determine the optimal feature positions on the face for face deformation, and the Semi-Supervised Local Patch Alignment algorithm is subsequently used to deform the face with the selected features according to the optimal feature positions. The active learning model can be solved by a sequential approach, and the Semi-Supervised Local Patch Alignment model can be addressed by a least-square method. Experimental results on various types of faces demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme to existing approaches in both feature points selection and fine-grained local characteristics preservation.},

To tackle these challenges, in this work, we present a novel pulmonary nodule classification framework via attentive and ensemble 3D Dual Path Networks. Specially, we first devise a contextual attention mechanism to model the contextual correlations among adjacent locations, which improves the representativeness of deep features. Second, we employ a spatial attention mechanism to automatically locate the regions essential for nodule classification. Finally, we employ an ensemble of several models to improve the prediction robustness. Extensive experiments are conducted on the LIDC-IDRI database.

However, it is still difficult for most of the existing CNN-based models to learn and make full use of adequate hierarchical features, which is crucial to ideally recover both high-frequency and low-frequency information. Generally, many networks tend to incorporate numerous parameters aiming to improve their learning capability, which demands more storage and is less applicable to mobile systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for SISR by using a deep fractal residual network (DFRN) composed of a series of fractal blocks containing multiple paths for feature extraction. The fractal blocks learn and combine different hierarchical features to generate finer features favoring the reconstruction of high resolution (HR) images. Moreover, we integrate both local and global residual learning to preserve the low-level features and decrease the difficulty of training. Finally, we propose a weight-sharing version with fewer parameters to reduce the space complexity while keeping comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DFRN has the capability of learning different hierarchical features and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for SISR by reconstructing low resolution (LR) images into the HR images quickly and accurately.},

The network is made up of various residual blocks, and is trained to identify the mapping relationship between an aliased image and a fully-recovered image. Mean square error criterion refined with data-consistency loss is employed to evaluate the ‘distance’ between the network output and ground truth.

  abstract     = {Image super-resolution (SR) techniques improve various remote sensing applications by allowing for finer spatial details than those captured by the original acquisition sensors. Recent advances in deep learning bring a new opportunity for SR by learning the mapping from low to high resolution. The most used convolutional neural networks (CNN) based approaches are prone to excessive smoothing or blurring due to the optimization objective in mean squared error (MSE). Instead, generative adversarial network (GAN) based approaches can achieve more perceptually acceptable results. However, the preliminary design of GANs generator with simple direct- or skip-connection residual blocks compromises its SR potential. Emerging dense convolutional network (DenseNet) equipped with dense connections has shown a promising prospect in classification and super-resolution. An intuitive idea to introduce DenseNet into GAN is expected to boost SR performance. However, because convolutional kernels in the existing residual block are arranged into a one-dimensional flat structure, the formation of dense connections highly relies on skip connections (linking the current layer to all subsequent layers with a shortcut path). In order to increase connection density, the depth of the layer has to be accordingly expanded, which in turn results in training difficulties such as vanishing gradient and information propagation loss . To this end, this paper proposes an ultra-dense GAN (udGAN) for image SR, where we reform the internal layout of the residual block into a two-dimensional matrix topology. This topology can provide additional diagonal connections so that we can still accomplish enough pathways with fewer layers. In particular, the pathways are almost doubled compared to previous dense connections under the same number of layers. The achievable rich connections are flexibly adapted to the diversity of image content, thus leading to improved SR performance. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets and real-world satellite imagery show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in both subjective and quantitative assessments , especially those related to perception.},

  abstract     = {The image acquisition process in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not always provide high resolution results that may be useful for a clinical analysis. Super-resolution (SR) techniques manage to increase the image resolution, being especially effective those based on examples that determine a correspondence between patterns of low resolution and high resolution. Deep learning neural networks have been applied in recent years to estimate this association with very competitive results. In this work, the starting point is a convolutional neuronal network to which a regularly spaced shifting mechanism over the input image is applied, with the aim of substantially improving the quality of the resulting image. This hybrid proposal has been compared with several SR techniques using the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index and Bhattacharyya coefficient metrics. The results obtained on different MR images show a considerable improvement both in the restored image and in the residual image without an excessive increase in computing time.},

Recent works on single image super resolution (SISR) are mostly based on optimizing pixel and content wise similarity between recovered and high-resolution (HR) images and do not benefit from recognizability of semantic classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach using categorical information to tackle the SISR problem; we present an encoder architecture able to extract and use semantic information to super-resolve a given image by using multitask learning , simultaneously for image super-resolution and semantic segmentation . To explore categorical information during training, the proposed decoder only employs one shared deep network for two task-specific output layers. At run-time only layers resulting HR image are used and no segmentation label is required.

  abstract     = {A common issue of deep neural networks-based methods for the problem of Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), is the recovery of finer texture details when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. This issue is particularly related to the choice of the objective loss function. In particular, recent works proposed the use of a VGG loss which consists in minimizing the error between the generated high resolution images and ground-truth in the feature space of a Convolutional Neural Network (VGG19), pre-trained on the very “large” ImageNet dataset. When considering the problem of super-resolving images with a distribution “far” from the ImageNet images distribution ( e.g., satellite images), their proposed fixed VGG loss is no longer relevant. In this paper, we present a general framework named Generative Collaborative Networks (GCN), where the idea consists in optimizing the generator (the mapping of interest) in the feature space of a features extractor network. The two networks (generator and extractor) are collaborative in the sense that the latter “helps” the former, by constructing discriminative and relevant features (not necessarily fixed and possibly learned mutually with the generator). We evaluate the GCN framework in the context of SISR, and we show that it results in a method that is adapted to super-resolution domains that are “far” from the ImageNet domain.},

Existing image deblurring algorithms usually use intensity and gradient priors to alleviate the degree of blurring. However, these methods only consider the changes caused by the blur process in the low intensity range, omitting the changes caused by the blur process in the high and middle part of the intensity range. In this paper, we propose an effective blind image deblurring algorithm based on the three segments of intensity prior, i.e., low, middle and high parts. This work is motivated by the observation that the blur process destroys the sparsity of both ends of intensity, and meanwhile shrinks the distance between the two distinct gray levels. A fast numerical scheme is deployed for alternatingly computing the sharp image and the blur kernel using an image pyramid at the stage of kernel estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world blurred images demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image deblurring methods.},

However, such assumptions are neither practical nor appropriate. In this paper, we address these impractical limitations and propose a multi-task learning framework for the identification and classification of aspect terms in a unified model. At first, the proposed approach employs a BiLSTM followed by a self-attention mechanism to identify the aspect terms in a given sentence. Subsequently, the architecture utilizes a CNN framework to predict the sentiments of the identified aspect terms. We evaluate our proposed approach for the three benchmark datasets across two languages, i.e., English and Hindi. Experimental results suggest that the proposed multi-task model achieves competitive performance with reduced complexity (i.e., a single model for the two tasks compared to two separate models for each task) for both the languages.},

Weak KCF classifiers are constructed via a Lukas-Kanade (LK) method and the preliminary target location is presented as a weighted sum of these classifiers. Specially, a facile weight strategy is implemented to estimate the reliability of each weak classifier .

Traditional loop closure methods execute place recognition by image retrieval with Bag-of-Word model, which forms an orderless representation of local feature descriptors. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based features have been investigated for place recognition, where the final descriptors usually are generated by first-order pooling, limiting the representation ability in challenging scenarios. To handle above issue, we introduce high-order statistics into place recognition by developing a novel adaptively normalized covariance pooling method for learning place representations in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method provides robust covariance matrix estimation of high-dimensional and small-size deep features by adaptive covariance normalization (AdaCN). Experimental results on place recognition in the urban environment and image retrieval tasks show that second-order representation is effective, especially for discriminating places with confusing objects, changes in viewpoint and illumination. Besides, the proposed adaptive normalization performs favorably against its counterparts based on Log-Euclidean Riemannian metric and Power-Euclidean metric, while our method is superior to the state-of-the-art place recognition approaches.},

  abstract     = {Storing and processing millions of parameters in deep neural networks is highly challenging during the deployment of model in real-time application on resource constrained devices. Popular low-rank approximation approach singular value decomposition (SVD) is generally applied to the weights of fully connected layers where compact storage is achieved by keeping only the most prominent components of the decomposed matrices. Years of research on pruning-based neural network model compression revealed that the relative importance or contribution of each neuron in a layer highly vary among each other. Recently, synapses pruning has also demonstrated that having sparse matrices in network architecture achieve lower space and faster computation during inference time. We extend these arguments by proposing that the low-rank decomposition of weight matrices should also consider significance of both input as well as output neurons of a layer. Combining the ideas of sparsity and existence of unequal contributions of neurons towards achieving the target, we propose sparse low rank (SLR) method which sparsifies SVD matrices to achieve better compression rate by keeping lower rank for unimportant neurons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in compressing famous convolutional neural networks based image recognition frameworks which are trained on popular datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach SLR outperforms vanilla truncated SVD and a pruning baseline, achieving better compression rates with minimal or no loss in the accuracy.

We define the metric as a linear combination of a Euclidean distance and an angular metric component. All information about the evolution of the system from the beginning of the time interval is used to support the extension of the reward function, but in addition this data set is enriched by adding some artificially produced states. Thus, the main novelty of our method is the way we produce more states—which we call “dreams”—to enrich learning. Using some known states of the dynamical system that represents the evolution of the financial market, we use our technique to simulate new states by interpolating real states and introducing some random variables.

  abstract     = {In this study, we address the fuzzy multiproduct multistage scheduling problem (FMMSP). The FMMSP with the objective of minimizing makespan is close to practical manufacturing circumstances in terms of the uncertainty in processing time. Backtracking searching algorithm (BSA) is a new proposed meta-algorithm for continuous optimization problems. To solve the FMMSP, an improved discrete BSA, called discrete BSA with local search (DBSA-LS), is developed. The information of the global best solution is incorporated into the mutation process to improve the convergence speed of discrete BSA. A local search related to the FMMSP enhances the exploitation ability of the improved discrete BSA. Left shift operation is applied to improve the solution quality when a hybrid encoding string is decoded into the scheduling scheme. The influence of the key parameter on the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested using different size instances. Sixteen different scales of instances are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed DBSA-LS. Several comparisons are conducted between DBSA-LS and three other algorithms. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed DBSA-LS.},

Convolutional neural network (CNN) based pansharpening has been introduced in some works recently. The represented frameworks often use a multi-layer CNN for fusion of MS and PAN images. Limited number of training samples and the high number of network weights to be determined may cause overfitting problem. To deal with this difficulty, a simple structure comprised from two single layer convolutional networks is proposed in this paper. The shortage of deleted layers is compensated by applying 3D Gabor filters and shearlet transform in addition to nonlinear kernel based principal component analysis.

  abstract     = {Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography, called aEEG clinically, is an effective approach for monitoring neonatal cerebral function. Early aEEG screening is necessary to diagnose neonatal encephalopathy. The electroencephalography (EEG) signal contains lots of information about infant neurological status and prognosis. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis methods pay more attention to process EEG signal data, while doctors referring more to aEEG screening images in clinical diagnosis. In addition, clinical diagnosis of neonatal encephalopathy is a large challenge in low-level medical resource settings where few neonatologists are available to care for those newborns with cerebral disease. As a result, a method of automated diagnosing EEG-related images is requested. This paper presents an automated neonatal encephalopathy diagnosis model for aEEG images, which is divided into two sub-networks. The front part is utilized to extract high-dimensional features from multiple parts of an image. And the second portion aims to accomplish classification. There is a feature combination operator between the two parts. The feature enhancing mechanism can protrude the important region and achieve a better result. The annotated datasets, containing more than 600 aEEG screening images, are established to train and evaluate the novel model. All the annotations in our datasets are verified by case reports. Our proposed method comes up to the performances of professional human neonatologists, which can be applied to clinical diagnosis.},

In practice, the generalization performance and computational burden of PESNs are perturbed by redundant or irrelevant inputs. To construct output weights with a suitable subset of input variables, the forward selection based PESN (FS-PESN) and backward selection based PESN (BS-PESN) are proposed. Firstly, the forward selection method is used in FS-PESN to choose the input variable which incurs the maximum reduction on objective function, and the backward selection shame is introduced in BS-PESN to remove the input variable which leads to the smallest increment on objective function. Then, the iterative updating strategies are designed to avoid repetitive computations in FS-PESN and BS-PESN. Specially, an accelerating scheme is introduced into BS-PESN to simplify training process.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based deep learning models could be used for this problem, but it would require a large number of manual annotated objects for training or fine-tuning. Unfortunately, fine-grained manually annotated objects are not available in many cases. Usually, it is possible to obtain imperfect initialized detections by some weak object detectors using some weak supervisions like the prior knowledge of shape, size or motion. In some real-world applications, objects have little inter-occlusions and split/merge difficulties, so the spatio-temporal consistency in object tracking are well preserved in the image sequences/videos. Starting from the imperfect initialization, this paper proposes a new easy-to-hard learning method to incrementally improve the object detection in image sequences/videos by an unsupervised spatio-temporal analysis which involves more complex examples that are hard for object detection for next-iteration training. The proposed method does not require manual annotations, but uses weak supervisions and spatio-temporal consistency in tracking to simulate the supervisions in the CNN training. Experimental results on three different tasks show significant improvements over the initialized detections by the weak object detectors.},

However, when correlations between nodes are compared after training the networks with or without dropout, one question arises if co-adaptation avoidance explains the dropout effect completely. In this paper, we propose an additional explanation of why dropout works and propose a new technique to design better activation functions . First, we show that dropout can be explained as an optimization technique to push the input towards the saturation area of nonlinear activation function by accelerating gradient information flowing even in the saturation area in backpropagation . Based on this explanation, we propose a new technique for activation functions, gradient acceleration in activation function (GAAF) , that accelerates gradients to flow even in the saturation area. Then, input to the activation function can climb onto the saturation area which makes the network more robust because the model converges on a flat region. Experiment results support our explanation of dropout and confirm that the proposed GAAF technique improves image classification performance with expected properties.},

In this article, we consider sentiment classification for those unstructured features extracted from texts. We propose a regularization-based framework to pursue better classification performance by (1) introducing polarity shifters assembled with sentiment words to create novel bigram features and (2) simultaneously constructing a constraint graph to encode the relative polarity among unstructured features to improve the parameter estimation procedure. Under these settings, our approach can uncover the intrinsic semantic information from the unstructured text data. Theoretically, we justify its underlying equivalent connection with the standard Bayes classifier , which is ideally optimal when the sample distribution is known. Moreover, we show that our new method yields better generalization ability due to the reduced solution search space and the appealing asymptotic consistency.

Emerging solutions are adopted for the neural network compression, e.g., binary/ternary weight network, pruned network and quantized network. Among them, binary neural network (BNN) is believed to be the most hardware-friendly framework due to its small network size and low computational complexity . No existing work has further shrunk the size of BNN. In this work, we explore the redundancy in BNN and build a compact BNN (CBNN) based on the bit-level sensitivity analysis and bit-level data pruning. The input data is converted to a high dimensional bit-sliced format. In the post-training stage, we analyze the impact of different bit slices to the accuracy. By pruning the redundant input bit slices and shrinking the network size, we are able to build a more compact BNN. Our result shows that we can further scale down the network size of the BNN up to 3.9x with no more than 1\% accuracy drop.

Meanwhile, the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is also an open research problem in this context. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, a novel context enhanced approach is proposed with structural optimization and loss function optimization. For loss function optimization, we introduce a hierarchical loss, referring to ``triple loss&#39;&#39; in this paper, to optimize the feature pyramid network (FPN) (Lin et al., 2017) based face detector. Additional layers are only applied during the training process. As a result, the computational cost is the same as FPN during inference. For structural optimization, we propose a context sensitive structure to increase the capacity of the prediction network to improve the accuracy of the output. In details, a three-branch inception subnet (Szegedy et al., 2015) based feature fusion module is employed to refine the original FPN without increasing the computational cost significantly, further improving low-level semantic information, which is originally extracted from a single convolutional layer in the backward pathway of FPN. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE. By using a VGG-16 based detector, experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves a good balance between the accuracy and computational cost of face detection.},

However, in a 24-hour intelligent surveillance system, the visible cameras may be noneffective at night. In this situation, thermal cameras are the best supplemental components, which capture images without depending on visible light. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the visible-thermal cross-modality person re-identification (VT Re-ID) problem. In VT Re-ID, there are two knotty problems should be well handled, cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality variations. To address these two issues, we propose focusing on enhancing the discriminative feature learning (EDFL) with two extremely simple means from two core aspects, (1) skip-connection for mid-level features incorporation to improve the person features with more discriminability and robustness, and (2) dual-modality triplet loss to guide the training procedures by simultaneously considering the cross-modality discrepancy and intra-modality variations. Additionally, the two-stream CNN structure is adopted to learn the multi-modality sharable person features. The experimental results on two datasets show that our proposed EDFL approach distinctly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, demonstrating the effectiveness of our EDFL to enhance the discriminative feature learning for VT Re-ID.},

  abstract     = {Support matrix machine (SMM) is an effective method to solve the problem of mechanical condition monitoring while the matrix is taken as the input. It makes full use of the effective information between rows and columns of the matrix to establish an ideal prediction model and achieve good condition monitoring results. However, Similar to support vector machine (SVM), the core principle of the SMM is to distinguish the data effectively by two parallel hyperplanes . Unfortunately, two parallel hyperplanes may not be able to maximize the interval. Therefore, the concept of interactive support matrix machine (ISMM) is proposed, which constructs a pair of interactive hyperplanes to maximize the interval between two types of data. Interactive hyperplanes may be more able to distinguish between two types of data, so that each hyperplane is as close as to one of the two types and as far away as possible from the other. However, the input of the model often contain noise information, which seriously interferes with the classification results . Therefore, a symplectic interactive support matrix machine (SISMM) method is further proposed, which combines symplectic geometry similarity transformation (SGST) with ISMM. In SISMM, it can directly get the symplectic geometry coefficient matrix without noise from the original signal, and intelligent classification recognition is realized. By analyzing and comparing the signal of roller bearings, the results show that the proposed method has better recognition performance and it is feasible for roller bearing condition monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud based 3D objection plays a crucial role in real-world applications, such as autonomous driving . In this paper, we propose the Multi-view Semantic Learning Network (MVSLN) for 3D object detection , an approach considering the feature discrimination for LIDAR point cloud. Since the discrete and disordered nature of point cloud, most existing methods ignore the low-level information and focus more on the spatial details of point cloud. To capture the discriminative feature of objects, our MVSLN takes advantages of both spatial and low-level details to further exploit semantic information. Specifically, the Multiple Views Generator (MVG) module in our approach observes the scene from four views by projecting the 3D point cloud to planes with specific angles, which preserves much more low-level features, e.g., texture and edge. To correct the deviation brought by different projection angles, the Spatial Recalibration Fusion (SRF) operation in our approach adjusts the locations of features of these four views, enabling the interaction between different projections. Then the recalibrated features of SRF are sent to the developed 3D Region Proposal Network (RPN) to detect objects. The experimental results on challenging KITTI benchmark verify that our approach achieves a promising performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the discriminative feature extractor brought by exploiting the conspicuous semantic information, leads to encouraging results in the hard-level difficulty of both BEV and 3D object detection tasks, without any help of camera image.},

  abstract     = {Quality of life (QoL) is an effective index of well-being, including physical health, aspect of social activity, and mental state of individuals. A new approach that uses a deep-learning architecture to estimate the score of a user&#39;s QoL is presented. This system was built using a combination of a 3D convolutional neural network and a support vector machine for multimodal data. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the estimation system, three experiments were conducted. Before these experiments, ten hours of audio and video data were collected from healthy participants during a natural-language conversation with a conversational agent we implemented. In the first experiment, the QoL question-answer estimation experiment, the accuracy of “Physical functioning,” which is one of the eight scales that constitute QoL, reached 84.0\%. In the second experiment, the QoL-score-regression experiment, in which the scores of each scale were directly estimated, the distribution of the difference between the actual score and the estimated results, known as error, was investigated. These results imply that the features necessary for QoL estimation can be extracted from audio and video data, except for the “Mental Health” domain. One of the reasons why it was difficult to estimate the “Mental Health” scale may be that the learning framework could not extract an appropriate feature for estimation. Therefore, we estimated “Mental Health” by focusing on eye movement. From the result, it was proven that estimation is possible, and the proposed system using multimodal data demonstrated its effectiveness for estimation for all eight scales that constitute QoL and for extracting high-dimensional information regarding the QoL of a human, including their satisfaction level towards daily life and social activities. Finally, suggestions and discussions regarding the plausible behavior of the estimation results were made from the viewpoint of human–agent interaction in the field of elderly welfare.},

  abstract     = {The ever increasing proportion of photovoltaic (PV), which is, in effect, a random and intermittent energy source, makes PV power forecasting increasingly important for power grid stability. Artificial neural networks (ANN) have become one of the commonly utilized methods in PV power prediction. Since there is no ideal theoretical guidance as yet on the determination of the number of hidden layers and hidden units, there are always abundant neurons in traditional neural networks in order to learn as many data characteristics as possible, which often results in overfitting and high computational costs. The dendritic model proposed in recent years has the characteristics of simple structure, fast convergence and better fitting ability. This paper proposes a PV power forecasting model based on the dendritic neuron networks, which seeks to improve the computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. In order to better extract characteristics of different frequencies of the input data, the approach introduces a wavelet transform . Firstly, the data is decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency components via a wavelet transform . Thereafter, the input data of different frequencies obtained by the decomposition are transmitted respectively to different sub-models. Finally, the results of sub-models are reconstructed to obtain the final output. The proposed PV power forecasting model was tested upon actual photovoltaic datasets. Results obtained through simulation demonstrate significant improvement in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

And the data in its cyber layer is often used to solve practical problems in the physical layer through sensors and communicators. But the use of communication data also brings a lot of problems. Among them, the upload interruption problem (i.e., communicator or sensor failure) will make a heavy impact on the system. To improve the voltage and frequency stability of microgrid through secondary control considering data uploading interruption, an improved growing and pruning-radial basis function neural network-based secondary control strategy is designed in this study. The main designs can be summarized as below: (1) When the communicator cannot receive data, a prediction compensation part is designed directly in the corresponding communicator, i.e., the predicted data is used to complete the follow-up works; (2) When the sensor cannot send data, a nonlinear cyber-physical vulnerability assessment part and a neighbor transmission part are designed. In this way, a neighbor sensor is selected to send the interrupted data for the follow-up control process; (3) Based on these designs above, a novel secondary control is designed for microgrid. Finally, the simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

In this paper, a novel improved radial basis function neural network model is proposed and applied in forecasting the short-term solar power generation. A recent proposed meta-heuristic approach named competitive swarm optimization is adopted to train the non-linear and linear parameters of the radial basis function neural network model. The proposed model has been validated in nonlinear benchmark functions and then employed in forecasting the solar power generation of a real-world case study in the Netherlands. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed competitive swarm optimized radial basis function neural network model could obtain higher accuracy compared to other counterparts and thus provides a useful tool for solar power forecasting.},

We consider the scenario that EV owners submit their bids for charging to the charging station, and then charging station determines the winning EVs who are admitted to charge and the payments based on an online continuous progressive second price (OCPSP) auction mechanism. In light of this, how to formulate optimal bidding strategy and maximize the economic benefits is crucial for EV owners. To this end, we propose a Multi-Deep-Q-Network (Multi-DQN) reinforcement learning bidding strategy, in which, a value evaluation network and a target network are proposed for each agent to learn the optimal bidding strategy. The extensive experimental results show that our bidding strategy can achieve better economic benefits and help EV owners spend less time on charging compared to the Q-learning based approach and the random approach.},

In the standard framework for prediction with expert advice, the performance of the learner is measured by means of the cumulative loss. In this paper we consider a generalisation of this setting and discount losses with time. A natural choice of predictors for the probability games is a class of multinomial logistic regression functions as they output a distribution that lies inside a probability simplex. We consider the class of multinomial logistic regressions to be our experts. We provide a strategy that allows us to ‘track the best expert’ of this type and derive the theoretical bound on the discounted loss of the strategy. We provide the kernelized version of our algorithm, which competes with a wider set of experts from Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and prove a theoretical guarantee for the kernelized strategy.

Our approach is to combine data from both sources by applying a co-kriging schema on latent functions, which allows the model to account item-dependent labeling discrepancy. We provide an extension of Laplace inference for Gaussian process classification, that takes into account multi-fidelity data. We evaluate the proposed method on real and synthetic datasets and show that it is more resistant to different levels of discrepancy between sources than other approaches for data fusion. Our method can provide accuracy/cost trade-off for a number of practical tasks such as crowd-sourced data annotation and feasibility regions construction in engineering design.},

  abstract     = {Accessing large, manually annotated audio databases in an effort to create robust models for emotion recognition is a notably difficult task, handicapped by the annotation cost and label ambiguities. On the contrary, there are plenty of publicly available datasets for emotion recognition which are based on facial expressivity due to the prevailing role of computer vision in deep learning research, nowadays. Thereby, in the current work, we performed a study on cross-modal transfer knowledge between audio and facial modalities within the emotional context. More concretely, we investigated whether facial information from videos could be used to boost the awareness and the prediction tracking of emotions in audio signals. Our approach was based on a simple hypothesis: that the emotional state’s content of a person’s oral expression correlates with the corresponding facial expressions. Research in the domain of cognitive psychology was affirmative to our hypothesis and suggests that visual information related to emotions fused with the auditory signal is used from humans in a cross-modal integration schema to better understand emotions. In this regard, a method called dacssGAN (which stands for Domain Adaptation Conditional Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Networks) is introduced in this work, in an effort to bridge these two inherently different domains. Given as input the source domain (visual data) and some conditional information that is based on inductive conformal prediction , the proposed architecture generates data distributions that are as close as possible to the target domain (audio data). Through experimentation, it is shown that classification performance of an expanded dataset using real audio enhanced with generated samples produced using dacssGAN (50.29\% and 48.65\%) outperforms the one obtained merely using real audio samples (49.34\% and 46.90\%) for two publicly available audio–visual emotion datasets.},

In this paper we discuss two computationally efficient versions of conformal predictive systems, which we call split conformal predictive systems and cross-conformal predictive systems.

The technique is hierarchical in nature because it can be performed at multiple significance levels which yields greater insight into the data than performing it at just one level. We describe the theoretical underpinnings of MLCC, compare and contrast it with the hierarchical clustering algorithm, and then apply it to real world datasets to assess its performance. There are several advantages to using MLCC over more classical clustering techniques: Once a significance level has been set, MLCC is able to automatically select the number of clusters. Furthermore, thanks to the conformal prediction framework the resulting clustering model has a clear statistical meaning without any assumptions about the distribution of the data. This statistical robustness also allows us to perform clustering and anomaly detection simultaneously. Moreover, due to the flexibility of the conformal prediction framework, our algorithm can be used on top of many other machine learning algorithms .},

As a novel framework of clustering analysis , penalized clustering bases itself on the sparsity of solution, which contributes to its ability of determining the best number of clusters automatically rather than specified in advance. Moreover, ℓ 1/2 regularization has been recognized extensively in recent studies. Compared with other ℓ p (0 &lt; p &lt; 1) regularization , it can always obtain sparser solution . Motivated by these two points, we propose a ℓ 1/2 -based penalized clustering model, and further transform it into a more general form by introducing the vector comprising pairwise differences between centroids and an auxiliary transfer matrix composed of identity matrixes and null matrixes. Finally, the transformed model is solved by the efficient half thresholding algorithm, which can not only obtain an exact analytic expression of ℓ 1/2 solutions, but also provide an effective parameter selection strategy. We also prove the convergence of the proposed half thresholding algorithm solving ℓ 1/2 -based penalized clustering model. Lastly but not least importantly, benchmark experiments on both synthesis and real data sets from UCI have been conducted to prove the superiority of the proposed method.},

The leaderless time-varying group formation problem is studied first. An observer-based distributed protocol is presented for each agent, where the observer is used to estimate the unmeasurable state utilizing the output information. Then, to broaden the scope of applications, we further study the leader-following case, in which there exists a leader with nonzero and bounded input for each subgroup. To tackle this problem, we take the input of the leader as a disturbance, and develop the new forms of control protocols with nonlinear functions . Furthermore, for both cases, it is shown that under the formation feasible conditions, the desired time-varying group formation can be achieved if the strong enough intra-group coupling is selected and the corresponding digraph of each subgraph contains a directed spanning tree. Finally, two simulation examples are given.},

Automatically debunking these rumor events is important to pursue and restore the truth. However, it is a challenging task to employ traditional classification approaches for rumor events detection since they rely on hand-crafted features that require daunting manual efforts. Besides, we observe that the various posts of each rumor event will debate its realness over time. Different individuals also have different emotional reactions to events, which will affect others’ identification. Thus, this paper firstly employs an automatic construction method to develop a Sentiment Dictionary (SD) to capture the fine-grained human emotional reactions to different events. Secondly, a Two-steps Dynamic Time Series (TsDTS) algorithm, involving the sentimental information in the division process, is elaborated to retain the time-span distribution information of microblog events in a natural manner. At last, a novel two-layer Cascaded Gated Recurrent Unit (CGRU) model based on the SD and the TsDTS algorithm is proposed for rumor events detection, named as SD-TsDTS-CGRU. Experimental results on real datasets from OSNs demonstrate that our proposed SD-TsDTS-CGRU model outperforms the latest rumor events detection algorithms .},

Although numerous advanced methods that learn object appearance by conventional machine learning models have been discussed in the last decade, most of them are strongly sensitive to scene background motion. In this research, we address the drawbacks of existing works by comprehensively studying gait information from 3D human skeleton data with a deep learning-based identifier. To capture the statistic gait information in the spatial dimension, we first extract the geometric gait features of joint distance and orientation. The dynamic gait information is then obtained by calculating the temporal description features with the mean and standard deviation of geometric features. Accordingly, the fully gait information of an individual is finally learned via a compact Deep Convolutional Neural Network which is explicitly designed with multiple stacks of asymmetric convolutional filters to fully gain the spatial correlation of in-frame body joints and the temporal relation of frame-wise posture at multiple scales. Based on the experimental results evaluated on four benchmark 3D gait datasets commonly used for person identification, including UPCV Gait, UPCV Gait K2, KS20 VisLab Multi-View Kinect Skeleton, and SDUGait, the proposed method presents the superior performance over that of several state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a low computational capacity.},

A novel consensus tracking method combined the adaptive neural control with the finite-time command filtered backstepping is proposed. During each backstepping process, the Radical Basis Function Neural Network (RBF NN) is used to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics and the finite-time sliding mode differentiator (FTSMD) is used to obtain intermediate signals and their derivative. Moreover, the filtering errors are eliminated by using error compensation signals. By using the finite-time Lyapunov stability theory , it can be proved that the bipartite consensus tracking errors can converge to a sufficient small region of the origin in finite-time and all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded in finite-time although there exists the input saturation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by simulation results.},

Using these inaccurate measurements, a distributed formation control laws is developed for each mobile agent . It is shown that under the proposed control law the multi-agent system can be driven to a neighborhood of the desired circle formation. The upper bound on the agents’ formation errors in the final configuration is also provided. Note that collision between mobile agents can be prevented if the agents’ spatial order on the circle is always preserved.

A novel approach called sampling time unit (STU) approach is proposed to study such system. In such approach, the work time is described by finite number of sampling time units and the rest time is describe by several average time units. The lengths of work time and rest time depend on the convergence or divergence property of each time unit. Based on the STU approach, the stabilization property at transition instants can be derived, which can compensate the divergence during rest time to some extents. The designed control scheme can tolerate a relatively large rest time. Based on the STU approach, a corresponding sampling-dependent time-varying Lyapunov function (SDTVLF) is utilized to describe the system state and derive the computable conditions for the overall consensus with maximum admissible rest time. Finally, a numerical example with two cases is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the theoretical results.},

Previous approaches to the problem have considered either the progressive increase in the size of the networks, or have tried to regularize the network behavior to equalize it with respect to previously observed tasks. In the latter case, it is essential to understand what type of information best represents this past behavior . Common techniques include regularizing the past outputs, gradients, or individual weights. In this work, we propose a new, relatively simple and efficient method to perform continual learning by regularizing instead the network internal embeddings. To make the approach scalable, we also propose a dynamic sampling strategy to reduce the memory footprint of the required external storage. We show that our method performs favorably with respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, while requiring significantly less space in memory and computational time. In addition, inspired by to recent works, we evaluate the impact of selecting a more flexible model for the activation functions inside the network, evaluating the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the activation functions themselves.},

A third adaption branch is designed to adaptively recalibrate the pathway-wise responses by discovering and modeling the dynamic scenarios implicitly.

To improve the graph classification accuracy , we propose a feature reduction algorithm based on semantic similarity for graph classification in this paper. In the algorithm, we first learn vector representations of subtree patterns using neural language models and then merge semantically similar subtree patterns into a new feature. We then provide a new feature discrimination score to select highly discriminative features .

Instead, we design a uniform under-sampling strategy and explore the potential of modeling the MRI data directly in the measured Fourier domain. We propose a dual-domain deep lattice network (DD-DLN) for CS-MRI with variable density uniform under-sampling. We train the networks to learn the mapping between both image and frequency domains. We observe the dual networks have complementary advantages, which motivates their combination via a lattice structure. Experiments show that the proposed DD-DLN model provides promising performance in CS-MRI under the designed variable density uniform under-sampling.},

To constraint the output tracking error within a predefined boundary in finite time, a modified performance function, i.e., finite-time performance function, is introduced. During the process of controller design, the dynamic surface control is employed to handle the ‘explosion of complexity’ problem occurred in the conventional backstepping method. According to the approximation of radial basis functions neural networks , an adaptive neural control scheme is developed which guarantees that the output tracking error is preserved within a specified prescribed performance and all the signals in closed-loop system are bounded by appropriately choosing the design parameters.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of image acquisition and storage, multiple images per class are commonly available for computer vision tasks (e.g., face recognition, object detection, medical imaging, etc.). Recently, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been widely integrated with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform image classification on ordered (sequential) data. In this paper, by permutating multiple images as multiple dummy orders, we generalize the ordered “RNN+CNN” design (longitudinal) to a novel unordered fashion, called Multi-path x-D Recurrent Neural Network (MxDRNN) for image classification. To the best of our knowledge, few (if any) existing studies have deployed the RNN framework to unordered intra-class images to leverage classification performance. Specifically, multiple learning paths are introduced in the MxDRNN to extract discriminative features by permutating input dummy orders. Eight datasets from five different fields (MNIST, 3D-MNIST, CIFAR, VGGFace2, and lung screening computed tomography) are included to evaluate the performance of our method. The proposed MxDRNN improves the baseline performance by a large margin across the different application fields (e.g., accuracy from 46.40\% to 76.54\% in VGGFace2 test pose set, AUC from 0.7418 to 0.8162 in NLST lung dataset). Additionally, empirical experiments show the MxDRNN is more robust to category-irrelevant attributes (e.g., expression, pose in face images), which may introduce difficulties for image classification and algorithm generalizability. The code is publicly available.},

  abstract     = {The deep neural network model based on spatial pyramid pooling for multi-scale context information has been widely adopted in image semantic segmentation . However, this structure reduces the feature resolution during the inference process, which should be recovered by bilinear interpolation . We find that the performance of boundary location heavily depends on the interpolation operation. Assuming that the foreground object has a boundary with uneven curvature changes, it will be difficult to preserve details in the lower resolution feature map. In this case, if the model achieves near-optimal fitting, the prediction of the boundary point needs to satisfy strict constraints. But this condition is very difficult to meet for the model. For this purpose, we propose a constraint balance factor (CBF) relaxation method to improve the fitting ability of the model. The constraint balance factor is learned end-to-end by a sub-network. This sub-network can be easily embedded into a semantic segmentation network that requires interpolation without too many extra parameter increments. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed CBFNet performs well on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets.},

  abstract     = {Time series forecasting is a challenging task as the underlying data generating process is dynamic, nonlinear, and uncertain. Deep learning such as LSTM and auto-encoder can learn representations automatically and has attracted considerable attention in time series forecasting. However, current approaches mainly focus on point estimation, which leads to the inability to quantify uncertainty. Meantime, existing deep uncertainty quantification methods suffer from various limitations in practice. To this end, this paper presents a novel end-to-end framework called deep prediction interval and point estimation (DeepPIPE) that simultaneously performs multi-step point estimation and uncertainty quantification for time series forecasting. The merits of this approach are threefold: first, it requires no prior assumption on the distribution of data noise; second, it utilizes a novel hybrid loss function that improves the accuracy and stability of forecasting; third, it is only optimized by back-propagation algorithm, which is time friendly and easy to be implemented.

  abstract     = {A large number of Android malware samples can be deployed as the variants of the previously known samples. In consequence, a classification system capable of supporting a large set of samples is required to secure Android platform. Although a large set of variants requires scalability for automatic detection and classification, it also presents a significant advantage about a richer dataset at the stage of discovering underlying malicious activities and extracting representative features. Deep Neural Networks are built by a complex structure of layers whose parameters can be tuned and trained in order to enhance classification statistical metric results. Emerging parallelization computing tools and processors reduce computation time. In this paper, we propose a deep learning Android malware detection method using features extracted from instruction call graphs. The presented method examines all possible execution paths and the balanced dataset improves deep neural learning benign execution paths versus malicious paths. Since there is not a publicly available model for Android malware detection , we train deep networks from scratch. Then, we apply a grid search method to seek the optimal parameters of the network and to discover the combination of the hyper-parameters, which maximizes the statistical metric values. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate with a balanced dataset constituted by 24,650 malicious and 25,000 benign samples. We evaluate the deep network architecture with respect to different parameters and compare the statistical metric values including runtime with respect to baseline classifiers. Our experimental results show that the presented malware detection is reached at 91.42\% level in accuracy and 91.91\% in F-measure, respectively.},

But it is still not very clear yet how they can be best deployed in real world applications. As a step in this direction, we propose a deep learning-based approach for efficiently training a humanoid robot to play multimodal games—and use the game of ‘Noughts and Crosses’ with two variants as a case study. Its minimum requirements for learning to perceive and interact are based on a few hundred example images, a few example multimodal dialogues and physical demonstrations of robot manipulation, and automatic simulations. In addition, we propose novel algorithms for robust visual game tracking and for competitive policy learning with high winning rates, which substantially outperform DQN-based baselines. While an automatic evaluation shows evidence that the proposed approach can be easily extended to new games with competitive robot behaviours , a human evaluation with 130 humans playing with the Pepper robot confirms that highly accurate visual perception is required for successful game play.},

  abstract     = {The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG), a non-invasive measure of brain&#39;s electrical activity, is commonly used ancillary test to aide in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Usually, neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. Therefore, electroencephalograms have been an essential integral to the researches which aim to automatically detect epilepsy. However, it is difficult because seizure manifestations on scalp EEG are extremely variable between patients, even the same patient. In addition, scalp EEG is usually composed of large number of noise signals which might cover the real features of seizure. To this challenge, we construct an 18-layer Long-Term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN) to automatic epileptogenic zone recognition and localization on scalp EEG. As far as we know, we are the first to train a deep learning classifier to identify seizures through the EEG images, just like neurologists direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. Furthermore, unlike the traditionally methods extracted features from channels manually, which neglected the association of brain&#39;s epileptiform abnormalities electrical transmission, seizures is considered as a continuous brain&#39;s abnormal electrical activity in our algorithm, from produce at one or several channels, transmission between channels, to flat again after seizures. The method was evaluated in 23 patients with a total of 198 seizures. The classifier shows reasonably good results, with 84\% for sensitivity, 99\% for specificity, and 99\% for accuracy. False Positive Rate per hours exceeds significantly previous results obtained on cross-patient classifiers, with 0.2/h.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an automatic visual inspection method for the fracture detection of clevises in the catenary systems of high-speed railways, using images of catenaries captured by an inspection vehicle. First, the clevises are extracted from the catenary image using a convolutional neural network based algorithm, known as the faster region-based convolutional neural network . Because the structure of catenary systems does not have many variations and the contextual information near a catenary fitting may have strong correlation with its category, the architecture of the original faster region-based convolutional neural network is modified to make use of the contextual information of the regions of interest in the images for object recognition. A crack detection process is then used to recognize the fractures of clevises. To detect the cracks, the edge map of the clevis sub-image is generated using a region-scalable fitting model. Areas where the cracks are most likely to occur are projected from a standard clevis image to the clevis sub-image by shape context matching and affine transformation matrix computation. The cracks are then recognized by calculating the wavelet entropy inside these areas followed by morphological filtering. Experimental results show that the modified faster region-based convolutional neural network architecture achieves better results in clevis extraction than the original architecture as well as some other state-of-art object detection models. The detection is not affected by the scaling, texture and grayscale changes of the clevises caused by the variation of shooting distance, shooting angle and illumination variations . The fractures of the clevises can be accurately and reliably detected using the fracture detection method proposed in this paper and the performance of this visual inspection method meets the strict requirements for catenary system maintenance.},

BNNs are trained using regular gradient descent but are harder to optimise, take longer to train and generally require a more careful tuning of hyperparameters such as the learning rate decay schedule than floating point versions. We propose to use Knowledge Transfer techniques to make it easier to train BNNs. Knowledge transfer is a general technique that tries to transfer the knowledge stored in a large network (the teacher) to a smaller (student) network. In our case the teacher is a network trained with floating point weights and activations while the student is a BNN. We apply different Knowledge Transfer techniques to the task of training a BNN. We introduce a novel similarity based Knowledge Transfer algorithm and show that this technique results in a higher test accuracy on different benchmark datasets compared to training the BNN from scratch.},

The approach is based on multi-task deep neural networks that perform automatic detection of the anterior commissures (AC) and posterior commissures (PC) in the sagittal images, and automatic determination of the symmetry line in the axial images. The proposed multi-task learning architecture solves the tasks of point and angle detection simultaneously by exploiting the commonalities and differences across these tasks. This results in improved learning efficiency and prediction accuracy for the task-specific models, when compared to training individual models separately. After deriving the AC-PC line and symmetry line on the sagittal image and axial image, respectively, the corresponding scan coverage is then determined by using an image processing approach. Based on a study using a small-sized MR brain image dataset, three benefits are observed: Firstly, our proposed approach was able to perform the task well despite limited availability of training data. This is an advantage in view of the fact that training of single task models will typically encounter difficulty in convergence using a small training set. Secondly, it achieves better performance for landmarks detection in terms of smaller position and angulation shifts between the predicted results and the ground truth. Lastly, the inference can be performed faster since the two tasks are solved simultaneously using only one model.},

In the last few decades various data based machine learning algorithms have been widely studied to monitor machine condition and detect process faults. However, the faulty datasets in industrial process are hard to acquire. Thus low-data of faulty data or imbalanced data distributions are common to see in industrial processes, resulting in the difficulty to accurately identify different faults for many algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) based data augmentation approaches are researched to generate data samples to supplement low-data input set in fault diagnosis field and help improve the fault diagnosis accuracies. To verify its efficient, various classifiers are used and three industrial benchmark datasets are involved to evaluate the performance of GAN based data augmentation ability. The results show the fault diagnosis accuracies for classifiers are increased in all datasets after employing the GAN-based data augmentation techniques.},

Challenging landmarks are focused firstly, and each cluster of landmarks is further optimized respectively. Moreover, to reduce the model complexity, we propose a model assembling method to integrate multiple shape prediction layers into one shape prediction layer.

  abstract     = {In this paper we present a diabetic retinopathy deep learning interpretable classifier. On one hand, it classifies retina images into different levels of severity with good performance. On the other hand, this classifier is able of explaining the classification results by assigning a score for each point in the hidden and input spaces. These scores indicate the pixel contribution to the final classification. To obtain these scores, we propose a new pixel-wise score propagation model that for every neuron, divides the observed output score into two components. With this method, the generated visual maps can be easily interpreted by an ophthalmologist in order to find the underlying statistical regularities that help to the diagnosis of this eye disease .},

  abstract     = {The automatic detection and recognition of human activities are valuable for physical security, gaming, and intelligent interface. Compared to an optical recognition system, radar is more robust to variations in lighting conditions and occlusions. The centimeter-wave ultra-wideband radar can even track human motion when the target is fully occluded from it. In this work, we propose a neural network architecture, namely segmented convolutional gated recurrent neural network (SCGRNN), to recognize human activities based on micro-Doppler spectrograms measured by the ultra-wideband radar. Unlike most existing approaches which treat the micro-Doppler spectrograms the same way as natural images, we extract segmented features of spectrograms via convolution operation and encode the feature maps along the time axis with gated recurrent units . Taking advantage of regularities in both the time and Doppler frequency domains in this way, our model can detect activities with arbitrary lengths. The experiments show that our method outperforms existing models in fine temporal resolution, noise robustness, and generalization performance . The radar system can thus recognize human behavior when visible light is blocked by opaque objects.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a deep learning based multitask learning (MTL) model to predict network-wide traffic speed, and introduces two methods to improve the prediction performance. The nonlinear Granger causality analysis is used to detect the spatiotemporal causal relationship among various links so as to select the most informative features for the MTL model. Bayesian optimization is employed to tune the hyperparameters of the MTL model with limited computational costs. Numerical experiments are carried out with taxis’ GPS data in an urban road network of Changsha, China, and some conclusions are drawn as follows. The deep learning based MTL model outperforms four deep learning based single task learning (STL) models (i.e., Gated Recurrent Units network, Long Short-term Memory network, Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units network and Temporal Convolutional Network) and three other classic models (i.e., Support Vector Machine , k -Nearest Neighbors and Evolving Fuzzy Neural Network). The nonlinear Granger causality test provides a reliable guide to select the informative features from network-wide links for the MTL model. Compared with two other optimization approaches (i.e., grid search and random search), Bayesian optimization yields a better tuning performance for the MTL model in the prediction accuracy under the budgeted computation cost. In summary, the deep learning based MTL model with nonlinear Granger causality analysis and Bayesian optimization promises the accurate and efficient traffic speed prediction for a large-scale network.},

In this paper, an integration strategy of data-driven and deep learning-based method is proposed to deal with incipient faults. The salient advantages of the proposed method can be summarized as: (1) The moving average technique is firstly introduced into the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) framework, which makes the new residual signals more sensitive to incipient faults than the traditional CCA-based method; (2) Based on the defined residual signals , the new test statistics cooperating closely with Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) are proposed from the probability viewpoint, which can greatly improve the fault detectability; (3) It is of high computational efficiency because the estimation of probability density functions of residual signals is skilly avoided; (4) Based on the new developed test statistics, the fault matrices are defined and regarded as the input of convolutional neural network (CNN) whose feature extraction ability is highly improved compared with the traditional method, which helps to accurately diagnose of incipient faults; (5) The proposed method can be implemented without any priori knowledge on system information.

  abstract     = {Device-free localization (DFL) is becoming one of the new techniques in wireless localization field, due to its advantage that the target to be localized does not need to attach any electronic device. One of the key issues of DFL is how to characterize the influence of the target on the wireless links , such that the target’s location can be accurately estimated by analyzing the changes of the signals of the links. Most of the existing related research works usually extract the useful information from the links through manual approaches, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Deep learning approaches have attempted to automatically extract the useful information from the links, but the training of the conventional deep learning approaches are time-consuming, because a large number of parameters need to be fine-tuned multiple times. Motivated by the fast learning speed and excellent generalization performance of extreme learning machine (ELM), which is an emerging training approach for generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), this paper proposes a novel hierarchical ELM based on deep learning theory, named multilayer probability ELM (MP-ELM), for automatically extracting the useful information from the links, and implementing fast and accurate DFL. The proposed MP-ELM is stacked by ELM autoencoders , so it also keeps the very fast learning speed of ELM. In addition, considering the uncertainty and redundant links existing in DFL, MP-ELM outputs the probabilistic estimation of the target’s location instead of the deterministic output. The validity of the proposed MP-ELM-based DFL is evaluated both in the indoor and the outdoor environments, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MP-ELM can obtain better performance compared with classic ELM, multilayer ELM (ML-ELM), hierarchical ELM (H-ELM), deep belief network (DBN), and deep Boltzmann machine (DBM).},

To construct accurate soft sensors, it is significant to carry out feature extraction for massive high-dimensional process data. Recently, deep learning has been introduced for feature representation in process data modeling . However, most of them cannot capture deep quality-related features for output prediction. In this paper, a hybrid variable-wise weighted stacked autoencoder (HVW-SAE) is developed to learn quality-related features for soft sensor modeling. By measuring the linear Pearson and nonlinear Spearman correlations for variables at the input layer with the quality variable at each encoder, a corresponding weighted reconstruction objective function is designed to successively pretrain the deep networks. With the constraint of preferential reconstruction for more quality-related variables, it can ensure that the learned features contain more information for quality prediction. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed HVW-SAE based soft sensor method is validated on an industrial debutanizer column process.},

  abstract     = {Built-up area is one of the most important objects of remote sensing images analysis, therefore extracting built-up area from remote sensing image automatically has attracted wide attention. It is common to treat built-up area extraction as image segmentation task. However, it&#39;s hard to devise a handcrafted feature to describe built-up area since it contains many non-built-up elements, such as trees, grasslands, and small ponds. Besides, built-up area corresponds to large size local region without precise boundary in remote sensing image so that the precision of segmentation in pixel level is not reliable. To cope with the problem of built-up area extraction, a segmentation framework based on deep feature learning and graph model is proposed. The segmentation procedure comprises of three steps. Firstly, the image is divided into small patches whose deep features are extracted by the devised lightweight multi-branch convolutional neural network (LMB-CNN). Secondly, a patch-wise graph model is constructed according to the learnt features, and then is optimized to segment built-up area with patch-level precision in full frame of remote sensing image. At last, post-processing step is also adopted to make the segmentation result visually intact. The experiments verify that the proposed method shows excellent performance by achieving high overall accuracy over 98.6\% on Gaofen-2 remote sensing image data with size of 10,240 × 10,240.},

We show that this arrangement is an efficient way to significantly reduce the number of parameters while at the same time improving the performance. The use of branches brings an additional form of regularization . In addition to splitting the parameters into parallel branches, we propose a tighter coupling of these branches by averaging their log-probabilities. The tighter coupling favours the learning of better representations, even at the level of the individual branches, as compared to when each branch is trained independently. We refer to this branched architecture as “coupled ensembles”. The approach is generic and can be applied to almost any neural network architecture. With coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC and parameter budget of 25 M, we obtain error rates of 2.92\%, 15.68\% and 1.50\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN, respectively. For the same parameter budget, DenseNet-BC has an error rate of 3.46\%, 17.18\%, and 1.8\%, respectively.

  abstract     = {Recurrent Neural Networks such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are often deployed as neural network-based predictors for time series data . Recently, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a machine learning technology attempting to simulate the human brain’s neocortex, has been proposed as another approach to time series data prediction. While HTM has gained a lot of attention, little is known about the actual performance compared to the more common RNNs. The only performance comparison between the two, performed at the company behind HTM, shows they perform similarly. In this article, we present a more in-depth performance comparison, involving more extensive hyperparameter tuning and evaluation on more scenarios. Surprisingly, our results show that both LSTM and GRUs can outperform HTM by over 30\% at lower runtime. Furthermore, we show that HTM requires explicitly timestamped data to recognize daily and weekly patterns, while LSTM only needs the raw sequential data to predict such time series accurately. Finally, our experiments indicate that the temporally aware components of all considered predictors contribute nothing to the prediction accuracy. We further strengthen this claim by presenting equally or better performing Multilayer Perceptrons conceptually similar to the HTM and LSTM, disregarding their temporal aspects.},

  abstract     = {Generating high fidelity identity-preserving faces with different facial attributes has a wide range of applications. Although a number of generative models have been developed to tackle this problem, there is still much room for further improvement. In particular, the current solutions usually ignore the perceptual information of images, which we argue that it benefits the output of a high-quality image while preserving the identity information, especially in facial attributes learning area. To this end, we propose to train GAN iteratively via regularizing the min-max process with an integrated loss, which includes not only the per-pixel loss but also the perceptual loss. In contrast to the existing methods only deal with either image generation or transformation, our proposed iterative architecture can achieve both of them. Experiments on the multi-label facial dataset CelebA demonstrate that the proposed model has excellent performance on recognizing multiple attributes, generating a high-quality image, and transforming image with controllable attributes.},

First, the NSCT-based coefficients of natural RGB-channel images are extracted, which are capable of capturing the statistical properties of each channel. In addition, the proposed feature descriptor is equipped with the mean–max-pooling strategy according to the characteristics of the correlated coefficients. Then, the CNN is concatenated to exaggerate the discriminative parts of the primary features. With these advantages, the proposed RGB-channel NSCT–CNN should, in general, improve the corresponding CNN-based image classification methods. Using the Food-101 and SUN Datasets, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art classification results that are also significant for object detection. In addition, the proposed method can achieve better or comparable accuracy compared to other related methods based on these two datasets.},

A good approach should be able to: (1) discover discriminative local details and (2) align and aggregate these local discriminative patch-level features in an effective manner to facilitate object-level classification. Toward this end, we develop a two-stage framework for fine-grained recognition. In our framework, the first stage aims to discover and align local discriminative features , and the second stage aims to aggregate these features to get classification results . In the first stage, we propose two methods to sequentially discover informative regions. In the second stage, we progressively feed these discovered and aligned regions into a recurrent neural network to obtain object-level representation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three fine-grained image benchmarks, and the results verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

Numerous studies, both empirically and theoretically, show that choosing suitable structure can improve the performance of DBN. In this paper, a self-organizing DBN (S-DBN), based on the information relevance strategy (IRS), was proposed to design the structure of DBN. For this IRS, the maximal information coefficient was designed to measure the input and output information relevance of hidden neurons. Meanwhile, the mutual information was introduced to measure the information relevance among the hidden layers. Then, a novel self-organizing strategy was developed to grow and prune both the hidden neurons and layers during the training process. Moreover, a contrastive divergence algorithm was used to adjust the parameters of S-DBN. Finally, several benchmark problems were used to illustrate the effectiveness of S-DBN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed S-DBN owns better performance for classification problems and modeling nonlinear systems than some existing methods.},

The central problem addressed is how several agents can collectively learn to coordinate their actions such that they complete a given task together without conflicts. However, sequential decision-making under uncertainty is one of the most challenging issues for intelligent cooperative systems . To address this, we propose a multi-agent concurrent framework where agents learn coordinated behaviors in order to divide their areas of responsibility. The proposed framework is an extension of some recent deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as DQN, double DQN, and dueling network architectures . Then, we investigate how the learned behaviors change according to the dynamics of the environment, reward scheme, and network structures. Next, we show how agents behave and choose their actions such that the resulting joint actions are optimal. We finally show that our method can lead to stable solutions in our specific environment.},

In this work, we present an extended version of the LSTM units named C 2 LSTM in which the motion data are perceived as well as the spatial features and temporal dependencies. We leverage convolution and correlation operators to credit both the spatial and motion structure of the video data.

This paper presents a framework called PSO NTM that improves the accuracy of NTM using the LSTM deep neural network as the controller, and implements a complex classification task along with available tasks. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is also applied in order to control the weights. The classifier task is compared with the basic SVM , KNN, Naïve Bayesian , and Decision Tree classification methods on MNIST, ORL, letter recognition, and ionosphere datasets. The accuracy of the proposed classification tasks is 99.73\%, 97.9\%, 99.02\%, and 97.1\%, respectively. That means the NTM classification task improved Naïve Bayesian 43.57\%, Decision Tree 15.6\%, and KNN 19.22\% on average. In addition, the presented framework improves the available NTM tasks as well.},

In this paper, we put forward a deep cross-modal hashing approach, dubbed semantic deep cross-modal hashing (SDCH). It can make effective use of semantic label information and generate more discriminative hash codes. Specifically, it utilizes the semantic label branches to improve the feature learning part, which can preserve semantic information of the learned features and keep the invariability of cross-modal data. Furthermore, it employs the hash codes learning branches to maintain the consistency of hash codes between different modalities in the Hamming space. Besides, it adopts inter-modal pairwise loss, cross-entropy loss and quantization loss to ensure that the ranking relevance of all similar instance pairs is higher than that of dissimilar ones. Compared to the most advanced method, attention-aware deep adversarial hashing (AADAH), SDCH averagely improves 6.14\%, 4.84\%, and 3.75\% on three widely used datasets, IAPR TC-12, MIR-Flickr 25k, and NUS-WIDE, respectively.},

However, the reconstructed 3D maps of these methods are extremely sparse. On the other hand, deep learning is widely used to predict dense depth maps from single-view color images, but the results are subject to blurry depth boundaries, which severely deform the structure of 3D scene . Therefore, this paper proposes a dense reconstruction method under the monocular SLAM framework (DRM-SLAM), in which a novel scene depth fusion scheme is designed to fully utilize both the sparse depth samples from monocular SLAM and predicted dense depth maps from convolutional neural network (CNN). In the scheme, a CNN architecture is carefully designed for robust depth estimation. Besides, our approach also accounts for the problem of scale ambiguity existing in the monocular SLAM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and our captured dataset demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed DRM-SLAM. The evaluation of runtime and adaptability under challenging environments also verify the practicability of our method.},

They utilize point distribution models (PDMs) in which a priori information is encoded into a template so that the objects to be detected can be represented with a fixed topology. One key element in 3D-ASM is the image intensity model (IIM), which is investigated in this work. We propose a hybrid approach to automatically construct 3D-ASM Intensity Models for the left ventricle. To train the IIM, CNN is adopted to obtain the initial shape for 3D-ASM, distance maps for endo and epicardial contours from ground truth are derived, and using PDM, training shapes can be obtained. The training shapes and cardiac images are then used to train an IIM. 1200 cardiac MRI cases from Hubei Cancer Hospital were used in this study. By comparing point-to-surface errors against a proper gold standard, it demonstrates that large-scale cardiac MRIs can be segmented by 3D models trained under this scheme with fair accuracy. Clinical parameters are calculated using the Bland-Altman analysis, and thus we yield biases of 4.8 ml, 2.19 ml, 2.59 ml, 0.96\%, 0.69 g and –2.67 g for LVEDV (LV End-diastolic Volume), LVESV (LV End-systolic Volume), LVSV (LV Stroke volume), LVEF (LV Ejection Fraction), LVM-DP (LV mass in diastolic phase) and LVM-SP (LV mass in systolic phase), respectively.},

By means of this algorithm, all NNs in an NNE can be trained simultaneously. In particular, the proposed algorithm is named adaptive niching differential evolution (ANDE), which is characterized by a heuristic clustering method to enable iteratively cluster subpopulations that track and locate multiple optima, a parameter adaptation strategy to adaptively adjust parameters according to the subpopulation states, and an auxiliary movement scheme to promote the equilibrium between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed ANDE on the benchmark test suite of multimodal optimization.

A large number of GAN-based encoder-decoder methods have been proposed for image transformation, inspired by the pix2pix model; however, these methods do not produce satisfactory results for photo generation, due to the fact that (1) they miss detailed information of input images because of a single-scale convolution operator in the shallow encoder layers, and (2) they fail to learn long-range dependencies in the deep encoder layers. To better handle these challenges, we present an approach that follows a “divide and conquer” strategy. Our method combines the advantages of a multi-scale convolutional neural network and an attention mechanism and applies these two modules to different encoder layers. Additionally, by optimizing a well-designed loss function, the complex correlations between the sketch and the photo can be calculated. Experimental results show that our method is able to generate high-quality photos from sketch images, and qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority over state-of-the-art models.

We also propose an iterative guidance loss for the perception operation to guide perceptual encoding features approaching to ground-truth encoding features. The guidance-enhanced perceptual encoding features are transferred to the decoder through skip connections, mutually reinforcing the entire encoder–decoder performance. Since the inpainting task involves different levels of feature representations, we further apply atrous separable parallel-convolutions (i.e., atrous separable pyramid-convolutions or ASPC) with different receptive fields in the last guidance-enhanced perceptual encoding feature, which is used to learn high-level semantic features with multi-scale information.

Recently, great progresses has been achieved in this area due to the fabulous ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Existing deep approaches try to train CNNs from a large set of photos with score annotations. However, the considerable cost in collecting score annotations limits the generalization of these approaches to other types of media. To combat this limitation, we propose a novel photo aesthetic rating architecture. Our method comprises three modules: a CNN based feature extractor, a style classifier, and a group of style-specific aesthetic prediction models. First, we propose to train a CNN in the standard binary aesthetic classification task and use it to extract aesthetic-aware features, because binary labels are easy to access. Afterwards, we use a support vector machine (SVM) to formulate the style classifier. Besides, we explored a multi-task learning (MTL) approach to jointly learn the style-specific rating models, which will further improve the generalization ability . Additionally, to address the imbalance in the distribution of styles and ratings, we adopted the strategy of data augmentation and selective sampling. Finally, we estimate the rating of an input photo by combining the estimates of the style-specific rating models according to the outputs of the style classifier. Experiments conducted on the AVA database show that the proposed method is considerably comparative to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Fashion compatibility is a subjective sense of human for relationships between fashion items, which is essential for fashion recommendation. Recently, it increasingly attracts more and more attentions and has become a very hot research topic. Learning fashion compatibility is a challenging task, since it needs to consider plenty of factors about fashion items, such as color, texture, style and functionality. Unlike low-level visual compatibility (e.g., color, texture), high-level semantic compatibility (e.g., style, functionality) cannot be handled purely based on fashion images. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework to learn fashion compatibility, which simultaneously integrates both semantic and visual embeddings into a unified deep learning model . For semantic embeddings , a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is employed for discriminative semantic representation learning , while a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for visual embeddings. A fusion module is then constructed to combine semantic and visual information of fashion items, which equivalently transforms semantic and visual spaces into a latent feature space. Furthermore, a new triplet ranking loss with compatible weights is introduced to measure fine-grained relationships between fashion items, which is more consistent with human feelings on fashion compatibility in reality. Extensive experiments conducted on Amazon fashion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for learning fashion compatibility, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, we propose Concept Conjunction Recurrent Neural Network (C 2 RNN) to tackle this problem. With our model, visual concepts involved in a conjunction are mapped into the hidden units and combined in a recurrent way to generate the representation of the concept conjunction, which is then used to compute a concept conjunction classifier as the output. We also present an order invariant version of the proposed method based on attention mechanism to learn the tasks without pre-defined concept order. To tackle concept conjunction learning from multiple semantic domains , we introduce a multiplicative framework to learn the joint representation. Experimental results on multi-attribute image retrieval and visual relationship detection show that our method achieves significantly better performance than other related methods on various datasets.},

While temporal attention determines where to look, semantic decides the context. However, the combination of semantic and temporal attention has never be exploited for video captioning. To tackle this issue, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named Fused GRU with Semantic-Temporal Attention (STA-FG) , which can explicitly incorporate the high-level visual concepts to the generation of semantic-temporal attention for video captioning. The encoder network aims to extract visual features from the videos and predict their semantic concepts , while the decoder network is focusing on efficiently generating coherent sentences using both visual features and semantic concepts . Specifically, the decoder combines both visual and semantic representation , and incorporates a semantic and temporal attention mechanism in a fused GRU network to accurately learn the sentences for video captioning. We experimentally evaluate our approach on the two prevalent datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT , and the results show that our STA-FG achieves the currently best performance on both BLEU and METEOR.},

For the semantic element discovery, an object detection module is used to predict regions of the image, and a captioning model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is employed to generate local descriptions for these regions. The predicted descriptions and categories are used to generate the semantic feature , which not only contains detailed information but also shares a word space with descriptions, and thus bridges the modality gap between visual images and semantic captions. We further integrate the CNN feature with the semantic feature into the proposed Element Embedding LSTM (EE-LSTM) model to predict a language description. Experiments on MS COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional caption methods and is flexible to combine with baseline models to achieve superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Traditional Bag-of-Words (BoWs) model is commonly generated with many steps, including local feature extraction, codebook generation and feature quantization, etc . Those steps are relatively independent with each other and are hard to be jointly optimized. Moreover, the dependency on hand-crafted local feature makes BoWs model not effective in conveying high-level semantics. These issues largely hinder the performance of BoWs model in large-scale image applications. To conquer these issues, we propose an End-to-End BoWs (E 2 BoWs) model based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Our model takes an image as input, then identifies and separates semantic objects in it, and finally outputs visual words with high semantic discriminative power . Specifically, our model firstly generates Semantic Feature Maps (SFMs) corresponding to different object categories through convolutional layers , then introduces Bag-of-Words Layers (BoWL) to generate visual words from each individual feature map. We also introduce a novel learning algorithm to reinforce the sparsity of the generated E 2 BoWs model, which further ensures the time and memory efficiency. We evaluate the proposed E 2 BoWs model on several image search datasets including MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MIRFLICKR-25K and NUS-WIDE .

To deal with these issues, we propose a novel discriminative multimodal embedding (DME) model for event classification in user generated photos by jointly learning the representation together with the classifier in a unified framework. In the proposed DME model, we can effectively resolve the multimodal, intra-class variation and inter-class confusion challenges by using the contrastive constraints on the multimodal event data.

  abstract     = {Fine-grained image classification aims to distinguish subcategories belonging to the same basic-level category, such as 200 subcategories belonging to bird. It is a challenging problem in computer vision and multimedia field due to: attribute similarity (e.g. color and texture) among different subcategories and attribute variance (e.g. pose and viewpoint) in the same subcategory. Attribute similarity causes the difficulty to classify different subcategories even for human, while attribute variance causes the learned feature representations chaotic and confused. Naturally, classification can benefit from a hierarchy of subcategories: since going to a coarser granularity leverages high-level semantic features , while going to a finer granularity leverages discriminative and subtle features. Therefore, we propose an attribute hierarchy based multi-task learning (AHMTL) approach, and its main novelties are: (1) Attribute hierarchy: We reassign all images to multi-granularity subcategories automatically, namely coarse-grained, fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained subcategories . Similar fine-grained subcategories are reassigned to the same coarse-grained subcategory according to their attribute similarity, which pays more attention to the high-level semantic feature representations. Simultaneously, the same fine-grained subcategory but with different attributes are divided into different ultra-fine-grained subcategories, which can obtain more discriminative and subtle feature representations for attribute variance. (2) Multi-task learning: A multi-task learning framework is designed to effectively learn robust feature representations by jointly optimizing coarse-grained, fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification tasks. These three level tasks learn coarse to fine feature representations, meaning high-level semantic to subtle features, which can regularize and boost each other to prevent overfitting, and the mutual promotion of them ensures feature representations more discriminative. Compared with more than 10 state-of-the-art methods on two widely-used CUB-200-2011 and Cars-196 datasets, our AHMTL approach achieves the best classification performance.},

Recently, face alignment is deemed as a regression problem , and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to predict the coordinates of facial landmarks. However, most existing methods only adopt Euclidean loss as the optimization target for each landmark, and neglect the correlations between them, which we think may be inappropriate. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel Relative Coordinates Constraint (RCC) loss function for face alignment, which considers the relative coordinates between any pairs of landmarks as a new supervision signal. More importantly, we prove that the proposed RCC loss function is trainable and can be easily incorporated in existing CNNs optimization procedure. With the joint supervision of Euclidean loss and RCC loss, we train a robust and light CNNs framework for face alignment. Extensive experimental results on several datasets show that the precision of face alignment improved significantly by the proposed RCC loss and quantitative results are comparable to state-of-the-art methods (mean error 5.39 on 300-W and 6.99 on AFLW). In addition, the proposed framework is also an efficient solution (300 FPS on CPU). We share the implementation code of our proposed methods at https://github.com/nianfudong/RCC-loss .},

  abstract     = {Feature selection can efficiently alleviate the issue of curse of dimensionality , especially for multi-label data with multiple features to embody diverse semantics. Although many supervised feature selection methods have been proposed, they generally assume the labels of training data are complete, whilst we only have data with incomplete labels in many real applications. Some methods try to select features with missing labels of training data, they still can not handle feature selection with a large and sparse label space. In addition, these approaches focus on global feature correlations, but some feature correlations are local and shared by a subset of data. In this paper, we introduce an approach called Feature Selection with missing labels based on Label Compression and Local feature Correlation (FSLCLC for short). FSLCLC adopts the low-rank matrix factorization on the sparse sample-label association matrix to compress labels and recover the missing labels in the compressed label space. In addition, it utilizes sparsity regularization and local feature correlation induced manifold regularizations to select the discriminative features .

  abstract     = {Dynamics of body skeletons convey significant information for human gait recognition . However, it is inevitable that missing points, overlapping error, or confusion of left and right error will frequently occur during the process of skeleton estimation. Existing skeleton-based methods have difficulty in achieving satisfactory performance in gait recognition since they treat the noisy data and the normal data equally to the recognition process. In this paper, we propose a novel skeleton-based model called Siamese Denoising Autoencoder networks (Siamese DAE), which can automatically learn to remove position noise, recover missing skeleton points and correct outliers in joint trajectories. More precisely, we construct an encoder that compresses the characteristics of input trajectories into a latent space and a decoder that attempts to reconstruct more accurate skeleton trajectories from the latent feature. The corrected joint trajectories not only lead to higher discriminative power but also stronger generalization capability. Moreover, we design a Siamese structure to reduce intra-class variations and increase inter-class variations of the encoded features. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances the robustness against inaccurate skeleton estimation and achieves substantial improvements over mainstream skeleton-based methods for gait recognition.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks have been employed to analyze the sentiment of text sequences and achieved significant effect. However, these models still face the issues of weakness of pre-trained word embeddings and weak interaction between the specific aspect and the context in attention mechanism . The pre-trained word embeddings lack the specific semantic information from the context. The weak interaction results in poor attention weights and produces limited aspect dependent sentiment representation in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end memory neural network, termed Recurrent Memory Neural Network (ReMemNN), to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. In ReMemNN, to tackle weakness of pre-trained word embeddings, a specially module named embedding adjustment learning module is designed to transfer the pre-trained word embeddings into adjustment word embeddings. To tackle weak interaction in attention mechanism , a multielement attention mechanism is designed to generate powerful attention weights and more precise aspect dependent sentiment representation. Besides, an explicit memory module is designed to store these different representations and generate hidden states and representations. Extensive experimental results on all datasets show that ReMemNN outperforms typical baselines and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Besides, these experimental results also demonstrate that ReMemNN is language-independent and dataset type-independent.},

New differential inequalities are established in which the Markovian switching and multiple time-varying delays are taken into account and the constraint on parameter that determines exponential convergence rate is reduced. Based on Lyapunov method, graph theory and differential inequality techniques, some sufficient conditions are obtained to achieve exponential synchronization. As a result, the developed synchronization criteria have more accurate exponential convergence rate than that in most existing literature which focuses on delayed systems with intermittent control.

Based on the properties of scrambling matrices, necessary and sufficient containment criteria are obtained for the network of agents with arbitrary bounded communication delays and switching interaction topologies.

Besides the robust concern, the AT k -GSAM has well adaptivity by integrating the data dependent hypothesis space and group sparse regularizer together. Generalization error bound is established by the concentration estimate with empirical covering numbers. In particular, our error analysis shows that AT k -GSAM can achieve the learning rate O ( n − 1 / 2 ) O(n−1/2) under appropriate conditions. We further analyze the robustness of AT k -GSAM via a sample-weighted procedure interpretation, and the theoretical guarantees on grouped variable selection.

To remedy this issue, this paper proposes a novel intra prediction method via convolutional encoder-decoder network, which we term IPCED. IPCED can learn and extract the internal representation of reference blocks, and progressively generate a prediction block from this representation. IPCED is a data-driven method, which represents an improvement over hand-crafted methods, and is capable of improving the accuracy of intra prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IPCED can generate higher-quality intra prediction results, achieves 3.41\%, 3.07\% and 3.44\% bitrate saving for the Y/Cb/Cr channel compared with HEVC baseline, which is significantly beyond existing methods.},

We used dense blocks for feature extraction to concatenate deep features with shallow features in depth. We also designed two sub-nets with distinct convolution kernels as different branches of the network, which can widen the network and improve the performance of the system.

  abstract     = {Semantic image segmentation requires large amounts of pixel-wise labeled training data. Creating such data generally requires labor-intensive human manual annotation. Thus, extracting training data from video games is a practical idea, and pixel-wise annotation can be automated from video games with near perfect accuracy. However, experiments show that models trained using raw video-game data cannot be directly applied to real-world scenes because of the domain shift problem. In this paper, we propose a domain-adaptive network based on CycleGAN that translates scenes from a virtual domain to a real domain in both the pixel and feature spaces. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we propose a dynamic perceptual network to improve the quality of the generated images in the feature spaces, making the translated images are more conducive to semantic segmentation; 2) we introduce a novel weighted self-regularization loss to prevent semantic changes in translated images; and 3) we design a discrimination mechanism to coordinate multiple subnetworks and improve the overall training efficiency. We devise a series of metrics to evaluate the quality of translated images during our experiments on the public GTA-V (a video game dataset, i.e., the virtual domain) and Cityscapes (a real-world dataset, i.e., the real domain) and achieved notably improved results, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the development of computing power and deep learning algorithms , pedestrian detection has made great progress. Nevertheless, once a detection model trained on generic datasets (such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) is applied to a specific scene, its precision is limited by the distribution gap between the generic data and the specific scene data. It is difficult to train the model for a specific scene, due to the lack of labeled data from that scene. Even though we manage to get some labeled data from a specific scene, the changing environmental conditions make the pre-trained model perform bad. In light of these issues, we propose a parallel vision approach to scene-specific pedestrian detection. Given an object detection model, it is trained via two sequential stages: (1) the model is pre-trained on augmented-reality data, to address the lack of scene-specific training data; (2) the pre-trained model is incrementally optimized with newly synthesized data as the specific scene evolves over time. On publicly available datasets, our approach leads to higher precision than the models trained on generic data. To tackle the dynamically changing scene, we further evaluate our approach on the webcam data collected from Church Street Market Place, and the results are also encouraging.},

Hence, detecting and recognizing the humor implied in text is an interesting and challenging research problem in the field of natural language processing . To understand humor, we discuss incongruity and ambiguity in detail and then propose an internal and external attention neural network (IEANN) for the humor detection task. The IEANN integrates two types of attention mechanisms to capture the incongruity and ambiguity in humor text. Meanwhile, extensive experiments are conducted on two humor datasets to test the effectiveness and robustness of our model.

In this work, we design a general and lightweight module named the attention dropout convolutional module (ADCM). It consists of two submodules, channel attention dropout (CAD) and position attention dropout (PAD), and each submodule integrates both attention and dropout mechanisms. The attention mechanism emphasizes the meaningful information and suppresses unnecessary noise. The dropout-channel in the CAD submodule filters the channel based on its channel attention, while the dropout-region in the PAD submodule filters the region consisting of the spatially correlated features according to its position attention. The two dropout methods we designed allow the baseline network to learn more robust features and further boost its performance. Finally, we deploy the ADCM in consecutive layers of classical convolutional neural networks and evaluate its performance on multiple benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the ADCM brings significant improvements to the performance of the baseline models at negligible computational cost and with less complexity.},

  abstract     = {Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular machine learning method with a solid theoretical foundation, and has shown promising performance on different classification problems. However, it suffers from an expensive training cost, which makes it not be very suitable for the application with a large-scale training set. To this end, as a data pre-processing technique, training set selection (TSS) for SVM has received much attention recently, since it can reduce the size of SVM training set without degrading the performance. In this paper, a subregion division based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm termed SDMOEA-TSS is proposed for SVM training set selection, where objective space is divided into several subregions for effectively searching good solutions. Specifically, in SDMOEA-TSS, a divided based initialization strategy is firstly suggested to initialize the population to locate in different regions of objective space. Then a subregion based evolutionary (including crossover, mutation and update) strategy is developed, which not only makes full use of individuals in each subregion for local search but also maintains the whole population’s global search ability. Empirical studies on 21 public data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both quality and diversity of the selected SVM training subset.},

However, this method converges slowly especially in the early stage of training. Based on this, a learning rate adjustment strategy that can automatically adjust and has a faster speed of loss decline will be helpful to the training of the deep model. In this paper, a dynamic adjustment strategy of learning rate is developed based on the Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) model and the gradients of loss function. This method effectively utilizes the advantages of the LSTM model considering the multi-step learning rate as a whole, and generates the learning rate of the current step based on the memory information of the previous learning rate. Three datasets and four architectures are used in the experiments.

  abstract     = {Segmentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is a crucial prerequisite for NPC radiotherapy. However, manual segmenting of NPC is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In addition, single-modality MRI generally cannot provide enough information for accurate delineation. Therefore, a novel multi-modality MRI fusion network (MMFNet) is proposed to complete accurate segmentation of NPC via utilizing T1, T2 and contrast-enhanced T1 of MRI. The backbone of MMFNet is designed as a multi-encoder-based network, consisting of several encoders and one decoder, where the encoders aim to capture modality-specific features and the decoder is to obtain fused features for NPC segmentation. A fusion block consisting of a 3D Convolutional Block Attention Module (3D-CBAM) and a residual fusion block (RFBlock) is presented. The 3D-CBAM recalibrates low-level features captured from modality-specific encoders to highlight both informative features and regions of interest (ROIs) whereas the RFBlock fuses re-weighted features to keep balance between fused ones and high-level features from decoder. Moreover, a training strategy named self-transfer is also proposed which utilizes pre-trained modality-specific encoders to initialize multi-encoder-based network in order to make full mining of individual information from multi-modality MRI. The proposed method based on multi-modality MRI can effectively segment NPC and its advantages are validated by extensive experiments.},

The proposed approach replaces the priority queue with an array and a linear search aiming at using a parallel-friendly data structure . We show that this approach leads to less competition among threads, thus yielding a more temporal and spatial locality. Additionally, we show how the use of vectorization in distance calculations affects the overall speedup and also provide directions on the situations one can benefit from that. The experiments are carried out on five public datasets with a different number of samples and features on architectures with distinct levels of parallelism .

So in this paper, we first analyze what kinds of PNARs are redundant and then propose a novel method called LOGIC by using logical reasoning to prune redundant PNARs. In addition, we combine correlation coefficient and multiple minimum confidences ( mc ) to ensure that the mined PNARs are strongly correlated and their number can be flexibly controlled. Experimental results show that our method can prune up to 81.6\% redundant PNARs. To the best of our knowledge, LOGIC is the first method to prune redundant PNARs simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {There are many high-dimensional multiview data in various big data applications . It is very difficult to deal with those high-dimensional multiview data for the classic clustering algorithms , which consider all features of data with equal relevance. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper aims at proposing a novel intelligent weighting k -means clustering (IWKM) algorithm based on swarm intelligence . Firstly, the degree of coupling between clusters is presented in the model of clustering to enlarge the dissimilarity of clusters. Various weights of views and features are used in the weighting distance function to determine the clusters of objects. Secondly, to eliminate the sensitivity of initial cluster centers, swarm intelligence is utilized to find initial cluster centers, weights of views, and weights of features by a global search. Lastly, a precise perturbation is proposed to improve optimization performance of swarm intelligence. To verify the performance of clustering for high-dimensional multiview data, the experiments were performed by the evaluation metrics of Rand Index, Jaccard Coefficient and Folkes Russe in five big data applications on the two different computational platforms of apache spark and single node. The experimental results show that IWKM is effective and efficient in clustering of high-dimensional multiview data, and can obtain better performance than the other 5 kinds of approaches in these complicated data sets with more views and higher dimensions on apache spark and single node.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computing is strongly limited by physical implementations of quantum computers . Currently, development of quantum computing algorithms is carried out by analytic or simulation procedures while quantum computers are not widely available. Although quantum computing simulation is parallel by nature, spatial and temporal complexity are major performance hazards. The exponential increase in memory and global access to quantum states in simulations limit not only the number of qubits but also quantum transformations. Considering these scenarios, six quantum simulators are studied, in order to find out their main features and simulation results considering implementations classified in single/multiple processor and accelerator architectures. The main strategies used to improve performance in these architectures provide relevant parameters for the development of the new extension of the Distributed Geometric Machine environment proposed in this paper. Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms are simulated and compared to previous D-GM results and to LIQUi|⟩’s simulator, showing improvements as relative speedups up to 22.2 ×  in relation to the previous version and up to 910.46 ×  when compared to LIQUi|⟩.},

  abstract     = {Outlier detection is a fundamental task for knowledge discovery in data mining, especially in the Big Data era. It aims to detect data items that deviate from the general pattern of a given data set. In this paper, we present a new outlier detection technique using tourist walks starting from each data sample and varying the memory size. Specifically, a data sample gets a higher outlier score if it participates in few tourist walk attractors, while it gets a low score if it participates in a large number of attractors. Experimental results on artificial and real data sets show good performance of the proposed method. In comparison to classical outlier detection methods , the proposed one shows the following salient features: (1) It finds out outliers by identifying the structure of the input data set instead of considering only physical features, such as distance, similarity or density. (2) It can detect not only external outliers as classical methods do, but also internal outliers staying among various normal data groups. (3) By varying the memory size, the tourist walks can characterize both local and global structures of the data set. (4) A parallel implementation is quite convenient due to the nature of large amount of independent walking of the algorithm. (5) The proposed method is a deterministic technique. Therefore, only one run is sufficient, in contrast to stochastic techniques, which require many runs. Moreover, in this work, we find, for the first time, that tourist walks can generate complex attractors in various crossing shapes. Such complex attractors reveal data structures in more details. Consequently, it can improve the outlier detection performance.},

An effective feature selection method is expected to result in a significantly reduced subset of the original features without sacrificing the quality of problem-solving (e.g., classification). In this paper, a non-unique decision measure is proposed that captures the degree of a given feature subset being relevant to different categories. This helps to represent the uncertainty information in the boundary region of a granular model, such as rough sets or fuzzy-rough sets in an efficient manner. Based on this measure, the paper further introduce a differentiation entropy as an evaluator of feature subsets to implement a novel feature selection algorithm. The resulting feature selection method is capable of dealing with either nominal or real-valued data. Experimental results on both benchmark data sets and a real application problem demonstrate that the features selected by the proposed approach outperform those attained by state-of-the-art feature selection techniques, in terms of both the size of feature reduction and the classification accuracy .},

  abstract     = {Although non-convex fuzzy set (FS) has the high potential of great performance in data modeling and controlling, it is seldom used and discussed because the lack of linguistic explanation and normative construction way. To address this problem, we propose a method named “parametric qualitative fuzzy set (PQ FS) plus choice strategy” for the construction and linguistic explanation of non-convex FS, in which PQ FS is a collection of convex FSs with special structure, and choice strategy is an approach to choose convex FSs from PQ FS. Based on this method, a non-convex FS is obtained as the trajectory of a collection of convex FS by choosing specific convex FS under specific situation. Thus, the linguistic explanation of non-convex FS is obtained: using non-convex FSs to represent linguistic variables does not violate the routine of using convex FSs, because it shows that the linguistic variable is just represented by different convex FS at different situation. Theorems are shown to demonstrate that the “PQ FS plus choice strategy” can effectively construct a non-convex FS. Furthermore, “Why a fuzzy logic system (FLS) adopting non-convex FSs may have a higher approximation capability” is discussed by introducing a parametric qualitative FLS (PQ FLS) that is compared with a typical Mamdani FLS as a function approximator. This indicates that non-convex FSs can approximate more extrema in a given universe with smaller partition numbers or fewer rules than convex FSs. Finally, the experimental results verify that a PQ FLS designed with the proposed non-convex FS construction method can outperform traditional convex fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). Meanwhile, using parallel computing in the model training phase of PQ FLSs can reduce the calculation time compared to single-thread mode.},

In order to tackle this challenge we exploit the Vision Processing Unit (VPU) that combines dedicated CNN hardware blocks and very low power requirement. The lack of readily available training data and memory requirements are two of the factors hindering the training and accuracy performance of 3D CNNs. In this paper, we propose a method for generating synthetic 3D point-clouds from realistic CAD scene models to enrich the training process for volumetric CNNs. Furthermore, an efficient 3D volumetric object representation Volumetric Accelerator format (VOLA) is employed. VOLA is a sexaquaternary (power-of-four subdivision) tree-based representation which allows for significant memory saving for volumetric data . Multiple CNN models were trained and pruning techniques for the weights were applied to the trained 3D Volumetric Network in order to remove almost 70\% of the parameters and outperform the existing state-of-the-art networks. The top performing and efficient model was ported to the Movidius™Neural Compute Stick (NCS). After deployment on the NCS, it takes 11 ms ( ∼ 90 frames per second) to perform inference on each input volume, with a reported power requirement of 1.2 W, which leads to 75.75 inferences per second per Watt.},

Most importantly our method is proposed with an adaptive integrating method to reduce the influence of over-fitting.

In this paper, an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm-based Kernel Ridge Regression , called KRR-ABC, is proposed for automobile insurance fraud detection. The global optimization ability of the ABC algorithm is used to optimize the parameter combination of KRR. It can quickly find the global optimal value without traversing all the grid points and improve the generalization ability of the model. The parallel computing is also used to enhance the computing speed of KRR-ABC algorithm. The performance of the KRR-ABC model is evaluated on eight benchmark data sets and compared with other methods.

Nevertheless, in many real-world applications, the original vibration data usually collected under different work conditions which lead to large distribution divergences. As a result, the performances of many machine learning methods may drop dramatically. To overcome this deficiency, domain adaptation is introduced by adapting the regression model or classifier trained in the source domain for use in the distinct but related target domain. Particularly, a novel sparse filtering based domain adaptation approach (SFDA) is proposed for the mechanical fault diagnosis. Comparing with the previous researches, two main contributions of SFDA are concluded as follows: (1) the domain adaptation is applied to the sparse filtering algorithm. (2) The ℓ 1-norm and ℓ 2-norm are employed to the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). (3) SFDA is easy to be implemented, and high classification accuracy can be obtained. The bearing and gear dataset are utilized to testify the validity and reliability of SFDA.},

In this work, we present an algorithm that classifies and samples the experiences into separate contextual memory buffers using an unsupervised learning technique. This allows each new experience to be associated to a mini-batch of the past experiences that are not from the same contextual buffer as the current one, thus further reducing the correlation between experiences. Experimental results show that the correlation minimizing sampling improves over Q-learning algorithms with uniform sampling, and that a significant improvement can be observed when coupled with the sampling methods that prioritize on the experience temporal difference error.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the designation in reward function and the large computational iterating steps until convergence. How to accelerate the training process in RL plays a vital role. In this paper, we proposed a Lyapunov function based approach to shape the reward function which can effectively accelerate the training. Furthermore, the shaped reward function leads to convergence guarantee via stochastic approximation , an invariant optimality condition using Bellman Equation and an asymptotical unbiased policy. Moreover, sufficient RL benchmarks have been experimented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. It has been verified that our proposed method substantially accelerates the convergence process as well as improves the performance in terms of a higher accumulated reward.},

  abstract     = {Regularization is a very effective algorithm to solve overfitting problem in neural network , which improves the generalization ability of the model. However, their working mechanisms and the impact on the model performance have not been fully explored. In this paper, we study and analyze them using information bottleneck theory and one theory from human brain sensory system. We propose a metric to characterise the encoding length of hidden layers, named as AEntry value. Then, we implement extensive experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets with several commonly used regularization algorithms, and calculate the corresponding AEntry values. We analyze these results and obtain three conclusions. (1) The introduction of regularization influences the encoding of relative features with prediction task in neural network . The early stopping technique avoids introducing unrelated information with the task into the model by stopping the training process as an appropriate iterations. Laplace, Gaussian and Sparse Response regularizations compress the related representation and improve the performance of neural network by introducing the prior information into the model. In contrast, Dropout, Batch Normalization , and Layer Normalization increase the encoding length of features by adopting redundant representation to improve the performance. (2) The encoding of neural network does not satisfy the data processing inequality of information theory , which is mainly caused by redundant coding of extracted features. (3) The overfitting is caused by introducing irrelative information with the target. These results can give us insight into building more efficient regularization algorithm to improve the performance of neural network model.},

In this paper, we present a Multi-level Feature Enhancement Network (MFENet) to enhance the feature extraction of each level in backbone. This approach can achieve high performance while maintaining high inference speed. We first rely on a Spatial and Edge Extraction Module with the Laplace Operator to improve the edge information extraction of low-level features. Next, we design a Context Boost Module to increase the context information inside each object of high-level features. Finally, we introduce the Selective Refinement Module to selectively combine the information from these two modules. Our network attained precise real-time segmentation results on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCO-Stuff datasets. More specifically, the architecture achieved 76.7\% Mean IoU on the Cityscapes test dataset with 12.5 GFLOPS and a speed of 47 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan Xp card, which is more accurate than existing real-time methods.},

  abstract     = {Despite great progress in face recognition tasks achieved by deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), these models often face challenges in real world tasks where training images gathered from Internet are different from test images because of different lighting condition, pose and image quality. These factors increase domain discrepancy between training (source domain) and testing (target domain) database and make the learnt models degenerate in application. Meanwhile, due to lack of labeled target data, directly fine-tuning the pre-learnt models becomes intractable and impractical. In this paper, we propose a new clustering-based domain adaptation method designed for face recognition task in which the source and target domain do not share any classes. Our method effectively learns the discriminative target feature by aligning the feature domain globally, and, at the meantime, distinguishing the target clusters locally. Specifically, it first learns a more reliable representation for clustering by minimizing global domain discrepancy to reduce domain gaps, and then applies simplified spectral clustering method to generate pseudo-labels in the domain-invariant feature space, and finally learns discriminative target representation. Comprehensive experiments on widely-used GBU, IJB-A/B/C and RFW databases clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed approach. State-of-the-art performance of GBU data set is achieved by only unsupervised adaptation from the target training data.},

In this paper, we present a multiobjective adaptive convolutional neural network (AdaResU-Net) for medical image segmentation that is able to automatically adapt to new datasets while minimizing the size of the network. The proposed AdaResU-Net is comprised of a fixed architecture that combines the structure of the state-of-the-art U-Net with a residual learning framework to improve information propagation and promote an efficient training. Then, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MEA) that optimizes both segmentation accuracy and model size is proposed to evolve the AdaResU-Net networks with different hyperparameters. The presented model is tested on two publically available medical image datasets and compared with the U-Net. Results show that the AdaResU-Net achieves better segmentation performance with less than 30\% the number of trainable parameters.

  abstract     = {Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading reasons that causes blindness. And the segmentation of hard exudates in color fundus images is crucial for early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, which is a difficult task due to its uncertainty in size, shape and contrast. Class-balanced cross entropy (CBCE) loss is the most popular objective function for image segmentation task to solve the class-unbalance problem. However, we show that background pixels tend to be misclassified to hard exudates in CBCE since the loss for a misclassified background pixels is much smaller than that for a misclassified hard exudate pixel, which is called loss-unbalance problem here. A top-k loss is proposed in this paper, which considers the cases of both class-unbalance and loss-unbalance by focusing more over the hard-to-classify pixels. Moreover, a fast version of the top-k loss, named bin loss, is implemented for efficiency, which reduces the time complexity from O ( n log n ) of top-k loss to O ( n ), where n is the number of background pixels. We evaluated the proposed bin loss over two public datasets for hard exudates segmentation task , including e-ophtha EX and IDRiD. Furthermore, three popular models for image segmentation , HED, DeepLab v2, and FCRN , were used to evaluate the versatility of bin loss. Extensive experiments show that each model with the proposed bin loss performs better than that with CBCE loss, which demonstrates bin loss is versatile so that it can be applied to different models for performance improvement. Specially, for DeepLab over e-ophtha EX, the F-score increases 5.2 percentage points, and the area under the SE-PPV curve (AUC) increases 10.6 percentage points. Moreover, the AUC increases more than 4 percentage points over IDRiD dataset for both DeepLab and FCRN . The source code of bin loss is available at: https://github.com/guomugong/bin_loss .},

  abstract     = {Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors, which have a high mortality. Surgery is the most commonly used treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially useful to assess gliomas and evaluate the success of the treatment in clinical practice. So accurately segmenting the brain tumor from MRI images is the key to clinical diagnostics and treatment planning. However, a large quantity of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time. So automatic approaches are required for quick and effective segmentation. But the spatial and structural variability among brain tumors bring a challenge to automatically segment MRI images. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) can achieve complex function mapping. This contributes to response to the challenge. Therefore, DCNN is the commonly used method in brain tumor segmentation. Although a large number of DCNN based methods have been proposed, these methods mainly aim to improve the quality of the image features extracted by DCNN. Actually, these methods usually ignore the prior knowledge in medical images, and the simple prior knowledge in brain tumor segmentation is that most of the tumor regions in images are left-right asymmetry. Based on this, in this paper, a novel deep convolutional neural network which combines symmetry have been proposed to automatically segment brain tumors. Our neural networks, called Deep Convolutional Symmetric Neural Network (DCSNN), extends DCNN based segmentation networks by adding symmetric masks in several layers. Our proposal was validated in the BRATS 2015 database, and we also give some baselines. The results are evaluated by dice similarity coefficient metric (DSC). And our proposed method achieved a competitive result with average DSC of 0.852. Furthermore, our method only takes about 10.8 s to segment a patient case. Although our method is not the best performance in BRATS 2015 challenge, as far as we know, our method outperforms other recent DCNN-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging can simultaneously acquire functional metabolic information and anatomical information of the human body. How to rationally fuse the complementary information in PET/CT for accurate tumor segmentation is challenging. In this study, a novel deep learning based variational method was proposed to automatically fuse multimodality information for tumor segmentation in PET/CT. A 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) was first designed and trained to produce a probability map from the CT image. The learnt probability map describes the probability of each CT voxel belonging to the tumor or the background, and roughly distinguishes the tumor from its surrounding soft tissues. A fuzzy variational model was then proposed to incorporate the probability map and the PET intensity image for an accurate multimodality tumor segmentation, where the probability map acted as a membership degree prior. A split Bregman algorithm was used to minimize the variational model. The proposed method was validated on a non-small cell lung cancer dataset with 84 PET/CT images. Experimental results demonstrated that: (1) Only a few training samples were needed for training the designed network to produce the probability map; (2) The proposed method can be applied to small datasets, normally seen in clinic research; (3) The proposed method successfully fused the complementary information in PET/CT, and outperformed two existing deep learning-based multimodality segmentation methods and other multimodality segmentation methods using traditional fusion strategies (without deep learning); (4) The proposed method had a good performance for tumor segmentation, even for those with Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake inhomogeneity and blurred tumor edges (two major challenges in PET single modality segmentation) and complex surrounding soft tissues (one major challenge in CT single modality segmentation), and achieved an average dice similarity indexes (DSI) of 0.86 ± 0.05, sensitivity (SE) of 0.86 ± 0.07, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.87 ± 0.10, volume error (VE) of 0.16 ± 0.12, and classification error (CE) of 0.30 ± 0.12.},

  abstract     = {Retinal vessel segmentation (RVS) helps the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy , which can cause visual impairment and even blindness. Some problems are hindering the application of automatic RVS, including accuracy, robustness and segmentation speed. In this paper, we propose a cross-connected convolutional neural network (CcNet) for the automatic segmentation of retinal vessel trees. In the CcNet, convolutional layers extract the features and predict the pixel classes according to those learned features. The CcNet is trained and tested with full green channel images directly. The cross connections between primary path and secondary path fuse the multi-level features. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets (DRIVE: Sn = 0.7625, Acc = 0.9528; STARE: Sn = 0.7709, Acc = 0.9633) are higher than those of most state-of-the-art methods. In the cross-training phase, CcNte’s accuracy fluctuations (△ Accs ) on DRIVE and STARE are 0.0042 and 0.007, respectively, which are relatively small compared with those of published methods. In addition, our algorithm has faster computing speed (0.063 s) than those listed algorithms using a GPU (graphics processing unit). These results reveal that our algorithm has potential in practical applications due to promising segmentation performances including advanced specificity, accuracy, robustness and fast processing speed.},

  abstract     = {Gastric cancer(GC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. To prevent the occurrence of advanced GCs, there is a need for immediate detection and treatment of gastric precancerous and early cancerous lesions. Magnification endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) system as an advanced diagnostic imaging technology is widely used in evaluating gastric lesion types, which can interpret gastric lesion characteristics by enhancing contrasts between vessels and mucosal surfaces. Based on microvascular morphologies presented on M-NBI images, physicians can manually diagnose gastric lesions; but this is a tough work for unexperienced doctors and it is lacking of objectivity. In this study, we propose a transfer learning framework by fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify gastric M-NBI images into three classes: chronic gastritis (CGT), low grade neoplasia (LGN) and early gastric cancer (EGC). The method we choose is used to compare with three kinds of traditional handcraft texture feature extraction methods and CNN models trained directly by our dataset. Results show that the performance of fine-tuned CNNs outperforms traditional handcraft features and trained CNNs. Experiments also illustrate that ResNet50 can achieve 0.96 accuracy, 0.92, 0.91 and 0.99 f1-scores for classifying M-NBI images into CGT, LGN and EGC. In conclusion, the proposed framework is suit for multi-classification tasks of gastric M-NBI images.},

Accurate lung nodule detection in computed tomography (CT) images is a crucial step in diagnosing lung cancer. CNN based CADe systems diagnose lung nodules in two stages by using one network for detection and another following network for classification or false positive reduction. Besides costly construction, two-stage systems can only find a single-scale location including many surrounding contexts for each nodule, which leads to a limited accuracy when classifying small nodules. In this paper, we construct a one-stage framework relying on feature pyramid network (FPN) for the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LA). The proposed network has two advantages, (i) it can localize and classify LAs simultaneously. (ii) it generates feature maps with high resolution, from which robust classification is reached since tight coverage takes less contextual information. The performance of the proposed one-stage diagnostic network is verified on a lung adenocarcinoma dataset. Experimental results show that it achieves higher sensitives than two-stage frameworks.},

To contend with smaller datasets (i.e. in hundreds) and the characteristics of CT TB images in which abnormalities occupy only limited regions, a 3D block-based residual deep learning network (ResNet) coupled with injection of depth information (depth-ResNet) at each layer was implemented. Progress in evaluation has been accomplished in two ways. One is to assess the proposed depth-ResNet in prediction of severity scores and another is to analyse the probability of high severity of TB. For the former, delivered results are of 92.70 ± 5.97\% and 67.15 ± 1.69\% for proposed depth-ResNet and ResNet-50 respectively. For the latter, two additional measures are put forward, which are calculated using (1) the overall severity (1 to 5) probability, and (2) separate probabilities of both high severity (scores of 1 to 3) and low severity (scores of 4 and 5) respectively, when scores of 1 to 5 are mapped into initial probabilities of (0.9, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.2) respectively.

  abstract     = {Human retinal vascular network plays an important role in ophthalmology diagnosis. For example, in the diagnosis of ophthalmology, the severity of the disease has a direct correlation with the lesion location, in the sense that the closer the lesion area is to the optic disk, the higher will be the severity of the disease. If a framework is able to provide the hierarchical structure of the retinal vascular network, then the severity of disease can be quantified by leveraging the hierarchical characteristics of vessels in the vicinity of the lesion location. Thus, in this paper, an executable framework is recommended for the hierarchical division of the retinal vascular networks. Specifically, a supervised method based on deep neural network is used for retinal blood vessel segmentation. A graph-based method is also applied to generate vascular trees from the segmented retinal vessels. As part of our proposed approach, we present two algorithms: the potential landmark detection algorithm (PLDA) is used to identify the bifurcations and crossings; and the adaptive hierarchical classification algorithm (AHCA) is used in the hierarchical characteristics classification of vascular bifurcations. By classifying the hierarchical characteristics of vascular bifurcation, the hierarchical characteristics of the vessel segments containing these bifurcations are identified. Thus, the hierarchical division of retinal vascular network is realized. When applied to two publicly available datasets, DRIVE and STARE, the proposed framework achieves an accurate rate of 98.99\% and sensitivity rate of 92.17\%.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is an important diagnostic technique in clinical practice. However, hardware limitations and time constraints often result in the acquisition of anisotropic MR images. It is highly desirable but very challenging to enhance image spatial resolution in medical image analysis for disease diagnosis. Recently, studies have shown that deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) can significantly boost the performance of MR image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel CNN-based anisotropic MR image reconstruction method based on residual learning with long and short skip connections. The proposed network can effectively alleviate the vanishing gradient problem of deep networks and learn to restore high-frequency details of MR images. To reduce computational complexity and memory usage, the proposed network utilizes cross-plane self-similarity of 3D T1-weighted (T1w) MR images. Based on experiments on simulated and clinical brain MR images, we demonstrate that the proposed network can significantly improve the spatial resolution of anisotropic MR images with high computational efficiency. The network trained on T1w MR images is able to effectively reconstruct both SR T1w and T2-weighted (T2w) images, exploiting image features for multi-modality reconstruction. Moreover, the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms classical interpolation methods, non-local means method (NLM), and sparse coding based algorithm in terms of peak signal-to-noise-ratio, structural similarity image index, intensity profile, and small structures. The proposed method can be efficiently applied to SR reconstruction of thick-slice MR images in the out-of-plane views for radiological assessment and post-acquisition processing.},

In this paper, a feature point descriptor using fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) is proposed and applied to cardiac motion estimation based on graph matching . A fully convolutional network is trained to predict endocardial contours and extract features of points from short-axis cine magnetic resonance (MR) images. An LV graph is constructed using the extracted point features, and a convex graph matching cost function is defined to estimate the point correspondence between images in two given phases. The sparsity and double stochastic constraints are introduced into the cost function, which is optimized iteratively by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Finally, the transformation using compact supported radial basis functions with sparsity constraint is employed to estimate the dense displacement field between two cardiac images in two phases based on the correspondence relationship. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on two public cardiac databases, and the experimental results show that the FCN feature descriptor outperforms traditional feature descriptors in estimating the correspondence between endocardial contours of the LV. For LV motion estimation, the proposed method provides more accurate motion fields than existing graph matching algorithms .},

  abstract     = {To develop a framework for automated prediction of hepatobiliary (HB) toxicity after liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A newly recognized toxicity type, named central or HB liver toxicity, had been reported, manifestation of which strongly correlates with the dose delivered to portal vein (PV) during SBRT. We propose a novel framework for automated HB toxicity prediction by combining deep learning-based auto-segmentation, PV anatomy analysis and the previously reported HB toxicity model. For validation of the framework, an IBR approved representative database of 72 patients treated with SBRT from primary (37) and metastatic (35) liver cancer was assembled. Each case included a pre-treatment CT, manual segmentations of tumor and PV, approved treatment plan, and the record of acute and late post-treatment toxicities. Performance of the developed framework was evaluated by quantitative comparison against manual predictions of HB toxicity, as well as post-treatment toxicity follow-ups. The manual and automated predictions of HB toxicity were in agreement for 94\% cases using either V BED10 30 ≥ 45 cc or V BED10 40 ≥ 37 cc dosimetric predictors. When compared to post-treatment follow-ups for primary liver cancer, the proposed automated framework made 86\% and 83\% correct predictions in comparison to 83\% and 80\% correct manual predictions using V BED10 30 ≥ 45 cc or V BED10 40 ≥ 37 cc, respectively. The proposed framework automates the HB toxicity prediction with the accuracy similar to manual analysis-based HB toxicity prediction. The strategy is quite general and extendable to the automated prediction of toxicities of other organs.},

The recent proposed methods for the early diagnosis of breast cancer, and while showing great success in achieving this goal, rely on one of the indicators in the mammogram to diagnose the patient&#39;s condition. Whether it is identifying differences in shapes and patterns of the findings (i.e. masses, calcifications,…etc.) or assessing the breast density as a risk indicator, these Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems by using single-label classification, fail to exploit the intrinsic useful correlation information among data from correlated domains. Rather than learning to identify the disease based on one of the indicators, we propose the joint learning of the tasks using multi-label image classification . Furthermore, we introduce a new fine-tuning strategy for using transfer learning , that takes advantage of the end-to-end image representation learning when adapting the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the new task. We also propose a customized label decision scheme, adapted to this problem, which estimates the optimal confidence for each visual concept.

In this work, we focus on blind compressed sensing (BCS), where the underlying sparse signal model is a priori unknown, and propose a framework to simultaneously reconstruct the underlying image as well as the unknown model from highly under-sampled measurements. Specifically, in our model, the patches of the under-sampled images are approximately sparse in a transform domain. Transform learning that combines wavelet and gradient sparsity is considered as regularization in our model for dynamic MR images. The original complex problem is decomposed into several simpler subproblems, then each of the subproblems is efficiently solved with a variable splitting iterative scheme . The results of numerous experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art compressed sensing MRI algorithms and yields better reconstructions results.},

Moreover, a novel separable convolution with inverted bottleneck is utilized to decouple the spatial and channel-wise relevancy of features efficiently. Experiments on PhysioNet/CinC 2016 show that the proposed method obtains a superior classification results and excels in consumption of parameter comparing to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Video-based non-contact heart rate detection can be easily affected by factors such as face shake and shooting environment; thus, effectively extracting the blood volume pulse signal is difficult. Therefore, a video-based face-shake-resistant heart rate detection method was proposed in this paper to mediate this problem. First, the face region that was selected through the multi-task convolution neural networks was used to correct the tilt angle and obtain the face image sequence. The face image sequence possessed approximately the same skin color information. Afterward, empirical mode decomposition and permutation entropy were combined, and the initial position of the signal was determined according to the randomness of the intrinsic mode function component to denoise and reconstruct the blood volume pulse signal. Finally, spectral analysis was implemented for the reconstructed signal to compute the heart rate value. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was highly consistent with the measurement result of the pulse oximeter; moreover, the proposed method showed good stability and accuracy for human heart rate detection.},

  abstract     = {MRI is the leading method of evaluation in traumatic shoulder pathologies ranging from soft tissue or bone edema to rupture of tendons or ligaments and subtle fractures of bone. MRI has the power of evaluating both of the soft tissues and bone at the same time. PD weighted MRI sequences are very powerful in demonstrating bone trauma in terms of edema and cortical disruption in the shoulder pathologies. The alterations in the intensity of the metaphyseal bone may be used to predict the presence of the bone trauma or pathologies. Although it is superior to many other imaging modalities to uncover the effects of trauma on the each anatomical structure of shoulder, PD weighted MRI has innate obstacles to image processing like low signal to noise ratio besides close anatomical relations and unclear bony borders. We proposed an innovative representation of a learning framework for diagnosis of bone lesions from PD MRI sequences that integrates deep learning techniques to automatically learn discriminative features while avoiding the design of specific hand crafted image based feature descriptors . In this study automatically segmented PD weighted shoulder images were evaluated by the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features and classify humeral head in three groups as normal, edematous and Hill -Sachs lesion with a success rate of 98.43\%. Compared to the state of art methods, our proposed CNN based diagnosis system is very promising to assist radiologists and orthopedists in decision making.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal image registration is becoming increasingly important in remote sensing. However, due to the significant nonlinear intensity differences between multimodal images, conventional registration methods tend to get trapped into local optima. To address this issue, we present a new approach for multimodal image registration using histogram of oriented gradient distance (HOGD) and data-driven grey wolf optimizer (DDGWO). First, we propose a novel similarity measure for area-based registration methods that is HOGD. We investigate the performance of HOGD by analyzing its similarity curve. HOGD has a large range of values, which is helpful to find the global optimum. Second, we use GWO to optimize the transformation parameters. Since it is time-consuming to calculate HOGD, we propose DDGWO to minimize HOGD. In DDGWO, the iterations are divided into two parts: the training and prediction iterations. A support vector machine (SVM) regression model is trained by the historical HOGD computed in the training iterations. The trained SVM model predicts HOGD instead of calculating in the prediction iterations, which can reduce the computational time. Finally, we test the proposed approach that uses HOGD as the similarity measure and DDGWO as the search algorithm on 12 real and four simulated image pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach saves up to 83.35-84.15\% of computational time and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of registration accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Video-based crowd counting can leverage the spatial-temporal information between neighboring frames, and thus this information would improve the robustness of crowd counting. Therefore, this solution is more practical than single image-based crowd counting in real applications. Since severe occlusions, translation, rotation, and scaling of persons will give rise to the change of density map of heads between neighboring frames, video-based crowd counting is a very challenging task. To alleviate these issues in video crowd counting, a Multi-Level Feature Fusion Based Locality-Constrained Spatial Transformer Network (MLSTN) is proposed, which consists of two components, namely density map regression module and Locality-Constrained Spatial Transformer (LST) module. Specifically, we first estimate the density map of each frame by utilizing the combination of the low-level, middle-level and high-level features of the Convolutional Neural Networks . This is because the low-level features may be more effective in the extraction of small head information , while the middle and high level features are more effective in the extraction of medium and large head information . Then to measure the relationship of the density maps between neighboring frames, the LST module is proposed, which estimates the density map of the next frame by concatenating several regression density maps. To facilitate the performance evaluation for video crowd counting, we have collected and labeled a large-scale video crowd counting dataset which includes 100 five-second-long sequences with 394,081 annotated heads from 13 different scenes. As far as we know, it is the largest video crowd counting dataset. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach for crowd counting on our dataset and other video-based crowd counting datasets. All our dataset are released online. 1},

Firstly, we construct a class of multiple DTMNNs with stochastic perturbations and time-varying delays. Secondly, two sets of sufficient synchronization conditions are respectively established by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals and using two different methods. Under impulsive perturbations, the synchronization preservation for stable DTMNNs is achieved as long as the first set of synchronization conditions is satisfied. Moreover, the desired impulsive control matrix is derived by solving the second set of synchronization conditions.

  abstract     = {Recently, facial image completion has witnessed substantial progress due to the increasing power of deep convolutional networks and generative adversarial nets. These methods try to reproduce the pixels in the missing regions of a facial image so that the completion results are indistinguishable from the original one. However, due to the multimodality of image contents, there are often many plausible ways to complete a facial image, which are equally good and meaningful. A user might be specifically interested in obtaining a particular completion result with certain desired attributes. To address this need, we propose a novel deep learning approach to facial image completion with multiple controllable attributes (e.g., gender and smiling). First, an attribute classification loss is proposed to guarantee the completed image should have some desired attributes. Second, our approach introduces a perceptual loss to model high-level semantic structures in a facial image, which greatly reduces structure distortions in the large missing regions. Third, an adversarial loss is employed to ensure the completion results are visually realistic. The three components cooperate well in our approach, forming an effective framework for high quality facial image completion with multiple controllable attributes. Experimental results on the CelebA datasets show our method not only achieves excellent performance on facial completion task, but also allows users to obtain specific completion results with facial attributes of interest.},

To this end, we introduce SketchSeg, a large dataset consisting of 10,000 pixel-wisely labeled sketches. Besides, due to the lack of colors and textures in sketches, conventional DNNs learned on natural images are not optimal for tackling our problem. Therefore, we further propose the Multi-column Point-CNN (MCPNet), which directly takes sampled points as its input to reduce computational costs, and adopts multiple columns with different filter sizes to better capture the structures of sketches. Extensive experiments validate that the MCPNet is superior to conventional DNNs like FCN .

Traditional methods mainly analyze prototypical facial expressions of no more than eight discrete emotions as a classification task . However, in practice, spontaneous facial expressions in a naturalistic environment can represent not only a wide range of emotions, but also different intensities within an emotion family. In such situations, these methods are not reliable or adequate. In this paper, we propose to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze facial expressions explainable in a dimensional emotion model. The proposed method accommodates not only a set of basic emotion expressions, but also a full range of other emotions and subtle emotion intensities that we both feel in ourselves and perceive in others in our daily life. Specifically, we first mapped facial expressions into dimensional measures so that we transformed facial expression analysis from a classification problem to a regression one. We then tested our CNN-based methods for facial expression regression and these methods demonstrated promising performance. Moreover, we improved our method by a bilinear pooling which encodes second-order statistics of features. We showed that such bilinear-CNN models significantly outperformed their respective baseline models .},

The resulting algorithm combines active and passive learning: A moving window (MW) algorithm, which adapts the window size against virtual/real concept drifts, is coupled with a just-in-time learning (JITL) model, constructed using an appropriate region of historical data, and the ensemble weights of the MW and JITL models are adjusted for each query point. Tests on four real industrial datasets and a synthetic data, comprising various concept drift scenarios, show that MW Adp -JITL yields superior prediction accuracy and is generally more robust to changes in algorithm parameters compared to conventional adaptive learning methods and state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. MW Adp -JITL complies with time limits of online prediction, and is applicable for high dimensional processes under various types of concept drifts. It is seen that MW Adp -JITL can successfully achieve a good balance in bias-variance tradeoff, justifying the use of only two exquisitely selected learners in ensemble learning.},

Q-learning is one of the most popular methods in RL, which leverages the Bellman equation to update the Q-function. Considering that data collection in RL is both time and cost consuming and Q-learning converges slowly, different kinds of transfer RL algorithms are designed to improve the sample complexity of the new tasks 1 . However, most of the previous transfer RL algorithms are similar to the transfer learning methods in deep learning and are heuristic with no theoretical guarantee of the convergence rate. Therefore, it is important for us to clearly understand how and when will transfer learning help RL method and provide the theoretical guarantee for the improvement of the sample complexity. In this paper, we rethink the transfer Rl problems in the RL perspective and propose to transfer the Q-function learned in the old task to the target Q-function in the Q-learning of the new task. We call this new transfer Q-learning method target transfer Q-Learning (abbrev. TTQL). The transfer process is controlled by the error condition which can help to avoid the harm to the new tasks brought by the transferred target. We design the error condition in TTQL as whether the Bellman error of the transferred target Q-function is less than the current Q-function. We show that TTQL with the error condition will achieve a faster convergence rate than Q-learning. Our experiments are consistent with our theoretical results and verify the effectiveness of our proposed target transfer Q-learning method.},

In this paper, we show that the weight of the attention layer has scale-invariant property, i.e. the output is invariant to a rescaling of weights. However, optimization algorithms in the vector space of weight such as SGD are not scaling invariant . This mismatch will potentially hurt the optimization process. To solve the mismatch, we seek a new parameter space for attention layer that is both scale-invariant and can sufficiently represent the output of attention, so that we can employ optimization algorithms in the scale-invariant parameter space. To achieve this goal, we first show that the output of the attention layer can be represented using scale-invariant variables, which is called paths. Then, we define basis paths which are an independent subset of all paths and are sufficient to represent all other paths. We prove that the Scale-Invariant (SI) space for the attention layer is composed of the basis path. Finally, we design an Attention Basis Path Identification(ABPI) Method to identify the basis paths and propose optimizing the attention layer directly in its SI space. Several experiments on benchmark datasets show that we can obtain more effective neural networks with the attention layer by optimizing the attention layer directly in its SI space.},

  abstract     = {As communication technology develops, various sensory stimuli can be collected in service spaces. To enhance the service effectiveness, it is important to determine the optimal stimuli to induce group emotion in the service space to the target emotion. In this paper, we propose a stimuli control system to adjust the group emotion. It is a stand-alone system that can determine optimal stimuli by utility table and modular tree-structured Bayesian networks designed for emotion prediction model proposed in the previous study. To verify the proposed system, we collected data using several scenarios at a kindergarten and a senior welfare center. Each space is equipped with sensors for collection and equipment for controlling stimuli. As a result, the system shows a performance of 78\% in the kindergarten and 80\% in the senior welfare center. The proposed method shows much better performance than other classification methods with lower complexity. Also, reinforcement learning is applied to improving the accuracy of stimuli decision for a positive effect on system performance.},

The proposed algorithm learns a dynamical model of the battery voltage from samples of current and voltage taken on a vehicle. The output of this dynamical model is the sum of two terms: the over-potential and the open circuit voltage. The over-potential model includes an element with fractional order dynamics. The open circuit voltage model is designed to depend on the same parameters as the incremental capacity curve, so the expression of the learnt model can be directly related to the health of the battery. The performance of the new method is assessed in three different batteries with varying states of health. A usable estimation of the incremental capacity curve was attained for low to moderate discharge currents. The state of health estimation produced by the fractional order network was consistently better than statistical and fuzzy models, LSTM and Echo State Networks for all the batteries under study.},

An intelligent system based on fuzzy logic is proposed and the membership functions are defined from defect behavior tendency curves. The proposed hybrid fuzzy logic system is tuned considering the expertise of an operator by means of a set of adaptive regression membership functions. So, the defined rules make possible for the expert system to correlate qualitative inspection of manufactured parts made by an operator with a quantitative inspection, determining the set of appropriate process parameters that produce high quality parts. Experimental results show that the effectiveness is improved and the process time is also reduced in 40\%.},

These technologies are to be developed from a considerable number of experiments which must be carried out by an experienced operator. This paper presents a new method of finding the optimal set of parameters. Here, the performance of the evolution strategy (ES), a stochastic, metaheuristic optimization method, is investigated. It offers the great advantage of finding solutions, even with little knowledge of system behaviour . The method involved a randomized and a derandomized ES, based on a non-elitist (μ,λ)-ES with one parent and four children. The two ES were initialized from an unfavourable starting point (A) and from a favourable starting point (B) to investigate their effectiveness. It could be demonstrated that starting from the unfavourable starting point A the erosion duration t ero could be reduced by a maximum of 77\% with a slightly smaller linear wear of the tool electrode Δl E after 40 trials.},

The primary objective of this work is to address the way the latency in location data acquisition, referred to also as timeliness, can be dealt with. We propose a hybrid method combining machine learning models such as multilayer perceptrons trained in batch mode and online learning methods to perform short-term prediction of vehicle delay data. In this way, stream instances that have not arrived yet from the sensors can be temporarily replaced with predicted values. The method we propose successfully integrates stream mining methods developed for stationary and non-stationary conditions i.e. also the methods developed for concept drifting data streams. For all examined reference data sets and hybridised stream methods, the method reduced prediction error and addressed the risk of using static prediction models not matching or no longer matching the evolving process for which the prediction is performed.},

Many existing salient object detection methods are performed excellently on ground, but, it remains a challenge to detect salient objects in water. Different from common scenes on ground, challenges to underwater salient object detection are posed by poor underwater image quality, uncontrolled underwater objects and environments. Till now, most of existing methods are hindered from adaptability to difficult underwater environments, due to the strong light attenuation and scattering effects. To this end, we propose a novel underwater salient object detection method by combining 2D and 3D visual features. For feature combination, a novel detection model is established by mathematically stimulating the biological vision mechanism of aquatic animals. This model, apart from the 2D visual features i.e. the color and intensity, extracts 3D depth features to arouse the depth sensitivity in the three-dimensional space. These 2D and 3D visual features are combined by our biologically inspirited model, generating comprehensive salient object detection results. Here, aiming to correctly estimate 3D depth features from underwater images, a regional method is used to respectively extract 3D depth features in two regions, namely the artificial light and natural light regions. Evaluations show the diverse and comprehensive performances of various features for underwater salient object detection. High accuracy of our proposed method is demonstrated by comparing to state-of-the-art saliency detection methods on public underwater benchmarks acquired in diverse underwater environments.},

Therefore, we propose a novel but simple framework, namely Question-Led Object Attention (QLOB), to improve the VQA performance by exploring question semantics, fine-grained object information, and the relationship between those two modalities. First, we extract sentence semantics by a question model, and utilize the efficient object detection network to obtain a global visual feature and local features from top r object region proposals. Second, our QLOB attention mechanism selects those question-related object regions. Third, we optimize question model and QLOB attention by a softmax classifier to predict the final answer. Extensive experimental results on three public VQA datasets demonstrate that our QLOB outperforms the state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation is an important but challenging task in the field of medical image analysis. Automatic labeling for different anatomical structures can be useful for disease diagnosis, treatment planning and development/degeneration evaluation. However, due to the large shape and appearance variance among different subjects, accurate and reliable semantic segmentation is difficult for automatic labeling and time-consuming for manual labeling. In this paper, we propose a multi-class semantic segmentation algorithm based on the 3D fully convolutional networks , exploring the multimodal image blocks. The use of multimodal image blocks naturally allows an effective data augmentation . Besides, we also investigated the use of ensemble learning and conditional random fields (CRFs) as the post-processing step, which obtains the spatially consistent segmentation results. Our proposed method was evaluated on two public benchmarks: BRATS2017 and MNI-HiSUB25. For both datasets, the experimental results demonstrated that our method was able to establish an effective semantic segmentation framework with multi-modality data and achieve better performance compared to the conventional fully convolutional network.},

  abstract     = {Along with the fast growing web-based applications, the recommender system is now attracting much attention due to its core function that matches the target users’ interest with the potential resources from the massive online information. Since the recommender system is a user centric application, in this work, we propose a recommendation framework based on user interaction, so as to explore the user’s real-time interest from the instant feedback. Naturally, we utilize the tag information assigned to different resources as the medium for user interaction. During the interaction, the most effective tags will be provided for users to choose, and the chosen tag words will be considered as the personalized preference and utilized to dynamically adjust the recommendation list during the process. However, the interaction procedure may cause the problem of potential false dismissal during the candidate filtering. In this work, we propose to analyze the association between different tags, and utilize the tag co-occurrence to refine the recommendation candidate, so as to avoid false dismissal. To generate the recommendation list from the filtered candidates, we design the representation of user and resource characteristics based on tag information and user historical behavior . We distinguish the significance of each tag word for the corresponding resource item, so as to precisely describe the item feature. Probabilistic matrix factorization is employed in our work to overcome the rating sparsity , which is enhanced by embedding the similar user and resource information. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve more accurate predictions and higher recommendation efficiency.},

Most methods for data-driven segmentation require training examples labeled with segmentation masks. This requirement makes it expensive to annotate new categories, especially in most cases, since only weak label information can be obtained from CT . This paper proposes a new semi-supervised 3D deep neural network to solve this problem. The model outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject by training this network using image-level tag annotations from the DSB dataset and mask annotations from the LUNA dataset. We evaluate our approach in a controlled study on the DSB test dataset. The over-fitting caused by the shortage of training data is alleviated by training two modules alternatively. This model can synchronously extract tag labels and mask labels in a sequence, and combine two objects through one weighted transfer function in the network learning process. The experimental results demonstrate the power of using the proposed method to produce significant improvements in the accuracy of pulmonary nodules detection.},

  abstract     = {Hippocampus plays an important role in the memory and spatial navigation function of human brain. Study on its growth and change during first year of life would assist the investigation of early brain development as well as the biomarker for neurological disorders . With the help of Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging techniques, infant brain at different development stage can be acquired with multiple imaging modalities . In this situation, the longitudinal segmentation of infant hippocampus is highly demanded and feasible for the clinical studies regarding to the hippocampal volume changes. However, since the brain structures undergo dynamic appearance, structural changes and various tissue contrast during the first year of life, substantial challenges will be imposed for ensuring the robustness and accuracy of automatic hippocampus segmentation algorithms . In addition, most of the existing hippocampus segmentation methods generally handle each brain development stage independently without considering the potential longitudinal consistency among different stages. In view of the above factors, we propose a longitudinal classification-regression model for segmenting hippocampus in infant brain MRIs . Generally, our model proceeds on a per-timepoint basis, guided by the output of latter timepoint towards the infant hippocampus in the previous timepoint. The key ingredient of our method is a combination of longitudinal context, static context and appearance learning strategies under the classification-regression forest architecture. Specifically, the longitudinal context is borrowed from the mask of prior-timepoint estimation and the static context is from the current-timepoint estimation. Furthermore, we implement the proposed model in a multi-scale and iterative manner to improve the efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method is evaluated on segmenting infant hippocampi from T1-weighted brain MR images acquired at the age of 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better performance in segmentation accuracy over the state-of-the-art classification and regression random forest model .},

  abstract     = {Dictionary learning (DL) for classification aims to learn a codebook from training samples to enhance the discriminative capability of their coding vectors. But how to determine appropriate features that can best work with the learned dictionary remains an open question. Recently, several joint feature and dictionary learning method have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. The purpose of these methods is to achieve low classification errors by implicitly assuming the costs for all misclassifications, regardless of the original labels, are the same. However, in real applications, this assumption may not hold as different kinds of mistake could produce different losses. Motivated by this concern, we propose a cost-sensitive joint feature and dictionary learning (CS-JFDL) method, in which the features are concurrently learned with the dictionaries. Our method considers the separate misclassification cost objectives during the feature and dictionary learning stages to achieve a minimum overall recognition loss. Thus, the derived feature and dictionary attain cost-sensitive constraints throughout the learning process. Extensive experimental results on both image based face recognition and image set based face recognition demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is better than many state-of-the-art methods.},

However, when encountering strong external interference or blind zones, potential risks will be raised. With the assistance of newly developed technologies and equipment, flight trajectories can be recorded at high frequency, which enhances capabilities of Air Traffic Management systems . A four-dimensional flight trajectory prediction model is put forward in this paper. Combined with sliding windows, Long Short-Term Memory network maintains the long-term features and manages to predict accurate trajectories.

Characteristics of terrains are introduced to our system by digital elevation model. The proposed cubic A* search algorithm provides reasonable path by considering the ultimate dynamic performance of an aircraft. Threat is assessed during the path planning process.

Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions . With introducing a dynamic signal, the difficulty from the unmodeled dynamics is successfully solved. And, by introducing a finite-time stability criterion, an new adaptive finite-time containment control scheme is designed, which ensures all signals are bounded.

We also combine the effectiveness of both stochastic and amortized variational inference to reduce the inference gaps and to alleviate the underfitting problem of variational recommendation. We propose two specific implementations of VASER, both of which explore soft attention mechanism to upweight the important clicks in a session and show that one of them, treating the attention vector as an auxiliary latent factor, can make the variational distribution more expressive, and thus improves the recommendation accuracy over the widely used deterministic attention approaches.

Whereas, the problems of generalization and efficiency for ECG biometric recognition are still challenging. In this paper, we propose a new generic convolutional neural network (CNN) approach ( i.e. , Cascaded CNN) to realize human identification via ECG biometric identification. In our method, two CNNs are trained progressively. The first CNN called F-CNN is used for feature extraction of ECG heartbeats, and the second one called M-CNN is used for biometric comparison (identification). The trained F-CNN and M-CNN are cascaded to compose the Cascaded CNN as the final identification network. One of the main characteristics of the proposed method is the strong generalization ability . Once the Cascaded CNN is constructed, it can be used for various groups with variable number of members for human identification, which meets the practical demands greatly. Experiments are conducted on five public datasets in PhysioNet to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. By the Cascaded CNN, an average identification rate of 94.3\% is achieved without re-training and any fine-tuning for the four test datasets. Moreover, only two milliseconds are needed for once comparison operation. Because of the generalization ability and real-time efficiency, it is feasible to promote the application of the proposed method for biometric identification via ECG in practice.},

  abstract     = {Most of the existing Zero-Shot Learning(ZSL) algorithms adopt pre-trained neural networks as their feature extractors. Since these pre-trained models are not specially designed for ZSL tasks, it is difficult to guarantee the stability and generalization ability of the ZSL algorithms due to the feature mismatch. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel dataset-specific feature extractor for ZSL according to an attribute-based label tree. Specifically, an attribute-based label tree is firstly built via K-means clustering and then the information extracted from the label tree is used to fine-tune the parameters of the pre-trained models in order to make the extracted features more suitable for the current ZSL task. The experimental results on three typical ZSL datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the predictive accuracy of the existing ZSL algorithms and significantly accelerate their convergence rate. Additionally we explain the experimental phenomena from the perspective of feature visualization, which experimentally show that the features extracted by our method are much more separable than those of the original pre-trained models.},

In this paper, we introduce a tag recommendation by text classification . We explore the capsule network with dynamic routing for the tag recommendation task. The capsule network encodes the intrinsic spatial relationship between a part and a whole constituting viewpoint invariant knowledge that automatically generalizes to novel viewpoints. In addition, an attention mechanism is incorporated into the capsule network to distill important information from the input documents. We conduct extensive experiments on large publication datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The experimental results demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms the compared baseline methods and achieves the state-of-the-art results.},

To solve the problem that existing features can not accurately identify different emotions, we extract two kinds features, i. e., Interspeech 2010 and deep features for audio data, LBP and deep features for visual data, with the intent to accurately identify different emotions by using different features. Owing to the diversity of features, SVM classifiers and CNN are designed for manual features, i.e., Interspeech 2010 features and local LBP features, and deep features, through which four sub-models are obtained. Finally, the blending ensemble algorithm is used to fuse sub-models to improve the recognition performance of visual-audio emotion recognition. In addition, multi-task learning is applied in the CNN model for deep features, which can predict multiple tasks at the same time with fewer parameters and improve the sensitivity of the single recognition model to user’s emotion by sharing information between different tasks. Experiments are performed using eNTERFACCE database, from which the results indicate that the recognition of multi-task CNN increased by 3\% and 2\% on average over CNN model in speaker-independent and speaker-dependent experiments, respectively.

  abstract     = {In the recent years, there have been remarkable improvements in the semantic segmentation based on deep convolutional neural networks . However, DCNN-based weakly supervised segmentation approaches are still inferior to the fully supervised manner. We observe that the performance gap mainly comes from the limitation of producing high-quality dense object localization clues from image-level labels. To mitigate this gap, in this paper, we are committed to finding more precise and complete pixel-level annotations from image-level tags. So this paper proposes a new iterative training framework for progressively refining pixel-wise labels and training the segmentation network . We first propose a new attention map generating method to locate more discriminative object regions. To find out less-discriminative regions and rectify wrong object location clues, the method fuses saliency map into the attention map to generate the initial pseudo pixel-level annotations. In the iteration training process, we train the segmentation network by treating pseudo pixel-level annotations as supervision. In order to correct the inaccurate labels of segmentation masks produced by current segmentation network, a superpixel-CRF refinement model is exploited to produce more accurate pixel-level annotations and use these annotations as supervision to train the segmentation network again. Our framework iterates between refining pixel-level annotations and optimizing the segmentation network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms other previous weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods, and obtains the state-of-the-art performance, which are 64.7\% mIoU score on PASCAL VOC 2012 test set and 26.3\% mIoU score on MS COCO validation set.},

In this paper, we introduce a directional attention weaving (DAW) mechanism to represent dialog context more comprehensively in two aspects. First, we use self-attention on each level of the question-aware passage hidden representation to collect global information for each question as conversation history input, which is referred to multi-round self-alignment. Second, different from existing methods using forward recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to pass the limited dialog context information, which is inefficient to deal with long conversation history and topic return, a unidirectional attention mechanism is proposed to build the history-aware passage representations by computing the attentions along the dialog progression. The DAW mechanism is used to build our model named CANet. We evaluate the proposed model on the CoQA dataset and achieve competitive results in published models, outperforming the published baselines on the hidden test dataset by a substantial margin. The further analysis shows that our DAW mechanism can be flexibly applied to powerful single-turn MRC models, and effective to augment the representations of dialog history to cater to long conversation and topic return settings.},

  abstract     = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is highly relevant to many real-world domains like safety, security, and in particular healthcare. The current machine learning technology of HAR is highly human-dependent which makes it costly and unreliable in non-stationary environment. Existing HAR algorithms assume that training data is collected and annotated by human a prior to the training phase. Furthermore, the data is assumed to exhibit the true characteristics of the underlying distribution. In this paper, we propose a new autonomous approach that consists of novel algorithms. In particular, we adopt active learning (AL) strategy to selectively query the user/resident about the label of particular activities in order to improve the model accuracy. This strategy helps overcome the challenge of labelling sequential data with time dependency which is highly time-consuming and difficult. Because of the changes that may affect the way activities are performed, we regard sensor data as a stream and human activity learning as an online continuous process. In such process the leaner can adapt to changes, incorporate novel activities and discard obsolete ones. To this extent, we propose a novel semi-supervised classifier (OSC) that works together with a novel Bayesian stream-based active learning (BSAL). Because of the changes in the sensor layouts across different houses’ settings, we use Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) to handle the features engineering issue by learning the features regardless of the environment settings. CRBM is then applied to extract low-level features from unlabelled raw high-dimensional activity input. The resulting approach will then tackle the challenges of activity recognition using a three-module architecture composed of a feature extractor (CRBM), an online semi-supervised classifier (OSC) equipped with BSAL. CRBM-BSAL-OSC allows completely autonomous learning that adjusts to the environment setting, explores the changes and adapt to them. The paper provides the theoretical details of the proposed approach as well as an extensive empirical study to evaluate the performance of the approach.},

The second architecture, called Linear-Morphological Neural Network (LMNN) is composed of one or several perceptron layers as a feature extractor, it is then followed by an output layer of morphological neurons for non-linear classification. Both architectures are trained by stochastic gradient descent . One of the main contributions of this paper is to show that the morphological layer offers a greater capacity to extract features than the perceptron layer. This claim is supported both theoretically and experimentally. We prove that the morphological layer possesses a greater capacity per computation unit to segment the 2D input space than the perceptron layer. In other words, adding more hyper-boxes produces more response regions than adding hyperplanes . From an empirical point of view, we test the two new models on 25 standard datasets at low dimensionality and one big data dataset. The result is that MLNN requires a lesser number of learning parameters than the other tested architectures while achieving better accuracies.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that any kind of time series algorithm requires past information to model the inherent temporal relationship between past and future. This temporal dependency (i.e. number of past samples required for a good prediction) is generally addressed by feeding a number of past instances to the model in an empirical manner. Conventional approaches mostly rely on offline model, making them impractical to be adopted in the online or streaming context. Hence, a novel method of online temporality analysis is proposed in this paper. The estimated temporality is then employed to form an Adaptive Temporal Neural Network (ATNN) with an elastic memory capable of automatically selecting number of past samples to be used. Temporality change or drift can be a common occurrence in data streams. Hence a drift detection mechanism is also proposed. Once such drift is detected, a drift handling mechanism kicks in which utilizes the rate of drift, making our solution truly autonomous. The entire mechanism is termed as LEMON: Learning Elastic Memory Online. LEMON although not a time series model in itself, can work with any predictive models to improve their performance. Synthetic datasets are used here as proof of correct temporality estimation and drift detection whereas real world datasets are employed to demonstrate how LEMON improves the predictive performance and speed of an existing model with the knowledge of temporality and drift.},

  abstract     = {Kinematics simulation is central to the control of serial manipulators in human machine interaction, which highly depends upon computational efficiency and accuracy for the sake of enabling real-time analysis and interaction. In this paper, a novel learning-based multiscale modelling approach is proposed to effectively address the efficiency and accuracy trade-offs through a combination of models with different levels of fidelity. Specifically, low-fidelity models are formulated using Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) to achieve much lower computational cost as its kinematic approximation . Additionally, high-fidelity models are created based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network , which can calibrate fidelity by training the significant samples and eliminate position singularity of a serial manupulator. The proposed approach is evaluated both by using numerical tests and by applying it to a collaborative industrial robot arm. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that it can achieve better performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared with the other popular methods.},

We employ radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to estimate human motion intention in real time, and least square method is utilized in robot learning of human impedance. When robot has learned the impedance information about human, it can adjust its desired impedance parameters by a simple tuning law for operative compliance. An adaptive impedance control integrated with RBFNNs and full-state constraints is also proposed in our work. We employ RBFNNs to compensate for uncertainties in the dynamics model of robot and barrier Lyapunov functions are chosen to ensure that full-state constraints are not violated in pHRI.

Traditional traffic police gesture recognition methods rely on depth-sensor or wearable-devices, which limits their availability in the domain of the intelligent vehicle. Vision-based methods have fewer requirements for distance, but the modeling process is challenging due to the complexity of the visual scenes. Inspired by the recent success in vision-based pose estimation networks such as Convolutional Pose Machine (CPM), in this paper, we propose a novel vision-based human-machine interface to recognize eight kinds of Chinese traffic police gestures and apply it in the real-time recognition tasks. This method integrates a modified CPM network and two kinds of handcrafted features: Relative Bone Length and Angle with Gravity as spatial domain features, and adopt a Long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal domain features. To train and validate our method, we create a gestures dataset with two hours of traffic police gesture videos, which has 3354 gesture instances. The experiment results show that the proposed method is capable of recognizing traffic police gestures, and is fast enough for online gesture prediction.},

Traditional representations of indoor place almost utilize image feature to retain the spatial structure without considering the object’s semantic characteristics. However, we argue that the attributes, state and relationships of objects are much more helpful in indoor place recognition. In particular, we improve the recognition framework by utilizing Place Descriptors (PDs) in text from to connect different types of place information with their categories. Meanwhile, we analyse the ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification in natural language, for which we use them to process the indoor place descriptions. In addition, we improve the robustness of the designed deep neural network by combining a number of effective strategies, i.e. L2-regularization, data normalization, and proper calibration of key parameters.

  abstract     = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs a child&#39;s ability to communicate and interact with others. Usually, recognizing a child with ASD needs the diagnosis by professional doctors. However, it is not only expensive and time-consuming, but also the results are influenced by subjective factors, such as the experience of a doctor. Recently, some methods which identify ASD based on biomarkers have been developed, but there are rarely works specific to raw video data. This paper is the first attempt to help diagnose the children with ASD in raw video data using a deep learning technique . Firstly, in order to investigate different gaze patterns between ASD children and typically developing (TD) children, we track the eye movement in each video by the tracking-learning-detection method. Secondly, we divide these tracking trajectories into two components: (i) the length; and (ii) the angle. Afterwards, we calculate an accumulative histogram for each component. Finally, we adopt three-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for classification. Experimental results on our extended dataset (Ext-Dataset) containing 272 videos captured from 136 ASD children and 136 TD children show the LSTM network outperforms the traditional machine learning methods, e.g., Support Vector Machine , with the improvement of accuracy by 6.2\% (from 86.4\% to 92.6\%). Especially, for ASD, we obtain the sensitivity (the true positive rate, TPR) of 91.9\% and the specificity (the true negative rate, TNR) of 93.4\%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.},

For single image frame gaze estimation, we improve the conventional Itracker by removing the face-grid and reducing one network branch via concatenating the two-eye region images. Experimental results show that our improved Itracker obtains 11.6\% significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on MPIIGaze dataset and has robust estimation accuracy for different image resolutions under the premise of greatly reducing network complexity. For video sequence gaze estimation, by employing the bi-LSTM to fit the temporal information between frames, experimental results on EyeDiap dataset further demonstrate 3\% accuracy improvement.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent bus system plays a key role in the modern smart city. The number of passengers in the buses or at the stations is necessary for making an optimal scheduling policy of public buses. We develop a crowd counting algorithm to provide the counting information for a bus dispatch system in a human–machine system. In consideration of the challenges (e.g., pedestrian occlusions, non-uniform crowd distributions, and scale variations) existed in hand-crafted features based crowd counting, a scale-distribution-aware multi-column convolutional neural network (SDA-MCNN) is presented to count crowds by summing up the output (denoted as the density map) of the SDA-MCNN. The SDA-MCNN is robust to scale variations by processing a crowd image with multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) columns and minimizing the per-scale loss. A weighted Euclidean loss is proposed to handle non-uniform crowd distributions. The loss can increase activations in dense regions and restrain activations in backgrounds. A new approach to estimate perspective maps of dense crowds is put forward to offer necessary information for generating density maps with human-shaped kernels. Evaluations on benchmarks are performed with other state-of-the-art counting approaches using deep neural networks. Comparative results verify the accuracy of our counting approach in challenging crowds. Evaluations on the real world BUS data reveal the accuracy of the proposed approach in counting passengers in spite of the complex environment.},

To deal with the system’s unstructured nonlinear uncertain dynamics, novel adaptive neural network (NN) learning control strategies are proposed by extending methodologies from the continuous-time deterministic learning theory. Both state-feedback and output-feedback cases are considered. The proposed control schemes are compelling in the sense that (i) they are capable of rendering not only stable tracking control , but also locally-accurate learning/identification of unknown system dynamics during stable closed-loop control; (ii) the learned knowledge can be effectively represented and stored as constant NN models, whose weights are guaranteed to partially converge to ideal/optimal values. Based on this, experience-based controllers are also developed to pursue improved tracking control performance without online adaptation. In particular for the output-feedback control case, a new observer-less adaptive NN learning control scheme is proposed without resorting to high-gain observers, followed by an observer-less output-feedback experience-based controller. Numerical simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

In this paper, we propose a scalable spectral ensemble clustering method via building a representative co-association matrix to improve the ensemble clustering problem. Our method mainly includes constructing a sparse matrix to select the representative points and building the co-association matrix, and a robust and denoising representation for the co-association matrix can be learned through a low-rank constraint in a unified optimization framework. The experiments verify the high efficiency and scalability but less time cost of our method compared with state-of-art clustering methods in the six real-world datasets, especially in the large-scale datasets.},

Inspired by a recent work that embeds neighborhood information among users (as represented by multiclass preference context, MPC) into a factorization-based method, we extend it to both user-oriented and item-oriented, and put forward both user-oriented MPC and item-oriented MPC into a generic factorization framework called matrix factorization with heterogeneous MPC (MF-HMPC). In particular, we derive two specific recommendation methods from MF-HMPC with different structures, including MF with dual MPC (MF-DMPC) and MF with pipelined MPC (MF-PMPC), which are corresponding to concurrent structure and sequential structure, respectively. Extensive empirical studies on four public datasets show that our two forms of MF-HMPC outperform the referenced state-of-the-art MF methods as well as two representative deep learning methods . Moreover, we also discover some interesting facts about how these two kinds of internal contextual information complement each other. The main advantage of our methods is that they manage to strike a good balance between user-oriented neighborhood information and item-oriented neighborhood information.},

Model-based fixed-time control for the robot has been proposed based on an assumption parameters of the robot are completely known. To deal with the uncertainties of the robot and improve the stability of the robot, the adaptive neural network approximation method is proposed. Compared with existing works, the proposed control scheme can not only eliminate the influence of input deadzone, but also make all the state variables converge to a small region of zero in fixed-time, which can accelerate the convergence speed and improve the transient performance of the tracking control for the robot. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed control algorithm, extensive simulations are carried on two joint robot manipulator.},

  abstract     = {The major disadvantage of supervised methods for action recognition is the need for a large amount of annotated data, where the data is matched to its label accurately. To address this issue, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) is introduced. Zero short learning primarily uses data that is synthesized to compensate for lack of training examples. In this paper, two different approaches are proposed for the synthesis of artificial examples for novel classes; namely, inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) based generative model and bi-directional adversarial GAN(Bi-dir GAN). A consequence of the proposed approach is a transductive setting using a semi-supervised variational autoencoder , where the unlabelled data from unseen classes are used to train the model. This enables the generation of novel class examples from textual descriptions. The proposed models perform well in the following settings, namely, i) Standard setting(ZSL), where the test data comes only from unseen classes, and ii) Generalized setting(GZSL), where the test data comes from both seen and unseen classes. In the case of the generalized setting, examples with pseudo labels are generated for unseen classes. Experiments are performed on three baseline datasets, UCF101, HMDB51, and Olympic. In comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, both the proposed models, IAF based generative model and Bi-dir GAN model outperform in UCF101, and Olympic datasets in all the settings and achieve comparative results in HMDB51.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering is an unsupervised method which aims to enhance the clustering performance by combining the knowledge from multiple view data. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is one of the most favourable multi-view clustering methods due to its strong representation ability of non-negative data. However, NMF only factorizes the data matrix into two non-negative factor matrices, which may limit its ability to learn higher level and more complex hierarchical information. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a multi-view clustering method based on deep graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (MvDGNMF). MvDGNMF is able to extract more abstract representation by constructing a multilayer NMF model with graph Laplacian regularization and drive the last layer representation from each view to a common consensus representation. Meanwhile, an efficient algorithm using alternating multiplicative update rules is developed. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed method, we employ several open datasets including image and text datasets to evaluate the clustering performance of MvDGNMF and the state-of-art methods.},

This assumption doesn’t always hold true, especially when the data from the two domains are heterogeneous with different resolutions. In such case, the most suitable numbers of layers for the source domain data and the target domain data would differ. As a result, the high level knowledge from the source domain would be transferred to the wrong layer of target domain. Based on this observation, “where to transfer” proposed in this paper might be a novel research area. We propose a new mathematic model named DT-LET to solve this heterogeneous transfer learning problem. In order to select the best matching of layers to transfer knowledge, we define specific loss function to estimate the corresponding relationship between high-level features of data in the source domain and the target domain. To verify this proposed cross-layer model, experiments for two cross-domain recognition/classification tasks are conducted, and the achieved superior results demonstrate the necessity of layer correspondence searching.},

The existing text classification methods based on deep neural networks can completely extract the local features of text. The text classification models constructed based on these methods yield good experimental results. However, these methods generally ignore the global semantic information of different categories of text and global spatial distance between categories. To some extent, this adversely affects the accuracy of classification. In this study, to address this problem, Siamese capsule networks with global and local features were proposed. A Siamese network was used to glean information about the global semantic differences between categories, which could more accurately represent the semantic distance between different categories. A global memory mechanism was established to store global semantic features , which were then incorporated into the text classification model. Capsule vectors were used to obtain the spatial position relationships of local features, thereby improving the representation capabilities of the features. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved better results and performed significantly better on six different public datasets, as compared with ten baseline algorithms.},

These systems require algorithms that can learn successful policies with independent agents that rely solely on local partial-observations of the environment. However, multi-agent environments are more complex, due to their partial-observability and non-stationarity from an agent’s perspective, as well as the structural credit assignment problem and the curse of dimensionality, and achieving coordination in such systems remains a complex challenge. To this end, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic algorithm called Asynchronous Advantage Actor Centralized-Critic with Communication (A3C3). A3C3 uses a centralized critic to estimate a value function, decentralized actors to approximate each agent’s policy function, and decentralized communication networks for each agent to share relevant information with its team. The critic can incorporate additional information, like the environment’s global state, when available, and optimizes the actor networks. The actor networks of an agent’s teammates optimize that agent’s communication network, such that each agent learns to output information that is relevant to the policies of others. A3C3 supports a dynamic amount of agents, noisy communication mediums, and can be horizontally scaled to shorten its learning phase. We evaluate A3C3 in two partially-observable multi-agent suites where agents benefit from communicating local information to each other. A3C3 outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent algorithms, independent approaches, and centralized controllers with access to all agents’ observations.},

However, in the practical RFID indoor localization application scenarios, the RFID readers need to keep working for an extensive time. When some readers malfunction and fail to be repaired in time, the existing algorithms usually cannot maintain the accuracy of the original localization system. In this paper, we propose an RFID reader-fault-adaptive localization algorithm based on online sequential fuzzy broad learning system, called RF-OSFBLS algorithm. The RF-OSFBLS algorithm improves the fuzzy broad learning system (FBLS) with the ability of online sequential learning (OSFBLS) by using the updating algorithm, so that it can process data streams that continue to arrive in the environment. Meanwhile, RF-OSFBLS algorithm proposes RFID reader-fault-adaptive strategy by introducing a transformation matrix , which can process subsequent data streams when reader fault occurs. We have carried out experiments to study the influence factors and validate the performance, both the simulation and realistic experiment results show that our proposed RF-OSFBLS algorithm can achieve better positioning effect and maintain a relatively high accuracy in the dynamically changing and reader-fault environment.},

With the utilization of the structural characteristics of combinatorial optimization problems and the ability to extract the rule behind the data by deep learning , pointer network has been successfully applied to solve several classical combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, a pointer network based algorithm is designed to solve UBQP problems. The network model is trained by supervised learning (SL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) respectively. Trained pointer network models are evaluated by self-generated benchmark dataset and ORLIB dataset respectively. Experimental results show that pointer network model trained by SL has strong learning ability to specific distributed dataset. Pointer network model trained by DRL can learn more general distribution data characteristics. In other words, it can quickly solve problems with great generalization ability . As a result, the framework proposed in this paper for UBQP has great potential to solve large scale combinatorial optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Due to the various emerging technologies, an enormous amount of data, termed as Big Data, gets collected every day and can be of great use in various domains. Clustering algorithms that store the entire data into memory for analysis become unfeasible when the dataset is too large. Many clustering algorithms present in the literature deal with the analysis of huge amount of data. The paper discusses a new clustering approach called an Incremental Random Sampling with Iterative Optimization Fuzzy c-Means (IRSIO-FCM) algorithm. It is implemented on Apache Spark , a framework for Big Data processing . Sparks works really well for iterative algorithms by supporting in-memory computations, scalability, etc. IRSIO-FCM not only facilitates effective clustering of Big Data but also performs storage space optimization during clustering. To establish a fair comparison of IRSIO-FCM, we propose an incremental version of the Literal Fuzzy c-Means (LFCM) called ILFCM implemented in Apache Spark framework. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of time and space complexity, NMI, ARI , speedup, sizeup, and scaleup measures. The reported results show that IRSIO-FCM achieves a significant reduction in run-time in comparison with ILFCM.},

  abstract     = {In the last few years, many research works have been suggested on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which assists severely physically disabled persons to communicate directly with the help of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, generated by the thought process of the brain. Thought generation inside the brain is a dynamic process, and plenty thoughts occur within a small time window. Thus, there is a need for a BCI device that can distinguish these various ideas simultaneously. In this research work, our previous binary-class mental task classification has been extended to the multi-class mental task problem. The present work proposed a novel feature construction scheme for multi mental task classification. In the proposed method, features are extracted in two phases. In the first step, the wavelet transform is used to decompose EEG signal. In the second phase, each feature component obtained is represented compactly using eight parameters (statistical and uncertainty measures). After that, a set of relevant and non-redundant features is selected using linear regression, a multivariate feature selection approach. Finally, optimal decision tree based support vector machine (ODT-SVM) classifier is used for multi mental task classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the publicly available dataset for 3-class, 4-class, and 5-class mental task classification. Experimental results are compared with existing methods, and it is observed that the proposed plan provides better classification accuracy in comparison to the existing methods for 3-class, 4-class, and 5-class mental task classification. The efficacy of the proposed method encourages that the proposed method may be helpful in developing BCI devices for multi-class classification.},

  abstract     = {Multiscale inherent fuzzy entropy is an objective measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) complexity, reflecting the habituation of brain systems. Entropy dynamics are generally believed to reflect the ability of the brain to adapt to a visual stimulus environment. In this study, we explored repetitive steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based EEG complexity by assessing multiscale inherent fuzzy entropy with relative measurements. We used a wearable EEG device with Oz and Fpz electrodes to collect EEG signals from 40 participants under the following three conditions: a resting state (closed-eyes (CE) and open-eyes (OE) stimulation with five 15-Hz CE SSVEPs and stimulation with five 20-Hz OE SSVEPs. We noted monotonic enhancement of occipital EEG relative complexity with increasing stimulus times in CE and OE conditions. The occipital EEG relative complexity was significantly higher for the fifth SSVEP than for the first SSEVP (FDR-adjusted p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the prefrontal EEG relative complexity tended to be significantly higher in the OE condition compared to that in the CE condition (FDR-adjusted p &lt; 0.05). The results also indicate that multiscale inherent fuzzy entropy is superior to other competing multiscale-based entropy methods. In conclusion, EEG relative complexity increases with stimulus times, a finding that reflects the strong habituation of brain systems. These results suggest that multiscale inherent fuzzy entropy is an EEG pattern with which brain complexity can be assessed using repetitive SSVEP stimuli.},

  abstract     = {Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, natural language, and audio tasks. It shows excellent ability in dealing with specific tasks with surpassing efficiency and accuracy. However, researches indicated that deep neural models are extremely vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbation. In image classification domain, crafted images with adversarial perturbation can fool deep neural models into misclassifying. Specific researches revealed that adversarial examples crafted by attack methods show substantial pixel modification strength, which causes lower similarity between the clean and corresponding sample and makes the change in crafted samples visible. To address the issues mentioned above, we propose an adversarial attack method, which generates adversarial perturbation based on adaptive root mean square gradient strategy. In our proposed approach, we formulate adversarial perturbation based on an adaptive gradient at root mean square level during crafting adversarial sample. Due to the adaptive strategy, the proposed method searches the decision boundary between the original and the adversarial classes in latent space directly by searching the extremum of loss. It helps to generate adversarial samples with higher image quality and better transferability on fooling multiple deep neural models. We evaluate several state-of-the-art attack methods with proposed methods. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform modern techniques in crafting adversarial sample with slight pixel modification, and excellent efficiency in fooling classifiers in both no-targeted and targeted attack strategies.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied to saliency object detection (SOD) with promising performance. However, the coarse feature resolutions due to a series of pooling and convolutional operations in CNNs considerably decrease the original image resolution, resulting in losing spatial details and fine structures, especially on salient object boundaries. To address this issue, we present a recurrent reverse attention based residual learning network for SOD. We first construct a pair of low-and high-level integrated feature representations by aggregating two groups of low-and high-level feature maps, respectively, among which we design a novel joint feature pyramid pooling module to increase the high-level feature resolution. Afterwards, we progressively learn to refine the residual between each side-output saliency prediction and the ground-truth in a cascaded fashion by alternatively using the high-level and low-level integrated features. Each residual learning module contains a recurrent reverse attention module that focuses on the residual region outside the current predicted salient regions , guiding the network to learn the missing salient parts and details. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective boundary detection loss to compensate the detailed texture loss. Extensive evaluations on six popular SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate remarkable performance boosting of our proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods. Especially, our approach runs in real-time with a speed of 32 fps.},

Due to the curse of dimensionality, general causal discovery methods such as constraint-based methods and functional model based methods are not quite effective and efficient for large and high-dimensional data sets. Thus, some causal partitioning methods have been proposed to handle this problem. However, existing causal partitioning methods rely on high-order conditional independent (CI) tests, which makes them inefficient in handling dense causal graphs. Therefore, high-dimensionality is still a big challenge to these methods. In this work, we propose a new split-and-merge strategy to enable effective and scalable causality discovery. Different from the existing methods, our method uses only low-order CI tests, can get more accurate results and is applicable to various scenarios. We provide both theoretic analysis and empirical evaluation on the proposed method. Experiments on various real-world causal graphs show that the proposed method outperforms the stat-of-the-art method in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability. For high-dimensional cases, our method is much faster than the counterpart by one to three orders of magnitudes.},

VSSI-ARD explores the sparseness of current sources on the variation domain by employing ARD prior under empirical Bayesian framework . With convex analysis, the sources are efficiently obtained by solving a series of reweighting L 21 -norm regularization problems with ADMM . By virtue of the iterative reweighting process and sparse signal processing techniques , VSSI-ARD gets rid of the small amplitude dipoles that are more probably outside the extent of underlying sources. With the sparsity enforced on the edges using ARD prior, the estimations show clear boundaries between active and background regions without subjective thresholds. Validation with both simulated and human experimental data indicates that VSSI-ARD not only estimates the localizations of sources, but also provides relatively useful and accurate information about the extents of cortical activities.},

How best to extract dynamical functional network structure and coefficient time series from neural data remains an open problem. We developed a new method, which called stability-driven non-negative matrix factorization (staNMF), that combines non-negative matrix factorization with a novel data-driven model selection criterion to decompose dynamic functional networks into sets of superposed subnetworks. To evaluate our method, we first use simulated noisy connectivity networks to demonstrate that staNMF is able to find the correct number of subnetworks, obtain the connectivity matrix of each subnetwork, and recover the corresponding activation coefficient time series. We then apply staNMF to a resting state EEG dataset recorded from 41 five-year-old children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 44 age-matched typically-developing (TD) children. StaNMF extracted several robust and biologically interpretable subnetworks for which significant differences between ASD and TD could be found. Specifically, the strength of the activation coefficient time series of one identified local connections subnetwork was higher in ASD children than in TD. Several subnetworks that had interhemispheric, long-range connections had lower energy of activation coefficient time series in ASD compared to TD. In conclusion, the analyses on simulated and real EEG data demonstrate that staNMF can be used to characterize dynamic functional networks, making it a promising tool for investigating disorders using resting-state EEG.},

The interactive attention mechanisms are proposed which automatically select salient positional sentence representations, that contribute more significantly towards the relevance between two question and answer. A new quantity called context information jump is proposed to facilitate the formulation of the attention weights, and is computed via the joint states of adjacent words. An interactive-aware sentence representation is constructed by connecting a combination of multiple sentence positional representations to each hidden representation state.

  abstract     = {Adaptive nonlinear optimal control methods , as proposed in the literature, give rise to some questions around practical implementation in robotics, especially how to find a solution in a reasonable time and how to deal with gravity. This paper proposes a method to solve these problems by using a neural network with local basis-function domains, specifically the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC). The algorithm uses the local domains in order to keep track of the value of local cost-functionals. In this way, it can freeze the learning of the network’s weights in a feedforward-like component in the CMAC when the bias has been overcome identified by using an error-based cost-functional e.g. automatic gravity compensation in a robot. After the feedforward component has been established, the algorithm then starts to learn another set of weights which contribute to feedback-like terms in the CMAC and these weights get frozen when they no longer reduce a cost-functional that includes additional control effort e.g. in a robot the control effort beyond that needed to compensate for gravity is penalized. Lyapunov methods guarantee uniformly ultimately bounded signals and ensure weight drift and bursting do not occur. One advantage is that the training time for finding a near-optimal control does not increase over previous neural-adaptive methods. Another advantage is that penalizing the control effort in a search for optimization does result in any steady-state error due to gravity. Simulations show that the proposed method significantly outperforms a standard adaptive-CMAC control using e-modification, without increasing control effort or training time. An experimental flexible-joint robot verifies that the adaptive method significantly outperforms a linear quadratic regulator.},

  abstract     = {Matrix completion is extensively studied due to its wide applications in science and technology. In this paper, we concentrate our study on the matrix completion problem for image analysis tasks due to their immense importance and pervasive use in many fields. A rich collection of models has been proposed to capture both linear and nonlinear relationships latent in a matrix. Even though nonlinear models possess more powerful matrix completion capabilities than their linear counterparts, these models generally carry higher model complexity and tuning difficulties. To take advantage of the superior discriminative power offered by nonlinear models while curbing its deployment overheads, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear matrix completion model utilizing a deep learning-based approach. In contrast to existing nonlinear models, the new model carefully explores and exploits spatial locality among adjacent matrix elements exhibited in patches of various sizes and locations in a target matrix. Building upon this idea, a new patch-based nonlinear matrix completion algorithm is designed. The algorithm leverages a convolutional neural network to learn the predictive relationship between a matrix element and its surrounding elements through an end-to-end trainable fashion, leading to a capable and easy-to-deploy nonlinear matrix completion solution. To identify an optimal patch size suited for tackling a given matrix completion task without exhaustively enumerating all candidate patch sizes, the new algorithm is coupled with a fast stochastic search procedure, yielding a good trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm for nonlinear matrix completion problem in comparison with a series of state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the superiority of the new algorithm in completing images with a variety of random and textual noises.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel Multilayer Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-IT2-FELM) for the recognition of walking activities and Gait events is presented. The ML-IT2-FELM uses a hierarchical learning scheme that consists of multiple layers of IT2 Fuzzy Autoencoders (FAEs), followed by a final classification layer based on an IT2-FELM architecture. The core building block in the ML-IT2-FELM is an IT2-FELM, which is a generalised model of the Interval Type-2 Radial Basis Function Neural Network (IT2-RBFNN) and that is functionally equivalent to a class of simplified IT2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs). Each FAE in the ML-IT2-FELM employs an output layer with a direct-defuzzification process based on the Nie-Tan algorithm, while the IT2-FELM classifier includes a Karnik-Mendel type-reduction method (KM). Real data was collected using three inertial measurements units attached to the thigh, shank and foot of twelve healthy participants. The validation of the ML-IT2-FELM method is performed with two different experiments. The first experiment involves the recognition of three different walking activities: Level-Ground Walking (LGW), Ramp Ascent (RA) and Ramp Descent (RD). The second experiment consists of the recognition of stance and swing phases during the gait cycle. In addition, to compare the efficiency of the ML-IT2-FELM with other ML fuzzy methodologies, a kernel-based ML-IT2-FELM that is inspired by kernel learning and called KML-IT2-FELM is also implemented. The results from the recognition of walking activities and gait events achieved an average accuracy of 99.98\% and 99.84\% with a decision time of 290.4ms and 105ms, respectively, by the ML-IT2-FELM, while the KML-IT2-FELM achieved an average accuracy of 99.98\% and 99.93\% with a decision time of 191.9ms and 94ms. The experiments demonstrate that the ML-IT2-FELM is not only an effective Fuzzy Logic-based approach in the presence of sensor noise, but also a fast extreme learning machine for the recognition of different walking activities.},

  abstract     = {To ensure the sustainability of the soil ecosystem, which is the basis for food production, efficient large-scale baseline predictions and trend assessments of key soil properties are necessary. In that regard, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared (VNIR–SWIR) spectroscopy can provide an alternative for the expensive wet chemistry. In this paper, we examined the application of the Multiple-Kernel Learning (MKL) approach to soil spectroscopy by integrating the information from heterogeneous features. In particular, the proposed three-level MKL framework acts in the following way: at the first level, it uses multiple kernels at each spectral feature (wavelength) to maximize the information of each band. At the second level, it performs implicit feature selection at the spectral source level, enabling it to provide interpretable results. Finally, at the third level of integration it combines the complementary information contained within a pool of spectral sources, each derived from its own set of pre-processing techniques. Additionally, at this stage, the proposed approach is also capable of fusing heterogeneous sources of information, such as auxiliary predictors, which can assist the spectral predictions. The experimental analysis was conducted using the pan-European LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey) topsoil database, with a goal to predict from the VNIR–SWIR spectra the concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC), a key indicator for agricultural productivity and environmental resilience. The particle size distribution which describes the soil texture was selected as the set of auxiliary predictors. The proposed MKL framework was compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, and the results indicated that it attains the best performance in terms of accuracy, whilst at the same time producing interpretable results.},

In fact, besides reinforcement and extinction, classical conditional reflex also contains generalization and differentiation. In this paper, a memristor-based circuit is designed to implement generalization and differentiation based on Pavlov associative memory . This circuit can respond to one kind of conditional stimulus after the initial learning, then when another similar stimulus is applied to the circuit, the circuit responds similarily, this is the phenomenon of generalization. To make the circuit be sufficiently cognizant of these two similar stimuli and ultimately distinguish them, a special training method, which selectively reinforces one stimulus while inhibits another similar stimulus, is used to train the whole circuit. As a result, when these two similar stimuli are applied to the circuit separately again, it can respond to them differently. This is the phenomenon of differentiation. Finally, the correctness of implementing these functions described above are demonstrated by simulation results in PSPICE.},

The first stage detects the 2D keypoints and 2D bounding boxes of objects by a stable end-to-end framework. During the training phase, this framework uses viewpoint transformation information and object saliency regions to learn geometrically and semantically consistent keypoints. Then the 6D poses of objects are calculated by a series of geometric reasoning algorithms in the second stage. Experiments show that our method achieves accurate pose estimation and robust to occluded and cluttered scenes.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian detection has achieved great improvements with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNN can learn high-level features from input images, but the insufficient spatial resolution of CNN feature channels (feature maps) may cause a loss of information, which is harmful especially to small instances. In this paper, we propose a new pedestrian detection framework, which extends the successful RPN+BF framework to combine handcrafted features and CNN features. RoI-pooling is used to extract features from both handcrafted channels (e.g. HOG+LUV, CheckerBoards or RotatedFilters) and CNN channels. Since handcrafted channels always have higher spatial resolution than CNN channels, we apply RoI-pooling with larger output resolution to handcrafted channels to keep more detailed information. Our ablation experiments show that the developed handcrafted features can reach better detection accuracy than the CNN features extracted from the VGG-16 net, and a performance gain can be achieved by combining them. Experimental results on Caltech pedestrian dataset with the original annotations and the improved annotations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. When using a more advanced RPN in our framework, our approach can be further improved and get competitive results on both benchmarks.},

Seeking a common subspace among the heterogeneous multi-modal data is essential for audio–visual emotion recognition. In this paper, we study the subspace learning for audio–visual emotion recognition by combing the similarity of intra-modality and the correlation of inter-modality. First, we enforce a low-rank constraint on the self-representation of the features in the subspace to exploit the structural similarity of intra-modality. It is based on a key observation that each modality and the corresponding features usually lie in a low-dimensional manifold. Second, we propose a joint low-rank model on the representation of inter-modality to keep consistency across different modalities. Finally, the intra-modality similarity and inter-modality correlation are integrated within a unified framework, for which we develop an efficient computational algorithm to pursue the common subspace.

In the case of changes in perspective, light, background, veil, and person&#39;s clothing, traditional method cannot achieve person recognition effectively and reliably. In this paper, we propose a novel biometric metric learning method named Human Skeleton Mutual Learning person re-identification (HSMLP-Reid). The purpose of HSML person re-identification method (HSMLP-Reid) largely aims to use the new pedestrian local segmentation method proposed in this paper combined with the global skeleton information to solve the influence of background and local posture change. Firstly, bottom-up method is used to estimate the pedestrian posture and skeleton and the joint points of the pedestrians will be marked in this process. A new local segmentation method proposed in this paper named joint segmentation is used to locally segment pedestrians and perform local block matching . Furthermore, we learn the global skeleton information by defined joint distances from the pedestrian 2D skeleton estimation by the bottom-up method and use global skeleton information to global skeleton matching. Finally, we use local match and global skeleton match for mutual learning. Local match based on pedestrian nodes and global skeleton match based on pedestrian skeleton are based on biometrics. We learn the classification loss and metric learning loss to train model. Metric loss includes global skeletal distance and local block metric distance. Extensive experimental results on the large-scale Market1501, CUHK03 and CUHK-SYSU data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently superior performance and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods.},

So far, the image data input to classifier mainly focus on 2D or 3D images. Although some functional imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), generate 4D data which contain both spatial and time-varying information of the brain, for the lack of suitable 4D image processing algorithm , these 4D data were always used by transforming them into functional connectivity or slicing them into 2D/3D pictures which causing apparent information loss. In this paper, we present a 4D deep learning model (C3d-LSTM) for AD discrimination, which is able to utilize the spatial and time-varying information simultaneously by dealing with 4D fMRI data directly. The proposed C3d-LSTM combines a series of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from each volume of 3D static image in fMRI image sequence. Then the feature maps obtained were put into the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the time-varying information contained in the data. Because of the design of structure, C3d-LSTM became an end-to-end data-driven model, which was more convenient for processing 4D fMRI data. The model proposed conducted on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative dataset for algorithm evaluation compared with controlled experiments. Results showed that using 4D fMRI data directly with the proposed method did make a far better result for AD detection than the methods using functional connectivity , 2D, or 3D fMRI data. It demonstrated our assumption that making the most of the natural spatial and temporal information preserved in 4D fMRI data is significant for AD detection and can increase the performance of the classifier. Meanwhile the result implied that the C3d-LSTM model proposed is a suitable model for processing 4D fMRI data and extracting the spatio-temporal property of fMRI data fully for diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract     = {Due to that polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data suffers from missing labeled samples and complex-valued data, this article presents a novel semi-supervised PolSAR terrain classification method named recurrent complex-valued convolution neural network (RCV-CNN) which combines semi-supervised learning and complex-valued convolution neural network (CV-CNN). The proposed method only needs a small number of labeled samples to achieve good classification results . First, a Wishart classifier is used to select some reliable PolSAR samples. Then, two new semi-supervised deep classification model RCV-CNN1 and RCV-CNN2 have been proposed to improve PolSAR image classification accuracy . Moreover, our proposed methods could solve the problem of network overfitting phenomenon to some extend when the number of training samples is too small. Finally, three real PolSAR dataset are applied to verify the effectiveness of our algorithms. Compared with the other five state-of-the-art methods, the proposed RCV-CNN1 and RCV-CNN2 classification models show good performance in accuracy and generalization.},

However, the manual annotations often require expensive human labor, which limits the application of supervised methods for large-scale real-world deployments. To address this problem, we formulate a Neighbor Similarity and Soft-label Adaptation (NSSA) algorithm to transfer the supervised information from source domain to a new unlabeled target dataset. Specifically, we introduce a distance metric on the target domain, which incorporates inner-domain neighbor similarity and inter-domain soft-label adapted from source domain. The unlabeled samples which are close in this metric are considered to share the same pseudo-id and further selected to fine-tune the model. The training is performed iteratively to incorporate more credible sample pairs and incrementally improve the model. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of our proposed NESSA algorithm, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised and domain adaptation re-identification methods.},

Supervised and semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed for the SOM. However, their teacher labels do not describe the relationship between the data and the location of nodes. This study proposes a landmark map (LAMA), which is an extension of SOMs that utilizes several landmarks, e.g., pairs of nodes and data points. LAMA is designed to obtain a user-intended nonlinear projection to achieve, e.g., the landmark-oriented data visualization. To reveal the learning properties of LAMA, the Zoo dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the McDonald’s dataset from Kaggle, and an artificial formant dataset were analyzed. The analysis results of the Zoo dataset indicated that LAMA could provide a new data view such as the landmark-centered data visualization. McDonald’s dataset analysis demonstrated menu recommendation examples based on a few designated items. Furthermore, the artificial formant data analysis revealed that LAMA successfully provided the intended nonlinear projection associating articular movement with vertical and horizontal movement of a computer cursor. Potential applications of LAMA include data mining, recommendation systems, and human–computer interaction.},

  abstract     = {Facial expressions play an important role during communications, allowing information regarding the emotional state of an individual to be conveyed and inferred. Research suggests that automatic facial expression recognition is a promising avenue of enquiry in mental healthcare, as facial expressions can also reflect an individual&#39;s mental state. In order to develop user-friendly, low-cost and effective facial expression analysis systems for mental health care, this paper presents a novel deep convolution network based emotion analysis framework to support mental state detection and diagnosis. The proposed system is able to process facial images and interpret the temporal evolution of emotions through a new solution in which deep features are extracted from the Fully Connected Layer 6 of the AlexNet, with a standard Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier exploited to obtain the final classification outcome. It is tested against 5 benchmarking databases, including JAFFE, KDEF,CK+, and databases with the images obtained ‘in the wild’ such as FER2013 and AffectNet. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, we observe that our method has overall higher accuracy of facial expression recognition. Additionally, when compared to the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms such as Vgg16, GoogleNet, ResNet and AlexNet, the proposed method demonstrated better efficiency and has less device requirements. The experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency which suggests it could act as a smart, low-cost, user-friendly cognitive aid to detect, monitor, and diagnose the mental health of a patient through automatic facial expression analysis.},

In this paper, we develop a new training and inference mechanism, which is shown to significantly improve the detection accuracy for high resolution aerial images. Instead of estimating the orientations of objects using direct regressions like in previous methods, we propose to predict the rotated bounding boxes by leveraging a segmentation task , which is easier to train and yields more accurate detection results. In addition, an image synthesizing based data augmentation strategy is presented to address the data imbalance issues in aerial object detection.

We employ real-world binary datasets describing the spontaneous neuronal activity of laboratory mice over time, and we aim to their efficient low-dimensional representation.

However, it is hard to get an overview of the vehicle emission in the city scale due to the sparse emission remote sensing stations in city, and selecting the appropriate stations locations which can reflect the emission variation in the given region mostly is another challenge. The existing methods solve the problem by spatial interpolation based on geographical statistics methods, without considering that urban vehicle emission varies by locations non-linearly and depends on many complex external factors. To tackle the spatial sparsity of vehicle remote sensing data , we design a data augmentation strategy based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which leverages prior model COPERT with conditional measurement data to filling the missing entries at other locations. With this strategy, we can generate realistic emission data while accelerating the training process. In addition, to address the emission stations location selection problem, we design a novel location selection strategy based on Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, which leverages the realistic data generated to discover the grids with maximum link correlation for the pre-deployed station. Finally, we present experiments with the remote emission sensing data in Hefei, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model can mimics the real vehicle emission distribution in the given region effectively.},

With the development of deep convolutional neural networks , many deep face recognition methods have been proposed and have achieved remarkable results. However, these methods show great diversity among their datasets, network architectures , loss functions, and parameter learning strategies. For those who want to apply these technologies to establish a deep face recognition system, it is bewildering to evaluate which improvements are more suitable and effective. This study systematically summarizes and evaluates the state-of-the-art face recognition methods . However, unlike general reviews, on the basis of a survey, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation framework and measures the effects of multifarious settings in five components, including data augmentation , network architecture, loss function, network training, and model compression . Based on the experimental results, the influences of these five components on the deep face recognition are summarized. In terms of the datasets, a high sample-identity ratio is conducive to generalization, but it leads to increased difficulty for the training to converge. For the network architecture, deep ResNet has an advantage over other designs. Various normalization operations in the network are also necessary. For the loss function, whose performance is closely related to network design and training conditions. The angle-margin loss has a higher upper bound performance, but the traditional Euclidean-margin loss has a stable performance in limited training condition and shallower network. In terms of the training strategy, the step-declining learning rate and large batch size are recommended for recognition tasks. Furthermore, this study compares several popular model compression methods and shows that MobileNet has advantages over the others in terms of both compression ratio and robustness.

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment polarity of an aspect term in a sentence instead of the sentiment polarity of the entire sentence. Neural networks have been used for this task, and most existing methods have adopted sequence models, which require more training time than other models. When an aspect term comprises several words, most methods involve a coarse-level attention mechanism to model the aspect, and this may result in information loss. In this paper, we propose a multi-attention network (MAN) to address the above problems. The proposed model uses intra- and inter-level attention mechanisms. In the former, the MAN employs a transformer encoder instead of a sequence model to reduce training time. The transformer encoder encodes the input sentence in parallel and preserves long-distance sentiment relations. In the latter, the MAN uses a global and a local attention module to capture differently grained interactive information between aspect and context. The global attention module focuses on the entire relation, whereas the local attention module considers interactions at word level; this was often neglected in previous studies. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior results when compared to the baseline models .},

Although significant progress has been achieved in this direction, the network architectures become more and more complex, which will make the future improvement difficult and heavily engineered. Moreover, the manually designed fusion strategies would be sub-optimal due to the large search space of possible solutions. To address above problems, we propose an Automatic Top-Down Fusion (ATDF) method, in which the global information at the top sides are flowed into bottom sides to guide the learning of low layers. We design a novel valve module and add it at each side to control the coarse semantic information flowed into a specific bottom side. Through these valve modules, each bottom side at the top-down pathway is expected to receive necessary top information. We also design a generator to improve the prediction capability of fused deep features for saliency detection . We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate that ATDF is simple yet effective and thus opens a new path for saliency detection .},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address a challenging task in real-word applications, i.e., automatic reading recognition for pointer meters, called PRM. 1 This application is valuable in the fields of military, industry, and aerospace. However, the accuracy of recognizing the readings of pointer meters by machine vision is, oftentimes, affected by several factors, such as uneven illumination in each image, large range variation of illumination in different images, complex backgrounds, tilting of pointer meters, image blur, and scale change, resulting in the recognized readings with unacceptable accuracy. In this paper, a new robust approach to reading recognition of pointer meters is proposed. The proposed method consists of three main contributions: (1) constructing a novel deep learning algorithm in which the PrRoIPooling is used in lieu of the RoiAlign in the existing Mask-RCNN, (2) classifying the type of pointer meters while fitting the pointer binary mask, and (3) calculating the readings of pointer meters by the proposed angle method. In addition, we also report and release a new dataset for the community. Experiments show that the new algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of the recognized readings of pointer meters, meanwhile, the proposed approach is also robust to the natural environments and computationally efficient.},

  abstract     = {Multi-loss-joint-optimization has been proven to be valid in computer vision literature . However, the learned deep sub-features usually fit their disjoint constraints, which yield confrontation and spatial inconsistency among the sub-features with nonshared FC layers. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid-loss supervision (HLS) framework in order to obtain smoother and more spatially consistent features with shared FC layers. First, we analyze the shortcomings of the monitoring with single-loss in the existing framework theoretically. Then, we selected two notable loss functions (e.g., Center loss and Weighted loss ) to instantiate the HLS framework by linear combination . By instantiating the framework with two standard loss functions, the network has learned more compact intra-class deep features and uniform inter-class deep features. The HLS framework can significantly boost the efficiency of existing convolution networks for both image classification task and object detection task without increasing network parameters and computational complexity . Extensive experimental results on different vision tasks demonstrate consistent improvement can be achieved across a variety of datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-2012, PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO) and different convolutional neural network architectures.},

  abstract     = {Facial nerve paralysis adversely affects the patients’ mental and physical health, and several existing evaluation methods of facial paralysis are put forward based on the static facial asymmetry. However, these traditional methods still suffer from two drawbacks: (1) the facial movement information is always being ignored, which plays important roles for facial paralysis analysis; (2) the shallow machine learning models have their limitations on extracting useful facial features for the evaluation of facial paralysis. To solve these problems, we present dual-path LSTM with deep differentiated network (DP-LSTM-DDN) to evaluate the severity of facial paralysis automatically. The key idea behind DP-LSTM-DDN is that the diagnosis results are sensitive to the facial asymmetry and the patterns of facial muscular movements when the patients were doing the diagnostic facial actions . Therefore, we design a deep differentiated network to analyze the difference between two sides of patients’ faces. Furthermore, since the involved facial regions are as important as the whole face for the diagnostic of facial paralysis analysis, we propose a dual-path LSTM network to extract both global and local facial movement features. Then these extracted high level representations are fused for the final evaluation of facial paralysis. The experimental results have verified the better performance of DP-LSTM-DDN compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, traditional manifold learning algorithms were proposed with the assumption of single manifold structure in HSI, while the samples in different subsets may belong to different sub-manifolds. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction (DR) method called multi-manifold locality graph preserving analysis (MLGPA) was proposed for feature learning of HSI data. According to the label information of HSI, MLGPA divides the samples data into different subsets, and each subset is treated as a sub-manifold. Then, it constructs a within-manifold graph and a between-manifold graph for each sub-manifold to characterize within-manifold compactness and between-manifold separability, and a discriminant projection matrix can be obtained by maximizing the between-manifold scatter and minimizing the within-manifold scatter simultaneously. Finally, low-dimensional embedding features of different sub-manifolds are fused to improve the classification performance. MLGPA can effectively reveal the multi-manifold structure and improve the classification performance of HSI. Experimental results on three real-world HSI data sets demonstrate that MLGPA is superior to some state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy .},

  abstract     = {This paper targets for the ordinal regression/classification, which objective is to learn a rule to predict labels from a discrete but ordered set. For instance, the classification for medical diagnosis usually involves inherently ordered labels corresponding to the level of health risk. Previous multi-task classifiers on ordinal data often use several binary classification branches to compute a series of cumulative probabilities. However, these cumulative probabilities are not guaranteed to be monotonically decreasing. It also introduces a large number of hyper-parameters to be fine-tuned manually. This paper aims to eliminate or at least largely reduce the effects of those problems. We propose a simple yet efficient way to rephrase the output layer of the conventional deep neural network . Besides, in order to alleviate the effects of label noise in ordinal datasets, we propose a unimodal label regularization strategy. It also explicitly encourages the class predictions to distribute on nearby classes of ground truth. We show that our methods lead to the state-of-the-art accuracy on the medical diagnose task (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy and Ultrasound Breast dataset) as well as the face age prediction (e.g., Adience face and MORPH Album II) with very little additional cost.},

To do so, a vector error function is firstly defined. Secondly, a power-type gain implicit dynamic model is derived and needs to be further discretized. Thirdly, by using Euler forward-difference rule, a discretized dynamic model is designed. In order to get the explicit dynamic model, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) quasi-Newton method is utilized to estimate the inverse of the Hessian matrix .

Most existing calligraphy robots focus on enabling the robots to learn writing through human participation, such as human–robot interactions and manually designed evaluation functions. However, because of the subjectivity of art aesthetics, these existing methods require a large amount of implementation work from human engineers. In addition, the written results cannot be accurately evaluated. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a robotic calligraphy model that combines a generative adversarial network (GAN) and deep reinforcement learning to enable a calligraphy robot to learn to write Chinese character strokes directly from images captured from Chinese calligraphic textbooks. In our proposed model, to automatically establish an aesthetic evaluation system for Chinese calligraphy, a GAN is first trained to understand and reconstruct stroke images. Then, the discriminator network is independently extracted from the trained GAN and embedded into a variant of the reinforcement learning method, the “actor-critic model”, as a reward function. Thus, a calligraphy robot adopts the improved actor-critic model to learn to write multiple character strokes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully allows a calligraphy robot to write Chinese character strokes based on input stroke images. The performance of our model, compared with the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning method, shows the efficacy of the combination approach. In addition, the key technology in this work shows promise as a solution for robotic autonomous assembly.},

Based on the similarity and dissimilarity, a multi-task Siamese Neural Network is formulated to perform network embedding and optimize embedding representations.

  abstract     = {Blind image deblurring is a challenging low-level vision problem which aims to restore a sharp image only from the blurry observation. Few known information makes this problem fundamentally ill-posed. Most recent works focus on designing various priors on both latent image and blur kernel based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) model to restrict the solution space. However, their performance is highly related to these hand-crafted explicit priors. In fact, the pre-designed explicit priors may have less flexibility to fit different image structures in real-world scenarios. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel framework, named Hybrid Deep Priors Model (HDPM), to simulate the propagation of sharp latent image used in kernel estimation and final deconvolution . Specifically, we introduce the learnable implicit deep prior and hand-crafted explicit prior as regularizations into the MAP inference process to extract the detailed texture and sharp structures of latent image, respectively. In HDPM, we can successfully take the advantages of explicit cues based on task information and implicit deep priors from training data to facilitate the propagation of sharp latent image which is beneficial for the kernel estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deblurring methods on benchmarks, challenging scenarios and non-uniform images.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning methods for graph classification are critical for graph data mining. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been able to achieve state-of-the-art node classification. A typical process for GCNs includes two iterative steps: node feature encoding and message passing. While the former encodes each graph node independently via the uniform encoding function, the latter updates the features of each node by weighted aggregation of the features of neighboring nodes, where the weights are generated by predefined or learned graph Laplacian. However, their accuracy deteriorates for graph classification tasks because the uniform encoding function encodes all the node features involved. In this study, we propose a novel affinity-aware encoding for graph classification. In our model, we implement a separate encoding function for the neighboring nodes of each node for updating the node features, where the nodes are arranged in the order of affinity values, such as graph centrality, in order to determine the correspondence between an encoding function and a specific neighboring node. Our separate encoding function performs non-Euclidean neighboring encoding for each node by weight sharing, which enables message passing. We also develop two variants based on our separate encoding function: the graph centrality-convolutional neural network (C-CNN) and the graph centrality-graph convolutional network (C-GCN). The former performs the separate encoding function on graph data directly by the function of message passing. The latter combines the separate encoding function with the normalized graph Laplacian implemented on the graph data. Experiments demonstrate that the results obtained by our models are consistent with those obtained by classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset, and they outperform existing GCNs on the 20NEWS, Reuters8, and Reuters52 datasets.

  abstract     = {Face hallucination is a domain-specific super-resolution (SR) algorithm, that generates high-resolution (HR) images from the observed low-resolution (LR) inputs. Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based SR offers an end-to-end solution for learning the complex relationship between LR and HR images, and achieves superior performance. However, most of them ignore the role of high-frequency (HF) information in image recovering. We design a novel global-local fused network (GLFSR) to refine HF information for recovering fine details of facial images . In contrast to existing methods that often increase the depth of network, we enhance the residual HF information from local to global levels through the networks. The proposed global-local fused network involves four sub-modules: first, reconstruction network, which is used to super-resolve the synthetic HR image from pixel level by reconstruction network, local and global residual enhancement networks, which generate residual information for learning; and fusion module, which is used to generate the final HR image. Experimental results on CAS-PEAL-R1 and CASIA-Webface databases demonstrate that GLFSR is superior to other state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {Conduction of action potentials along nerve fiber is an important nonlinear phenomenon related to neural information transition. Recently, the conduction failure behavior that some action potentials with high frequency fail to conduct along C-fiber was identified to be associated with diabetic neuropathy and induced by potassium ( K + ) channel. In the present paper, the dynamical mechanism for downregulated expression of K + channel induced-reduction of conduction failure, i.e. enhancement of painful information, is acquired with a chain network model composed of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons. The conduction failure behavior appears for the action potentials induced by stimulation with high frequency and small coupling strength corresponding to C-fiber, and the conduction failure degree reduces with decreasing K + conductance, which closely matches with those observed in the biological experiment. Moreover, the dynamics of the conduction failure behavior are explained with the Hopf bifurcation of HH model. The afterpotential near the Hopf bifurcation exhibits the damping oscillation, which leads to that the current intensity threshold of a pulse stimulation to evoke an action potential from the afterpotential also manifests damping oscillations. Such a current threshold is the intrinsic cause that conduction failure behavior appears for action potential with high frequency. With decreasing K + conductance, the current threshold becomes lower, which is the intrinsic dynamical mechanism for the reduction of conduction failure degree. By using current threshold determined by Hopf bifurcation, the results present the dynamical mechanism of potassium channel induced-conduction failure behavior, which shows that potassium channel is a potential modulation candidate for the pathological pain.},

  abstract     = {Two dilemmas frequently occur in many real-world clinical prognoses. First, the on-hand data cannot be put entirely into the existing prediction model, since the features from new data do not perfectly match those of the model. As a result, some unique features collected from the patients in the current domain of interest might be wasted. Second, the on-hand data is not sufficient enough to learn a new prediction model. To overcome these challenges, we propose an output-based transfer learning approach with least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) to make the maximum use of the small dataset and guarantee an enhanced generalization capability. The proposed approach can learn a current domain of interest with limited samples effectively by leveraging the knowledge from the predicted outputs of the existing model in the source domain. Also, the extent of output knowledge transfer from the source domain to the current one can be automatically and rapidly determined using a proposed fast leave-one-out cross validation strategy. The proposed approach is applied to a real-world clinical dataset to predict 5-year overall and cancer-specific mortality of bladder cancer patients after radical cystectomy. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves better classification performances than the other comparative methods and has the potential to be implemented into the real-world context to deal with small data problems in cancer prediction and prognosis.},

However, this assumption does not always founded because the acquisition of labeling data is costly. In real-world applications, the available labels usually arrive one by one over time. To address this problem, we develop a novel multi-label feature selection method under the circumstance of streaming label to select a set of the most relevant and discriminative features . Specifically, we firstly select label-specific features for each newly-arrived label by designing inter-class discrimination and intra-class neighbor recognition. Then, a feature conversion is created to fuse the generated label-specific feature sets. Comprehensive experiments on a series of benchmark data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against other state-of-the-art multi-label feature selection methods.},

Several previously proposed LRTC methods have been successfully applied to practical applications. However, while the tensor nuclear norm has been successfully applied to solve the LRTC problem, penalizing all singular values equally restricts its recovery accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient tensor p -shrinkage nuclear norm ( p -TNN) based on tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD). Under the condition − ∞ −∞&amp;lt;p&amp;lt;1, we theoretically prove that p -TNN outperforms traditional tensor nuclear norm when they are used to approximate the tensor average rank. Based on the proposed p -TNN, we design an LRTC model to obtain an underlying tensor from its partial observations, which provides an upper bound for recovery error. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem that originates in our developed model and accelerate this algorithm using an adaptive momentum scheme. Theoretical analyses indicate that our algorithm enjoys a globally geometric convergence rate under the smoothness assumption . Numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets verify our method and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed p -TNN in solving LRTC problems over several state-of-the-art methods},

Moreover, by utilizing the integral inequality treatment techniques together with stochastic analysis methods, several optimized control algorithms (OCAs) with a larger sampling period (LSP) are established for analyzing the FT synchronization issue of homologous error system with the optimal performance index.

  abstract     = {Salient object detection in RGB-D images aims to identify the most attractive objects in a pair of color and depth images for the observer. As an important branch of salient object detection, it focuses on solving the following two major challenges: how to achieve cross-modal fusion that is efficient and beneficial for salient object detection; how to effectively extract the information of depth image with relatively poor quality. This paper proposes a cross-modal adaptive gated fusion generative adversarial network for RGB-D salient object detection by using color and depth images. Specifically, the generator network adopts double-stream encoder-decoder network and receives RGB and depth images at the same time. The proposed depthwise separable residual convolution module is used to deal with deep semantic information, and the processed feature is combined with side-output features of the encoder network progressively. In order to compensate for the shortcoming of poor quality of the depth image, the proposed method adds the cross-modal guidance from the side-output features of the RGB stream to the decoder network of depth stream. The discriminator network adaptively fuses the features of double streams using a gated fusion module, then sends the gated fusion saliency map to the discriminator to distinguish the similarity from ground-truth map. Adversarial learning forms the better generator network and discriminator network, and the gated fusion saliency map generated by the best generator network is served as final result. Experiments on five publicly RGB-D datasets demonstrate the effect of cross-modal fusion, depthwise separable residual convolution and adaptive gated fusion. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves the better performance.},

In this paper, we propose the multi-label symbolic value partitioning through random walks algorithm with two stages. In the first stage, an undirected weighted graph is constructed for each attribute. Each node corresponds to an attribute value and the weight of each edge corresponds to the similarity between two nodes. Similarity is defined based on the attribute value distribution for each label. In the second stage, a random walk algorithm is used to cluster attribute values. The average weight serves as the separation operator to sharpen the inter-cluster edges. We tested the new algorithm and seven popular feature selection algorithms on 13 datasets.

To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Bi-Decoder Augmented Network (BiDAN) for the neural machine translation task. Besides the original decoder which generates the target language sequence, we add an auxiliary decoder to generate back the source language sequence at the training time. Since each decoder transforms the representations of the input text into its corresponding language, jointly training with two target ends can make the shared encoder has the potential to produce a language-independent semantic space.

This paper mainly aims to develop a new solution to address texture recognition using a Cellular Neural Network (CellNN). Firstly, it proposes an improved model of CellNN by the binary constraints of local receptive fields, and then designs a recurrent convolution framework of such a model to generate two types of texture feature maps, including state feature maps and output feature maps . In order to obtain low-dimensional features, state feature maps are further compressed by the mapping of rotation-invariant patterns and the merging of low-frequency occurrence patterns. By the statistics of joint-distribution patterns, state feature maps and output feature maps are fused together to generate the features of single resolution. Moreover, a multi-resolution feature combination scheme is also designed by the optimization of softmax &amp; &amp;#x26; variance and concatenation of multiple features. Finally, a fully-connected neural network is trained to work as a texture recognizer. The experimental comparisons of totally 15 algorithms on five benchmark datasets show that, on the dataset whose texture-class quantity is not beyond 30, such as Brodatz, our method could always acquire the highest recognition accuracy, outperforming any other compared ones. On the big dataset with huge texture-class quantity, such as ALOT, our method could also surpass any other non-deep-learning one, such as the state-of-the-art gLBP, only slightly falling behind the best two deep-learning ones, FV-Alex and FV-VGGVD.

By this way, spectral and spatial features are calculated and expanded together in a single GRU. By comparing the different utilization patterns of RNN with a variety of spatial information fusion methods, our approach demonstrates a competitive advantage in both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Blast furnace ironmaking (BFI) is currently the most widely used method of pig iron smelting. In order to achieve efficient and reasonable control, how to quickly and accurately obtain the molten iron quality (MIQ) model is a key issue. Aiming at this problem, this paper applies robust stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) based on kernel density estimation (KDE) into the BFI modeling to obtain the MIQ model with good modeling accuracy and strong robustness quickly and effectively. Firstly, the network model is incrementally constructed by adding neurons one by one using the conventional SCNs algorithm. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of insufficient robustness of conventional SCNs, kernel density estimation algorithm is introduced to obtain the corresponding probability density estimates of each training set, and it&#39;s used as the penalty weight introduced into constructing process of conventional SCNs. At the same time, the network output weight is obtained by an improved method to solve the problem that the output weight of the conventional RSCNs is abnormal in the multi-output modeling application. Finally, modeling experiments based on actual industrial data of BFI production verified that RSCNs can achieve good modeling accuracy and strong robust performance.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based solutions have achieved state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised multi-view feature selection. However, existing methods generally characterize the sample similarities first by constructing multiple fixed graphs with manually determined parameters, and then perform the feature selection on a composite one. They will suffer from two severe problems: (1) The fixed graphs may be unreliable as the raw multi-view features usually contain adverse noises and cannot accurately capture the intrinsic sample relations. (2) The graph construction and feature selection are separate and independent, the two-step learning may lead to sub-optimal performance. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose an effective unsupervised multi-view feature selection method, dubbed as Nonnegative Structured Graph Learning (NSGL). Specifically, we develop a unified learning framework, which directly learns the structured graph from the raw features by imposing a rank constraint, and simultaneously performs adaptive feature selection with exploiting the complementarity of multi-view features. Besides, we introduce the pseudo label learning to extract the discriminative semantic information in unsupervised scenarios and steer the graph learning process. The informative features are finally selected by forcing the feature selection matrix to be sparse in rows with sparse regression. To solve the challenging optimization problem , we first transform the formulated problem into an equivalent one that can be tackled more easily, and then develop an efficient alternate optimization algorithm guaranteed with convergence to calculate the solution iteratively. Extensive experiments on several widely tested benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of NSGL compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in face recognition mostly concentrate on designing more discriminative loss functions or adding normalization on features/weights to make a single feature more accurate. In this work, inspired by the frequently used multi-patch ensemble method for face recognition and part-based models for person re-identification, we propose a novel training strategy to enhance the discriminability of deeply learned feature from another perspective, namely learning with dense supervision. The main idea is to apply multiple classification losses on top of multiple component features extracted from a single network. Ideally, each component feature is expected to be accurate and have low correlation with the others. To this end, we first design a metric called feature consistency to evaluate the correlation between one component feature and the others, which is defined as the sum of distances between one component feature and the others, where the distance here is measured with KL divergence between corresponding softmax probabilities. Then we use feature consistency to select which component features to sample for one learning pass by importance sampling. The dense supervision significantly outperforms the single supervision baseline and even performs on par with its multi-patch ensemble counterpart which has much more parameters (9×). Our experimental results match state-of-the-art performance on LFW, YTF, MegaFace and surpass the others on LFW BLUFR and VGGFace2 pose protocol, thereby achieving state-of-the-art. Specially, results on VGGFace2 also show the superiority of the dense supervision on cross-pose face matching.},

  abstract     = {There are a lot of linguistic knowledge and sentiment resources nowadays, but in the current research with deep learning framework, these kinds of unique sentiment information are not fully used in sentiment analysis tasks. Moreover, the sentiment analysis task can be seen as a sequence model, and the sequence model has a problem: the model will decode the input file sequences into a specific length vector. If the length of the vectors is set too short, the input text information will be lost, and finally the text will be misjudged. To solve these problems, we propose a bidirectional LSTM model with self-attention mechanism and multi-channel features (SAMF-BiLSTM). The method models the existing linguistic knowledge and sentiment resources in sentiment analysis tasks to form different feature channels, and uses self-attention mechanism to enhance the sentiment information. SAMF-BiLSTM model can fully exploit the relationship between target words and sentiment polarity words in a sentence, and does not rely on manually organized sentiment lexicon. In addition, we propose the SAMF-BiLSTM-D model based on SAMF-BiLSTM model for document-level text classification tasks . The method obtains the representation of all sentences in the document through SAMF-BiLSTM training, then integrates BiLSTM to learn the representation of all sentences, and further obtains the sentiment feature information of the entire document. Finally, we evaluate experiment results under five datasets. The results show that SAMF-BiLSTM and SAMF-BiLSTM-D are superior to other advanced methods in classification accuracy in most cases.},

Lots of researchers recently focused on this hot issue and proposed deep learning based methods to enhance the recognition rate in a supervised or unsupervised manner . However,there are two limitations that cannot be ignored: firstly, compared with other image retrieval benchmarks, the size of existing person Re-Id datasets is far from meeting the requirement, which cannot provide sufficient pedestrian samples for the training of deep model; secondly, the samples in existing datasets do not have sufficient human motions or postures coverage to provide more priori knowledges for learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised pose augmentation cross-view person Re-Id scheme called PAC-GAN to overcome these limitations. We firstly present the formal definition of cross-view pose augmentation and then propose the framework of PAC-GAN that is a novel conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) based approach to improve the performance of unsupervised corss-view person Re-Id. Specifically, the pose generation model in PAC-GAN called CPG-Net is to generate enough quantity of pose-rich samples from original image and skeleton samples. The pose augmentation dataset is produced by combining the synthesized pose-rich samples with the original samples, which is fed into the corss-view person Re-Id model named Cross-GAN. Besides, we use weight-sharing strategy in the CPG-Net to improve the quality of new generated samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to enhance the unsupervised cross-view person Re-Id by pose augmentation, and the results of extensive experiments show that the proposed scheme can combat the state-of-the-arts with recognition rate.},

To address this issue, we propose a discriminant globality-locality preserving extreme learning machine (DGLELM) in this paper. In contrast to ELM, DGLELM not only considers the global discriminative structure of the dataset but also makes the best use of the local discriminative geometry information. DGLELM optimizes the projection direction of the ELM output weights by maximizing the inter-class dispersion and minimizing the intra-class dispersion for global and local data. Experiments on several widely used image databases validate the performance of DGLELM. The experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ELM algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous ground vehicles are increasingly finding their way into real-life applications, ranging from food/parcel delivery to self-driving vehicles. Given that, understanding the behaviours and intentions of humans are still one of the main challenges autonomous ground vehicles faced with. More specifically, when it comes to complex environments such as urban traffic scenes, inferring the intentions and actions of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians become even harder. In this paper, we address the problem of intent action prediction of pedestrians in urban traffic environments using only image sequences from a monocular RGB camera. We propose a real-time framework that can accurately detect, track and predict the intended actions of pedestrians based on a tracking-by-detection technique in conjunction with a novel spatio-temporal DenseNet model. We trained and evaluated our framework based on real data collected from urban traffic environments. Our framework has shown resilient and competitive results in comparison to other baseline approaches. Overall, we achieved an average precision score of 84.76\% with a real-time performance at 20 FPS.},

  abstract     = {Illumination normalization for face recognition is of great importance when the face image is taken under a harsh lighting condition and only one single image is available. In this paper, an illumination normalization method that can preserve face identity and make the processed image have photorealistic face texture is proposed. First, an illumination regression filter is proposed to remove a large number of illumination components of the input image. Then, the accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is used for low-rank decomposition of the filtered image, which further reduces the residual illumination and noise of the face image. However, after these two operations, the face image has a peeled-off appearance. To avoid the unrealistic appearance, a deep image prior synthesis process is developed to synthesize the photorealistic face texture. To accomplish this task, the filtered image, the low-rank decomposed image, the original image and any a uniformly illuminated frontal face image as reference are used as synthetic ingredients. These ingredients, as prior knowledge, synthesize a face image that has the texture features of the reference image and retains the identity of the input image. We try to bridge the appearance gap between the synthetic ingredients and the final synthetic image by a deep neural network . Instead of training the network on a large dataset, the final synthetic image is generated by iterating the parameters of the generator-structured network according to a certain proportion of the synthetic ingredients. Systematic evaluations conducted on public databases demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to illumination with better performance than state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper synthesizes three considerations: feature space correlation, information distributed in the long distance of image plane and long distance sequence information, and proposes a combination of self-attention mechanism and bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network to extract various contextual information on the basis of deep feature network, so as to achieve better semantic segmentation performance. In order to explore the optimal implementation, two kinds of topological connections are attempted. One is self-attention branch and bi-directional GRU branch in series, and the other is in parallel. In addition, in order to train the network better and achieve more precise segmentation results, a cascade refinement supervised method using two losses is proposed. Experiments carried out on Cityscapes, Mapillary, CamVid and KITTI semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance and robust generalization ability of our method.},

  abstract     = {Classifying visual information is an apparently simple and effortless task in our everyday routine, but can we automatically predict what we see from signals emitted by the brain? While other researchers have already attempted to answer this question, we are the first to show that a commercially available BCI could be effectively used for visual image classification in real-world scenarios – when testing takes place at a completely different time than training data collection. The task is difficult, as it requires relating the noisy and low-level EEG signals to complex and highly semantic visual categories. In this paper, we propose different learning approaches and show that simpler classifiers such as Ridge Regression with Gabor filtering of the input EEG signal could be more effective than the powerful Long Short Term Memory Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks in this case of limited and noisy training data. We analyzed the importance of each electrode for the visual classification task and noticed that the sensors with the highest accuracy were the ones that recorded brain activity from regions known to be correlated more with higher level recognition and cognitive processes and less to lower-level visual signal processing. The result is also in accordance with research in computer vision with deep neural networks, which shows that semantic visual features are learned only at higher levels of neural depth. While EEG signals are weaker by themselves for the task of visual classification, we demonstrate that they could be powerful when combined with deep visual features extracted from the image, improving performance from 91\% to over 97\% in a multi-class recognition setting. Our tests show that EEG input brings additional information that is not learned by artificial deep networks on the given image training set. Thus, a commercially available BCI could be effectively used in conjunction with a deep learning based vision system to form together a stronger visual recognition system that is suitable for real-world applications.},

This framework integrates the key components of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) which include preference handling, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and a posteriori selection. To this end, three well-known MOEAs such as NSGA-II, SPEA-II and MOEA/D are thoroughly investigated to determine if there exists any significant difference in their search performance. The sensitivity of all these MOEAs to various qualitative and quantitative parameters, such as the choice of recombination mechanism, crossover and mutation probabilities , is also studied. These issues are critically analyzed considering seven discrete-time and a continuous-time benchmark nonlinear system as well as a practical case study of non-linear wave-force modeling. The results of this investigation demonstrate that MOEAs can be tailored to determine the correct structure of nonlinear systems . Further, it has been established through frequency domain analysis that it is possible to identify multiple valid discrete-time models for continuous-time systems. A rigorous statistical analysis of MOEAs via performance sweet spots in the parameter space convincingly demonstrates that these algorithms are robust over a wide range of control parameters.},

All states of the system are guaranteed to be constrained in bounded compact set. The pure feedback nonlinear system is transformed into a strictly feedback nonlinear system with nonaffine nonlinear terms by using the mean value theorem. By using backstepping design of BLF combine with DSC technique, the explosion of complexity is avoided. Based on the neural network with the finite covering lemma, the time-delay functions are solved. Simultaneously, the backlash-like hysteresis input control in this paper is considered. The two cases of symmetric and asymmetric BLFs are discussed separately. An adaptive controller is designed to ensure that the output tracking error converges on a small region of the origin. Finally, the control scheme ensures that all signals in the closed-loop systems are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded. Results of two simulation cases are presented to prove the effectivity of the theoretical analysis.},

To achieve automatic TLS point cloud registration, many methods, based on the hand-crafted features of keypoints, have been proposed. Despite significant progress, the current methods still face great challenges in accomplishing TLS point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale neural network to learn local shape descriptors for establishing correspondences between pairwise TLS point clouds. To train our model, data augmentation , developed on pairwise semi-synthetic 3D local patches, is to extend our network to be robust to rotation transformation. Then, based on varying local neighborhoods, multi-scale subnetworks are constructed and fused to learn robust local features . Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method successfully registers two TLS point clouds and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our learned descriptors are invariant to translation and tolerant to changes in rotation.},

To break the boundary, in this paper, we propose a Joint Personalized Markov Chains (JPMC) model to address the cold-start issues for implicit feedback recommendation system. In our study, we first utilize user embedding to mine Network Neighbors, so that newcomers without relations can be represented by similar users, then we designed a two-level model based on Markov chains at both user level and user group level respectively to model user preferences dynamically.

A commonality of them is the final results have to be subsequently derived by k -means clustering. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature selection based extreme learning machine (UFSELM) for clustering, which integrates ELM with L2,1 norm regularization to remove the worthless hidden neurons and clusters the data directly without building an embedding. Specifically, the proposed method conducts feature selection by minimizing the L2,1 norm of output weights, and the clustering results is computed by eigendecomposition.

Different from most currently existing approaches, the study perceived especially a highly spatial correlation among the inner structure of the neighbouring pixels in this contiguously block-sparse residual. The high intra-block correlation is then introduced as prior information to deal the governing optimization problem .

An efficient solving algorithm is designed accordingly with a convergence analysis by adopting the classical Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework.

  abstract     = {Building extraction is one of the important tasks for urbanization monitoring, city planning, and urban change detection. It is not an easy task due to spectral heterogeneity and structural diversity of the complex backgrounds. In this paper, an object-based multi-modal convolution neural networks (OMM-CNN) is proposed for building extraction using panchromatic and multispectral imagery. Specifically, a multi-modal deep CNN (the multispectral CNN and the panchromatic CNN) architecture is designed which can mine multiscale spectral-spatial contextual information. In order to fully explore the spatial-spectral information embedded in panchromatic and multispectral images, the complex convolution and complex self-adaption pooling layer are developed. Furthermore, to improve the building extraction accuracy and efficiency, a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm is used to segment the panchromatic and multispectral remote sensing imagery simultaneous. Results demonstrated that the proposed method can extract different types of buildings, and the result is more accurate and effective than that of the recent building extraction methods.},

Time-varying Sylvester-transpose matrix inequation, which is an important variant, has not been fully investigated. Solving the time-varying problem in a constructive manner remains a challenge. This study considers an exp-aided conversion from time-varying linear matrix inequations to equations to solve the intractable problem. On the basis of zeroing neural network (ZNN) method, a continuous-time zeroing neural network (CTZNN) model is derived with the help of Kronecker product and vectorization technique. The convergence property of the model is analyzed. Two discrete-time ZNN models are obtained with the theoretical analyses of truncation error by using two Zhang et al.’s discretization (ZeaD) formulas with different precision to discretize the CTZNN model. The comparative numerical experiments are conducted for two discrete-time ZNN models, and the corresponding numerical results substantiate the convergence and effectiveness of two ZNN discrete-time models.},

  abstract     = {Cross-modality person re-identification is a challenging problem which retrieves a given pedestrian image in RGB modality among all the gallery images in infrared modality. The task can address the limitation of RGB-based person Re-ID in dark environments. Existing researches mainly focus on enlarging inter-class differences of feature to solve the problem. However, few studies investigate improving intra-class cross-modality similarity, which is important for this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, called Hetero-Center loss (HC loss) to reduce the intra-class cross-modality variations. Specifically, HC loss can supervise the network learning the cross-modality invariant information by constraining the intra-class center distance between two heterogenous modalities. With the joint supervision of Cross-Entropy (CE) loss and HC loss, the network is trained to achieve two vital objectives, inter-class discrepancy and intra-class cross-modality similarity as much as possible. Besides, we propose a simple and high-performance network architecture to learn local feature representations for cross-modality person re-identification, which can be a baseline for future research. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which outperform state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.},

It has the desirable advantage of well scalability and thus can effectively support large-scale cross-media retrieval. However, how to directly learn discriminative discrete hash codes under the unsupervised learning paradigm is still an open challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to attack this problem by proposing an Unsupervised Deep Cross-modal Hashing with Virtual Label Regression (UDCH-VLR) method. We propose a novel unified learning framework to jointly perform deep hash function training, virtual label learning and regression. Specifically, we learn unified hash codes via collaborative matrix factorization on the multi-modal deep representations to preserve the multi-modal shared semantics. Further, we incorporate the virtual label learning into the objective functions and simultaneously regress the learned virtual labels to the hash codes. Finally, instead of simply exploiting the existing shallow features and relaxing the binary constraints , we devise an alternative optimization strategy to directly update the deep hash functions and discrete binary codes. Under such circumstance, the discriminative capability of hash codes can be progressively enhanced with iterative learning. Extensive experiments on three publicly available cross-media retrieval datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

First, the impacts of QoS on QoE are comprehensively analyzed by experimental means and an association test method, instead of independently studying each parameter. Second, an algorithm is proposed to integrate the effects of QoS parameters with spatial or temporal characteristics on QoE. Third, we apply machine learning regression algorithms with QoS impairments, noise and echo impairments to nonintrusive voice quality prediction in different network environments. The results from numerous experiments show that fairly accurate prediction can be obtained from these models.

However, GAN is the model to capture the data distribution rather than image content. Therefore, for the corrupted face image with large holes, it may generate a new image which is greatly different from the original one. To solve above problem, we present a face inpainting network based on weighted face similarity (WFS-Net) to generate a better restoration. Firstly, according to the structural similarity index (SSIM), a weighted similar face set (WSFS) can be built to provide more reference information for the recovery of missing regions. And then, WFS-Net is designed to fill the damaged face image by exploring the relationship between the missing region and the available information, which include the known parts of the damaged image and its WSFS. Furthermore, a new loss function is presented in pixel level and texture level. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-arts.},

To tackle these problems, we propose a neural network called DE-CNN, which can incorporate context-relevant concepts into a convolutional neural network for short text classification.

  abstract     = {Unlike natural image captured with cameras, screen content image (SCI) is a composite image including textual and pictorial regions. The different characteristics lead to many difficulties in image quality assessment (IQA). Most existing models based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) divide large SCIs into image patches to increase training samples for CNN training. This brings two problems: (1) a single image patch can not represent the quality of the entire image, especially in IQA of SCI; (2) SCI patches of an entire image degraded by the same distortion type and strength may have drastically different quality. In addition, these models adopt the mean square error (MSE) between the predicted quality and the subjective differential mean opinion score (DMOS) to train the CNN, without considering quality ranking between different SCIs. In this paper, we propose a novel no-reference (NR) IQA model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). The contributions of our algorithm can be concluded as follows: (1) considering a large difference exists in different regions in a SCI, the pseudo global features generated with multi-region local features are utilized for quality evaluation, which better reflect image quality than local features of each image patch; (2) the noise classification task is used as an auxiliary task which aids the quality score prediction task to improve the representation ability; (3) the Siamese networks are used to predict the quality scores of two different SCIs, and a new ranking loss is proposed to rank the predicted scores, aiming to enhance the ability of the model to rank image in terms of quality. Experimental results verify that our model outperforms all test NR IQA methods and full-reference (FR) IQA methods on the screen content image quality assessment database (SIQAD).},

We then present a new activation function design based on the Hermite polynomials for better utilization of spatial representation . Moreover, we analyze the information transfer of DNNs, emphasizing the convergence problem caused by the mismatch between input and topological structure . We also study the effects of input perturbations and regularization operators on critical expressivity. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DNNs use spatial domains for information representation and evolve to the edge of chaos as depth increases. In actual training, whether a particular network can ultimately arrive the edge of chaos depends on its ability to overcome convergence and pass information to the required network depth.

  abstract     = {Supervised cross-modal hashing has gained increasing research interest on large-scale retrieval task owning to its satisfactory performance and efficiency. However, there are still some issues to be further addressed: (1) most of them fail to capture the inherent data structure effectively due to the complex correlations among heterogeneous data points; (2) most of them obtain continuous solutions firstly and then quantize the continuous solutions to generate hash codes directly, which causes large quantization error and consequent suboptimal retrieval performance ; (3) most of them suffer from relatively high memory cost and computational complexity during training procedure, which makes them unscalable. In this paper, to address above issues, we propose a supervised hashing method for cross-modal retrieval dubbed Efficient Discrete Supervised Hashing (EDSH). Specifically, the sharing space learning with collective matrix factorization and semantic embedding with class labels are seamlessly integrated to learn hash codes. Therefore, the feature based similarities and semantic correlations are both preserved in hash codes, which makes the learned hash codes more discriminative. Then an efficient discrete optimal scheme is designed to handle the scalable issue. Instead of learning hash codes bit-by-bit, hash codes matrix can be obtained directly which is more efficient. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets show that our EDSH produces a superior performance in both accuracy and scalability over several existing cross-modal hashing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Hashing has been widely used for large-scale image retrieval due to its high storage efficiency and fast calculation speed. Recent works have found that deep-supervised hashing methods are superior to non-deep-supervised hashing methods and unsupervised hashing methods in many applications. However, the previous deep-supervised hashing only uses the training set to learn the hash function , which results in that the discrete hash codes corresponding to the retrieval image set and the query image set are derived from the trained hash function . The retrieval image set did not participate in the training and learning of the network. Hence, it is difficult to acquire the real discrete hash code of the retrieval image. In addition, the traditional deep-supervised hashing methods failed to make full use of the supervised information . In this paper, we propose a novel deep supervised hashing method called J oint L earning Based D eep S upervised H ashing (JLDSH). It joints the image classification and hash function learning into the same end-to-end neural network framework. In the training process, we randomly select a subset from the retrieval image set to learn the hash function. The hash code of the entire retrieval image set is directly calculated by the trained hash code of the subset. Meanwhile, JLDSH sets a hyper-parameter on the supervised information to make the output of the network closer to the real discrete hash code. Furthermore, by adding a new loss function, an extended JLDSH-A model is proposed to make the image representation obtained by network training more discrete. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.},

However, the traditional RNNs have suffered from the gradient diminishing problem until the advent of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). However, LSTM is weak in capturing long-time dependency in sequential data due to the inadequacy of memory capacity in LSTM cells. To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-augmentation Bidirectional Multi-residual Recurrent Neural Network (ABMRNN) to overcome the deficiency. We propose an algorithm which integrates both past and future information at every time step with omniscient attention model. The multi-residual mechanism has also been leveraged in the proposed model targeting the pattern of the relationship between current time step and further distant time steps instead of only one previous time step. The results of experiments show that our model outperforms the traditional statistical classifiers and other existing RNN architectures.},

  abstract     = {Topic models have been widely used to mine hidden topics from documents. However, one limitation of such topic models is that they are prone to generate incoherent topics. To address this limitation, many approaches have been proposed to incorporate the prior knowledge of word semantic relatedness into the topic inference process. One example is the Generalized P o ´ o´ lya Urn (GPU) scheme. However, GPU-based topic models often require sophisticated algorithms to acquire domain-specific knowledge from data. Moreover, prior knowledge is incorporated into the topic inference process without considering its impact on the intermediate topic sampling results. In this paper, we propose a novel Weighted P o ´ o´ lya Urn scheme and incorporate it into Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework to build the self-enhancement topic model and generate coherent topics. In specific, semantic prior knowledge based on word embedding is employed to measure the semantic coherence of a word to different topics, which is incorporated into the Weighted P o ´ o´ lya Urn scheme. Moreover, semantic coherence is updated dynamically based on the semantic similarity between a word and the representative words in different topics. Experiments have been conducted on seven public corpora from different domains to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed approach can generate more coherent topics.},

Secondly, the existence conditions and the stability conditions of the sliding mode dynamics are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. An adaptive event-triggered sliding mode controller is designed to ensure the retainability to the sliding surface from beginning almost surely. Thirdly, an effective strategy is developed to avoid the Zeno behavior without decomposing the descriptor system, and the positive lower-bound of the inter-execution time intervals is provided. The existing method can not directly get the positive lower-bound. Thus, the parameters used for scaling corresponding inequalities are introduced to solve the problem. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and are superior to the existing event triggering strategies in the literature.},

It is able to map low-dimensional input signals to high-dimensional space for information extraction, but it is found that not every dimension of the reservoir output directly contributes to the model generalization. This work aims to improve the generalization capabilities of the ESN model by reducing the redundant reservoir output features. A novel hybrid model, namely binary grey wolf echo state network (BGWO-ESN), is proposed which optimises the ESN output connection by the feature selection scheme. Specially, the feature selection scheme of BGWO is developed to improve the ESN output connection structure. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic and financial data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BGWO-ESN model is more effective than other benchmarks, and obtains the lowest generalization error .},

  abstract     = {Osteoporosis makes bones weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fracture. In this paper, we designed a hybrid model to diagnose osteoporosis based on bone radiograph images. Two types of features were used to distinguish between the “healthy” and the “sick”. One type of features was obtained from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), named CNN features, and the other was hand-crafted features containing a group of standard texture features such as local binary pattern and gray level co-occurrence matrix and a group of “encoded features” that have shown impressive discriminative capabilities. We used a minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance algorithm to reduce the high dimensionality of the features and a support vector machine was used as the recognizer. This is the first study to fuse the CNNs features with the state-of-the-art osteoporotic texture features for osteoporosis diagnosis. We explore if the fusion of the two types of powerful features will increase the performance or not. Comparative experiments show that considerable performance improvements can be made through the fusion of both types of features, and the fusion of AlexNet with encoded features or all the hand-crafted features achieved the highest accuracy among all the fusions.},

Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative deep framework called GLICR to simultaneously incorporate the global and local item correlations into the model. More specifically, our proposed GLICR model tightly couples deep neural network with matrix factorization (MF), and jointly learns the deep feature representations of item content information in deep neural network and the rating matrix in MF. In addition, we introduce manifold regularization to learn the global and local item correlations directly from data. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets at three different degrees of sparsity to confirm that our approach can effectively alleviate data sparsity problem and is superior to existing state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

However, item recommendation tasks play a more important role in the real world, due to the large item space as well as users’ limited attention. In this paper, we treat users’ rating behaviors from a new perspective and study the effectiveness of conditional RBM (CRBM) in modeling users’ rating preferences for top- k recommendation. We conduct extensive empirical studies on four real-world datasets and find that our proposed CRBM-IR is very competitive in exploiting users’ explicit rating feedback in comparison with the closely related works.},

To be more specific, for new users with little or no experience, they may turn to popular items preferred by majority users. In terms of those medium-level users who already have interacted with some items, they may require and expect items to meet their personal preferences. As pro-active users are likely to leave rich behavior (action) feedback (e.g., view, like ) on the items they interacted with, the system will have good chance to better interpret users’ intention, and thus generate more accurate and elaborate recommendations to hit their preferences. In this paper, we propose a generic M ulti-facet U ser P reference L earning (MUPL) framework for fine-grained item recommendation. By considering diverse user experience and intention, MUPL captures user preference in the level of group-, individual- and action-facet. Besides, the importance of user preference in different facets can be automatically learnt by MUPL.

Challenges are usually used to evaluate such performance only in terms of accuracy. In this work, instead of proposing a new architecture, we overcome the limitations of those challenges by proposing a computationally undemanding comparative model based on several Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) strategies, not only for the comparison of deep-learning architectures, but also to detect which parameters are the most relevant features for achieving efficiency. In addition, the proposed model provides with a set of recommendations to improve object-detection frameworks. Those measures may be applied in future high-performance meta-architectures, since this model requires lower computational and temporal requirements compared to the traditional strategy based on training neural networks – based on the trial-error method – for each configurable parameter. To this aim, the presented model evaluates 16 parameters of 139 configurations of well-known detectors present in the Google data set [1].},

The proposed method facilitates clustering with the discriminative intra-view low rank structures that complement the shared inter-view transition. By recovering complementary low rank transitions from the differences between the shared inter-view transition and individual-view transitions, we pursue a more accurate transition probability matrix by combining the complementary intra-view transitions with the shared inter-view transition in an additive manner.

  abstract     = {Riemannian sparse coding methods are attracting increasing interest in many computer vision applications , relying on its non-Euclidean structure. One such recently successful task is image set classification by the aid of Grassmann Manifolds, where an image set can be seen as a point. However, due to irrelevant information and outliers, the probe set may be represented by misleading sets with large sparse coefficients. Meanwhile, it is difficult for a single subspace to cover changes within an image set and the hidden structure among samples is relaxed. In this paper, we propose a novel Grassmann Locality-Aware Group Sparse Coding model (GLGSC) that attempts to preserve locality information and take advantage of the relationship among image sets to capture the inter and intra-set variations simultaneously. Since the contributions of different gallery subspaces to the probe subspace should vary in importance, we then introduce a novel representation adaption term. In addition, a kernelised version of GLGSC is proposed to handle non-linearity in data. To reveal the effectiveness of our algorithm over state-of-the-art, several classification tasks are conducted, including face recognition, object recognition and gesture recognition .},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the leader-following bipartite consensus problem for second-order multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics, node-delay and signed digraph topology. By using pinning control strategies, an event-triggered controller is designed to achieve bipartite consensus in multi-agent systems, where a novel event-triggered function is proposed. Two cases are discussed in this paper according to whether the node-delay is differentiable or not. When the node-delay is differentiable, an LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) condition is derived for reaching bipartite consensus in multi-agent systems by using M -matrix theory. When the node-delay is non-differentiable, some bipartite consensus conditions are developed based on Jensen inequality and the reciprocally convex approach. Moreover, it is shown that Zeno-behavior can be avoided for the designed event-triggered controller. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and correctness of the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract     = {Depth estimation from monocular video plays a crucial role in scene perception. The significant drawback of supervised learning models is the need for vast amounts of manually labeled data (ground truth) for training. To overcome this limitation, unsupervised learning strategies without the requirement for ground truth have achieved extensive attention from researchers in the past few years. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework for estimating single-view depth and predicting camera motion jointly. Stereo image sequences are used to train the model while monocular images are required for inference. The presented framework is composed of two CNNs (depth CNN and pose CNN) which are trained concurrently and tested independently. The objective function is constructed on the basis of the epipolar geometry constraints between stereo image sequences. To improve the accuracy of the model, a left-right consistency loss is added to the objective function. The use of stereo image sequences enables us to utilize both spatial information between stereo images and temporal photometric warp error from image sequences. Experimental results on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show that our model not only outperforms prior unsupervised approaches but also achieving better results comparable with several supervised methods. Moreover, we also train our model on the Euroc dataset which is captured in an indoor environment. Experiments in indoor and outdoor scenes are conducted to test the generalization capability of the model.},

This paper deals with an adaptive UASN-OFDM multi-parameter allocation problem in a strongly incomplete information scenario. Specifically, an adversarial multi-armed bandit (MAB) formalism is first proposed, whereby no prior knowledge about channel conditions is required and the reward sequences are not restrained by any statistical assumptions. Second, considering the curse of dimensionality caused by exponentially large number of feasible strategies, we tailor orthogonal learning strategy to reinforce learning for initial decision set and achieve filtration by abandoning some inferior levels. Third, under strictly limited prior information, we design a time-based dynamic exploration mechanism to adjust exploration factor adaptively, which improves algorithm learning ability effectively. Thank to aforementioned efforts, a low-complexity, high-efficiency OD-Exp3 algorithm is presented to handle the complex adaptive OFDM problem in UASNs. Lastly, we show the upper regret bound and the convergence of OD-Exp3 algorithm. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the existing algorithms.},

In this paper, a method coupling these two approaches is designed using a matrix cofactorization formulation. Each task is modeled as a factorization matrix problem and a term relating both coding matrices is then introduced to drive an appropriate coupling. The link can be interpreted as a clustering operation over the low-dimensional representation vectors. The attribution vectors of the clustering are then used as features vectors for the classification task , i.e., the coding vectors of the corresponding factorization problem. A proximal gradient descent algorithm, ensuring convergence to a critical point of the objective function, is then derived to solve the resulting non-convex non-smooth optimization problem . An evaluation of the proposed method is finally conducted both on synthetic and real data in the specific context of hyperspectral image interpretation, unifying two standard analysis techniques, namely unmixing and classification.},

Despite some methods such as orthogonal matching pursuit can help solve this problem to some extent, it is quite difficult to find the optimum sparse solution .

Most existing deep hashing approaches first leverage the continuous relaxation strategy to learn continuous approximate codes, and then transform them into discrete hash codes by separating quantization operations, which results in the suboptimal problem of hash codes and ultimately affects the performance of image retrieval . To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep discrete hashing approach with pairwise labels, namely Pairwise Correlation Discrete Hashing (PCDH), to leverage the pairwise correlation of deep features and semantic supervised information to directly guide discrete hashing codes learning. Firstly, we integrate discrete hash code learning and deep features learning in a unified network framework, which can utilize the semantic supervision to guide discrete hash codes learning. Secondly, we design a novel pairwise correlation constraint to perform pairwise correlation learning of deep features. Thirdly, we develop a novel pairwise construction module to mine good pairwise samples for discrete hash codes learning. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed PCDH approach achieves superior performance over other recent state-of-the-art hashing approaches.},

Therefore, automatically predicting the number of defects in software modules is necessary and may help developers efficiently to allocate limited resources. Various approaches have been proposed to identify and fix such defects at minimal cost. However, the performance of these approaches require significant improvement. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep learning techniques to predict the number of defects in software systems. First, we preprocess a publicly available dataset, including log transformation and data normalization. Second, we perform data modeling to prepare the data input for the deep learning model . Third, we pass the modeled data to a specially designed deep neural network-based model to predict the number of defects. We also evaluate the proposed approach on two well-known datasets. The evaluation results illustrate that the proposed approach is accurate and can improve upon the state-of-the-art approaches. On average, the proposed method significantly reduces the mean square error by more than 14\% and increases the squared correlation coefficient by more than 8\%.},

In this paper, the spatiotemporal modeling of the goethite process and its optimal control problem are studied. To make the infinite-dimensional distributed parameter system easier to solve, space–time separation is adopted to transform it into a finite-dimensional system. Then, a multi-scale local least squares support vector machine is proposed to establish the temporal model. This method uses multi-scale kernel learning to deal with different trends of the process and establish a local model to track the state change of the system. Through space–time synthesis, the established spatiotemporal model can approximate the distributed parameter system of the goethite process. Moreover, an optimal control strategy based on the spatiotemporal model is designed to reduce the cost of oxygen and zinc oxide consumed in the process. Finally, simulation experiments on the goethite process demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method and optimal control strategy.},

However, when the dimensions of the feature space for multikernel is extremely high or even infinite, the inner product is difficult to calculate directly. To overcome these limitations, this study further proposes a high-order fuzzy clustering (HoFC) algorithm called multikernel mean shift (MKMS-HoFC), which incorporates mean shift based on multikernel space to divide the data and expand the original dimension into multiple new dimensions in the high-dimensional kernel feature space. The MKMS-HoFC initially maps the input points into a high-dimensional feature space of the multikernel and constructs a separating hyper-plane that maximizes the margin among multiple clusters in this space. The multikernel then finds the optimal hyper-plane by HoFC . This method iteratively searches for the densest regions of the sample points in the feature space and improves the clustering performance by using the multidimensional commensurability of HoFC. Real datasets are used to analyze the quality of clustering. Experimental results and comparisons demonstrate the excellent performances of MKMS-HoFC with its effectiveness in practice.},

A key issue to be discussed is how to guarantee both the singular stochastic finite-time boundedness (SSFTB) of the resultant sliding mode dynamic systems and the reachability of the pre-selected sliding surface. Accordingly, a sufficient condition is obtained to ensure the SSFTB of sliding motion based on delay-fractioning method and linear matrix inequality technique. Furthermore, a new SMC mechanism is proposed to compensate the influence induced by LPs and ensure the reachability condition of pre-selected sliding surface simultaneously.

The HDS-SP descriptor consists of both spatial and temporal information from specific viewpoint, in which projecting 3D trajectories on specific planes and creating reasonable histograms using proposed way are two primary contributions. Inspired by the nature of human action, the spatial information is incorporated into the histogram of the displacement of one joint between two successive frames voting for corresponding bins following weight-based rules over an undefined plane while the specific projection planes are optimized by both local search algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); the temporal information is captured by temporal hierarchical construction. The proposed method is evaluated in five widely researched datasets for skeleton-based human action recognition with results significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the distributed set-membership filtering problem is investigated for general nonlinear systems subject to Round-Robin and stochastic communication protocols over sensor networks. The considered disturbances are assumed to be unknown but bounded within certain known ellipsoidal regions. Two types of frequently used protocols, i.e., the Round-Robin and stochastic communication protocols are adopted separately to regulate the data transmission among sensor nodes . According to the Round-Robin protocol, each node is able to receive information from only one of its neighboring nodes in a circular order at each time step, whereas the stochastic communication protocol allows each node randomly receive the information sent from one of the neighboring nodes. By resorting to the recursive linear matrix inequalities approach, sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the desired distributed filter, guaranteeing that the state estimates are constrained within certain pre-determined ellipsoidal regions at each time step. Then two optimization problems aiming to minimize the ellipsoids (in the sense of matrix trace) are put forward to seek the locally optimal filtering performance. Finally, simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Recent work shows that incorporating tag information to recommender systems is promising for improving the recommendation accuracy in social systems. However, existing approaches suffer from less reasonable assignment of tag weights when constructing the user profiles and item characteristics in real-world scenarios, resulting in decreased accuracy in making recommendations. The above issue is specifically summarized into two aspects: 1) the weight of a target item is mainly determined by number of one certain type of tags, and 2) users place equal focus on the same tag for different items. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model named TNAM, a T ag-aware N eural A ttention M odel, which accurately captures users’ special attention to tags of items. In the proposed model, we design a tag-based neural attention network by extracting potential tag information to overcome the difficulty of assigning tag weights for personalized users. We combine user-item interactions with tag information to map sparse data to dense vectors in higher-order space. In this way, TNAM acquires more interrelations between users and items to make recommendations more accurate. Extensive experiments of our model on three publicly implicit feedback datasets reveal significant improvements on the metrics of HR and NDCG in Top-N recommendation tasks over several state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {A key strategy to enable training of deep neural networks is to use non-saturating activation functions to reduce the vanishing gradient problem. Popular choices that saturate only in the negative domain are the rectified linear unit (ReLU), its smooth, non-linear variant, Softplus, and the exponential linear units (ELU and SELU). Other functions are non-saturating across the entire real domain, like the linear parametric ReLU (PReLU). Here we introduce a nonlinear activation function called Soft++ that extends PReLU and Softplus, parametrizing the slope in the negative domain and the exponent. We test identical network architectures with ReLU, PReLU, Softplus, ELU, SELU, and Soft++ on several machine learning problems and find that: i) convergence of networks with any activation function depends critically on the particular dataset and network architecture, emphasizing the need for parametrization , which allows to adapt the activation function to the particular problem; ii) non-linearity around the origin improves learning and generalization; iii) in many cases, non-saturation across the entire real domain further improves performance. On very difficult learning problems with deep fully-connected and convolutional networks , Soft++ outperforms all other activation functions, accelerating learning and improving generalization. Its main advantage lies in its dual parametrization, offering flexible control of the shape and gradient of the function.},

Then, at the lower formation tracking control level, a neural-dynamic combined model predictive control (MPC) method is applied to drive the swarm moving on the reference paths. The MPC can reformulate the system into a convex minimization problem , which can further be transformed into a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem such that an efficient QP solver, called primal-dual neural network (PDNN), is implemented to obtain the optimal control inputs online for the robots.

However, state of the art reconstruction algorithms are still subjected to two challenges including terrible parameters tuning and image details loss resulted from over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a deep frequency-division network (DFDN) to face these two image reconstruction issues. The proposed DFDN approach applies a deep iterative reconstruction network (DIRN) to replace the regularization terms and the corresponding parameters by a stacked convolution neural network (CNN). And then multiple DIRN blocks are cascaded continuously as one deeper neural network . Data consistency (DC) layer is incorporated after each DIRN block to correct the k -space data of intermediate results. Image content loss is computed after each DC layer and frequency-division loss is gained by weighting the high frequency loss and low frequency loss after each DIRN block. The combination of image content loss and frequency-division loss is considered as the total loss for constraining the network training procedure. Validations of the proposed method have been performed on two brain datasets. Visual results and quantitative evaluations show that the proposed DFDN algorithm has better performance in sparse MRI reconstruction than other comparative methods .},

First, it can expand the receptive field and eliminate the discontinuity between each 8 × 8 block by overlapping extraction of patches. Second, it is based on the essence of distortion and can predict true DCT coefficients more accurately to reduce the loss of JPEG images.

In order to address these challenges, we propose a Scale-Recursive encoder–decoder Network with Point Supervision (SRN+PS). On the one hand, an encoder–decoder recurrent structure uses features between adjacent scales to tackle scale variation, and a novel loss function, called the row vector-based counting loss, is proposed to focus on the crowd counting accuracy. On the other hand, we employ an additional point segmentation task in training and combine features learned from the two tasks above. The Euclidean loss, row vector-based counting loss, and two-label focal loss are integrated by a joint training scheme, which improves both the quality of density map estimation and the performance of crowd counting. Finally, we propose a weakly supervised framework based on the SRN structure and the Convolutional Winner-Take-All(CWTA) module. In this framework, most parameters are obtained by unsupervised learning with the exception of a few which are tuned by supervised learning in model training. As a result, our multi-scale structure can obtain salient object sparse spatial features from unsupervised learning .

It demands an effective algorithm to learn a multiple-perspective density distribution for precious categorization. To shape a coarse-to-fine object perception, a hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN) denoting the skip-connections convolutional neural network (S-CCNN) was proposed, focusing on a butterfly domain at sub-species level due to the fine-grained structure of the category taxonomy. Specifically, based on the serial backbone, three skip-connections with Grating layers are established to link the earlier layers and upper layers of network, and integrated with DropConnect, exponential linear unit (ELU), and local response normalization (LRN) to alleviate over-fitting and vanishing gradient. Benefitting from the long-span skip-connections, coarse-grained context with orientation descriptions and finer-grained context with semantic representations can be both took into consideration, and they are jointly incorporated into framework. S-CCNN can achieve the cross-utilization of object-level and part-level representations, and its rationality were evidenced with both theory and practice. For effectness verification, a total of 24,836 lab-made images of butterfly specimens spanning 56 sub-species are utilized as testing samples, while 173,852 augmented images are employed for model training. S-CCNN delivers a consistent and significant boost in performance, i.e., validation accuracy achieved 94.17\% and testing accuracy achieved 93.36\%, which outperformed state-of-the-arts. S-CCNN can easily relish accuracy gains from skip-connections in fine-grained visual categorization of butterfly sub-species, without any bells and whistles.},

Therefore, many methods have been developed for hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution by fusing a high resolution RGB image and a low resolution HSI. These methods have been extensively evaluated by using simulated image pair with exact geometric alignment. However, the effect of misalignment on these methods, which always arises in hybrid camera system, has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we present an effective approach for simultaneous HSI super-resolution and geometric alignment of the image pair with drastically contrasting spatial resolution. Besides, we also conduct a systematic evaluation of the misalignment effect on five state-of-the-art hybrid HSI super-resolution methods under five different geometric transformations and three benchmark datasets. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real images show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art HSI super-resolution methods with a misaligned hybrid camera system in terms of both objective metric and subjective visual quality.},

A probabilistic estimation approach by hybridization of optimal robust control and a damped least-square backpropagation based neural networks (NN) is proposed to design a control system for dealing with unknown nonlinear dynamics of a passenger car. To this end, a four-wheel active steering (4WAS) model is employed and a multilayer perceptron (ML) feed-forward backpropagation neural network (FFBPNN) model is developed as an approximator. The optimal robust control is employed to regulate the yaw rate and side-slip angle of the vehicle to follow the desired vehicle response. The developed FFBPNN model is trained to distinguish the nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle and the corresponding optimal feedback gain during a wide range of operating conditions via the state variables. The robustness of the controller is evaluated using Lyapunov stability method. The performance of the proposed controller is analyzed considering the open-loop and closed-loop responses of the nonlinear vehicle model and a sliding mode controller to track the desired yaw rate and side-slip angle responses. The results obtained during severe maneuvers suggest that the proposed control method can substantially enhance the handling and stability performances of the vehicle.},

  abstract     = {Evolutionary algorithms have shown prominent performance in solving various kinds of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), but most of them only use single operator that is often sensitive to the characteristics of problems. As different operators have different search patterns, a proper combination of multiple operators can be more efficient and robust than using one single operator in solving complex problems. However, how to ensemble multiple operators based on their performances in optimization process is a challenging task. In the machine learning field, it is well known that AdaBoost can effectively ensemble multiple classifiers by giving the proper weights based on their classification errors . Inspired by this ensemble way, we propose a multi-operator ensemble (MOE) strategy based on multiple subpopulations for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. In the proposed strategy, the survival rate of each subpopulation after environmental selection is used to evaluate the performance of the operator, and then a credit assignment scheme is developed by using the weight update method in AdaBoost. Based on these credits, an emigration-immigration mechanism is designed to update the subpopulation that can adaptively reward or punish the computational resources for operators. Experimental results on three complex test suites demonstrate that the proposed MOE can significantly improve the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on different types of MOPs.},

  abstract     = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) appear as regions of abnormally signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, that can be identified in MRI images of elderly people and ischemic stroke patients. However, manual segmentation and quantification of images with WMHs is laborious and time-consuming. Moreover, ischemic stroke lesion and WMHs appear as similar signals in MRI images, making it difficult to accurately segment the WMHs. Analysis of WMH-containing images is important for clinical diagnosis, and thus several segmentation methods have been proposed. However, these methods cannot accurately differentiate WMH and ischemic stroke lesions. We propose a deep convolutional neural network , M2DCNN, that can accurately segment WMHs and distinguish them from ischemic stroke lesions. M2DCNN consists of two subnets that rely on a set of novel multi-scale features and a novel architecture (inclusion of dense and dilated blocks). Our model is trained and evaluated on two public segmentation challenges with multi-modality MRI images. Empirical tests demonstrate that M2DCNN outperforms current segmentation methods. We empirically demonstrate that M2DCNN effectively separates WMHs from stroke lesions. Finally, ablation experiments reveal that both multi-scale features and architectural elements in our method contribute to the improved predictive performance .},

However, in most existing CF trackers: (i) they mainly focus on object localization and cannot handle scale variations well; (ii) the learned CF is unavoidably deteriorated by the boundary effects, especially the background pixels inside the bounding box; (iii) there exists a localization gap between the original image and feature map. To handle these issues, we propose an online scale-adaptive correlation tracker by collaboratively learning a target-insight model (TIM) for object localization and a scale-insight model (SIM) for progressive refinement. In TIM, we introduce a target likelihood map to impose discriminative weights on the image, and then formulate a target-insight correlation filter for encoding the target as well as its surrounding context, which can handle boundary effect and distractors. Furthermore, we developed a SIM based on multiple instance learning and structured-labelled samples, which realizes the scale estimation and position refinement over time. Specifically, a hard negatives mining strategy is introduced to update the SIM rather than random sampling, which helps realize long-term tracking with re-capturing the missing target even tracking failure occurs. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

However, both such frameworks are less valid with the fixed geometric structure or unsuitable interim. In this paper, we advocate Dynamic Attention Network (DAN) to solve these problems. First, we design a Deformable Attention Pyramid (DAP) module to perform a self-adjustable descriptor of high-level output, which utilizes deformable function to model geometric transformation . With DAP, semantic information can be captured effectively. Second, we propose a Fusing Attention Interim (FAI) module to guide the back-propagation of long-short range information in each level of decoder. We evaluate DAN on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes segmentation benchmarks and find that it achieves state-of-the-art results without post-processing. Our observation can be concluded that the flexible structure that possesses dynamic attention mechanism is beneficial to learn multi-scale context information.},

The proposed networks could greatly improve the performance of HSI classification as they select the spectral bands adaptively and avoid the limitations of handcrafted selection. Specifically, 3D spectral residual blocks are initially used to learn discriminant features from rich spectral features . Subsequently, extracted 3D images with spectral features are reshaped into 2D feature maps as the input for spatial feature learning , which does not affect the extraction of spatial-spectral features and could reduce the number of parameters. This is followed by using hybrid dilated convolution (HDC) residual blocks to continue learning discriminative spatial features, expanding the receptive field of the convolution kernel without increasing the computational complexity , and avoiding the gridding effect generated by the dilated convolution. Finally, the proposed networks are trained via supervised learning. Besides, this method could accelerate the convergence speed and alleviate the over-fitting problem due to the added batch normalization layers and the design of a multi-residual structure. Experimental results validate that the performance of the proposed network is superior on several HSI benchmark datasets when compared with that of existing methods.},

Our proposed method cast this difficulty as information dissolve problem in deep convolutional network , which is manifested as: first, the model cannot grab whole details of a salient object at training phrase; second, due to the isolation between layers and blocks, the valued information is blocked within a block, which leads to the difficulty in obtaining the position and the edge of salient objects simultaneously; third, the output of the network is a low-resolution saliency map, which cannot accurately express the edge of salient objects. To address information dissolve problems, we construct a Bi-Connect Net (BCN) composed of forward connection subnet and reverse side connection subnet. Besides, the proposed adaptive learning fusion method not only stress all blocks contribution but also combine multiple features with different scale, so that grab more details on the right salient location and precise edges at the same time.

In the learning mode, a data-based adaptive critic learning algorithm is proposed, which guarantees that the controlled objective adaptively tracks the reference model on behavior . Such an algorithm also ensures flexible switching from the learning mode to the control mode under which the robustness of the closed-loop control systems is further improved. By employing a newly defined mode scheduler that regulates the learning mode and the control mode, the adaptation and the robustness of the systems are both achieved by the developed SNDP approach. Its uniformly ultimately bounded property is proved by using Lyapunov method.

Therefore, it is one of our main objectives to design a non-fragile state estimator subject to the norm bounded gain variation. The sensor nonlinearity is supposed to occur in a random way. In the meanwhile, the event-triggered scheme and energy constraints are adopted in state estimator design for the purpose of energy and resource saving. By using the Lyapunov stability theory and some analytical techniques, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the estimation error system is finite-time bounded and meet a prescribed mixed H ∞ and passivity performance constraint.

RNA secondary structure prediction with pseudo-knots is really difficult, which has been proven as an NP-hard problem. Many of the existing predictions seemed to be limited not only by the quality of the search algorithms but also by the quality of the objective functions used. In this paper, a novel prediction model called DpacoRNA is proposed to improve the accuracy of the RNA secondary structure prediction with pseudo-knots, which mainly consists of two features: a parallel search algorithm and learning structural constraints using a deep model. First, based on the base-paired and single-stranded probabilities as multiple objective functions, DpacoRNA applied a parallel ant colony optimization strategy to predict the RNA secondary structure. Second, a bi-directional LSTM recurrent neural network was used to learn the base-pairing constraints. Finally, the constraints learned from the deep model were applied to the output of parallel ant colonies to refine the final secondary structures. To examine the strength and the weakness of the proposed method, multiple RNA types, including RNase P RNA, 5s rRNA, hammerhead ribozyme, transfer RNA, and tmRNA, were used to carefully benchmark DpacoRNA with other state-of-the-art solutions. The final results showed that DpacoRNA was competitive to the other methods.},

  abstract     = {Protecting sensitive information against data exploiting attacks is an emerging research area in data mining. Over the past, several different methods have been introduced to protect individual privacy from such attacks while maximizing data-utility of the application. However, these existing techniques are not sufficient to effectively protect data owner privacy, especially in the scenarios that utilize visualizable data (e.g. images, videos) or the applications that require heavy computations for implementation. To address these problems, we propose a new dimension reduction-based method for privacy preservation . Our method generates dimension-reduced data for performing machine learning tasks and prevents a strong adversary from reconstructing the original data. We first introduce a theoretical approach to evaluate dimension reduction-based privacy preserving mechanisms, then propose a non-linear dimension reduction framework motivated by state-of-the-art neural network structures for privacy preservation . We conducted experiments over three different face image datasets (AT&amp;T, YaleB, and CelebA), and the results show that when the number of dimensions is reduced to seven, we can achieve the accuracies of 79\%, 80\%, and 73\% respectively and the reconstructed images are not recognizable to naked human eyes.},

  abstract     = {Zhang neural network (ZNN), being a special type of recurrent neural network , has shown powerful abilities to solve a great variety of continuous time-varying problems. In order to solve future problems (or termed discrete time-varying problems), discrete ZNN (DZNN) models should be developed. In this paper, four kinds of future problems, i.e., future linear system (FLS), future division (FD), future quadratic minimization (FQM), and future equality-constrained quadratic programming (FECQP), are investigated. The DZNN models of Adams-Bashforth (AB) type are thus proposed for solving four kinds of future problems. Compared with conventional DZNN models of Euler type and Taylor type, the performances of DZNN models of AB type in terms of accuracy are better. Meanwhile, the numerical results substantiate the efficacy and superiority of DZNN models of AB type for solving future problems. Furthermore, the motion control of mobile robot manipulator is conducted to substantiate the efficacy of DZNN models of AB type for solving future problems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning based visual tracking methods have obtained great success owing to the powerful feature representation ability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Among these methods, classification-based tracking methods exhibit excellent performance while their speeds are heavily limited by the expensive computation for massive proposal feature extraction. In contrast, matching-based tracking methods (such as Siamese networks) possess remarkable speed superiority. However, the absence of online updating renders these methods unadaptable to significant object appearance variations. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time visual tracking method, which adopts an object-adaptive LSTM network to effectively capture the video sequential dependencies and adaptively learn the object appearance variations. For high computational efficiency, we also present a fast proposal selection strategy, which utilizes the matching-based tracking method to pre-estimate dense proposals and selects high-quality ones to feed to the LSTM network for classification. This strategy efficiently filters out some irrelevant proposals and avoids the redundant computation for feature extraction, which enables our method to operate faster than conventional classification-based tracking methods. In addition, to handle the problems of sample inadequacy and class imbalance during online tracking, we adopt a data augmentation technique based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to facilitate the training of the LSTM network. Extensive experiments on four visual tracking benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in terms of both tracking accuracy and speed, which exhibits great potentials of recurrent structures for visual tracking.},

Before application of the algorithms, several current studies extracted features presumed to represent parochial markings from the data using engineering techniques. Recently the deep learning domain offered opportunities to directly feed data into the model without any extensive hand-crafted feature engineering techniques. In this paper, the proposed framework does the feature extraction in a non-supervised (i.e. self-supervised) manner using both Contextual Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) and Contextual Convolutional Neural Networks (CCNN). We can then concatenate data obtained from the CLSTM and CCNN blocks, feed it into the Attention block, pass it through the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) block, ultimately passing it through a terminal layer for classification. The task involved here was non-trivial as there is a major challenge in implementing our model to solve the time series classification (TSC) problem: overfitting. We deal with this challenge as follows; firstly, we adjusted the number of neurons in each of the stages. Secondly we introduced dropouts after every layer in each stage of this model. Finally experiments regarding the University of California Riverside (UCR) dataset indicates the model’s superiority.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning is one of the advanced approaches of machine learning, and has attracted a growing attention in the recent years. It is used nowadays in different domains and applications such as pattern recognition, medical prediction, and speech recognition. Differently from traditional learning algorithms, deep learning can overcome the dependency on hand-designed features. Deep learning experience is particularly improved by leveraging powerful infrastructures such as clouds and adopting collaborative learning for model training. However, this comes at the expense of privacy, especially when sensitive data are processed during the training and the prediction phases, as well as when training model is shared. In this paper, we provide a review of the existing privacy-preserving deep learning techniques, and propose a novel multi-level taxonomy, which categorizes the current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving deep learning techniques on the basis of privacy-preserving tasks at the top level, and key technological concepts at the base level. This survey further summarizes evaluation results of the reviewed solutions with respect to defined performance metrics. In addition, it derives a set of learned lessons from each privacy-preserving task. Finally, it highlights open research challenges and provides some recommendations as future research directions.},

Feature selection provides an effective way for solving these problems by removing irrelevant and redundant features, thus reducing model complexity and improving accuracy and generalization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a novel teacher-student feature selection (TSFS) method in which a ‘teacher’ (a deep neural network or a complicated dimension reduction method) is first employed to learn the best representation of data in low dimension. Then a ‘student’ network (a simple neural network) is used to perform feature selection by minimizing the reconstruction error of low dimensional representation. Although the teacher-student scheme is not new, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that this scheme is employed for feature selection. The proposed TSFS can be used for both supervised and unsupervised feature selection. This method is evaluated on different datasets and is compared with state-of-the-art existing feature selection methods. The results show that TSFS performs better in terms of classification and clustering accuracies and reconstruction error. Moreover, experimental evaluations demonstrate a low degree of sensitivity to parameter selection in the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering (SC) has been widely applied to segment data drawn from multiple subspaces. However, for sequential data, a main challenge in subspace clustering is to exploit temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel robust sequential subspace clustering approach with a ℓ 1 -norm temporal graph. The ℓ 1 -norm temporal graph is designed to encode the temporal information underlying in sequential data. By using the ℓ 2 norm, it can enforce well temporal similarity of neighboring frames with a sample-dependent weight, and mitigate the effect of noises and outliers on subspace clustering because large errors mixed in the real data can be suppressed. Under assumption of data self-expression, our clustering model is put forward by further integrating the classical Sparse Subspace Clustering and the ℓ 1 -norm Temporal Graph (SSC-L1TG). To solve the proposed model, we introduce a new efficient proximity algorithm. At each iteration, the sub-problem is solved by proximal minimization with closed-form solution. In contrast to the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) employed in most existing clustering approaches without convergence guarantee, the proposed SSC-L1TG is guaranteed to converge to the desired optimal solution. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.},

In our scheme, we propose to use a feature divergence measure to compute the asymmetric distances in between users and items. To obtain local matrix approximation , we first propose to use a density-based clustering algorithm to automatically select a number of user-item pairs as anchors for self-adapting different datasets. Next for each anchor, we recruit its neighboring users and items with small feature divergences to the anchor, thus forming each local matrix. A kernel-based approach is then applied for local matrix approximation and a weighted averaging is used to obtain the global matrix rating approximations . Our experiments on the three real-world datasets show that the proposed solution can outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in terms of lower approximation errors and higher coverage ratios.},

  abstract     = {The performance of braking system strongly affects the safe operation of electric multiple unit (EMU). During the practical operation, it’s of great significance to detect incipient faults in braking system. Since the braking process is a typical non-Gaussian and multi-stage process, it’s difficult to detect these incipient faults. Particularly, the usually occurred overlap of normal and faulty samples during braking process makes the detection more difficult. In this paper, a novel method based on data domain description and variable control limit (VCL) is developed for detecting incipient faults in EMU braking system. The local reachability density (LRD) weighted support vector data description with negative samples (NSVDD) is introduced for offline modeling to get more accurate domain description, while the Gaussian kernel trick is utilized to obtain hypersphere with soft boundary. With the presence of sample overlap, the VCL strategy is adopted for online fault detection, which effectively reduces false alarm rate (FAR) and increases fault detection rate (FDR) simultaneously. A case study of three kinds of incipient faults in EMU braking system fully demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Aspect embeddings have been extensively used for representing aspect-categories on ACSA task. Based on our observations, existing aspect embeddings cannot properly represent the relation between aspect-categories and aspect-terms. To address this limitation, this paper presents a learning method which trains aspect embeddings according to the relation between aspect-categories and aspect-terms. According to the cosine measure metric we proposed in this paper, the limitation is successfully alleviated in the aspect embeddings which are trained by our method. The trained aspect embeddings can be used as initialization in existing models to solve ACSA task. We conduct experiments on SemEval datasets for ACSA task, and the results indicate that our pre-trained aspect embeddings are capable of improving the performance of sentiment analysis .},

  abstract     = {One-shot learning has recently attracted growing attention to produce models which can classify significant events from a few or even no labeled examples. In this paper, we introduce a deep Q-network strategy into one-shot learning (OL-DQN) to design a more intelligent learner to infer whether to label a sample automatically or request the true label for the active-learning set-up. Then we conducted experiments in the ALOI dataset for the classification of objects recorded under various imaging circumstances and a dataset for handwriting recognition composed of both characters and digits to have a performance evaluation and application analysis of the proposed model respectively, and the obtained results demonstrate that our model can achieve a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and the need of label requests compared with a purely supervised task, a prior work AOL, and a conventional active learning algorithm QBC.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning fostered a leap ahead in automated skin lesion analysis in the last two years. Those models, however, are expensive to train and difficult to parameterize. Objective: We investigate methodological issues for designing and evaluating deep learning models for skin lesion analysis. We explore ten choices faced by researchers: use of transfer learning , model architecture, train dataset, image resolution, type of data augmentation , input normalization, use of segmentation, duration of training, additional use of Support Vector Machines , and test data augmentation . Methods: We perform two full factorial experiments, for five different test datasets, resulting in 2560 exhaustive trials in our main experiment, and 1280 trials in our assessment of transfer learning. We analyze both with multi-way analyses of variance (ANOVA). We use the exhaustive trials to simulate sequential decisions and ensembles, with and without the use of privileged information from the test set. Results main experiment: Amount of train data has disproportionate influence, explaining almost half the variation in performance. Of the other factors, test data augmentation and input resolution are the most influential. Deeper models, when combined, with extra data, also help. — transfer experiment: Transfer learning is critical, its absence brings huge performance penalties. — simulations: Ensembles of models are the best option to provide reliable results with limited resources, without using privileged information and sacrificing methodological rigor. Conclusions and Significance: Advancing research on automated skin lesion analysis requires curating larger public datasets. Indirect use of privileged information from the test set to design the models is a subtle, but frequent methodological mistake that leads to overoptimistic results. Ensembles of models are a cost-effective alternative to the expensive full-factorial and to the unstable sequential designs.},

Most existing works explore motion and inter-frame information on the features corrupted by spatial noises such as occlusion, blur, posture changes, etc, leading to degraded representation and matching performance. Enhancing features of each frame guarantees a more robust and discriminative final feature representation. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-guided feature enhancement network that leverages flow information to enhance low-level features. Specifically, it improves per-frame features by aggregating with the warped feature under the guidance of optical flow and the enhanced feature of previous frame in spatial attention mechanism . Then, a part-based loss is directly employed on the enhanced features to supervise the aggregation process, which can exert full capability of the network. Experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets: iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance and outperforms most of the recent state-of-the-art methods.},

Firstly, we propose an Encoder-only Transformer Language Model (ETLM) to quantify the relationship between words. Then we propose a novel topic model, referred as weighted Conditional random field regularized Correlated Topic Model (CCTM), which leverages semantic correlations to discover meaningful topics and topic correlations. Finally, topic evolutionary graphs are generated by an Online version of CCTM (OCCTM) to capture the evolutionary patterns of main topics and related subtopics.

Summarily, the proposed approach has three main advantages: (1) Benefit from the Faster R-CNN, our approach can analyze the behavior at object-wise, which makes our approach has good generality and high computational efficiency; (2) The HLSOF descriptor can characterize the object behavior efficiently, and is insensitive to the variations of the size of objects; (3) As a weakly supervised learning framework, the MISVM only requires the labels at the bag level rather than instance level, which makes our approach has high accuracy as the supervised approaches but not requires completely labeled training samples, only the frame-level label is required. Experimental results analysis on different datasets validates the effectiveness of our approach.},

Many existing computational methods not only use the autocorrelation function on the hydrophobicity index of amino acids, but also consider the evolutionary conservatism information of the primary protein sequences. In this study, we employ Average Blocks (AvBlock), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Pseudo-PSSM (PsePSSM) to extract evolution characteristics from Position-Specific Score Matrix (PSSM). Then, we construct five kernels from above five corresponding feature sets.

To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method equipped with self-paced learning, which first learns the MVC model with easy examples and then progressively considers complex ones from each view. In addition, a soft weighting scheme of self-paced learning is designed to further reduce the negative impact from outliers and noises. Furthermore, to consider the importance of different views, we develop an auto-weighted technique to automatically assign weights to views. The proposed model only needs the number of clusters as input and can be easily solved by an alternating optimization paradigm. Experimental results on various benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Particularly, the domain shift problem where training and testing data are sampled from different operating conditions of the same machine is well addressed. However, it is still difficult to prepare sufficient labeled data on the tested machine. Therefore, the idea of transferring fault diagnosis knowledge learned from one machine to different but related machines is motivated, and that is realized through a deep learning-based method in this paper. Features of different equipments are first projected into the same subspace using an auto-encoder structure, and cross-machine adaptation algorithm is adopted for knowledge generalization, where the distribution discrepancy between data from different machines is minimized. Experiments on three rolling bearing datasets are implemented to validate the proposed method. The results suggest it is feasible to transfer fault diagnosis knowledge across different machines, and the proposed method offers a novel and promising approach for knowledge generalization.},

This article addresses a new framework based on Attention U-Net (ATT U-Net) network and graph-based Random Walk (RW) to extract both nucleus and cytoplasm of each individual cell within an image of overlapping cervical cells. The proposed approach starts by separating nuclei from the cellular clumps through ATT U-Net architecture. Then, we remove fake nuclei that are usually much smaller than real nuclei. For each nucleus, a polar coordinate sampling matrix is generated. Each element in this matrix is realized by converting the image pixel from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. After that, converted images would serve as the input of ATT U-Net for predicting cytoplasm. And finally, Graph-based RW is applied to extract the contour of cytoplasm. Because the features of cytoplasm boundaries in predicted maps are so obvious that the segmentation of every individual cell, including overlapping area, worked well under RW. We evaluate our framework on ISBI 2014 Challenge Dataset. The results reveal that our approach improves the performance on extracting individual cell from heavy overlapping cell clumps.},

A reasonable edge weight is defined by incorporating low-level features as well as deep features extracted from deep networks to measure the relationship between different regions. To remove incorrect outputs, two computational mechanisms are then developed to extract reliable background seeds and compact foreground regions, respectively. The saliency value of a node is calculated by fully considering the relationship between the corresponding node and the virtual background (foreground) node. As a result, two types of saliency maps are obtained and integrated into a uniform map. In order to achieve significant performance improvement consistently, we propose a robust saliency optimization mechanism, which subtly combine suppressed/active (SA) nodes and mid-level structure information based on manifold ranking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-art saliency detection methods in terms of different evaluation metrics on several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on semantic segmentation of scenes by capturing the appropriate scale, rich detail and contextual dependencies in a feature representation. Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level classification task and has made steady progress on the basis of fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, we find there is still room for improvement in the following aspects. The first is that the pixel itself has not enough information for semantic prediction, it needs to look around to determine which category it belongs to. However, the fixed size of the receptive field defined by the network is not suitable for all pixels when an image contains objects with various scales. The second is that the extracted scale-aware features do not handle sharper object boundaries due to low-resolution. The final aspect is regarding the ability to model long-range dependencies. In order to solve the above challenges, in this paper we propose three modules: Scale-aware spatial pyramid pool module, Encoder mask module and Scale-attention module (SSPP-ES). Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes and ADE20K benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for semantic segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Sentiment analysis has been a popular field in natural language processing . Sentiments can be expressed explicitly or implicitly. Most current studies on sentiment analysis focus on the identification of explicit sentiments. However, implicit sentiment analysis has become one of the most difficult tasks in sentiment analysis due to the absence of explicit sentiment words. In this article, we propose a BiLSTM model with multi-polarity orthogonal attention for implicit sentiment analysis. Compared to the traditional single attention model, the difference between the words and the sentiment orientation can be identified by using multi-polarity attention. This difference can be regarded as a significant feature for implicit sentiment analysis. Moreover, an orthogonal restriction mechanism is adopted to ensure that the discriminatory performance can be maintained during optimization. The experimental results on the SMP2019 implicit sentiment analysis dataset and two explicit sentiment analysis datasets demonstrate that our model more accurately captures the characteristic differences among sentiment polarities.},

The main objective of this study is to originate a non-fragile reliable controller with saturation effect such that the state trajectories of the proposed coupled memristive neural networks are initiated to synchronize asymptotically to the leader node under direct communication topology. In particular, a novel set of sufficient conditions is derived in conjunction with graph theory and the Lyapunov’s direct method for obtaining the asymptotic synchronization of the addressed coupled memristive neural networks.

However, on real-world datasets, multiple non-predictive time series has different influence (such as different mutation information) on target series in different time stages. Therefore, a new multistage attention network is designed to capture the different influence. The model is mainly composed of the influential attention mechanism and temporal attention mechanism. In the influential attention mechanism, the same and different time stage attention mechanisms are used to capture the influence information of different non-predictive time series on the target series over time. In the temporal attention mechanism, the variation law of data can be captured over time. Besides, the prediction performance of proposed model on two different real-world multivariate time series datasets is comprehensively evaluated. The results show that, the prediction performance of the proposed model beat all baseline models and SOTA models.

Keywords extraction is a critical issue in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and can improve the performance of many NLP systems. The traditional methods of keywords extraction are based on machine learning or graph model. The performance of these methods is influenced by the feature selection and the manually defined rules. In recent years, with the emergence of deep learning technology, learning features automatically with the deep learning algorithm can improve the performance of many tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network model for the task of keywords extraction. We make two extensions on the basis of traditional LSTM model. First, to better utilize both the historic and following contextual information of the given target word, we propose a target center-based LSTM model (TC-LSTM), which learns to encode the target word by considering its contextual information. Second, on the basis of TC-LSTM model, we apply the self-attention mechanism, which enables our model has an ability to focus on informative parts of the associated text. In addition, we also introduce a two-stage training method, which takes advantage of large-scale pseudo training data. Experimental results show the advantage of our method, our model beats all the baseline systems all across the board. And also, the two-stage training method is of great significance for improving the effectiveness of the model.},

In this contribution, we propose and study an efficient and potentially effective option: Applying Disjoint Tangent Configurations (DTC), a formulation that includes discriminants such as Fisher’s, Bayes for normal distributions, Minimax Probabilistic Decision Hyperplane (MPDH), and others, to the output of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network which has been previously designed with a moderate number of nodes to reduce the computational load, but with a high quality centroid selection algorithm , Frequency Sensitive Competitive Learning (FSCL), which allows to obtain networks with high representation capabilities.

Recently, a new ANN model for representing logical relations is proposed. In the model, six components are designed to simulate the operations of logic gates. The work provides a novel way for constructing logical relations running in a neural-like manner. However, the components are still complex and indirect for the representation since more extra neurons and links are needed to simulate logic gates. In order to represent logical relations more directly, this paper defines new neurons and multiple kinds of links to represent logic gates directly, and they can be combined to represent complex logical relations in a simpler neural network structures with fewer neurons. Additionally, this ANN model can dynamically create links on demand instead of the fixed full connections. It can constantly adjust its network structure when getting the data continuously.

Secondly, we integrate a shallow linear model to effectively solve single pair interaction problems. Finally, DeepUCF construct of a pair of user relations (interactive users with a history of items) for the input, and joint linear and nonlinear models to build relationships between users. More importantly, DeepUCF+a add an attention network to distinguish the historical user importance of items, which make DeepUCF more expressive.

  abstract     = {Tor (The Onion Router) is one of the most famous anonymous networks in the Deep Web. It provides a wide range of legal and illegal hidden services to the user. Recognizing such illicit domains is a challenging task for Cyber Security and Law Enforcement Agencies . However, doing it manually, based only on the officers’ experience, is slow and prone to errors. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an automatic method based on perceptual hashing to recognize services on the Tor network only by means of their snapshots. Firstly, we introduce and make publicly available DUSI-2K (Darknet Usage Service Images-2K), an image dataset which contains snapshots from active Tor service domains. We also present a new, efficient, robust and discriminative image hashing method , named F-DNS, built by incorporating the Dominant Neighborhood Structure (DNS) map and the Global Neighborhood Structure (GNS) texture energy map extracted from the discrete cosine transform of the image. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our hashing method , we carry out intra- and inter- tests using images from some state-of-the-art datasets subject to various content-preserving operations. The high correlation coefficient values that our method obtains, indicates that F-DNS performs better than other state-of-the-art methods, especially in the case of rotation. Additionally, we assess F-DNS for recognizing the category of Tor domains based on their snapshots using the DUSI-2K dataset. We compare its performance with three typical image classification methods, i.e. Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) and features obtained from ResNet50 and Inception-ResNet-v2. F-DNS outperforms all of them, with an accuracy of 98.75\%, against 31.39\%, 82.70\% and 85.19\%, respectively. Fine-tuning ResNet50 and Inception-Resnet-v2 for DUSI-2K does not improve the result, attaining 37.12\% and 79.15\%, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose a deep spectral analysis network for unsupervised representation learning and image clustering. While spectral analysis is established with solid theoretical foundations and has been widely applied to unsupervised data mining, its essential weakness lies in the fact that it is difficult to construct a proper affinity matrix and determine the involving Laplacian matrix for a given dataset. In this paper, we propose a SA-Net to overcome these weaknesses and achieve improved image clustering by extending the spectral analysis procedure into a deep learning framework with multiple layers. The SA-Net has the capability to learn deep representations and reveal deep correlations among data samples. Compared with the existing spectral analysis, the SA-Net achieves two advantages: (i) Given the fact that one spectral analysis procedure can only deal with one subset of the given dataset, our proposed SA-Net elegantly integrates multiple parallel and consecutive spectral analysis procedures together to enable interactive learning across different units towards a coordinated clustering model; (ii) Our SA-Net can identify the local similarities among different images at patch level and hence achieves a higher level of robustness against occlusions. Extensive experiments on a number of popular datasets support that our proposed SA-Net outperforms 11 benchmarks across a number of image clustering applications.},

  abstract     = {The Person Re-identification (ReID) task aims to match persons across cameras in a surveillance system. In the past few years, many researches are devoted to ReID and its performance has gained significant improvement. ReID models are usually trained as a joint framework comprising a person feature extractor and a classifier. However, there exists co-adaptation between the feature extractor and the classifier, which prevents the feature extractor from making effective and sufficient optimization and results in inferior retrieval performance . In this paper, we propose a very simple and effective training method, called DeAda, to decouple this co-adaptation. Our main motivation is to construct a series of weak classifiers during training by randomization of parameters, so that optimization on the feature extractor could be strengthened in the training stage. DeAda is easy, effective, and efficient, and could serve as a plug-and-play optimization tool for ReID models, without additional memory and time cost. We also analyze the theoretical property of DeAda and show that it could produce identical features for the same person under some simple assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness on three public ReID datasets: Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 over different ReID models. With DeAda optimization, we finally obtain state-of-the-art results on all the three datasets.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the field of person re-identification has made significant advances riding on the wave of deep learning . However, owing to the fact that there are much more easy examples than those meaningful hard examples in a dataset, the training tends to stagnate quickly and the model may suffer from over-fitting, which leads to some error matching of models especially for some hard samples during the test process. Therefore, the hard sample mining method is fateful to optimize the model and improve the learning efficiency. In this paper, an Adaptive Hard Sample Mining algorithm is proposed for training a robust person re-identification model. No need for hand-picking the images in the batch or designing the loss function for both positive and negative pairs, we can briefly calculate the hard level by comparing the prediction result with the true label of the sample. Meanwhile, taking into account the change in the number of samples required for the model during training process, an adaptive threshold of hard level can make the algorithm not only stay in step with training process harmoniously but also alleviate the under-fitting and over-fitting problem simultaneously. Besides, the designed network to implement the approach is very efficient and has good generalization performance that can be combined with various existing models readily. Experimental results on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

However, noises are ubiquitous and unavoidable in the application of the real-time system. Therefore, the modified Z-type models (MZTMs) with different measurement noises are needed for online solving TVISRPs. In this study, the MZTMs are first developed, analyzed and verified for online solution of the TVISRPs with different measurement noises. Furthermore, theoretical analyses infer that the MZTMs globally and exponentially converge to the theoretical solution. Compared with the traditional Z-type neural dynamics model (ZTNDM) and gradient neural dynamics model (GNDM), two illustrative examples are described and investigated to substantiate the efficiency and superiority of the developed MZTMs. Finally, a systematic method is proposed via exploring control framework to construct MZTMs for online solving TVISRPs with great robustness and accuracy.},

Although deep learning has achieved great improvement in crowd counting, scene complexity affects the judgement of these methods and they usually regard some objects as people mistakenly; causing potentially enormous errors in the crowd counting result. To address the problem, we propose a novel end-to-end model called Crowd Attention Convolutional Neural Network (CAT-CNN). Our CAT-CNN can adaptively assess the importance of a human head at each pixel location by automatically encoding a confidence map. With the guidance of the confidence map, the position of human head in estimated density map gets more attention to encode the final density map, which can avoid enormous misjudgements effectively. The crowd count can be obtained by integrating the final density map. To encode a highly refined density map, the total crowd count of each image is classified in a designed classification task and we first explicitly map the prior of the population-level category to feature maps. To verify the efficiency of our proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on three highly challenging datasets. Results establish the superiority of our method over many state-of-the-art methods.},

In recent years, neural network models have been widely applied and gradually achieved satisfactory performance in this field. However, existing methods either not model the fully internal correlations among labels or not capture the local and global semantic information of text simultaneously, which somewhat affects the classification results finally. In this paper, we implement a novel model for multi-label classification based on sequence-to-sequence learning, in which two different neural network modules are employed, named encoder and decoder respectively. The encoder uses the convolutional neural network to extract the high-level local sequential semantic, which is combined with the word vector to generate the final text representation through the recurrent neuron network and attention mechanism . The decoder, besides using a recurrent neural network to capture the global label correlation, employs an initialized fully connection layer to capture the correlation between any two different labels. When trained on RCV1-v2, AAPD and Ren-CECps datasets, the proposed model outperforms previous work in main evaluation metrics of hamming loss and micro-F1 score.},

In the absence of the introductory description about an entity we intend to know, the natural language text automatically generated by neural network model can greatly help people to better understand the entity. Entities in KG always have multiple property fields and corresponding values. The target generated description sentences should consist of these slot types and slot values in a consistent and high coverage manner. In order to cover the facts in an input KG, pointer-generator networks always copy certain segments from the input sequences via softmax pointing while generating novel words through the generator. But the challenges that when and where to integrate the copied information with the generated one, how to prevent duplicate generation and information loss are hard to conquer. In this paper, the KG2TEXT model based on adapted pointer-generator networks is proposed. In it, a varied coverage loss function is devised to cover attribute-value pairs as many as possible when generating natural language descriptions for entities in KG. Secondly, an attention mechanism named supervised attention mechanism is added to the model which aims to guide the soft switch transformation process (to generate or to copy). With empirical experiments on two kinds of realistic datasets, the KG2TEXT model achieves promising results and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely and successfully utilized in the field of image-to-image translation.

  abstract     = {Humans use information from sensory predictions, together with current observations, for the optimal exploration and recognition of their surrounding environment. In this work, two novel adaptive perception strategies are proposed for accurate and fast exploration of object shape with a robotic tactile sensor . These strategies called (1) adaptive weighted prior and (2) adaptive weighted posterior, combine tactile sensory predictions and current sensor observations to autonomously adapt the accuracy and speed of active Bayesian perception in object exploration tasks. Sensory predictions, obtained from a forward model, use a novel Predicted Information Gain method. These predictions are used by the tactile robot to analyse ‘what would have happened’ if certain decisions ‘would have been made’ at previous decision times. The accuracy of predictions is evaluated and controlled by a confidence parameter, to ensure that the adaptive perception strategies rely more on predictions when they are accurate, and more on current sensory observations otherwise. This work is systematically validated with the recognition of angle and position data extracted from the exploration of object shape, using a biomimetic tactile sensor and a robotic platform . The exploration task implements the contour following procedure used by humans to extract object shape with the sense of touch. The validation process is performed with the adaptive weighted strategies and active perception alone. The adaptive approach achieved higher angle accuracy (2.8 deg) over active perception (5 deg). The position accuracy was similar for all perception methods (0.18 mm). The reaction time or number of tactile contacts, needed by the tactile robot to make a decision, was improved by the adaptive perception (1 tap) over active perception (5 taps). The results show that the adaptive perception strategies can enable future robots to adapt their performance, while improving the trade-off between accuracy and reaction time, for tactile exploration, interaction and recognition tasks.},

Recently, deep learning has witnessed remarkable progress in many super-resolution approaches. However, we observe that most studies focus on designing deeper and wider architectures to improve the quality of image SR at the cost of computational burden and speed. Few researches adopt lightweight but effective modules to improve the efficiency of SR without compromising its performance. In this paper, we propose the Wavelet-based residual attention network (WRAN) for image SR. Specifically, the input and label of our network are four coefficients generated by the two-dimensional (2D) Wavelet transform , which reduces the training difficulty of our network by explicitly separating low-frequency and high-frequency details into four channels. We propose the multi-kernel convolutional layers as basic modules in our network, which can adaptively aggregate features from various sized receptive fields. We adopt the residual attention block (RAB) that contains channel attention and spatial attention modules. Thus, our method can focus on more crucial underlying patterns in both channel and spatial dimensions in a lightweight manner. Extensive experiments validate that our WRAN is computationally efficient and demonstrate competitive results against state-of-the-art SR methods.},

  abstract     = {Spiking neural network (SNN) is a neuromorphic system based on the information process and store procedure of biological neurons. In this paper, a low-cost and high-speed implementation for a spiking neural network based on FPGA is proposed. The LIF (Leaky-Integrate–Fire) neuron model and tempotron supervised learning rules are used to construct the SNN which can be applied to the classification of pictures. A combined circuit instead of lookup table implementation method is proposed to realize the complex computing of kernel function in LIF neuron model. In addition, this work replaces the multiplication operations in the weights training with the arithmetic shift , which can speed up the training efficiency and reduce the consumption of computing resources. Experimental results based on Vertix-7 FPGA shows that the classification accuracy is approximately 96\% and the average time for classifying a sample is 0.576 us at the maximum frequency 178 MHz which achieves approximately 908,578 speedup compared with the software implementation on Matlab.},

Due to the difficulty in acquiring the knowledge of system dynamics, the optimal control strategies could be computed with only history input and output database by employing an estimator on the basis of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) technology. By analyzing features of time delay systems, a homologous equivalent notion of delay-free systems is proposed so that the optimal control policy against systems with multiple time delays could be designed indirectly. Moreover, four equivalent conditions are deduced between the two related systems. The convergence of the rising SVI algorithm with discount factor is discussed according to optimal control principles. The proposed SVI algorithm is proved to converge to optimal values with proper discount factor. In the end, two numerical examples are given, and simulation results illustrate that the presented data-based SVI method is effective.},

In this paper, we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), the strongest first-order attack method on classification, to produce adversarial examples on the total loss of Faster R-CNN object detector. Compared with the state-of-the-art Dense Adversary Generation (DAG) method, our attack is more efficient and more powerful in both white-box and black-box attack settings, and is applicable in a variety of neural network architectures. On Pascal VOC2007, under white-box attack, DAG has 5.92\% mAP on Faster R-CNN with VGG16 backbone using 41.42 iterations on average, while our method achieves 0.90\% using only 4 iterations. We also analyze the difference of attacks between classification and detection, and find that in addition to misclassification, adversarial examples on detection also lead to mis-localization. Besides, we validate the adversarial effectiveness of both Region Proposal Network (RPN) and Fast R-CNN loss, the components of the total loss. Our research will provide inspiration for further efforts in adversarial attacks on other vision tasks.},

Secondly, a decentralized composite suboptimal control is designed by combing model-based fast controller and data-based slow controller. Thirdly, the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop overall system and the sub-optimality of the proposed scheme are rigorously proved. As a consequence, the ill-conditioned numerical issues and high dimensionality associated with the full-order model are eliminated in controller design.

  abstract     = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has been one of the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes aiming to support high spectral efficiency and ubiquitous access requirements for 5G communication networks. Conventional SCMA approaches are confronting challenges in designing low-complexity high-accuracy decoding algorithm and constructing optimum codebooks. Fortunately, the recent spotlighted deep learning technologies are of significant potentials in solving many communication engineering problems. Inspired by this, we propose and train a deep neural network (DNN) called DL-SCMA to learn to decode SCMA modulated signals corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). An autoencoder called AE-SCMA is established and trained to generate optimal SCMA codewords and reconstruct original bits. Furthermore, by manipulating the mapping vectors, an autoencoder is able to generalize SCMA, thus a dense code multiple access (DCMA) scheme is proposed. Simulations show that the DNN SCMA decoder significantly outperforms the conventional message passing algorithm (MPA) in terms of bit error rate (BER), symbol error rate (SER) and computational complexity , and AE-SCMA also demonstrates better performances via constructing better SCMA codebooks. The performance of deep learning aided DCMA is superior to the SCMA.},

In this study, we propose a method for generating the initial population of an EA-based multi-label feature selection method considering dependencies between features and labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first initialization method described for EA-based multi-label feature selection.

This framework is a modified version of the conventional CNN and, when using proper image filters, outperforms conventional CNN in solving many specific problems, such as medical image classification and handwritten digit recognition problems. As expected, this framework achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available medical image (IDRiD) dataset and USPS dataset.

In this paper, we overcome this drawback by presenting Local Distance Neighbor (LDN), a novel feature that substitutes the gazetteer and makes that the model obtains state-of-the-art results. LDN captures an initial guess for each input token based on the categories of its neighboring tokens within an embedding space. We evaluated the proposed network on the W-NUT-2017 dataset, and we obtained the state-of-the-art F1 score for the Group, Person, and Product categories. We employed our new feature together with the model proposed by Aguilar et al. to recognize named entities in the Tor Darknet related to suspicious activities associated with weapons and drug selling. After increasing the samples of the W-NUT-2017 dataset with 851 manually annotated entries, we repeated our evaluation in this extended version of the dataset, achieving entity and surface F1 scores of 52.96\% and 50.57\%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a generic formulation to provide a systematical solution (named ProLFA ) to aggregate local descriptors . It is capable of producing compact yet interpretable representations by selecting representative prototypes from numerous descriptors, under relaxed exclusivity constraint. Meanwhile, to strengthen the discriminability of the aggregated representation, we rationally enforce the domain-invariant projection of bundled descriptors along a task-specific direction. Furthermore, ProLFA is also provided with a powerful generalization ability to deal flexibly with the semi-supervised and fully supervised scenarios in local feature aggregation. Experimental results on various descriptors and tasks demonstrate the proposed ProLFA is considerably superior over currently available alternatives about feature aggregation.},

However, the existing approaches are incapable of utilizing both structural and attributional information in an efficient way, which creates a space of improvement to performance. In this paper, HOSCIEN, as a novel solution to identifying hierarchical and overlapping social circles in ego networks, is developed. Rather than directly partitioning nodes into different groups, social circles are identified based on the link clustering. An efficient scheme is proposed to evaluate the similarity of links according to both structural and attributional information. Then a hierarchical clustering method is applied to construct a dendrogram of links. Two methods are suggested to perform calculations of proper cuts for the dendrogram, which leads to circles with varying granularity . Besides, a supervised classifier is trained to identify the category of a circle based on the structural and attributional features. The performance of HOSCIEN is assessed based on three benchmark datasets. As revealed by the results, HOSCIEN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for all of the four evaluation metrics . Our method is also applied to real social networks by implementing a WeChat applet for classification of a user’s friends into proper circles.},

On the other hand, the training for video is still mainly based on classifying a single frame via its person identity. The representation of the video is generated by aggregating each frame feature. All these will cause that the robustness of video feature is not adequate at the training stage, and the model is easy to be misled by noise information existing in frames. In order to alleviate the difficulty of training video-based re-id, we propose a novel loss named Weighted Triple-Sequence Loss (WTSL) to optimize the video-based feature and reduce the impact of outliers. Further more, we design a Spatial Transformed Partial Network (STPN) coordinated with jointly optimizing image-level and video-level features to generate more robust representation. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art results and achieves 82.2\%, 95.2\%, and 85.9\% rank-1 accuracy on three popular video-based benchmarks: iLIDS-VID, PRID2011, and MARS, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Deep convolutional neural networks are one of the most successful types of neural networks widely used in image processing and pattern recognition. These networks involve many tunable parameters that influence network performance drastically. Among them, the proposed method of this paper focuses on the role of activation function in these networks, while the idea of adaptive activation functions is further developed by utilizing the neuroevolutionary technique. Considering several basic function to be combined in a non-linear manner, the proposed method attempts to construct an adaptive function by the help of Genetics Algorithm (GA) technique, while the selected basic functions by GA and the learned combination coefficients are adapted to the input data. As the network optimizer and the learning rate parameter are tightly related to the network activation functions, they are also included in the GA evolutionary process to be selected such that they are highly in coherence with the selected basic functions. Experiments done on the classification of CT brain images and the MNIST hand written digits dataset clearly confirm the efficiency of the proposed idea and the role of proper adaptive activation functions in extending the capabilities of neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Previous works of traditional zeroing neural networks (or termed Zhang neural networks , ZNN) show great success for solving specific time-variant problems of known systems in an ideal environment. However, it is still a challenging issue for the ZNN to effectively solve time-variant problems for uncertain systems without the prior knowledge. Simultaneously, the involvement of external disturbances in the neural network model makes it even hard for time-variant problem solving due to the intensively computational burden and low accuracy. In this paper, a unified neural approach of simultaneous identification, tracking control and disturbance rejection in the framework of the ZNN is proposed to address the time-variant tracking control of uncertain nonlinear dynamics systems (UNDS). The neural network model derived by the proposed approach captures hidden relations between inputs and outputs of the UNDS. The proposed model shows outstanding tracking performance even under the influences of uncertainties and disturbances. Then, the continuous-time model is discretized via Euler forward formula (EFF). The corresponding discrete algorithm and block diagram are also presented for the convenience of implementation. Theoretical analyses on the convergence property and discretization accuracy are presented to verify the performance of the neural network model. Finally, numerical studies, robot applications, performance comparisons and tests demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed neural network model for the time-variant tracking control of UNDS.},

Our DepthNet adopts a novel fully differential patch-based cost function through the Zero-Mean Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC) to take multi-scale patches as matching and learning strategies. This approach greatly increases the accuracy and robustness of the depth learning. Whilst the proposed patch-based cost function naturally provides a 0-to-1 confidence, it is then used to self-supervise the training of a parallel network for confidence map learning and estimation by exploiting the fact that ZNCC is a normalized measure of similarity which can be approximated as the confidence of the depth estimation. Therefore, the proposed corresponding confidence map learning and estimation operate in a self-supervised manner and is a parallel network to the DepthNet.

The most cutting-edge methods are attentional encoder-decoder frameworks that learn the alignment between the input image and output sequences. In particular, the decoder recurrently outputs predictions, using the prediction of the previous step as a guidance for every time step. In this study, we point out that the inappropriate use of previous predictions in existing attentional decoders restricts the recognition performance and brings instability. To handle this problem, we propose a novel module, namely adaptive embedding gate (AEG). The proposed AEG focuses on introducing high-order character language models to attentional decoders by controlling the information transmission between adjacent characters. AEG is a flexible module and can be easily integrated into the state-of-the-art attentional decoders for scene text recognition. We evaluate its effectiveness as well as robustness on a number of standard benchmarks, including the IIIT5K, SVT, SVT-P, CUTE80, and ICDAR datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that AEG can significantly boost recognition performance and bring better robustness.},

Deep hashing which can well extract features of multi-modal data has received increasing research attention recently. However, most of deep hashing for cross modal retrieval methods do not make full use of the semantic label information and do not fully mine correlation of heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a Deep Semantic cross modal hashing with Correlation Alignment (DSCA) method. In DSCA, we design two deep neural networks for image and text modality separately, and learn two hash functions . Firstly, we construct a new similarity for the multi-label data, which can well exploit the semantic information and improve the retrieval accuracy . Simultaneously, we preserve the inter-modal similarity of heterogeneous data features, which can exploit semantic correlation. Secondly, the distributions of heterogeneous data are aligned so as to mine the inter-modal correlation well. Thirdly, the semantic label information is embedded in the hash layer of the text network, which can make the learned hash matrix more stable and make the hash codes more discriminative. Experimental results demonstrate that DSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, numerous cameras have been equipped in tunnels for monitoring the tunnel safety, such as detecting fire, vehicle stopping, crashes, and so forth. Nevertheless, safety events in tunnels may occur in the blind zones not covered by the multi-camera monitoring systems. Therefore, this paper opens the challenging problem, tunnel vehicle re-identification (abbr. tunnel vehicle Re-ID), to make a between-camera speculation. Different from the open road scenes focused by existing vehicle Re-ID methods, tunnel vehicle Re-ID is more challenging because of poor light condition, low resolution, frequent occlusion, severe motion blur, high between-vehicle similarity, and so on. To be specific, we propose a synergistically cascade forests (SCF) model which aims to gradually construct the linking relation between vehicle samples with an increasing of alternative layers of random forest and extremely randomized forest. Through the modeling of SCF, we can restrict the influence of little inter-variation of different vehicle identities and large intra-variation of the same identities. This paper constructs a new and challenging tunnel vehicle dataset (Tunnel-VReID), consisting of 1000 pairs of tunnel vehicle images. Extensive experiments on our Tunnel-VReID demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform current state-of-the-art methods. Besides, in order to prove the adaptation ability of SCF, we also verify the superiority of SCF on a large-scale vehicle Re-ID dataset, named as VehicleID, collected in open road scenes.},

It is shown that the distributed approach decouples the local contribution of each agent locally while guaranteeing a solution of the network wide optimization problem subject to the resource allocation constraints. The agents operate over a communication network which enables the application of a dynamic consensus algorithm to generate local estimates of the total network cost. Locally, each agent implements a parameter estimation routine to estimate the gradient of the total cost with respect to the local action. Each agent uses its local gradient estimate to implement a dual mode extremum seeking controller that guarantees satisfaction of the resource allocation constraints.

For modeling users’ preferences beneath the observed one-class positive feedback, the similarity between two users is a key concept of constructing a neighborhood structure with like-minded users. With a well-constructed neighborhood, we can make a prediction of a user’s preference to an un-interacted item by aggregating his or her neighboring users’ tastes . However, the neighborhood constructed by a typical traditional method is usually asymmetric, meaning that a certain user may belong to the neighborhood of another user but the inverse is not necessarily true. Such an asymmetric structure may result in a less strong neighborhood, which is our major finding in this paper. As a response, we exploit the reciprocal neighborhood among users in order to construct a better neighborhood structure with more high-value users, which is expected to be less influenced by the active users. We then design a corresponding recommendation algorithm called k -reciprocal nearest neighbors algorithm ( k -RNN). Extensive empirical studies on two large and public datasets show that our k -RNN performs significantly better than a closely related algorithm with the traditional asymmetric neighborhood and some competitive model-based recommendation methods.},

Further, artificial costs and physical equipment are expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a deep soft sensor method for SD detection. First, CNN is utilized for flame hole image feature extraction. Second, a semi-supervised extreme learning machine (ELM) that integrates Laplacian regularization is further used for SD classification. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) The proposed CNN-LapsELM utilizes the CNN for flame hole image feature extraction and then ELM for further classification, which fully takes advantage of CNN’s ability for complex feature extraction, ELM’s excellent generalization ability , and high computation efficiency. (2) Both the labeled and unlabeled samples are utilized for the CNN-LapsELM training process. It fully leverages the information contained in unlabeled data . At the same time, Laplacian regularization is utilized for learning the manifold structure of hole image samples, so the performance of the proposed CNN-LapsELM are improved. (3) The proposed CNN-LapsELM algorithm improves the generalization ability and robustness. The comparison result demonstrates that the CNN-LapsELM is superior to the existing SD identification and the accuracy is 87\%.},

While many variations of attention have been developed over recent years, all share a common component in the application of a softmax function to normalize the attention weights, in order to transform them into valid mixing coefficients. In this paper, we aim to improve the modeling flexibility of a generic attention module by innovatively replacing this softmax operation with a learnable softmax, in which the normalizing functions are also adapted from the data. Specifically, our generalized softmax builds upon recent work in learning activation functions for deep networks, in particular the kernel activation function and its extensions. We describe the application of the proposed technique for the challenging case of time series forecasting with the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN), an innovative model for predicting time series that employs two different attention modules for handling exogenous factors and long-term dependencies. A series of real-world benchmarks are used to show that simply plugging-in our generalized attention model can improve results on all datasets, even when keeping the number of trainable parameters in the model constant. To further evaluate the algorithm, we collect a novel dataset for predicting the Bitcoin closing exchange rate, a problem of high practical significance lately. Finally, to foster research in the topic, we also release both the dataset and our model as an open source extensible library. Over a baseline DA-RNN, our proposed model delivers an improvement of MAR ranging from 6\% to 15\% using our newly-released dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the knowledge learned from some labelled training images, zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize new visual concepts by leveraging some intermediate information for both seen and unseen classes. Despite the existence of various methods, few work tends to comprehensively evaluate the generalization ability towards some practical data, which is important for their popularization and application. In this paper, we illustrate that it is inadequate and unconvincing to evaluate the ZSL methods using the current fixed data split. 19 existing methods are investigated on two practical datasets using 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate their generalization performances . More specifically, to alleviate the hubness problem in the high-dimensional visual space, we propose a cosine distance-based objective function to learn the transformation from semantic to visual features. Extensive experiments on up to 9 practical subsets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the other baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {Hazy image observation is a serious phenomenon occurred by random scattering of atmospheric elements. This reduces the scene prominence in terms of color contrast and makes the vision system poor. To overcome this issue, dehazing of digital images is dealt with much attention in the field of computer vision. Dense scattering in hazy image results in loss of original spectral information of the object. It is required to remove the unwanted artifacts of weather during image acquisition process of the given object to improve the visual insight of an acquired image. It is found that most of the existing methods fail to retrieve the sufficient information from hazy images. To address such problem, a robust single image dehazing method is introduced to recover the haze-free image. This is performed by calculating the atmospheric light of the given hazy images by decomposing and retaining the high frequency sub bands using wavelet domain . The dense haze elimination is performed on approximated low frequency sub band of the given hazy image. On reconstruction process, well-refined dehaze image is obtained. Moreover, transmission maps are also produced as a byproduct of this method.},

However, with these CNN based models, the predicted saliency map is usually incomplete, that is, spatially inconsistent with the corresponding ground truth, because of the inherent complexity of the object and the inaccuracy of object boundary detection resulted from regular convolution and pooling operations. Besides, the breakthrough on saliency detection accuracy of current state-of-the-art deep models comes at the expense of high computational cost, which contradicts its role as a pretreatment procedure for other computer vision tasks . To alleviate these issues, we propose a lightweight adversarial network for salient object detection, which simultaneously improves the accuracy and efficiency by enforcing higher-order spatial consistency via adversarial training and lowering the computational cost through lightweight bottleneck blocks, respectively. Moreover, multi-scale contrast module is utilized to sufficiently capture contrast prior for visual saliency reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art works on salient object detection in both accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Navigation in GPS-denied environments is a critical challenge for autonomous mobile platforms such as drones. The concept of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) addresses this challenge through real-time mapping of the platform&#39;s surroundings as it explores its environment. The computational resources required for traditional SLAM implementations (e.g. graphical processing units) require large size, weight, and power overheads; making it infeasible to employ them in resource-constrained applications. This work proposes a self-learning hardware architecture utilizing a novel gated-memristive device to address the implementation of SLAM in an energy-efficient manner. The gated-memristive devices are implemented as electronic synapses in tandem with novel low-energy spiking neurons to create a spiking neural network (SNN). This work shows how the SNN allows for navigation through an environment via landmark association without needing GPS. In the simple environment in which the network exists, it can successfully determine a direction in which to navigate while only consuming 36 µW of power and only needing to be exposed to each landmark within the environment for 1-2ms in order to remember that location.},

In this paper, a multi-branch conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is proposed to augment data for object detection in optical remote sensing images , which is the first GANs-based data augmentation framework proposed for this topic. We use MCGAN to generate the diverse objects based on the existing remote sensing datasets. The multi-branch dilated convolution and the classification branch are adopted into MCGAN to help the generator to generate the diverse and high-quality images. Meanwhile, an adaptive samples selection strategy based on the Faster R-CNN is proposed to select the samples for data augmentation from the objects generated by MCGAN, which can ensure the quality of new augmented training sets and improve the diversity of samples. Experiments based on NWPU VHR-10 and DOTA show that the objects generated by MCGAN have the higher quality compared with the objects generated by WGAN and LSGAN. And the mean average precision detected by the state-of-the-art object detection models used in the experiments has the satisfactory improvement after the MCGAN based data augmentation, which indicates that data augmentation by MCGAN can effectively improve the accuracy of remote sensing images object detection.},

  abstract     = {Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using only tags can significantly ease the label costing, because full supervision needs pixel-level labeling. It is, however, a very challenging task because it is not straightforward to associate tags to visual appearance. Existing researches can only do tag-based WSSS on simple images, where only two or three tags exist in each image, and different images usually have different tags, such as the PASCAL VOC dataset. Therefore, it is easy to relate the tags to visual appearance and supervise the segmentation. However, real-world scenes are much more complex. Especially, the autonomous driving scenes usually contain nearly 20 tags in each image and those tags can repetitively appear from image to image, which means the existing simple image strategy does not work. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by using region based deep clustering. The key idea is that, since each tagged object is repetitively appearing from image to image, it allows us to find the common appearance through region clustering, and particular deep neural network based clustering. Later, we relate the clustered region appearance to tags and utilize the tags to supervise the segmentation. Furthermore, regions found by clustering with weak supervision can be very noisy. We further propose a mechanic to improve and refine the supervision in an iterative manner. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that image tags weakly-supervised semantic segmentation can be applied in complex autonomous driving datasets with still images. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Although they were able to perform these tasks, the latest generation of robots are being designed to take a step further, by performing more complex tasks that have been carried out by smart animals or humans up to date. To this end, inspiration needs to be taken from biological examples. For instance, insects are able to optimally solve complex environment navigation problems , and many researchers have started to mimic how these insects behave. Recent interest in neuromorphic engineering has motivated us to present a real-time, neuromorphic, spike-based Central Pattern Generator of application in neurorobotics, using an arthropod-like robot. A Spiking Neural Network was designed and implemented on SpiNNaker. The network models a complex, online-change capable Central Pattern Generator which generates three gaits for a hexapod robot locomotion in real-time. Reconfigurable hardware was used to manage both the motors of the robot and the low-latency communication interface with the Spiking Neural Networks. Real-time measurements confirm the simulation results, and locomotion tests show that NeuroPod can perform the gaits without any balance loss or added delay.},

  abstract     = {Under homoscedastic Gaussian assumption , it is demonstrated that conventional LDA is formulated by maximizing the weighted arithmetic mean of the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergences between different classes. However, the calculation of projection directions is dominated by class pairs with large KL divergence, which causes class pairs with small KL divergence overlapping in the low-dimensional subspace when the dimensionality of subspace is strictly lower than c − 1 , c−1, wherein c is the class number. Therefore, the classification accuracy is degraded significantly when dealing with classification task . In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely Multiclass Discriminant Analysis via Adaptive Weighted Scheme (MDAAWS), to alleviate the problem mentioned above by assigning weights to all between-class pairs adaptively. Since the proposed problem is a challenging task, an iterative algorithm is exploited to solve it and the corresponding theoretical analysis is presented as well.

  abstract     = {Mostly and differently, the recovery of high-resolution (HR) depth map has been demonstrated under the guidance of its corresponding color image. In this paper, without color guidance, we propose a single depth map upsampling algorithm. This algorithm adopts a new Bi-perspective discriminative self-learning approach which turns the HR depth recovery process into a multi-stage classification-based problem. It employs Fisher discriminant criterion over different splitted subspaces and sub-subspaces through a new trilateral decomposition process. This new trilateral decomposition approach utilizes joint weighted low-rank and sparse priors which ensure global and local consistency, respectively. In addition, with the proposed Bi-perspective and multi-stage discriminant classification, the HR construction process is converted from single-map into a 3D collaborative multi-map reconstruction process. Moreover, for more accurate discriminative classification-based behavior , the shared common bases or features between subspaces, that don&#39;t contribute basically in the classification, are addressed by a specific shared property learning to keep suitable overlapping consistency between different subspaces. Accordingly, the proposed depth upsampling algorithm shows superior accuracy among most of the state-of-the-art algorithms. The performance is tested by a set of depth maps from different depth sensing systems and with different degradation styles. The proposed algorithm achieves the first rank with a robust performance against TOF degradations.},

  abstract     = {In all areas of engineering, catastrophe assessment is an essential prerequisite for remedial action schemes. Modelers constantly push for more accurate models, and often meet goals by using increasingly complex, data mining-based blackbox models. However, system operators tend to favor interpretable models for after-the-fact preventive control (PC). While switching from blackbox to interpretable solutions, a tradeoff occurs between accuracy and interpretability . To avoid this tradeoff, we develop an intelligent framework for online catastrophe assessment and PC via a blackbox stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) equipped with accuracy and the ability to derive a PC scheme. Specifically, we implement a transient stability cost-sensitive assessment (TSCA) and PC case in the context of a power grid. First, using only controllable variables, we build the TSCA model by adding a sigmoid unit on top of the SDAE. Considering power systems’ conservatism, we explore a novel TSCA model’s training criterion to determine the operation conditions’ degrees of stability and divide them into three classes: stable, unstable, and boundary. Second, given an operation condition identified as unstable or boundary by TSCA model and its desired degree of stability, the PC model (the reverse of a TSCA model’s mapping) consists of the top sigmoid’s backward mapping and the stack of denoising decoders from trained SDAE. The former is formalized as an optimization problem to push back the desired degree of stability to a desired SDAE’s highest-level abstraction. The latter decodes back the desired SDAE’s highest-level abstraction to a desired operation condition (essentially, a PC scheme nearest to the controlled operation condition in the coordinates along the underlying causes that generate the observed data). This approach actually resembles operators’ tendency to adjust and stabilize unstable conditions (in terms of underlying causes) with the fewest control actions. A simulation study on the IEEE New England 39-bus system shows that, as a blackbox technology, our framework not only provides superior online situational awareness, but also finds a viable PC scheme, thereby justifying its practicability in engineering.},

The model utilizes a uniformly connected nodal structure, where the connections are discretely adaptive and the nodes act as simple gatekeepers. The model replicates all known logics used in current electronics, such as AND, OR, XNOR, XOR, NOR, XNOR, NAND and NOT. Additionally, by using recurrent negating connections the model easily creates XOR gates, and adds novel sided and favoured gates. This model also facilitates the creation of ternary to n-ary gates, and it simplifies the creation of a number of majority functions (especially for an odd number of inputs). Also, as a multi-layered neural network , the model allows learning back propagation through the use of its negating connections. Finally, because of its adaptive connections, parts of the network can be used as internal memory. Overall, the model provides backward compatibility to existing CMOS circuitry, while opening up a number of new logics and architectures for neural computing.},

  abstract     = {Recently, much attention has been paid to personalized session-based recommendations, where detailed user information is available due to users’ automatic or active login. Nevertheless, most methods focus on a single-domain scenario, assuming that users are only active in a single domain. Consequently, they always suffer from lack of data due to ignoring the fact that users’ behaviors are scattered across domains. Therefore, we propose a novel model, called Cross-Domain Hierarchical Recurrent Model (CDHRM), to incorporate cross-domain sequential information by exploring correlations among users’ cross-domain behaviors . Specifically, we devise a cross-domain user-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to systematically depict users’ global interests by capturing the cross-domain inter-session dynamics. To separately capture intra-session dynamics of different domains, two domain-specific session-level RNNs, which can preserve behavioral differences, are constructed. Meanwhile, for achieving synchrony of interactions among domains, the user-level RNN exchanges information with different session-level RNNs in a chronological order . Moreover, fusion layers with different integration strategies are introduced to further capture behavioral differences. Finally, cross-domain user-level and session-level information are jointly exploited to predict users’ future behaviors. Empirical results show CDHRM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three cross-domain datasets and can work well even with non-overlapping and sparse item information across domains.},

Therefore, using intelligent and automated methods to solve this problem has become a hot research topic. With the increasing diversity of fabric defects, it is urgent to design effective methods to classify defects with a higher accuracy, which can contribute to ensuring the fabric products&#39; quality. Considering that the fabric defect is not obvious against the texture background and many kinds of them are too confusing to distinguish, a visual long-short-term memory (VLSTM) based integrated CNN model is proposed in this paper. Inspired by the human visual perception and visual memory mechanism, three categories of features are extracted, which are the visual perception (VP) information extracted by stacked convolutional auto-encoders (SCAE), the visual short-term memory (VSTM) information characterized by a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN), and the visual long-term memory (VLTM) information characterized by non-local neural networks. Experimental results on three fabric defect datasets have shown that the proposed model provides competitive results to the current state-of-the-art methods on fabric defect classification.},

  abstract     = {Recommender Systems (RS) are used to give customized recommendations about specific items to users in a variety of applications including social web sites applications, media recommendation and commerce sites etc. Collaborative Filtering (CF) along with the Content Based Filtering (CBF) are two widely used methods which are being efficiently applied in RS implementation. CF suffers with sparseness problem where user-to-item ratings are amply sparse. On the other hand, CBF performance rely on methods of feature extraction for efficient use of items’ description. The sparseness of user-to-item ratings and features extraction impede the performance of RS. Quality of rating prediction and item recommendation further degrades due to the negative values present in users/items latent factors. This paper proposes a novel RS that is built upon the semantics based items’ content embedding model, enriched with contextual features extracted through Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), supplied with improvised embedding is used as CF technique . Embedding model captures the item details, thus resolving the sparsity , whereas, NMF caters for information loss due to negative values in latent factors. The proposed RS with contextually enriched NMF (Contx-NMF) simultaneously overcomes both the issues of sparseness and loss due to negative values, thus enhancing the rating prediction accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on three public datasets (MovieLens 1M, MovieLens 10M)and Amazon Instant Video (AIV). The results demonstrate significant improvement in performance of Contx-NMF over state of the art RS models for sparse user-to-item ratings.},

  abstract     = {Complex action recognition is an important yet challenging problem in computer vision. Sufficient labeled training data are required for learning a robust model. However, labeling complex actions is often time-consuming and expensive. Considering that each complex action is composed of a sequence of simple actions, we propose a new learning framework for complex action recognition by using a sequence of existing simple actions. A matrix is first designed as the probability matrix by manual annotation, which encodes the occurrence of simple actions in complex actions. As the probability matrix depends on label information, it is only available for the training data and is regarded as privileged information. A new framework is proposed, which is called latent task learning with privileged information (LTL-PI). An efficient algorithm is also presented for solving the proposed LTL-PI formulation, which obtains the optimal sparse weight parameters. To validate the proposed LTL-PI algorithm, extensive experiments are carried out on two challenging complex action datasets: the Olympic Sports dataset and the UCF50 dataset. Experimental results show that LTL-PI is a promising development that improves the performance of complex action recognition, and the designed privileged information can offer promising enhancement.},

  abstract     = {As an important component of trains, rolling bearing is always faced with the defection of shed oil, which inevitably threatens the train safety. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct defection inspection on bearing shed oil. Due to the complex structure of rolling bearings, traditional signal analysis approaches cannot detect the defections of bearing shed oil with high-efficiency and low cost. In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable growth and been successfully applied to various computer-vision tasks. Motivated by this fact, we propose a two-stage attention aware method to recognize defections of bearing shed oil. The proposed method is based on convolutional neural networks , can automatically learn bearing defect features, and does not need manual feature design and extraction like traditional methods. The two-stage method cascades a bearing localization stage and a defection segmentation stage, to recognize the defect areas in a coarse-to-fine manner. The localization stage extracts the foremost bearing region and removes the useless part of images, so as to focus the attention of segmentation stage only on the target region. In segmentation stage, we propose a novel attention aware network APP-UNet16, to segment defect areas from extracted bearing region. APP-UNet16 stacks attention gates to enable the attention-aware features change adaptively, and thus can learn to focus on target defect areas automatically. We also utilize transfer learning in constructing the encoder of APP-UNet16, and introduce spatial pyramid pooling to connect the encoder and decoder, to improve traditional UNet. A series of comparative experiments are conducted, to compare our two-stage method with one-stage method which directly perform segmentation on original train images. The results indicate that the proposed two-stage inspection method achieves higher robustness and accuracy in recognizing defect areas with small oil spot. And the experimental results on proposed APP-UNet16 also demonstrate that a better segmentation performance is achieved, compared to traditional UNet and related state-of-art approaches. We will release the source code as well as the trained models to facilitate more research work.},

As inspired by Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) (Lin et al., 2017), the key idea of our framework is to exploit inherent multi-scale features of a single convolutional neural network by aggregating higher-level semantic feature maps of different scales as contextual cues to augment lower-level feature maps via a hierarchical agglomeration manner at marginal extra computation cost. We further propose a Hierarchical Loss to effectively train the FANet model. We evaluate the proposed FANet detector on several public face detection benchmarks, including PASCAL face, FDDB, and WIDER FACE datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results 2 .

  abstract     = {Cerebrovascular segmentation from time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) data is of great importance in blood supply structure analysis, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies. However, complete and accurate segmentation is still a challenge due to the complex image context and vascular morphology. The existing model-driven methods are often difficult to obtain prominent accuracy and robustness. Deep-learning based technology has achieved unimaginable success, but always faces the problem of insufficient labeled data. In this paper, a novel strategy is proposed to automate cerebrovascular segmentation, which integrates model- and data-driven methods. Firstly, the TOF-MRA data are sparsely labeled by three radiologists. Secondly, a semi-supervised mixture probability model is proposed to fit the cerebrovascular intensity distribution precisely, which starts from the sparse annotations and generates massive labeled points. Thirdly, mislabeled points are corrected by a Clean-Mechanism model, to acquire a well-labeled point-set of good quality. Finally, we construct and train a dilated dense convolution network (DD-CNN) by the resultant labeled point-set. The proposed method is validated on 109 clinical TOR-MRA data from a public dataset. Compared with the other state-of-the-art segmentation methods , our method segments cerebrovascular structure with better completeness and sensibility, especially for slender vascularity.

  abstract     = {Automated precise segmentation of glands from the histological images plays an important role in glandular morphology analysis, which is a crucial criterion for cancer grading and planning of treatment. However, it is non-trivial due to the diverse shapes of the glands under different histological grades and the presence of tightly connected glands. In this paper, a novel multi-scale fully convolutional network with three class classification (TCC-MSFCN) is proposed to achieve gland segmentation. The multi-scale structure can extract different receptive field features corresponding to multi-size objects. However, the max-pooling in the convolution neural network will cause the loss of global information. To compensate for this loss, a special branch called high-resolution branch in our framework is designed. Besides, for effectively separating the close glands, a three-class classification with additional consideration of edge pixels is applied instead of the conventional binary classification . Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on Warwick-QU dataset and CRAG dataset with three reliable evaluation metrics , which are applied to our method and other popular methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the-state-of-the-art performance. Discussion and conclusion are presented afterwards.},

Most methods proposed so far try to utilize different kinds of network related data available in just one perfect model to learn the set of perfect embeddings, and then evaluate its performance comparing with other methods for downstream applications, such as node classification or link prediction. In this paper, we introduce ensemble learning to the study of network representation learning . In conventional scenario, ensemble methods train multiple individual learners and combine all their results about the same input to produce an improved one. Inspired by this, we try to train multiple individual models using network related data, and aggregate all the learned embeddings as the final network representations, to expect a performance boost for downstream applications. In order to learn good and diverse individual models, bootstrap sampling is used and different individual model structures are designed. Experimental results show that the idea of aggregating network embeddings really works, and can outperform existing excellent methods under specific experimental setups.},

Most of them choose to conduct domain adversarial training either on the high-level convolutional neural network (CNN) features or on the output segmentation maps . Typically, a relatively small weight is given to the adversarial training loss to avoid the problem of mode collapse. However, one potential weakness of these methods is that low-level CNN layers may receive little gradients for domain adaptation , especially when the network is deep. To address this problem, we propose to conduct an auxiliary adversarial training on the fused multi-level CNN features. Gradients for domain adaptation can thus flow into low-level CNN layers more easily along a shorter path. Experiments are conducted on the dataset of Cityscapes with using the source datasets of GTA5 and SYNTHIA, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative results certify the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to its storage and computation efficiency, hashing as a kind of nearest neighbor search method can facilitate massive data processing in recent vision and learning studies. Particularly, deep supervised hashing methods have significantly improved the retrieval performance compared with non-deep supervised hashing methods. However, most existing deep supervised hashing methods approximate the similarity between two images with the hamming distance between the outputs of the same hash function , i.e., the symmetric strategy. Consequently, it is typically time-consuming to train these symmetric hashing methods, and these methods can hardly take full advantage of the supervised information in the large-scale database. In this paper, we propose a novel discriminative deep m etric learning approach for a symmetric d iscrete h ashing (ADMH) approach for supervised hashing learning. ADMH integrates an asymmetric strategy with a deep metric learning method to learn the hash function for the query images and the discrete hash codes for database images directly. More specifically, we train a deep neural network to extract the features of the query images. Subsequently, we introduce a metric learning scheme for learning the discrete discriminative hash codes of the database images directly. Finally, the feature learning procedure for generating the hash codes of the query images and the discrete coding procedure for generating the hash codes of the database images are integrated into an end-to-end learning framework. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed asymmetric deep hashing method outperforms the existing hashing methods.},

This results in instability of most existing clustering algorithms , because they mainly employ the original data as input to learn the latent similarity matrix . To address these problems, we propose a novel latent similarity learning for multi-view clustering(LSLMC) by integrating manifold learning and tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) into a uniform framework. LSLMC utilizes the similarity matrices calculated from each view to recover a latent representation matrix by local manifold learning coupled with spectral clustering . Thus, the adaptively recovered similarity matrix , which is shared by all views, can well characterize both the clustering structure and local manifold structure underlying multi-view data. In addition, by simultaneously using low-rank tensor constraint on the error matrix, the view-specific information and the noise can be well explored. Therefore, the recovered similarity matrix become more robust and accurate, leading to better clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five widely used multi-view datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.},

This paper deals with the problem of training multi-layer feedforward SNNs. The non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics employed by spiking neurons make it difficult to train SNNs to generate desired spike trains in response to a given input. To tackle this, first the problem of training a multi-layer SNN is formulated as an optimization problem such that its objective function is based on the deviation in membrane potential rather than the spike arrival instants. Then, an optimization method named Normalized Approximate Descent (NormAD), hand-crafted for such non-convex optimization problems, is employed to derive the iterative synaptic weight update rule. Next, it is reformulated to efficiently train multi-layer SNNs, and is shown to be effectively performing spatio-temporal error backpropagation . The learning rule is validated by training 2-layer SNNs to solve a spike based formulation of the XOR problem as well as training 3-layer SNNs for generic spike based training problems. Thus, the new algorithm is a key step towards building deep spiking neural networks capable of efficient event-triggered learning.},

Undiagnosed faults in the machinery’s components produce a high rate of unplanned stoppage of production processes that can even result in catastrophic consequences. Fault diagnosis in reciprocating compressors requires complex and time-consuming feature-extraction processes because typical fault diagnosers cannot deal directly with raw signals. In this paper, we streamline the deep learning and optimization algorithms for effective fault diagnosis on these machines. The proposed approach iteratively trains a group of long short-term memory (LSTM) models from a time-series representation of the vibration signals collected from a compressor. The hyperparameter search is guided by a Bayesian approach bounding the search space in each iteration. Our approach is applied to diagnose failures in intake/discharge valves on double-stage machinery. The fault-recognition accuracy of the best model reaches 93\% after statistical selection between a group of candidate models. Additionally, a comparison with classical approaches, state-of-the-art deep learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches, and the LSTM-based model shows a remarkable improvement in performance by using the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Some optimization problems are characterized by an objective that is very expensive, that lacks an analytical expression, and whose evaluations can be contaminated by noise. Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods can be used to solve these problems efficiently. BO relies on a probabilistic model of the objective, which is typically a Gaussian process (GP). This model is used to compute an acquisition function that estimates the expected utility (for solving the optimization problem) of evaluating the objective at each potential new point. A problem with GPs is, however, that they assume real-valued input variables and cannot easily deal with categorical or integer-valued values. Common methods to account for these variables, before evaluating the objective, include assuming they are real and then using a one-hot encoding, for categorical variables , or rounding to the closest integer, for integer-valued variables. We show that this leads to suboptimal results and introduce a novel approach to tackle categorical or integer-valued input variables within the context of BO with GPs. Several synthetic and real-world experiments support our hypotheses and show that our approach outperforms the results of standard BO using GPs on problems with categorical or integer-valued input variables.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a delay tolerant containment control problem for second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) is studied. Considering the disturbance caused by the time-varying delays between agents, we utilize the delay tolerant character of MASs with multiple leaders to redesign the topology of concerned MASs and solve the containment control problem. Corresponding sufficient and necessary conditions on the communication digraph of the MAS are developed to ensure the followers converging to interior points of a convex hull formed by the leaders. Furthermore, considering the inevitable delays between the communications of agents, we present the topology design algorithm in light of the proposed conditions to solve the delay tolerant containment control problem for the second-order MAS. In this case, we focus on how to redesign the communication topology structure instead of constructing a proper distributed cooperative controller. Finally, some examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

The automatic analysis of such data, however, requires a deep understanding of natural language. Current sentiment analysis approaches are mainly based on word co-occurrence frequencies, which are inadequate in most practical cases. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for concept-level sentiment analysis in Persian language, that integrates linguistic rules and deep learning to optimize polarity detection. When a pattern is triggered, the framework allows sentiments to flow from words to concepts based on symbolic dependency relations . When no pattern is triggered, the framework switches to its subsymbolic counterpart and leverages deep neural networks (DNN) to perform the classification. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (including support vector machine , and logistic regression) and DNN classifiers (long short-term memory, and Convolutional Neural Networks) with a margin of 10–15\% and 3–4\% respectively, using benchmark Persian product and hotel reviews corpora.},

  abstract     = {No matter whether they are univariate or multivariate decision forests, most of previous decision forests determine their partition hyperplanes at split nodes by exhaustive search from candidates or by random generation, which makes some dent in either efficiency or accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new oblique/multivariate decision forest, a forest of trees with principal direction specified oblique split on random subspace (FPDS), where each split of trees is uniquely deterministic once the random feature subspace is determined, the largest principal direction of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the sample data at the corresponding split node and the median value of all the current sample points’ projections on the largest principal direction directly specified as the normal direction and the cut-point of the partition hyperplane. This method avoids either tediously searching for the optimal split or casually randomly generating the split. The heuristic method to obtain the hyperplanes guarantees accuracy of trees, and the random feature subspace selection adequately ensures the diversity among individual trees in the forest. In addition, each tree of the FPDS uses the whole training set instead of the sampling subset. Therefore, the only randomness factor in the FPDS derives from the random feature subspace selection, which to some extent enhances the robustness. It proves that the proposed forest FPDS is an alternative classifier which can match or even outperform the existing ensemble classifiers or other classifiers.},

Firstly, we propose an improvement of the previous approach we proposed in [1], which relies on a novel distribution pseudodistance based on a disagreement averaging, allowing us to derive a new tighter domain adaptation bound for the target risk. While this bound stands in the spirit of common domain adaptation works, we derive a second bound (introduced in [2]) that brings a new perspective on domain adaptation by deriving an upper bound on the target risk where the distributions’ divergence—expressed as a ratio—controls the trade-off between a source error measure and the target voters’ disagreement. We discuss and compare both results, from which we obtain PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Furthermore, from the PAC-Bayesian specialization to linear classifiers , we infer two learning algorithms, and we evaluate them on real data.},

We consider two models: a conventional deep neural network, and a hybrid deep learning model which additionally uses features informed by anatomical context. We find that we can introduce significant errors in predicted age by adding imperceptible noise to an image, can accomplish this even for large batches of images using a single perturbation, and that the hybrid model is much more robust to adversarial perturbations than the conventional deep neural network.

In this paper, we develop a dictionary-based projection transformation learning approach, where the idea of metric learning and dictionary learning are introduced into a unified framework to make full use of their respective advantages. More specifically, to cope with the challenge caused by dramatic changes in visual appearance, we first project the image features of pedestrian into a discriminative subspace to make the same person from different views with the same coding coefficients. Moreover, we develop a new stretch regularization to make the distance between different pedestrian images larger than that of the same pedestrian images so as to reduce the similarity exhibited by different pedestrian images. Additionally, we develop a label consistency constraint and integrate it into the dictionary learning and then we obtain the ensemble learning model of identity discriminator and dictionary. As a result, the coding coefficient and the corresponding label are bridged and the supervision from the labeled samples is also better exploited. Experimental results on five popular person re-identification benchmarks indicate that the approach developed in this paper has higher identification performance than some state-of-the-art methods.},

Considering, the linearized Izhikevich model, two digital circuits are developed for both afferents and are executed on the field programmable gate array (FPGA). After implementation of the digital circuits, we investigate how much information is encoded by this hardware-based neuromorphic system. Indeed, the artificial spiking sequences are evoked by applying different force profiles to the sensor connected to the FPGA. Next, the obtained neural responses are classified based on the two fundamental neural coding for brain information processing : spike timing and rate coding. Considering temporal coding, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machine (SVM) and Decision Tree algorithms are used for forces recognition using acquired artificial spike patterns. The results of classification show that the digital RA1 is susceptible to signal variations, while the digital SA1, on the other hand, is sensitive to the ramp and hold inputs. Furthermore, these responses are better distinguishable to different stimuli when both artificial SA1 and RA1 afferents are regarded. These results, which are functionally compatible with biological observations, yield the promise for fabrication and development of new tactile sensing modules to be employed in bio-robotic and prosthetic applications.},

In addition, most of them do not exploit the hierarchical features across networks for the final reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion residual network (MSFFRN) to fully exploit image features for SISR. Based on the residual learning, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion residual block (MSFFRB) with multiple intertwined paths to adaptively detect and fuse image features at different scales. Furthermore, the outputs of each MSFFRB and the shallow features are used as the hierarchical features for global feature fusion. Finally, we recover the high-resolution image based on the fused global features. Extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our MSFFRN achieves better accuracy and visually pleasing than the current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {The identification of chromatin accessibility is a significant part of the genomics and genetics. However, high-throughput experimental techniques are costly and impractical for systematic identification of accessibility. Many computational methods were proposed to predict the functional regions of chromatin purely relying on DNA sequences, but they could not take full advantage of sequence information to capture hidden complex motifs among DNA sequences. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been incorporated into the chromatin accessibility predication and achieved the remarkable results. Nevertheless, there still exists a problem in chromatin accessibility prediction as how to effectively represent the complex features merely from DNA sequences. Thus, developing efficient computational methods is becoming increasingly urgent to identify functional regions of the genome. In this paper, combining convolutional and gated recurrent unit neural networks with attention mechanism , we develop a discriminative computational framework DeepANF to adaptively extract hidden pattern features and identify the chromatin accessibility based on distributed representation of DNA sequences. To verify the efficacy of the DeepANF framework, we conduct extensive experiments on five large scale datasets, and experimental results reveal that our framework not only consistently outperforms these published methods for chromatin accessibility prediction tasks, but also extracts more discriminative features from pure DNA sequences than published methods, especially on MCF-7 dataset.},

Our results identified that both of these two types of autapses exhibit similar geometric dynamic properties in terms of burst regulation.

To handle this problem, a time-varying delayed zeroing neural network (TVDZNN) is for the first time proposed in this paper to consider the potential influence of time-varying delays for matrix inversion. Moreover, the proposed TVDZNN model is theoretically proved to achieve the global exponential convergence for solving matrix inversion under the Lipschitz condition . Besides, a less conservative sufficient condition is presented to relax the restriction on design parameter γ . Moreover, for expediting the convergence speed of the TVDZNN model, two different time-varying parameters have been used to replace its fixed parameter γ , and the improved version is called the varying-parameter TVDZNN (VP-TVDZNN) model.

  abstract     = {Recently, there is a surge of interest in image-text multimodal representation learning , and many neural network based models have been proposed aiming to capture the interaction between two modalities with different forms of functions. Despite their success, a potential limitation of these methods is insufficient to model all kinds of interactions with a set of static parameters. To alleviate this problem, we present a dynamic interaction network, in which the parameters of the interaction function are dynamically generated by a meta network. Additionally, to provide necessary multimodal features that the meta network needs, we propose a new neural module called Multimodal Transformer . Experimentally, we not only make a comprehensively quantitative evaluation on four image-text tasks, but also show some interpretable analyses of our models, revealing the internal working mechanism of the dynamic parameter learning.},

Recently, some unsupervised methods utilize stereo image pairs as input by transforming depth estimation into a view synthesis problem , but need stereo camera as an additional equipment for data acquisition. Therefore, we use more available monocular videos captured from monocular camera as our input, and propose an unsupervised learning framework to predict scene depth maps from monocular video frames. First, we design a novel unsupervised hybrid geometric-refined loss, which can explicitly explore more accurate geometric relationship between the input color image and the predicted depth map, and preserve depth boundaries and fine structures in depth maps. Then, we design a contextual attention module to capture nonlocal dependencies along the spatial and channel dimensions in a dual path, which can improve the ability of feature representation and further preserve fine depth details. In addition, we also utilize an adversarial loss to discriminate synthetic or realistic color images by training a discriminator so as to produce realistic results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable or even better results than those trained with monocular videos or stereo image pairs.},

By using the mathematical induction method, a novel exponential stability criterion in the form of linear matrix inequalities is firstly established. Then stability criteria depending upon only the system parameters are derived, which can easily checked by using the standard toolbox software (e.g., MATLAB). The proposed approach is directly based on the definition of global exponential stability, and it does not involve the construct of any Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional or auxiliary function . For a class of special cases, it is theoretical proven that the less conservative stability criteria can be obtained by using the proposed approach than ones in literature.

With the developed fixed-time controller, the synchronization can be achieved within a pre-defined time for any initial phase of each oscillator. The event-triggered mechanism avoids continuous controller update and data transmission, which significantly saves the computation and communication resources. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that the fixed-time convergence can be guaranteed and the Zeno behavior is avoided by the proposed methods.

First, the tracking target of the vessel is reduced from tracking the earth-fixed position to tracking the line-of-sight (LOS) angle by LOS method. Then, by employing the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to deal with the uncertain nonlinear dynamics, an adaptive NN fast power reaching law is developed for the path following problem based on the backstepping design methodology. Thereafter, the event-triggered technique is incorporated into the control design to synthesize an adaptive NN event-triggered controller with the fast power reaching convergence rate. By combining with the presented event-triggered mechanism, the controller is only updated when the triggering condition is satisfied. Therefore, both the update frequency of the controller and actuator loss are greatly reduced comparing with the traditional time-triggered controller. Theoretical analysis via Lyapunov method indicates that the tracking error can converge to zero within a finite time, meanwhile it also shows that Zeno behavior can be avoided. Simulation results with comparations illustrate the validity and superiority of the proposed controller.},

For the purpose of addressing error propagate, some researchers combine these two tasks together by ID and SF joint model. However, the joint models usually perform well only on one of these tasks due to the different values of the trade-off parameter. We therefore propose an encoder-decoder model with a new tag scheme which unifies these two tasks into one sequence labeling task. In our model, the process of slot filling can receive an intent information and the performance about multiple tags of a word has been improved. Moreover, we show a length-variable attention which can selectively look at a subset of source sentence in the sequence labeling model.

For the foreground-based saliency detection. Boundary expansion combined with background-based saliency map highlights foreground regions, which are regarded as queries for a foreground-based saliency map.

Finally, we integrate the three saliency maps via the proposed unified framework for a more accurate and smooth saliency map.

Previously, Progressive Operational Perceptron (POP) was proposed to train a multilayer network of GOPs which is formed layer-wise in a progressive manner. While achieving superior learning performance over other types of networks, POP has a high computational complexity . In this work, we propose POPfast, an improved variant of POP that signicantly reduces the computational complexity of POP, thus accelerating the training time of GOP networks. In addition, we also propose major architectural modications of POPfast that can augment the progressive learning process of POP by incorporating an information preserving, linear projection path from the input to the output layer at each progressive step. The proposed extensions can be interpreted as a mechanism that provides direct information extracted from the previously learned layers to the network, hence the term “memory”. This allows the network to learn deeper architectures and better data representations. An extensive set of experiments in human action, object, facial identity and scene recognition problems demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can train GOP networks much faster than POPs while achieving better performance compared to original POPs and other related algorithms.},

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results, which improves the baseline by a large margin, e.g. , 3–5\% in terms of F-measure.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the breakthrough success of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image classification and other vision applications. DCNNs have distinct advantages over traditional solutions in providing a uniform feature extraction-classification framework to free users from troublesome handcrafted feature extraction. However, DCNNs are far from autonomous, since their performance relies heavily on the handcrafted architectures, which also requires a lot expertise and experience to design, and cannot be continuously improved once the tuning of hyper-parameters converges. In this paper, we propose an autonomous and continuous learning (ACL) algorithm to generate automatically a DCNN architecture for each given vision task. We first partition a DCNN into multiple stacked meta convolutional blocks and fully connected blocks, each of which may contain the operations of convolution, pooling, fully connection, batch normalization , activation and drop out, and thus convert the architecture into an integer code. Then, we use genetic evolutionary operations, including selection, mutation and crossover to evolve a population of DCNN architectures. We have evaluated this algorithm on six image classification tasks, i.e., MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST-Letters, EMNIST-Digits, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Our results indicate that the proposed ACL algorithm is able to evolve the DCNN architecture continuously if more time cost is allowed and can find a suboptimal DCNN architecture, whose performance is comparable to the state of the art.},

The resultant quasi-TSM adjusts the error convergence rate according to the distance from the origin. To achieve robustness against structural variations of the mechanical system as well as external disturbances, we use nonlinear damping combined with a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) approximator. The RBFNN adaptively identifies the upper-bound of the uncertainty/disturbances to prevent conservative, high-gain control inputs. Moreover, we use raised-cosine basis functions, which have compact supports, to improve the computational efficiency of the RBFNN. Through Lyapunov-based stability analysis, we show the boundedness and ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system as well as the TSM-induced convergence of the tracking errors.

  abstract     = {Deep learning is becoming more appealing in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of machines, because it is able to automatically build the mapping relationship between the raw data and the corresponding RUL by representation learning. Among deep learning models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are gaining special attention because of its powerful ability in dealing with time-series signals, and have achieved promising results in current studies. These studies, however, suffer from the two limitations: (1) The temporal dependencies of different degradation states are not considered during network construction; and (2) The uncertainty of RUL prediction results cannot be obtained. To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, a new framework named recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) is proposed in this paper for RUL prediction of machinery. In RCNN, recurrent convolutional layers are first constructed to model the temporal dependencies of different degradation states. Then, variational inference is used to quantify the uncertainty of RCNN in RUL prediction. The proposed RCNN is evaluated using vibration data from accelerated degradation tests of rolling element bearings and sensor data from life testing of milling cutters, and compared with some state-of-the-art prognostics approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RCNN in improving the accuracy and convergence of RUL prediction. More importantly, RCNN is able to provide a probabilistic RUL prediction result, which breaks the inherent limitation of CNNs and facilitates maintenance decision making.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of multimedia data on the Internet, content-based image retrieval becomes a key technique for the Internet development. Hashing methods are efficient and effective for image retrieval . Dual Complementary Hashing (DCH) is one such method, which uses multiple hash tables and has good performance. However, DCH utilizes wrongly hashed image pairs to train the following hash table and discards correctly hashed image pairs. Therefore, the number of image pairs utilized for training the following hash tables will decrease rapidly. Moreover, each hash function in a hash table of DCH is trained by correcting the errors caused by its preceding one instead of holistically considering errors made by all previous hash functions. These restrictions significantly reduce the training efficiency and the overall performance of DCH. In this paper, we propose a new hashing method for image retrieval, Bootstrap Dual Complementary Hashing with semi-supervised Re-ranking (BDCHR). It is a semi-supervised multi-hashing method consisting of two parts: bootstrap DCH and semi-supervised re-ranking. The first part relieves the restrictions of DCH while the second part further enhances the image retrieval performance . Experimental results show that BDCHR yields better performance than other state-of-the-art multi-hashing methods.},

  abstract     = {Multi-view clustering is a learning paradigm based on multi-view data. Since statistic properties of different views are diverse, even incompatible, few approaches implement multi-view clustering based on the concatenated features straightforward. However, feature concatenation is a natural way to combine multi-view data. To this end, this paper proposes a novel multi-view subspace clustering approach dubbed Feature Concatenation Multi-view Subspace Clustering (FCMSC), which boosts the clustering performance by exploring the consensus information of multi-view data. Specifically, multi-view data are concatenated into a joint representation firstly, then, l 2,1 -norm is integrated into the objective function to deal with the sample-specific and cluster-specific corruptions of multiple views. Moreover, a graph regularized FCMSC is also proposed in this paper to explore both the consensus information and complementary information of multi-view data for clustering. It is noteworthy that the obtained coefficient matrix is not derived by simply applying the Low-Rank Representation (LRR) to concatenated features directly. Finally, an effective algorithm based on the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (ALM) is designed to optimize the objective functions. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed methods over several state-of-the-art approaches for multi-view clustering.},

On the other hand, Capsule networks are a novel DNN architecture that offer a richer representation because each concept is represented by a number of different vectors. The bayesian formulation of the Capsule networks is still an open problem that we address in this paper. We present a bayesian formulation of Capsule networks and compare its performance against the state-of-the-art for the ill-posed regression problem of estimating the 3D human pose from a single 2D image. The results show that our network is very competitive with a much more straightforward solution.

However, current LiDAR-based 3D object detection algorithms allocate inadequate attention to the inhomogeneity of LiDAR point clouds and the shape encoding capability of regional proposal schemes. This paper introduces a novel 3D object detection network called the Shape Attention Regional Proposal Network (SARPNET), which deploys a new low-level feature encoder to remedy the sparsity and inhomogeneity of LiDAR point clouds with an even sample method, and embodies a shape attention mechanism that learns the statistic 3D shape priors of objects and uses them to spatially enhance semantic embeddings . Experimental results show that the proposed one-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art one-stage and even two-stage methods on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark. It achieved a BEV AP of (87.26\%, 62.80\%), 3D AP of (75.64\%, 60.43\%), and orientation AP of (88.86\%, 71.01\%) for the detection of cars and cyclists, respectively.

Then, the robust optimal tracking control problem of original system is converted into the optimal control problem of a nominal system, and an ADP method with single critic network is utilized to acquire the corresponding optimal controller. Furthermore, Lyapunov analysis method shows that the overall control input which contains AISMC law and optimal controller can ensure all the signals in closed-loop system are stable in the sense of uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB). Finally, simulation results about attitude flight control of NSHV are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

  abstract     = {Inference in natural language processing (NLP) is a tough task. Although plenty of models have been proposed in recent years, they are usually restricted to infer within a limited vocabulary or handcrafted training templates. In this paper, we propose the introspection unit (IU), a new neural module which can be incorporated with memory networks to deal with inference tasks in out of vocabulary (OOV) and rare named entities (RNEs) scenarios. Specifically, when encountering a new word, IU compares its part-of-speech context with the training dataset to extract a similar sample, and then embeds the new word into a target position to construct a simulated sample. The target position is located by the result of part-of-speech tagging. Finally, using the simulated sample, IU helps memory networks to learn the context and characteristic of the new word. In experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of IU with the memory network on four inference datasets: a name OOV dataset, a place OOV dataset, a more challenging synthetical mixture OOV dataset and a realistic dialogue dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that IU effectively generalizes the inference ability of memory networks to OOV scenarios and improves the inference accuracies significantly. Furthermore, we visualize both the introspection process and the effect of IU in word embeddings and memories.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning technology has been gradually applied to solve a variety of fault diagnosis problems because of its outstanding feature learning and nonlinear classification abilities. However, few deep learning network models can be applied to both variable speed conditions and unbalanced samples scenarios in fault diagnosis, especially in extreme cases where fault samples are missing. And most of the fault diagnosis models do not have the ability to update automatically as the collected fault data increases. To deal with the above problems, a deep learning model named renewable fusion fault diagnosis network (RFFDN) is proposed. The network has three main parts: improved feature classification network; second order statistics fusion network and unbalanced feature comparison network. Moreover, these three networks are simultaneously organized on a two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with fused data input, so as to facilitate the network to learn the depth nonlinear domain invariant features. Finally, the RFFDN model and other mainstream fault diagnosis models are tested on two different datasets. The results show that the RFFDN model not simply achieves high diagnostic accuracy in diagnosis results, but also extracts the domain invariant features at variable speed conditions under unbalanced samples, and accurately classifies the new faults. These prove that the model can not only be applied to a variety of operating modes, but can be updated as more data are collected as well, which is of great significance to the field of fault diagnosis.},

RNN models are frequently used to solve computational problems due to the prevalent exploitation of the gradient-based RNN. However, the overlong convergent time and the too large residual error restrict the widespread applications of the RNN model in solving time-varying problems. Further, a special type of RNN named zeroing neural network (ZNN) is able to solve the time-varying Sylvester equation, which breaks the limitations mentioned above, but fails to handle complex time-varying problems owing to the sharp increment of the calculated amount in matrix inversion involved. To remedy the limitation, a modified gradient-based RNN (MGRNN) model is proposed to generate more accurate computational solutions with less convergent time and adaptive coefficients for solving the time-varying Sylvester equation, which replaces the matrix inversion problem with the matrix transposition problem. Besides, theoretical analyses and mathematical verifications are presented to validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed MGRNN model compared with the traditional gradient-based recurrent neural network (GRNN) and ZNN models . Furthermore, simulation experiments are conducted to substantiate the properties of the newly proposed MGRNN model for solving the time-varying Sylvester equation.},

However, this improvement is caused in part by the overlap between training set and test set. In this paper, a novel non-overlapping spectral-spatial classification framework based on set-to-sets distance is proposed. First, each class is sampled using a controlled random sampling method, which is regarded as a training set. The image is segmented into many superpixels and each superpixel is taken as a test set. In order to ensure that the test set and the training set are not overlapped with each other, the training pixels contained in each test superpixel are deleted. Then, the training set of each class is compressed into a more compact set to reduce the computational complexity and kernel trick is used to make samples be approximately linearly separable. Finally, each test set is modeled as a convex hull , this hull is represented collaboratively with all training sets. With the resolved representation coefficients, the distance between the test set and each training set can be calculated for classification. Experimental results based on three real HSI data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to state-of-the-art algorithms under the non-overlapping sampling strategy.},

Firstly, we transform the proposed BAM inertial neural networks to usual one. Secondly, by establishing a new neutral-type differential inequality and employing Lyapunov method and analytical techniques, some novel sufficient conditions in accordance with algebraic and linear matrix inequalities are obtained for the global exponential dissipativity of the addressed neural networks. Moreover, the globally exponentially attractive sets and the exponential convergence rate index are also assessed. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is illustrated by some examples with numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification is an import problem in computer vision fields and more and more deep neural network models have been developed for representation learning in this task due to their good performance. However, compared with hand-crafted feature representations, deep learned features cannot not be interpreted easily. To meet this demand, motivated by the Gabor filters’ good interpretability and the deep neural network models’ reliable learning ability, we propose a new convolution module for deep neural networks based on Gabor function (Gabor convolution). Compared with classical convolution module, every parameter in the proposed Gabor convolution kernel has a specific meaning while classical one has not. The Gabor convolution module has a good texture representation ability and is effective when it is embedded in the low layers of a network. Besides, in order to make the proposed Gabor module meaningful, a new loss function designed for this module is proposed as a regularizer of total loss function. By embedding the Gabor convolution module to the Resnet-50 network, we show that it has a good representation learning ability for person re-identification. And experiments on three widely used person re-identification datasets show favorable results compared with the state-of-the-arts.},

It remains challenging to effectively fuse the multi-view data with various dimensions as well as different structures into a new yet highly informative form, thus facilitating adequate assignment of the objects. To tackle the issue, we propose a common subspace integration (CSI) model. The CSI actively learns a common subspace by jointly preserving the local geometry of each view, while incorporating a global partition information to enhance its separability during the learning process. It can be easily generalized to its kernel version, thereby popularizing its general usages. An effective alternative optimization scheme is designed to solve the proposed model. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets were conducted to demonstrate its superiority by comparing with the twelve state-of-art methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims at developing a faster and more accurate solution to the amodal 3D object detection problem for indoor scenarios . The solution is achieved through a novel neural network structure which takes a pair of RGB-D images as input and delivers oriented 3D bounding boxes as the output. Such network, named 3D-SSD, has two components: hierarchical feature fusion and multi-layer prediction. The hierarchical feature fusion combines multi-scale appearance and geometric features learned from RGB-D images, which is later utilized in the multi-layer prediction for object detection. Both the accuracy and the efficiency can be improved by exploiting 2.5D representations in a synergistic way. To specifically address the shape variance of different objects, a set of 3D anchor boxes with varying physical sizes are attached to every location on the prediction layers. While testing, the category scores for 3D anchor boxes are generated with adjusted positions, sizes and orientations, leading to the final detections using non-maximum suppression. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on publicly accessible dataset of SUN RGB-D and NYUV2. The results show the proposed algorithm is the first 3D detector that runs in near real-time on the challenging datasets with competitive performance to the state-of-the-art methods. The 3D-SSD gets 37.1\% mAP on the SUN RGB-D dataset at around 5.6 fps, which outperforms the state-of-the-art Deep Sliding Shape by 10.2\% mAP and around 109 ×  faster. For an efficient model setting with a rate of 9.3 fps, 3D-SSD still gets an accuracy of 37\% on mAP. Further, experiments also suggest the proposed approach achieves comparable accuracy and is about 477 ×  faster than the state-of-art method on the NYUv2 dataset even with a smaller input image size.},

Then, the piecewise planar scene structures are reconstructed in a progressive manner that jointly optimizes image regions (or superpixels) and their associated planes, followed by a global plane assignment optimization under a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework.

  abstract     = {In utero fetal MRI has been developing in common medical prenatal practice for nearly two decades. But the applications and research on fetal MRI still lag behind due to the lack of specialized image processing and analysis tools. Brain extraction, as an initial preprocessing step for many brain MRI-based processing methods, is an important basis for accurate fetal MRI analysis. However, it is very challenging to automatically extract fetal brains from fetal MRI due to the large variation in fetal brains across different gestational weeks and complex maternal tissues surrounding the fetal brains. We proposed a novel two-step framework using the deep learning method for solving the challenging problem of automatic fetal brain extraction in 2D in utero fetal MRI slices. The proposed framework consisted of two fully convolutional network (FCN) models, i.e., a shallow FCN and an extra deep multi-scale FCN (M-FCN). The first shallow FCN rapidly located the fetal brain and extracted the region of interest (ROI) containing the brain. Then, within the brain ROI, the M-FCN further refined the segmentation and produced the final brain mask by leveraging the multi-scale information and residual learning blocks. Dilated convolutional layers were employed in both FCNs to control the size of feature maps and increase the field of view. Eighty-eight 2D fetal MRIs were collected for experiments. We compared our method with the state-of-the-art methods on extracting fetal brains. It has been evaluated that our proposed framework outperformed the other methods in both fetal brain localization and segmentation tasks . With the proposed method, we located the fetal brain with an accuracy of 100\%. The brain segmentation performance was measured based on the overlap between the automatic segmentations and the manual segmentations. Our proposed method achieved an average of 0.958 Dice score, 0.950 sensitivity rate, and 0.968 precision on the testing dataset, and it took an average of 6 s to process one fetal MRI stack on a workstation with TITAN X GPU and i7-6700 CPU. In this paper, we proposed an effective and efficient deep learning framework for automatic fetal brain extraction from fetal MRI. It has been validated with solid experiments that the proposed method can be used as a practical and useful tool in clinical practice and neuroscience research.},

Ranges are usually obtained based on a presumed or known effective sound velocity (ESV). Because it is difficult to accurately determine the ESV between the pinger and the receiver, traditional methods are usually affected by large-range measurement errors that lead to large positioning errors. In this study, we use the expectation maximization (EM) method, which is widely used for parameter identification, to estimate the unknown ESV by treating it as a model parameter. We propose an EM-based, single-beacon navigation method that incorporates the Kalman filter into the EM frame. Numerical examples using simulated and field data indicate that navigation accuracy can be significantly improved when the proposed EM-based method is implemented, and the estimated ESV is in good agreement with its true value.},

Most of the existing methods rely on domain experts’ experience for the selection of hyperparameters such as the rank and sparsity ratio of the weight matrix in order to get an appropriate compression result without serious performance downgrade. However, they usually suffer from heavy computational loads due to the large number of tests in revealing the best hyperparameters. In this work, we propose an efficient approach to network compression from the perspective of multiobjective evolution. The contributions in the paper are twofolds: (1) We build a multiobjective compression learning model that considers the model classification error rate and compression rate as two objectives in the optimization, which can provide a compromise of the tradeoffs between these two objectives. (2) A mechanism for approximate compressed model generation is devised in the framework of expensive multiobjective optimization, which is able to reduce the high model training costs involved in the optimization process.

  abstract     = {Browser identification is the act of recognizing web traffic through surveillance despite the use of encryption or anonymizing software. Although previous work has reported some promising results, browser fingerprinting is still an emerging technique and has not reached an acceptable level of performance. This paper presents a novel approach by using deep-convolutional-neural-network-based (deep CNN) learning model to extract the complete shape of traffic I/O graph signal in obtaining stable traffic characteristics, employing nonlinear multi-class classification algorithms to perform the task of browser identification. The approach is evaluated on a new dataset collected across a large number of websites. Extensive experimental results show that traffic characteristics which are learned from I/O graph by deep CNN are much more stable and discriminative than the metrics those are obtained from the early studies, and the approach achieves a practically useful level of performance with significant precision and recall. Additional experiments on the depth of deep CNN are provided to further examine the applicability of our approach. Our dataset is publicly available to facilitate future research.},

When these methods are used for training, very large datasets (several millions of instances) can be considered. The proposed methods are also very general as they can interpolate between other popular approaches for approximate inference based on Expectation Propagation (EP) ( α → 1) and Variational Bayes (VB) ( α → 0) simply by varying the α parameter. An exhaustive empirical evaluation analyzes the generalization properties of each of the proposed methods for different values of the α parameter.

  abstract     = {The explosive growth of video data has raised new challenges for many video processing tasks such as video browsing and retrieval, hence, effective and efficient video summarization (VS) is urgently demanded to automatically summarize a video into a succinct version. Recent years have witnessed the advancements of sparse representation based approaches for VS. However, video frames are analyzed individually for keyframe selection in existing methods, which could lead to redundancy among selected keyframes and poor robustness to outlier frames. Due to that adjacent frames are visually similar, candidate keyframes often occur in temporal blocks, in addition to sparse presence. Therefore, in this paper, the block-sparsity of candidate keyframes is taken into consideration, by which the VS problem is formulated as a block sparse dictionary selection model. Moreover, a simultaneous block version of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (SBOMP) algorithm is designed for model optimization. Two keyframe selection strategies are also explored for each block. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, namely VSumm and TVSum datasets, demonstrate that the proposed SBOMP based VS method clearly outperforms several state-of-the-art sparse representation based methods in terms of F-score, redundancy among keyframes and robustness to outlier frames.},

However, the precise weight tuning protocol (PWTP) requires a significant amount of time because it requires repeated read-verify-write cycles for each synapse device. In this paper, we propose an efficient PWTP method to significantly reduce the weight mapping time by greatly reducing the number of synaptic devices to which PWTP should be applied. In the proposed method, the effect of weight variation of synaptic devices on the inference accuracy of neural networks depends largely on which layer the synaptic devices belong to. Using our layer-selection method, the required percentage of PWTP-applied synaptic devices is can be reduced by up to 2600 times compared to that of the conventional method where PWTP is applied to all or part of the synaptic devices which are simply ranked by the weight magnitude. Also, three criteria of variation sensitivity are evaluated and compared in the method of selecting synaptic devices to which PWTP is applied within the selected layer.},

  abstract     = {Change detection between multi-temporal images becomes a core technique widely used in various fields. But there still exist some challenging issues in the field of change detection. This thesis mainly focuses on the issue that two compared images captured at different times are hard to be precisely aligned due to the fact that the camera is mounted on a moving platform. This issue will lead to the problem that it is difficult to determine the change area between a pair of roughly registered images in pixel-level. To conquer this problem, a novel deep learning based change detection framework, consisting of two collaborative modules, is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy and computation efficiency. The first module is mainly used to roughly predict change areas and match information of two unaligned compared images in the absence of ground truth. The second module aims to refine the change areas and make results more accurate and interpretative. Because of the designed two modules, the framework could not only deal with two roughly registered images, but also be robust to uninteresting change coming from noise or arbitrary spurious differences. Although it is a two-stage method, the proposed framework is trained end-to-end. Meanwhile, the design of pure network make it efficient. Experiments evaluated on PCD-2015 dataset and AICD 2012 dataset demonstrate the method outperforms existing literatures.},

To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose a novel clustering framework where a robust graph is learned with noise removal, and simultaneously, with desirable clustering structure . To this end, we first learn a discriminative representation of data samples via sparse reconstruction. Then, a robust graph is automatically constructed with adaptive neighbors to each data sample. Simultaneously, a reasonable rank constraint is imposed on the Laplacian matrix of similarity graph to pursue the ideal clustering structure , where the number of connected components in the learned graph is exactly equal to the number of clusters. We finally derive an alternate optimization algorithm guaranteed with convergence to solve the formulated unified learning framework to achieve better prediction accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art clustering techniques .},

  abstract     = {Causal inference aims to estimate the treatment effect of an intervention on the target outcome variable and has received great attention across fields ranging from economics and statistics to machine learning . Observational causal inference is challenging because the pre-treatment variables may influence both the treatment and the outcome, resulting in confounding bias. The classic inverse propensity weighting (IPW) estimator is theoretically able to eliminate the confounding bias. However, in observational studies, the propensity scores used in the IPW estimator must be estimated from finite observational data and may be subject to extreme values, leading to the problem of highly variable importance weights, which consequently makes the estimated causal effect unstable or even misleading. In this paper, by reframing the IPW estimator in the importance sampling framework, we propose a Pareto-smoothing method to tackle this problem. The generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) from extreme value theory is used to fit the upper tail of the estimated importance weights and to replace them using the order statistics of the fitted GPD. To validate the performance of the new method, we conducted extensive experiments on simulated and semi-simulated datasets. Compared with two existing methods for importance weight stabilization, i.e., weight truncation and self-normalization, the proposed method generally achieves better performance in settings with a small sample size and high-dimensional covariates. Its application on a real-world heath dataset indicates its utility in estimating causal effects for program evaluation.},

In the real-valued and complex-valued NNs, there exist three types of reducibilities. In the hyperbolic NNs, there exists another type of reducibilities, and it has been difficult to determine all the reducibilities of hyperbolic NNs. It is proved that hyperbolic NNs have another reducibility, referred to as hyperbola-reducibility, and all the reducibities of hyperbolic NNs are determined.

We have shown that the mechanism of the suppression of ectopic bursting discharges is the base for the changes in the dynamical complexity of patterns in the nociceptive neurons. Under the conditions of the potassium blocking, the molecular mechanism of suppression of these discharges can be connected entirely with the modification of the activation gating system of slow Na V 1.8 sodium channels by the specific action of comenic acid that is a drug substance of a new non-opioid analgesic anoceptin.

  abstract     = {Due to the rapid development of multimedia technology, a large number of unlabelled data with high dimensionality need to be processed. The high dimensionality of data not only increases the computation burden of computer hardware, but also hinders algorithms to obtain optimal performance. Unsupervised feature selection, which is regarded as a means of dimensionality reduction, has been widely recognized as an important and challenging pre-step for many machine learning and data mining tasks . However, we observe that there are at least two issues in previous unsupervised feature selection methods. Firstly, traditional unsupervised feature selection algorithms usually assume that the data instances are identically distributed and there is no dependency between them. However, the data instances are not only associated with high dimensional features but also inherently interconnected with each other. Secondly, the traditional similarity graph used in previous methods can only describe the pair-wise relations of data, but cannot capture the high-order relations, so that the complex structures implied in the data cannot be sufficiently exploited. In this work, we propose a robust unsupervised feature selection method which embeds the latent representation learning into feature selection. Instead of measuring the feature importances in original data space, the feature selection is carried out in the learned latent representation space which is more robust to noises. In order to capture the local manifold geometrical structure of original data in a high-order manner, a hypergraph is adaptively learned and embedded into the resultant model.

  abstract     = {This study aims to address and test a new residual learning algorithm in neural network applied to the projection data to generate high qualified imaging by reducing the streaking artifacts in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Since the streaking artifacts have a large relationship with the noise on the projection, a residual objective upon Poisson noise corresponding to the image was proposed. As the prior, the convolution neural network (CNN) was constructed to residual learning based on the simulated label and exploited to eliminate the artifacts in the slice. To illustrate the robustness and applicability of CNN, the proposed method is evaluated using CBCT images. For the simulated projection, the PSNR and SSIM of the proposed method were dramatically increased by 15.4\% and 85.9\% of that with raw projection; for the true projection, the PSNR and SSIM were increased by 14.9\% and 56.2\%, respectively. Study results show effective results, and the proposed method is practical and attractive as a preferred solution to CT streaking artifacts suppression.},

Although transfer learning and data fusion methodologies try to address this challenge, they lack robust uncertainty quantification which is crucial for decision making. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous approach for uncertainty quantification in decision making. Uncertainty quantification using Bayesian inference takes into consideration uncertainty associated with model parameters, as well as, the uncertainty in combining multiple sources of data. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework for transfer learning using neural networks that considers single and multiple sources of data. We use existence of prior distributions to define the dependency between different data sources in a multi-source Bayesian transfer learning framework. We use Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method to obtain samples from the posterior distribution that consider the knowledge from the source datasets as priors . The results show that the framework provides a robust probabilistic approach for decision making with accuracy that is similar to gradient-based learning methods. Moreover, the results are comparable to related machine learning methods used for transfer learning in the literature.},

It predicts eye positions from coarse-to-fine to improve the performance of eye localization, and binary network not only helps to reduce the storage size of the model, but also speeds up the operation. Experiments on eye localization are performed using Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), BioID, and Labeled Face Parts in the Wild (LFPW) Databases, from which the results show that the average detection errors of left eye and right eye by our method are 0.66\% and 0.71\% on LFW, respectively. The operation speed of binary network is approximately as twice as that of non-binary. In addition, our method requires less storage capacity, which maintains higher performance on BioID and LFPW, compared to some state-of-the-art works.},

A nonlinear feature extraction method based on deep multiset CCA (DMCCA) is proposed for SSVEP recognition to fully utilize the real EEG and constructed sine–cosine signals. In DMCCA, neural networks are trained to learn the nonlinear representations of multiple sets of EEG signals at the same frequency by maximizing the overall correlation within the representations and reference signals. Therefore, reference signals are augmented with the extracted features for frequency recognition. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated using SSVEP signals collected from 10 subjects. DMCCA-based method outperforms others in terms of classification accuracy compared with CCA- and multiset CCA-based methods.

  abstract     = {In image classification , deriving robust image representations is a key process that determines the performance of vision systems. Numerous image features and descriptors have been developed manually over the years. As an alternative, however, deep neural networks , in particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have become popular for learning image features or representations from data and have demonstrated remarkable performance in many real-world applications. But CNNs often require huge amount of labelled data, which may be prohibitive in many applications, as well as long training times. This paper considers an alternative, data-independent means of obtaining features for CNNs. The proposed framework makes use of the Markov random field (MRF) and self-organising map (SOM) to generate basic features and model both intra- and inter-image dependencies. Various MRF textures are synthesized first, and are then clustered by a convolutional translation-invariant SOM, to form generic image features. These features can be directly applied as early convolutional filters of the CNN, leading to a new way of deriving effective features for image classification . The MRF framework also offers a theoretical and transparent way to examine and determine the influence of image features on performance of CNNs. Comprehensive experiments on the MNIST, rotated MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets were conducted with results outperforming most state-of-the-art models of similar complexity.},

Instead of estimating the transmission map and atmospheric light as previously performed, we directly generate a haze-free image by the proposed end-to-end trainable neural network . We derive five maps from the original hazy image based on the characteristics of the hazy scene to improve the dehazing performance. First, the exposure map (EM) and saliency map (SM) complement each other to focus on details in far-away and near-region scenes. Second, the white balance map (BM) and gamma correction map (GM) are employed to recover the latent colour and intensity components of the scene. Finally, the haze veil map (VM) is introduced to enhance the global image contrast. To efficiently blend the five derived maps, we propose a U-shaped deep convolutional network consisting of encoder and decoder layers to generate a haze-free image. The convolutional layers transferred from the pretrained ResNet50 are used as encoder layers for hierarchical feature extraction. Two efficient blocks, named the cascaded residual block and the channel compression block, are proposed in the network for better dehazing performance. The final dehazed result is generated by combining the significant features of the different derived maps. Additionally, perceptual loss is introduced for better visual quality. The experimental results for both synthetic and natural hazy images demonstrate that our algorithm performs comparably or even better than state-of-the-art methods in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structure similarity (SSIM) and visual quality.},

We construct an asynchronous SNP-MC system using only 38 neurons and preserving its universality for computing functions.

In comparing with the existing literature, asynchronous SNP-MC system needs fewer neurons than any other small asynchronous SN P system and even some synchronous SN P systems.

  abstract     = {With rapid development of satellite and airplane platforms, aerial image has become more and more accessible. Aerial image scene classification plays an important role in many remote sensing and geo-science applications. Deep learning methods , especially convolutional neural network (CNN), have boosted the performance of aerial image scene classification significantly because of the strong feature representation ability. However, the distribution of geo-spatial objects and the spatial arrangement of aerial image scenes is often more complicated than natural image scenes. While current CNNs usually highlight the global semantics, more local semantics and more discriminative features need to be preserved to deal with the aforementioned challenges in aerial scenes. In this paper, we propose a residual attention based dense connected convolutional neural network (RADC-Net) to tackle this problem. This framework contains three dense block each followed by an attention block and an enhanced classification layer. Firstly, we simplify the current dense connection structure so that our dense block has much fewer parameters while maintaining discriminative convolutional feature representation ability. Then, we propose a novel residual attention block for our framework to highlight the local semantics relevant to the aerial scenes. Finally, we introduce an enhanced classification layer in our framework to further refine the extracted convolutional features and highlight local semantic information. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed RADC-Net on three publicly available benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RADC-Net outperforms some state-of-the-art methods with much fewer parameters.},

The time-varying impulsive synchronization gains are able to adapt to the variation of sampling intervals, and thus can improve the synchronization performance. The stability analysis of the resultant synchronization error system is performed by applying an impulse-time-dependent discretized Lyapunov functions based method. Sufficient conditions for the existence of desired impulsive synchronization controllers are derived in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

Many researchers used metric learning methods and have achieved reasonably good performance in kinship verification, none of these methods looks at the kinship verification as a cross-view matching problem. To tackle this issue, we propose a tensor cross-view method to train multilinear data using local histograms of local features descriptors. Therefore, we learn a hierarchical tensor transformation to project each pair face images into the same implicit feature space, in which the distance of each positive pair is minimized and that of each negative pair is maximized. Moreover, TXQDA was proposed to separate the multifactor structure of face images (i.e. kinship, age, gender, expression, illumination and pose) from different dimensions of the tensor. Thus, our TXQDA achieves better classification results through discovering a lowdimensional tensor subspace that enlarges the margin of different kin relation classes. Experimental evaluation on five challenging databases namely Cornell KinFace, UB KinFace, TSKinFace, KinFaceW-II and FIW databases, show that the proposed TXQDA significantly outperforms the current state of the art.},

However, this learning way may generate incorrect representations inevitably and cannot correct them online without any feedback. To tackle this problem, we propose a biologically-inspired hierarchical cognitive system called Self-Organizing Developmental Cognitive Architecture with Interactive Reinforcement Learning (SODCA-IRL). The architecture introduces interactive reinforcement learning into hierarchical self-organizing incremental neural networks to simultaneously learn object concepts and fine-tune the learned knowledge by interacting with humans. In order to realize the integration, we equip individual neural networks with a memory model, which is designed as an exponential function controlled by two forgetting factors to simulate the consolidation and forgetting processes of humans. Besides, an interactive reinforcement strategy is designed to provide appropriate rewards and execute mistake correction. The feedback acts on the forgetting factors to reinforce or weaken the memory of neurons. Therefore, correct knowledge is preserved while incorrect representations are forgotten. Experimental results show that the proposed method can make effective use of the feedback from humans to improve the learning effectiveness significantly and reduce the model redundancy.},

In this paper, we propose a novel stereoscopic video saliency detection method based on spatiotemporal correlation and depth confidence optimization. First, spatial saliency is obtained by color contrast computation and further enhancing spatial correlation between neighbors. Second, temporal saliency is calculated by propagating motion information between frames. The special propagation in sequential frames and reverse sequential frames augments the temporal correlation. Furthermore, a depth confidence optimization is proposed to fuse the spatial saliency and temporal saliency to generate optimal saliency map adaptively. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed saliency method.},

With the principle of IRL method, the requirement for the system drift dynamics is relaxed in the controller design. Moreover, different from the conventional iteration computation methods, the algorithm developed in this work is implemented in an online adaptive fashion, which provides a new way to combine the IRL algorithm and the event-triggered control framework in solving the NZS game issues. In the event-based algorithm, a state-dependent triggering condition is presented, which not only guarantees the closed-loop system stability, but also reduces the computation and communication loads of the controlled plant. By means of Lyapunov theorem, the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) properties of the system states and the critic weight estimation errors have been proved.

  abstract     = {We approximate the version space which covers all feasible classification hypotheses into a structured geometric hypersphere against agnostic distribution. We present a structured perspective that divides the available active learning (AL) sampling approaches into two kinds of strategies: Outer Volume Sampling and Inner Volume Sampling . For the outer volume, it is represented by a circumscribed hypersphere which would exclude any outlier (non-promising) hypothesis from the version space globally. While for the inner volume, it is represented by many inscribed hyperspheres, which cover most of hypotheses within the outer volume. To enhance the performance of AL, we aggregate the two kinds of volumes to eliminate their sampling biases via finding the optimal inscribed hyperspheres in the enclosing space of outer volume. We then propose a Volume-based Model for the AL sampling without any distribution assumption. To generalize our theoretical model, in a non-linear feature space, spanned by kernel, we use sequential optimization to globally optimize the original space to a sparse space by halving the size of the kernel space. Then, the expectation maximization (EM) model which returns the local center helps us to find a local representation. To describe this process, we propose an easy-to-implement algorithm called Volume-based AL (VAL). Empirical evaluation on a various set of structured clustering and unstructured handwritten digit data sets have demonstrated that, employing our proposed model can accelerate the decline of the prediction error rate with fewer sampling number compared with the other algorithms.},

However, despite the huge advances in features development and mid-level representations, a single visual descriptor is often insufficient to achieve effective retrieval results in several scenarios. Mainly due to the diverse aspects involved in human visual perception, the combination of different features has been establishing as a relevant trend in image retrieval . An intrinsic difficulty consists in the task of selecting the features to combine, which is often supported by supervised learning approaches. Therefore, in the absence of labeled data, selecting features in an unsupervised way is a very challenging, although essential task. In this paper, an unsupervised framework is proposed to select and fuse visual features in order to improve the effectiveness of image retrieval tasks. The framework estimates the effectiveness and correlation among features through a rank-based analysis and uses a list of ranker pairs to determine the selected features combinations. High-effective retrieval results were achieved through a comprehensive experimental evaluation conducted on 5 public datasets, involving 41 different features and comparison with other methods. Relative gains up to +55\% were obtained in relation to the highest effective isolated feature.},

In this scheme, a stable nonlinear observer is designed to estimate the system states and neural networks with random hidden nodes are utilized in this observer to approximate unknown functions. A projection algorithm is adopted to estimate system unknown parameters such that the boundedness of parameter estimates is guaranteed. It is proved that the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system can be ensured by the proposed modified Lyapunov function . Also the ultimate bound of the tracking error depends on design parameters, adjustable jumping amplitude of Lyapunov function and minimum fault time interval.

  abstract     = {Multiple sensory signal, such as various visual stimuli, can be simultaneously transmitted and processed through different cortical areas . Using a biologically inspired model, we investigate the mechanism underlying such multiplexing in cortex. The network model is comprised of five feedforward-connected neural population of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. Numerical results indicate that multiple input signals are independently transmitted through feedforward neural networks via stochastic resonance (SR), and the transmission of information between adjacent cortical areas is altered by E-I relation of local cortical circuits. Due to different intrinsic properties of neurons, excitatory population can induce stochastic resonance to respond to low-frequency signal, and inhibitory neurons tend to respond to high-frequency signal through resonance. The E-I coupled neural ensemble shows selectivity for different input signal, which is gated by the gain between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. To be specific, neural network is inclined to gate-on signal with low-frequency when the excitation exceeds inhibition, whereas the high-frequency signal is selected. Moreover, neural signal can be transmitted from area to area only when the input frequency coincides with the inherent frequency of receivers in posterior areas, thus the independent conduction pathway is established through resonance. The transmission efficiency largely depends on the gain between excitatory and inhibitory input. Mean-field theory is further applied to validate the multiplexing in cortical networks and demonstrate the effective transmission of multiple information via SR in cortical networks .},

In this paper, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network , namely Fine-grained Conditional Adversarial Network (F-CGAN), which can produce class-dependent synthetic images with fine-grained details.

This problem has two difficulties: (1) How to design a model to learn the change of sentence? (2) How to balance the relationship between the local object and the whole image during learning process? Confronted with these difficulties, as far as we know, few existing methods deal with them effectively. Therefore, we propose a new cascaded model to solve this problem based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). We employ the adversarial game to build a cascaded model, which learns the changed information of a sentence. Then, we specially design a penalty balance term to balance the relationship between local object and entire image in the generated image.

First of all, the minimum learning parameter (MLP) neural networks (NN)-based are designed to enhance the robustness against model uncertainties. Subsequently, an adaptive law is employed to compensate neural networks approximation errors and disturbances. The recursive sliding mode control method combined with dynamic surface control (DSC) is designed to eliminate repeated derivative of virtual control laws and enhance systems robustness. A smooth hyperbolic tangent function is incorporated with the control scheme to reduce the risk of actuator saturation. At the same time, the Nussbaum function is used to compensate for the saturation function and ensure the stability of system. We show that under the proposed control method , despite the presence of system uncertainties and disturbances, the tracking errors can converge into arbitrarily small neighborhoods around zero, while the constraint requirements on the control force and torque will not be violated. By using the Lyapunov function , it is proven that the proposed control method can guarantee the uniform boundedness of all the closed loop signals.

  abstract     = {Large amounts of training data in machine learning can keep the accuracy high to a certain extent, but the time costs are high because of the exorbitant amount of data and their dimensionality. Therefore, how to simultaneously select the most useful training data set and extract the main features of the samples, especially for image data, are essential problems that urgently need to be solved in the field of large-scale machine learning . Herein, a training sample selection method that is based on the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm (FCM) is proposed for the problems. It first utilises condensed nearest neighbour (CNN) to make a preliminary selection of training samples. Then, it utilises the FCM to get the centres of the selected data, and, finally, it effectively condenses the sample using a compression parameter. Meanwhile, considering the critical influence of the sample features on the classification model , this paper selects the hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) model to better solve the classification task . Based on this, the paper presents the FCM-CNN-H-ELM framework for data classification , which combines FCM-Based CNN and H-ELM. The results of the experiments show that the proposed training sample selection method and classification framework can guarantee consistent, even higher, prediction results with a small number of training samples, and significantly reduce the training time.},

  abstract     = {In multi-label learning, extracting specific features for each label is a new strategy to construct discriminative classification models in recent years. Existing approaches usually consider that each label is only associated with a small subset of the original features. But in some applications this sparsity assumption does not hold, where non-sparse label specific features are more discriminative than sparse label specific features. In this paper, a novel feature selection-based approach is proposed to extract non-sparse label specific features. Firstly, we translate the logic labels to the numerical ones to convey more semantic information and embed the label correlations. Secondly, a linear regression is modeled to describe the discrimination of label specific features based on the numerical labels. To our best knowledge, it is one of the first attempts to utilize the numerical labels for extracting label specific features. Comprehensive experiments on several multi-label data sets clearly manifest that the superiority of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proven effective in learning policies of high-dimensional states and actions. Recently, a variety of robot manipulation tasks have been accomplished using end-to-end DRL strategies. An end-to-end DRL strategy accomplishes a robot manipulation task as a black box. On the other hand, a robot manipulation task can be divided into multiple subtasks and accomplished by non-learning-based approaches. A hybrid DRL strategy integrates DRL with non-learning-based approaches. The hybrid DRL strategy accomplishes some subtasks of a robot manipulation task by DRL and the rest subtasks by non-learning-based approaches. However, the effects of integrating DRL with non-learning-based approaches on the learning speed and the robustness of DRL to model uncertainties have not been discussed. In this study, an end-to-end DRL strategy and a hybrid DRL strategy are developed and compared in controlling a cable-driven parallel robot. This study shows that, by integrating DRL with non-learning-based approaches, the hybrid DRL strategy learns faster and is more robust to model uncertainties than the end-to-end DRL strategy. This study demonstrates that, by taking advantages of both learning and non-learning-based approaches, the hybrid DRL strategy provides an alternative to accomplish a robot manipulation task.},

In this paper, a multi-scene ancient Chinese text (MACT) dataset, formed by handwritten text, calligraphy, natural scene text in ancient fonts, is established that includes synthetic samples generated for training and real scene samples collected for testing. We first perform experiments on some CNN structures as the baseline method , and the top-1 recognition result, 66.94\%, is approximately 13.96\% higher than subjective human recognition results. Furthermore, based on these models and confidence score from the baseline, a multi-model ensemble (MME) method is proposed, which adopts auxiliary datasets and a feature extraction method to augment data before training, utilizes different hyper-parameters to optimize in training, and integrates multiple models to improve recognition accuracy. The top-1 accuracy results of the MME method reach 73.36\% and other top-n results also greatly surpass the baseline results. The MACT dataset is publicly available on the website 1 .},

  abstract     = {Recently, deep convolutional neural networks have been widely introduced into image salient object detection and achieve good performance in this community. However, as the complexity of video scenes, video salient object detection with deep learning models is still a challenge. The specific difficulties come from two aspects. First of all, the deep networks on image saliency detection cannot capture robust motion cues in video sequences. Secondly, as for the spatiotemporal fusing features, the existing methods simply exploit element-wise addition or concatenation, which not fully explores the contextual information and complementary correlation, thus they cannot produce more robust spatiotemporal features. To address these issues, we propose a two-stream based spatiotemporal attention neural network (STAN) for video salient object detection. We amply extract the motion information in terms of long short term memory (LSTM) network and 3D convolutional operation from optical flow-based prior and video sequences. Moreover, an attentive module is designed to integrate the different types of spatiotemporal feature maps by learning the corresponding weights. Meanwhile, in order to generate sufficient pixel-wise annotated video frames, we manually generate lots of coarse labels, which are well utilized to train a robust saliency prediction network. Experiments on the widely used challenging datasets (e.g., FBMS and DAVIS) prove that the proposed STAN has competitive performances among salient object detection methods.},

Then a novel online recovery mechanism, including the weighted fern classifier and the pattern-memorized template matcher, is applied to strengthen the ability to re-capture the target in case of tracking failure. The spatio-temporal weights used in the fern classifier can effectively suppress the significant position drift caused by the distortion of the target, whereas the pattern-memorized templates compressed by Gaussian mixture model (GMM) can reduce capacity usage and computational cost. Finally, we focus on the model corruption problem, the average peak-to-correlation energy (APCE) is exploited to identify the reliable parts of the tracking trajectory, and we update the model adaptively in term of the feedback from high-confidence tracking results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably in OTB2013 data set against several state-of-the-art methods.},

Probabilistic topic modeling is firstly utilized to summarize the semantics of texts and extract a set of topic features of interest. Then, a multi-objective sampling model is designed to generate a subset of original dataset, which will not only reduce the visual clutter of large-scale social media data visualization, but also retain the ordering of topic features of interest as well as the geographical distribution of original social media datasets. A rich set of visual designs such as word cloud, text stream and heat map are integrated into the visual abstraction framework, enabling users to evaluate the sampled results from different perspectives including semantic topics, temporal changes and spatial distribution.

Despite its great potential, existing LRMR-based saliency detection methods seldom consider the inter-relationship among elements within these two components, thus are prone to generating scattered or incomplete saliency maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient LRMR-based saliency detection model under a coarse-to-fine framework to circumvent this limitation. First, we roughly measure the saliency of image regions with a baseline LRMR model that integrates a ℓ 1 -norm sparsity constraint and a Laplacian regularization smooth term. Given samples from the coarse saliency map, we then learn a projection that maps image features to refined saliency values, to significantly sharpen the object boundaries and to preserve the object entirety. We evaluate our framework against existing LRMR-based methods on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results validate the superiority of our method as well as the effectiveness of our suggested coarse-to-fine framework, especially for images containing multiple objects.

The correlation coefficient matrix is first calculated and K-means clustering is adopted to divide the original variables into several blocks. Then the weighted SPA, which gives different weights to different samples in each window according to their distributions, is adopted to build statistic spaces containing both low-order and high-order statistics. After that, LKCPA is performed in each statistic space to realize feature extraction. To reduce the noise effect amplified by SPA, PCA is adopted in the residual space to remove noise. Bayesian strategy is used to fuse the results of each block and two monitoring statistics E T and E R are proposed to monitor the feature space and the residual space respectively.

  abstract     = {For most previous attention-based scene text recognition methods, images are transformed into high-level feature vectors that form a feature map with height equal to one. Such vectors may contain unnecessary noise that limits recognition performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the effective parts attention network (EPAN) which can attentively highlight the character region for more precise recognition. EPAN consists of a text image encoder and character effective parts decoder (CEPD), and it is end-to-end trainable. The former separates the high-dimensional feature map into one-dimensional vectors row-by-row, which are connected to a bidirectional long short term memory unit to encode contextual information. Subsequently, the CEPD transforms the vectors using a novel glimpse network at each time step to roughly determine the position of the characters. Then the CEPD uses a refinement network to generate a mask to gradually localize the precise position of important parts of the current character. Experiments were conducted on various benchmarks, including IIIT5K-Words, Street View Text, ICDAR 2003, ICDAR 2013, CUTE80, Street View Text Perspective, and ICDAR 2015, which demonstrated that the proposed EPAN method significantly outperformed or was comparable to existing methods in terms of lexicon-free word accuracy. Additionally, substantial qualitative results further demonstrated the robustness of our method.},

However, there are still some thorny issues unsolved, especially the problem of efficiency degradation when dealing with high-dimensional data and the inability to maintain robustness when dealing with contaminated data, which have not been addressed simultaneously in the existing models. In our work, we propose a novel hybrid unsupervised AD method, which first integrates convolutional auto-encoder and Gaussian process regression to extract features and to remove anomalies from noisy data as well.

Though numerous efforts have been tried in this research area, the overlapping and touching nuclei segmentation remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel and effective instance segmentation method for tackling this challenge by integrating Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Marker-controlled Watershed. Firstly, we design a novel network architecture with multiple segmentation tasks , called Deep Interval-Marker-Aware Network, for learning the foreground, marker, and interval of nuclei, simultaneously. Then the learned interval between overlapping nuclei is used to refine the foreground result of nuclei by using the logical operators. Finally, the learned marker result and the nuclei segmentation result refined by interval are transmitted into the Marker-controlled Watershed for splitting the touching nuclei. The experiments on the standard public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a substantial improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Most previous studies discussed single image deblurring and video deblurring but neglected detailed analyses of the spatiotemporal continuity between adjacent frames, which limits the deblurring effect. We propose a novel end-to-end blind video motion deblurring network that takes triple adjacent frames as input to deblur a blurry video frame. In our approach, a bidirectional temporal feature transfer between triple adjacent frames is implemented to pass the latent features of the central frame on to a group encoder of its neighbors. Then, a hybrid decoder decodes group features and estimates a sharper video frame relative to the central frame. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous excellent methods in terms of traditional metrics (PSNR and SSIM) and visual quality within an acceptable time cost.

  abstract     = {This research proposes a 1-norm regularized linear programming nonparallel hyperplane support vector machine (LNSVM) model to solve binary classification problems and enhance the robustness performance. Numerous nonparallel support vector machine (SVM) models have been studied with outstanding performance on classification tasks . However, most nonparallel SVM models require two independent models to determine hyperplanes. In addition, due to the involvement of the 2-norm terms, traditional SVM models may suffer from the lack of robustness to outliers and irrelevant features. Therefore, the LNSVM model is proposed by reformulating a typical nonparallel SVM model through the 1-norm regularization . By applying the exterior penalty theory, the proposed LNSVM model is converted to the dual exterior penalty problem, which is solved by the Newton–Armijo algorithm. The essential differences that distinguish the LNSVM model from other nonparallel SVM models are: (1) Different from typical nonparallel SVM models, which solve two quadratic programming (QP) problems, the proposed LNSVM model determines two nonparallel hyperplanes simultaneously by solving a single linear programming (LP) model; (2) The robustness performance of the proposed LNSVM model has been enhanced to tolerate noisy data through the involvement of 1-norm loss function, which can also eliminate redundant features by generating sparse solution during the training procedure. The performance of the proposed LNSVM model is tested through a comparison with state-of-art SVM-based classifiers using a synthetic dataset and 11 practical benchmark datasets. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed LNSVM model, by achieving better classification performance regarding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and removing redundant features synchronously.},

  abstract     = {Sparsity is widely utilized for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reduce k -space sampling. In many clinical MRI scenarios, existing similarity within a series of MRI images and between different contrasts in the same scan can be used to substantially shorten the acquisition time. In this study, the prior information on the pre-acquired reference image is employed in the framework of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for accurate longitudinal compressed sensing (CS) MRI (LCS-MRI) reconstruction. We propose an efficient algorithm based on the ADMM framework, by using similarity prior information for LCS-MRI. The algorithm minimizes the linear combination of three terms including a least squares data fitting and two ℓ 1 norm regularization terms. The first ℓ 1 norm regularization is utilized for measuring the sparsity of the recovered signal, and the other ℓ 1 norm regularization is employed for measuring the sparsity of the difference between the recovered MR image and the prior known MR scan. The proposed method formulates the reconstruction problem to several unconstrained minimization sub-problems, which can be solved by shrinking operators and alternating minimization algorithms. We compare the proposed algorithm with previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computation complexity. Numerous experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and robust and obtained superior performance in reconstructing longitudinal compressed MR image than the other methods.},

Most of deep learning methods learn a non-linear mapping of input-to-target space by one-step upsampling. These methods are difficult to reconstruct a high-resolution face image from single very low-resolution face image. In this paper, we propose an asymptotic Residual Back-Projection Network (RBPNet) to gradually learn residual between the reconstructed face image and the ground truth by multi-step residual learning. Firstly, the reconstructed high-resolution feature map is projected to the original low-resolution feature space to generate low-resolution feature map (the projected low-resolution feature map). Secondly, the projected low-resolution feature map is subtracted by original feature map to generate low-resolution residual feature map. And finally, the low-resolution residual feature map is mapped to high-resolution feature space. The network will get a more accurate high-resolution image by iterative residual learning. Meanwhile, we explicitly reconstruct the edge map of face image and embed it into the reconstruction of high-resolution face image to reduce distortion of super-resolution results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed RBPNet qualitatively and quantitatively.},

  abstract     = {Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VMs) provide a powerful framework for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) tasks which leverage widely available unlabeled data to improve performance. However, there exist three issues in S3VMs: (i) S3VMs require concurrently training c one-against-all (OAA) classifiers ( c is the number of classes) for multiclass classification , which is prohibitive for large c ; (ii) S3VMs require huge computational time and large storage (because of the large kernel matrix) in large-scale training and testing; (iii) S3VMs require the balance constraint in the unlabeled data , which not only needs prior knowledge from the unlabeled data (the prior knowledge is unavailable in some applications), but also makes their nonconvex optimization problem more intractable. To address these issues, a novel method called Extreme Semi-Supervised Learning (ESSL) is proposed in this paper. First, the framework of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is adopted to handle both binary and multiclass classification problems in a unified model. Second, the hidden layer is encoded by an extremely small approximate empirical kernel map (AEKM) to greatly reduce the computational cost and the memory usage for training and testing. Third, the balance constraint (prior knowledge) in the unlabeled data is removed through the elaborative design of weighting function (which emphasizes the importance of labeled data and the minority pattern in the labeled data).By these three ways, ESSL can be solved effectively and efficiently based on alternating optimization (AO). More specifically, ESSL can be analytically and simply solved by generalized pseudoinverse and oneHotMap function (without any optimization solver and the OAA strategy) in the AO procedure, and consequently, better performance and much faster training speed are always achieved in ESSL. Our empirical study shows that ESSL significantly outperforms existing efficient SSL methods (e.g., meanS3VM and SS-ELM) in terms of accuracy, efficiency and memory, especially for large-scale multiclass problems . As an example, on the 20Newsgroups dataset, ESSL respectively runs 45 and 120 times faster than meanS3VM for training and testing with the improvement in accuracy of 3\%, while the memory usage is reduced to 1/14. It is noteworthy that even though all the model parameters are with default values, ESSL already produces very excellent performance without fine-tuning parameters.},

Previous dominant methods to solve this problem are RNN-based models. Recently, attention mechanisms that allow higher parallelization have shown significant improvement on this issue. However, none of the existing attention-based methods explicitly takes advantage of both the position information and context information in a sequence. We assume that one item usually exhibits different levels of importance when it appears in different positions in a sequence. Therefore, a position-aware context attention (PACA) model is proposed as a remedy, which improves the recommendation performance by taking into account both the position information and the context information of items. PACA introduces positional vectors to model the position information and utilizes a pooling function to generate the context feature vectors. Then the two vectors are combined to generate the attention weight for each item in a session. To further improve the performance, we use a multi-head method to combine several parallel attention modules. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed attention model is able to achieve very promising performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we visualize the positional vectors to explicitly analyze the importance of each position in a sequence.},

Nevertheless, the traditional domain adaptation approaches may suffer two shortcomings: (1) Poor performance is obtained for many traditional domain adaptation approaches when the sample is insufficient. (2) The diagnosis results are not stable, that is to say, the traditional domain adaptation approaches may have poor robustness. In order to overcome these deficiencies, we propose a novel domain adaptation model named DAGSZ based on geodesic flow kernel (GFK), strengthened feature extraction and Z-score normalization. Firstly, time domain average and square for the power spectral density (PSD) matrix is applied for preprocessing the original vibration data to learn more representative features. Then, the geodesic flow kernel (GFK), an unsupervised domain adaptation method, is adopted for learning the transferable features. Finally, Z-score normalization is employed to normalize the learned transferable features and softmax regression is utilized to classify the health conditions. The real-world dataset of gears and bearings are employed to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The result shows that DAGSZ obtains fairly high detection accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for mechanical fault detection.},

  abstract     = {Continuous affect recognition has a huge potential in human computer interaction applications. How to efficiently fuse speech and facial information for inferring the affective state of a person from data captured in real-world conditions is a very important issue for continuous affect recognition. Currently, late fusion is usually used in multi-modal continuous affect recognition to improve system performance. However, late fusion ignores the complementarity and redundancy between multiple streams from the different modalities. In this work, we propose an efficient model-level fusion approach for audiovisual continuous affect recognition. First, we propose a LSTM based model-level fusion approach for audiovisual continuous affect recognition. Our approach considers the complementarity and redundancy between multiple streams from different modalities. In addition, our model can efficiently incorporate side information such as gender using adaptive weight network. At last, we design a deep supervision based effective optimization strategy for training the proposed audiovisual continuous affect recognition model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the RECOLA dataset. Our experimental results show that the proposed adaptive weight network improves the performance compared to a plain neural network without adaptive weights. Our approach obtains remarkable improvements on both arousal and valence in terms of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) compared to state-of-the-art early fusion and model-level fusion approaches. Therefore, we believe that our proposed approach gives a promising direction for further improving the performance of audiovisual continuous affect recognition.},

  abstract     = {Although there has been a growing body of work for face recognition, it is still a challenging task for faces under occlusion with limited training samples. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address the problem of few-shot occluded face recognition. In particular, inspired by the human being’s optic nerves characteristics that humans recognize the face under occlusion using contextual information rather than paying attention to the facial parts, we propose an effective feature extraction approach to capture the local and contextual information for face recognition. To enhance the robustness, we further introduce an adaptive fusion method to incorporate multiple features, including the proposed structural element feature, connected-granule labeling feature, and Reinforced Centrosymmetric Local Binary Pattern (RCSLBP). Final recognition is derived from the fusion of all classification results according to our proposed novel fusion method. Experimental results on three popular face image datasets of AR, Extended Yale B, and LFW demonstrate that our method performs better than many existing ones for few-shot face recognition in the presence of occlusion.},

Different from PTSVM, our ν -PTSVM enjoys the following characteristics: (i) ν -PTSVM is equipped by a more theoretically sound parameter ν , which can be used to control the bounds of fraction of both support vectors and margin-error instances. (ii) By reformulating the least-square loss of within-class instances in primal problems of ν -PTSVM, its dual problems no longer involve the time-costly matrix inversion. (iii) ν -PTSVM behaves consistent between its linear and nonlinear cases. Namely, the kernel trick can be applied directly to ν -PTSVM for its nonlinear extension.

The variance of the blade defects and the lack of the blade defect images make the defect identification of the wind turbine blades challenging. This paper proposes a defect identification method of wind turbine blades based on defect semantic features with transfer feature extractor. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is built and is trained on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge dataset. The deep hierarchical features of the training blade images are extracted by the trained DCNN and fed into a classifier. By training on the labeled blade images, the first n layers of the trained DCNN is selected as the transfer feature extractor to extract the defect semantic features and the defect classifier is also obtained. The blade images can be diagnosed by the defect classifier based on the defect semantic features. The experiments are conducted on a real dataset of wind turbine blade images. The experimental results demonstrate the high learning ability of the proposed method from the small samples and its effectiveness for the defect identification of wind turbine blades.},

Despite promising results from recent deep learning based methods, existing works are still not sufficient to incorporate momentous global context to detect salient objects. In this work, we present a dual pyramid network (DPNet) for salient object detection by formulating self-attention mechanism into the sub-regions based contexts. Our key idea is to aggregate different sub-regions based contexts into the enhanced global context without sacrificing the resolution of deep features. To achieve this, we design the spatial pyramid module and channel-wise pyramid module. The proposed modules can enhance the global context by incorporating self-attention mechanism into the sub-regions based contexts in the spatial and channel-wise dimension, respectively. Compared with 23 state-of-the-art methods on six RGB saliency benchmark datasets, experimental results show that our method performs favorably over all the others, both quantitatively and visually. The superior performance of proposed DPNet than others on three RGB-D saliency benchmark datasets further demonstrates the powerful generalization ability of our network.},

In this work, we propose a scalable and reconfigurable architecture that exploits the ReRAM-based neurons for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). In prior publications, neurons were implemented using dedicated analog or digital circuits that are not area and energy efficient. In our work, for the first time, we address the scaling and power bottlenecks of neuromorphic architecture by utilizing a single one-transistor-one-ReRAM (1T1R) cell to emulate the neuron. We show that the ReRAM-based neurons can be integrated within the synaptic crossbar to build extremely dense Process Element (PE)–spiking neural network in memory array–with high throughput . We provide microarchitecture and circuit designs to enable the deep spiking neural network computing in memory with an insignificant area overhead. Simulation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with spiking Resnet (SResnet) and spiking Squeezenet (SSqueez) show that compared to the baseline CPU only solution, our proposed architecture achieves energy saving between 1222 ×  and 1853 ×  and speed improvement between 791 ×  to 1120 ×.},

Based on the adaptive backstepping technique and Lyapunov function method, an adaptive NN output feedback control scheme is developed. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed controller can provide that, under arbitrary deterministic switching, all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded in probability and the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin.

  abstract     = {An electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes embedded in the transport protein , which is an important process to transfer electrons and other macromolecules throughout the cell. It is the primary process to extract energy via redox reactions in the case of oxidation of sugars in cellular respiration . According to the molecular functions , the components of the electron transport chain could be formed with five complexes and with several different electron carriers. The functional loss of a specific molecular function in electron transport chain has been implicated in a variety of human diseases such as diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders , Parkinson, and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Therefore, creating a precise model to identify its functions is pertinent to the understanding of human diseases and designing of drug targets. Previous bioinformatics studies have almost exclusively focused on the electron transport proteins without information on the five complexes. Here we present DeepETC, a deep learning model that uses a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and position-specific scoring matrices profiles to classify electron transport proteins into the five complexes. DeepETC can classify the electron transporters with the independent test accuracy of 99.6\%, 99.7\%, 99.7\%, 99.1\% and 99.8\% for complex I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively. Our performance results are significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art traditional neural networks in all typical measurement metrics. Throughout the proposed study, we provide an effective tool for investigating electron transport proteins and our achievement could promote the use of deep learning in bioinformatics and computational biology.

Unlike traditional Photometric Stereo, MPS can therefore be used in dynamic scenes for single frame reconstruction. However, MPS is challenging due to the tangle of the illumination, surface reflectance and camera response, causing inaccurate estimation of surface normal. Existing approaches rely on either extra depth information or materials calibration strategies, thus limiting its usage in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a Multispectral Photometric Stereo Network (MPS-Net) to solve this under-determined system. The MPS-Net takes the single multispectral image and an initial surface normal estimation obtained from this image itself, and outputs an accurate surface normal map, where no extra depth or materials calibration information is required. We show that the MPS-Net is not constrained to Lambertian surfaces and can be applied to surfaces with complex reflectance. We evaluated the MPS-Net using both synthetic and real objects of various materials. Our experiment results show that the MPS-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Most of existing methods utilize deep learning methods with RNN/CNN to capture contextual information. These models typically treat each word in a sentence equally, which ignores the fact that keywords always play a leading role in expressing the sentence semantic. Especially, on the tasks of sentence classification and semantic relatedness prediction, we can judge through the information of several keywords, no need for the whole sentence. To this end, we propose a window-based intra-weighing approach to weigh words in the sentence. In calculating attentive weights, we take as input multi-window n-grams and use max-pooling for feature extraction. To evaluate our model, we conduct experiments on 6 benchmark data sets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in calculating word importance.

  abstract     = {There are several breast cancer datasets for building Computer Aided Diagnosis systems (CADs) using either deep learning or traditional models. However, most of these datasets impose various trade-offs on practitioners related to their availability or inner clinical value. Recently, a public dataset called BreakHis has been released to overcome these limitations. BreakHis is organized into four magnification levels, each image is labeled according to its main category (Benign/Malignant) and its subcategory (A/F/PT/TA/PC/DC/LC/MC). This organization allows practitioners to address this problem either as a binary or a multi-category classification task with either a magnification dependent or independent training approach. In this work, we define a taxonomy that categorize this problem into four different reformulations: Magnification-Specific Binary (MSB), Magnification-Independent Binary (MIB), Magnification-Specific Multi-category (MSM) and Magnification-Independent Multi-category (MIM) classifications. We provide a comprehensive survey of all related works. We identify the best reformulation from clinical and practical standpoints. Finally, we explore for the first time the MIM approach using deep learning and draw the learnt lessons.},

The focus of a significant number of reported approaches is primarily on either increasing the depth or the width of the networks to achieve improvements in performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical convolutional neural network (HCNN) for effective image super-resolution by learning features from different levels. More specifically, the proposed framework implements a 3-step hierarchical process, which consists of an edge extraction branch, an edge reinforcement branch, and an image reconstruction branch. Informative edges in an image are extracted and enhanced in the edge extraction and reinforcement branch, which are used as a guidance in the image reconstruction branch. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can restore high-frequency edges information and achieve superior performances over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, through a case study in facial expression recognition, we show that the enhanced images are beneficial in improving the recognition performance, paving the way for more practical applications.},

Firstly, we propose to jointly minimize pixel-wise cross entropy loss and our semantic-aware mean square error loss for the optimization of generative restoration network, which ensures correct semantic predictions at each pixel location . Secondly, we introduce GAN into our framework, which can benefit high-order consistency of semantic predictions.

In this paper, a novel patch selection method based on parsing and saliency detection is proposed. The algorithm is divided into two stages. The first stage, primary selection: Deep Decompositional Network (DNN) is adopted to parse a pedestrian image into semantic regions, then sliding window and color matching techniques are proposed to select pedestrian patches and remove background patches. The second stage, secondary selection: saliency detection is utilized to select reliable patches according to saliency map. Finally, PHOG, HSV and SIFT features are extracted from these patches and fused with the global feature LOMO to compensate for the inherent errors of saliency detection. By applying the proposed method on such datasets as VIPeR, PRID2011, CUHK01, CUHK03, PRID 450S and iLIDS-VID, it is found that the proposed descriptor can produce results superior to many state-of-the-art feature representation methods for person identification.},

  abstract     = {Rating-based methods (e.g., collaborative filtering) in recommendation can explicitly model users and items from their rating patterns, nevertheless suffer from the natural data sparsity problem. In other hand, user-generated reviews can provide rich semantic information of user preference and item features, and can alleviate the sparsity problems of rating data. In fact, ratings and reviews are complementary and can be viewed as two different sides of users and items, hence fusing rating patterns and text reviews effectively has the potential to learn more accurate representations of users and items for recommendation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural recommendation model to learn the deep representations for users and items from both ratings and reviews. Our model contains three major components, i.e., a rating-based encoder to learn deep and explicit features from rating patterns of users and items, a review-based encoder to model users and items from text reviews, and the prediction module for recommendation according to the rating- and review-based representations of users and items. In addition, considering that different reviews have different informativeness for modelling users and items, we introduce a novel review-level attention mechanism incorporating with rating-based representation as query vector to select useful reviews. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our model can outperform the existing competitive baseline methods in recommendations.},

One-hot encoding is an outstanding method for transforming discrete data into a binary vector. Nonetheless, if there are many distinct values, the problem of dimensionality will be incurred. To tackle this issue, we propose a new approach, called the Pixelization method, which transforms event data into images. We experimentally performed causal inference for prediction of pixels (representing the processing time of each event) by using a generative model with our novel convolution technique. We compared our approach with a baseline method , one-hot encoding, and an entity-embedded approach combined with a neural network model.

In cellular level, a quadratic function is used to replace the inner product in a traditional neuron, and then undergoes a nonlinear activation. With a single quadratic neuron, any fuzzy logic operation, such as XOR, can be implemented. In this sense, any deep network constructed with quadratic neurons can be interpreted as a deep fuzzy logic system. Since traditional neural networks and quadratic counterparts can represent each other and fuzzy logic operations are naturally implemented in quadratic neural networks, it is plausible to explain how a deep neural network works with a quadratic network as the system model. In this paper, we generalize and categorize fuzzy logic operations implementable with individual quadratic neurons, and then perform statistical/information-theoretic analyses of exemplary quadratic neural networks.},

  abstract     = {Accurate cerebrovascular segmentation in Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) image, as an indispensable step, can help doctors appropriately estimate the degree of cerebrovascular lesions to avoid misdiagnosis. Because of the complexity of cerebrovascular structure and the uneven distribution of contrast media in DSA, automatic segmentation is a challenging task in clinical diagnosis. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed the state-of-art methods and shown great potential for medical image segmentation. This paper proposes a CNN-based segmentation framework Multiscale Dense CNN (MDCNN) to automatically segment cerebral vessel in DSA images. Inspired by U-net, this proposed MDCNN structure is designed as encoder-decoder architecture. Considering that the diameters of blood vessel in cerebrovascular are various, we define a multiscale module to segment cerebral vessel with different diameters. Meanwhile, we redesign the skip connections between encoder and decoder stage to utilize more features from encoder stage. To improve the capability of extracting high-level features, improved dense blocks are introduced. In terms of simplifying parameters, we refer to the idea of deep supervision to make pruning possible. The proposed framework is tested on DCVessel (a DSA cerebrovascular dataset made by our lab). Our proposed method reaches 0.8813, 0.9784, 0.8775, 0.9886, 0.9944 in F1 score, accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe) and AUC respectively, outperforming the state-of-art methods. Meanwhile, we evaluate our MDCNN framework on benchmark retinal vessel dataset DRIVE.

  abstract     = {Human perception of a signal depends on the ratio of the change of stimulus to the stimulus itself while the change of stimulus to the stimulus itself is usually ignored in hand-crafted feature descriptors . However, it is important for extracting discriminant feature. To address this problem, we firstly develop a local multiple patterns (LMP) feature descriptor based on the Weber&#39;s law for feature extraction and face recognition. In LMP, (1) the Weber&#39;s ratio is modified to contain the change direction, and thus the modified Weber&#39;s ratio is quantized into several intervals to generate multiple feature maps for describing different changes; (2) LMP concatenates the histograms of the non-overlapping regions of the feature maps for image representation. Secondly, since LMP could only capture small-scale structures, a multi-scale block LMP (MB-LMP) is presented to generate more discriminative and robust visual feature. Thus, MB-LMP could capture both the small-scale and large-scale structures. In implementation, MB-LMP is computationally efficient using integral image. In experiments, LMP and MB-LMP are evaluated on four public datasets for face recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the promise of the proposed LMP and MB-LMP descriptors with desirable efficiency.},

  abstract     = {As a new task of image understanding, the dense caption model needs to locate and describe a salient region in the image simultaneously. It inevitably divides the dense caption model into two parts, one part for detecting the regions of interest and the other part for generating regional language caption. Previous methods are relatively simple to deal with these two parts, using the feature map on the last convolution layer of RPN network to predict object coordinates, and using LSTM for regional language modeling . However, the structure of RPN is insufficient to deal with a large number of objects in the complex dataset, and LSTM also fails to effectively utilize the global information of images in regional language training, which brings opportunity to improve the performance of dense caption. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-scale Fusion with Global Attribute model (CSGA) that enables the two parts of the dense caption model to perform normal end-to-end training without mutual interference. Furthermore, our model uses a one-stage object detector with feature map fusion operation across multiple detection scales to improve the quality of object detection part, and combines image features with the global high-level attribute to improve regional language training. We design a variety of model architectures and conducted sufficient experiments. Empirical results on Visual Genome dataset show that our model achieves competitive results with mAP 8.33.},

It is a key issue in the alignment to accurately measure the multi-modal data distances. Although metric learning has been employed in many image ZSL approaches, few of them make full use of the data information. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep metric learning framework called Dual-Triplet Network (DTNet) for image ZSL. The DTNet first projects the semantic information into the visual space with a mapping network and then employs two triplet networks for learning the visual-semantic mapping. Specifically, one triplet network focuses on negative attribute features, and the other pays special attention to negative visual features, which guarantees the sufficient discovery and utilization of data information. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DTNet achieves the state-of-the-art results on both traditional and generalized image ZSL tasks. Especially, on the H measurement of generalized image ZSL, DTNet has improvements of 18\% on AwA, 1.9\% on CUB, and 12.9\% on aPY, respectively.},

Although the depth modality can provide extra geometric information , how to better learn the multi-modal features is still an open problem. Considering this, in this paper we propose the modality separation networks to extract the modal-consistent and modal-specific features simultaneously. The motivations of this work are from two aspects: 1) The first one is to learn what is unique to each modality and what is common between the two modalities explicitly; 2) The second one is to explore the relationship between global/local features and modal-specific/consistent features. To this end, the proposed framework contains two branches of submodules to learn the multi-modal features. One branch is used to extract the individual characteristics of each modality by minimizing the similarity between two modalities. Another branch is to learn the common information between two modalities by maximizing the correlation term. Moreover, with the spatial attention module, our method can visualize the spatial positions where different submodules focus on. We evaluate our method on two public RGB-D scene recognition datasets, and new state-of-the-art results are achieved with the proposed framework.},

Besides, to avoid the traditional separation method, the sign function of complex numbers is proposed and some properties about it are derived. Under the proposed sign function framework, by designing some novel and effective control schemes, constructing nontrivial Lyapunov functions and developing some new inequality methods in complex domain, several criteria of finite-time synchronization are derived and the settling-time of synchronization is effectively estimated.

  abstract     = {Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is one of the most essential tasks in LBSNs to help users discover new interesting locations, especially when users travel out of town or to unfamiliar areas. Current studies on POI recommendation in LBSNs mainly focus on modeling multiple factors extracted from users’ profiles and checking-in records. Data sparsity and incompleteness of user-POI interaction matrix are very common problems in POI recommendation, especially for the out-of-town scenario. Another challenge is that most information in the LBSNs is unreliable due to users’ different backgrounds or preferences. Because of the close relationship between users, information from trustable friends on Communication-Based Social Networks (CBSNs) is more valuable than that in LBSNs, which can give a preferable suggestion instead of trustless reviews in LBSNs. In this study, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called HI-LDA (Heterogeneous Information based LDA), which can accurately capture users’ words on CBSNs by taking into full consideration the information on LBSNs including geographical effect as well as the abundant information including social relationship, users’ interactive behaviors and comment content. In particular, the parameters of the HI-LDA model can be inferred by the Gibbs sampling method in an effective fashion. Beyond these proposed techniques, we introduce an POI recommendation framework integrating geographical clustering approach considering the locations and popularity of POIs simultaneously. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on two real heterogeneous LBSN-CBSN networks. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HI-LDA on effective and efficient POI recommendation in both home-town and out-of-town scenarios, when compared with the state-of-the-art baseline approaches.},

To overcome the separability problem caused by the fusion of heterogeneous samples, we adopt an unconventional unit hyperspherical crown mapping model in the sample space. Theoretical analysis indicates that nonlinear mapping can improve the separability of the original sample set under certain conditions. In addition, to optimize the pattern layer structure of probabilistic neural networks , we adopt an adaptive kernel coverage method for the training sample space to generate initial pattern nodes. The accumulation potential of the sample in each training subclass is used to measure the distribution density of different classes, and an adaptive update mechanism of potential values is established. In each iteration, nodes with high accumulation potential values are searched as pattern nodes from the dense to sparse regions . The precise position of each pattern node and the corresponding kernel width are adjusted by the Expected Maximum algorithm. Experiments show that HCPNN outperforms other algorithms with respect to the classification performance.},

  abstract     = {As an important component of music information retrieval , music genre classification attracts great attentions these years. Benefitting from the outstanding performance of deep neural networks in computer vision, some researchers apply CNN on music genre classification tasks with audio spectrograms as input instead, which has similarities with RGB images . These methods are based on a latent assumption that spectrums with different temporal steps have equal importance. However, it goes against the theory of processing bottleneck in psychology as well as our observation from audio spectrograms. By considering the differences of spectrums, we propose a new model incorporating with attention mechanism based on Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network . Furthermore, two attention-based models (serial attention and parallelized attention) are implemented in this paper. Comparing with serial attention, parallelized attention is more flexible and gets better results in our experiments. Especially, the CNN-based parallelized attention models with taking STFT spectrograms as input outperform the previous work.},

  abstract     = {Greedy algorithm (GA) is an efficient sparse representation framework with numerous applications in machine learning and computer vision. However, conventional GA methods may fail when applied to grossly corrupted data because they iteratively estimate the sparse signal using least squares regression , which is sensitive to gross corruption and outliers. In this paper, we propose a modal regression based greedy algorithm referred as MROMP (modal regression based orthogonal matching pursuit) to robustly learn the sparse signal from corrupted measurements. Unlike previous GA methods, MROMP is based on sparse modal regression, which has decent robustness to heavy-tailed noise and outliers. To efficiently optimize MROMP, we devise two half-quadratic based algorithms with guaranteed convergence. Our another two contributions are leveraging MROMP to develop a robust subspace clustering method to cluster data lying in a union of subspaces, and a robust pattern classification method to recognize data into the class that they belong to, respectively. The experimental results on both simulated and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of MROMP for sparse signal recovery, data clustering and classification, especially for grossly corrupted data.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, many knowledge bases have been constructed or populated. These knowledge bases link real-world entities by their relationships on a large scale, serving as good resources to answer factoid questions. To answer a natural language question using a knowledge base, the main task is mapping it to a structured query of the same meaning, whose results from the knowledge base will be used as the question’s answers. This mapping task is non-trivial since different questions can express a same meaning and many queries can arise from a knowledge base. To fulfill the task, an important thing is to model a query’s structure as it conveys a part of the meaning and affects word orders in the question. However, state-of-the-art methods based on deep learning have neglected query structures and focused only on capturing semantic correlations between a question and a simple relation chain. In this paper, we instead take a query as a tree, and encode the orders of entities and relations into its representations to better distinguish candidate queries of a given question. Overall, we first construct candidate queries of a given question from its linked entities, types and number operations. Then, we adopt an encoder-decoder framework which encodes a candidate query and decodes it into the given question, where the decoding probability is used to select the best query from candidates. During encoding, we propose a tree-based LSTM to properly model contexts of an entity or relation in a query, and one such tree-based LSTM runs from all leafs to the root while another runs reversely. During decoding, we propose to mix a generating mode and a referring mode to capture different levels of correlations between queries and questions. Experiments on two popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both the tree-based encoder and the mixed-mode decoder.},

More and more methods design more complex networks to integrate the features of each stage from backbone extractor. Considering that global information and spatial details of an image are better captured by features of deep layers and shallow layers of CNN respectively, deep layer guided network in which global information from deep layers is progressively transmitted to shallow layers in a guided manner is proposed. Hybrid feature enhancement block receives the feature maps of adjacent stages, and outputs enhanced feature maps which reduce the loss of spatial details and reduce the impact of varying in shape, scale and position of object. Discriminative feature block highlights the consistency in different stages from channel and spatial dimensions. Optimized discriminative features focus more on channels which show higher response to salient objects and positions consistent with the foreground in the saliency map from higher stage. Saliency inference block optimizes feature by merging with adjacent layer feature further. Thus feature becomes more enhanced, discriminative and refined in a high-to-low manner. Experimental results on five public datasets show that our salient object detection method reaches state-of-the-art performance under evaluation metrics .},

The sign in the 3D video can be characterized in the form of 3D joint location information in 3D space over time. Therefore, the objective of this study is to construct a color coded topographical descriptor from joint distances and angles computed from joint locations. We call these two color coded images the joint distance topographic descriptor (JDTD) and joint angle topographical descriptor (JATD) respectively. For the classification we propose a two stream convolutional neural network (2CNN) architecture, which takes as input the color-coded images JDTD and JATD. The two independent streams were merged and concatenated together with features from both streams in the dense layer. For a given query 3D sign (or action), a list of class scores was obtained as a text label corresponding to the sign. The results showed improvement in classifier performance over the predecessors due to the mixing of distance and angular features for predicting closely related spatio temporal discriminative features . To benchmark the performance of our proposed model, we compared our results with the state-of-the-art baseline action recognition frameworks by using our own 3D sign language dataset and two publicly available 3D mocap action datasets, namely, HDM05 and CMU.},

  abstract     = {Building 3D maps of surroundings is a fundamental and important task for autonomous robots operating in large previously unknown semi-structured or unstructured outdoor environments, where external methods for localization like GPS are not always available. Most of existing 3D mapping approaches are based on the local scan matching algorithm , which are difficult to achieve accurate mapping with good efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective graph-based SLAM approach for 3D mapping of outdoor environments without odometry measurement. It first utilizes scan matching algorithm to sequentially estimate initial robot poses and progressively construct a pose graph, where each vertex denotes the robot pose at a point in time and each edge indicates the constraint between two robot poses. As scan matching algorithm cannot be error-free, the estimation of robot poses suffers from the error accumulation problem. To address this issue, the hypothesis of loop closure can be generated by an adaptive search circle and then verified by the global scan matching algorithm. Once the loop closure is verified, more edges should be added into the pose graph, which is subsequently optimized by the weighted motion averaging algorithm so as to obtain accurate robot poses for 3D mapping. Experimental results carried out on multiple outdoor environment data sets show that the proposed approach can build 3D maps with good performance.},

The proposed RDenseNet still utilizes the dense block in Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) as a basic structure, but different from the cascade structure of DenseNet, our proposed RDenseNet uses the output of the dense block as input for the current block again. That is, our proposed RDenseNet turns the cascade structure in DenseNet into a recursive structure , which can reduce the number of parameters that actually need to be stored.

In this paper, we propose a novel concept of Aggregation of Ensembles (AOE) for detecting an anomaly in video data showing crowded scenes, which leverage the existing capability of pre-trained ConvNets and a pool of classifiers. The proposed approach uses an ensemble of different fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on the hypothesis that different CNN architectures learn different levels of semantic representation from crowd videos and thus an ensemble of CNNs will enable enriched feature sets to be extracted. The proposed AOE concept utilizes the fine-tuned ConvNets as fixed feature extractors to train variants of SVM classifier and then the posterior probabilities are fused to predict the anomaly in the crowd frame sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed Aggregation of Ensembles fine-tuned CNNs of various architectures achieve a higher accuracy in comparison with other established methods on benchmark datasets.},

Recently, the deep neural network has become a powerful learning machine, making it possible to work with text itself as raw input for the classification problems. However, existing neural networks are typically end-to-end and lack explicit interpretation of the prediction. In this paper, we propose Jumper , a novel framework that models text classification as a sequential decision process. Generally, Jumper is a neural system that scans a piece of text sequentially and makes classification decisions at the time it wishes, which is inspired by the cognitive process of human text reading. In our framework, both the classification result and when to make the classification are part of the decision process, controlled by a policy network and trained with reinforcement learning . Experimental results of real-world applications demonstrate the following properties of a properly trained Jumper : (1) it tends to make decisions whenever the evidence is enough, therefore reducing total text reading by 30–40\% and often finding the key rationale of the prediction; and (2) it achieves classification accuracy better than or comparable to state-of-the-art models in several benchmark and industrial datasets. We further conduct a simulation experiment with mock data, which confirms that Jumper is able to make a decision at the theoretically optimal decision position.},

  abstract     = {Single-stage detectors depend on a simple regression network to predict category scores and regress box offsets for a fixed set of default boxes directly. The regression network needs to have high generalization capability, so as to accurately model the relationship between various object shapes and default boxes. Instead of complicating the regression network to increase generalization capability, we iteratively refine the default boxes to model this relationship sequentially. In this paper, we propose an Attention-Enhanced Progressive Learning Network (APLNet), which employs multiple stages for progressive detection to improve performance of single-stage detectors. Specifically, a progressive learning module is proposed to iteratively update the feature representation space and gradually regress the default boxes, which are pushed closer to the target objects progressively. In addition, since low-level features have less semantic information about objects, we design an attention enhancement module to generate the attention map applied to inject more semantically meaningful information into the low-level features. This module is supervised by boxes-induced segmentation annotations, i.e., no extra segmentation annotations are required. The multi-task loss function is used to train the whole network in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APLNet.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to detect salient objects in an image. However, how to better use convolutional features for co-saliency detection, which is an emerging branch of saliency detection , is not fully explored. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network based co-saliency detection model, which consists of two key parts including the integration of multi-layer convolutional features extracted from a group of images and the inter-image saliency propagation. Firstly, the input image and its four co-images belonging to the same image category are passed through the VGG16 model, to obtain the multi-layer convolutional features of these images. Secondly, multi-scale synthesized feature maps, which contain both internal features and correlative features, are generated by integrating the multi-layer convolutional features. Thirdly, via the integration of low-level boundary features and high-level semantic features , the multi-scale synthesized feature maps are enhanced and fused together to generate the initial co-saliency map. Finally, an inter-image saliency propagation method is utilized to refine the initial co-saliency map, yielding the final co-saliency map with the improved quality. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art co-saliency detection models.},

  abstract     = {On purpose of aiding detection and recognition for railway infrastructure and dramatic changes in the environment around railways, visual inspection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is a highlight. However, UAV images often suffer from degradation for fog or haze, which limits the inspection efficiency. Most existing methods depend on a suboptimal two-step network with much more redundant procedures where transmission map and atmospheric light are estimated at first, and then haze-free images can be acquired using a dehazing model. This paper presents a novel end-to-end network for UAV-based railway images dehazing, and focuses on two key issues: network architecture and loss function. With regards to the first aspect, based on a pyramidal network structure, densely pyramidal residual network (DPRnet) consists of dense residual block and enhanced residual blocks, which heavily exploits the feature maps of all preceding layers and considerably increased depth at different scale, respectively. With regards to the second, a new loss function introducing structural similarity index is proposed to preserve more structural information, thereby restore the appealing perceptual quality of the hazy images. Finally, quantitative and qualitative evaluations illustrate that the DPRnet achieves better performance over the classic methods, yet remains efficient and convenient.},

  abstract     = {The Wasserstein distance originated from the optimal transport theory is a general and flexible statistical metric in a variety of image processing problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Wasserstein driven low-dimensional manifold model (W-LDMM), which tactfully embraces the Wasserstein distance between two noise histograms and low-dimensional manifold regularization for noisy image restoration. Specifically, with the Wasserstein distance, the discrepancy between the estimated noise histogram and the reference noise histogram is minimized to improve the noise estimation accuracy. Moreover, based on the fact that the patch manifold structures of many natural images are low dimensional, the dimension of the image patch maniflod is utilized as regularization constraint. The key idea of W-LDMM is that the Wasserstein distance for noise constraint and the low-dimensional manifold for image regularization are complementary to each other, rather than isolated and uncorrelated. Together, they promote the W-LDMM to exhibit excellent restored results in Gaussian denoising and noisy image inpainting . Finally, extensive experiments confirm that our W-LDMM can greatly improve visual and quantitative performance compared to several popular image restoration models.},

  abstract     = {Quantum neural network (QNN) is developed based on two classical theories of quantum computation and artificial neural networks . It has been proved that quantum computing is an important candidate for improving the performance of traditional neural networks. In this work, inspired by the QNN, the quantum computation method is combined with the echo state networks (ESNs), and a hybrid model namely quantum echo state network (QESN) is proposed. Firstly, the input training data is converted to quantum state, and the internal neurons in the dynamic reservoir of ESN are replaced by qubit neurons. Then in order to maintain the stability of QESN, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to the model for the parameter optimizations. The synthetic time series and real financial application datasets (Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index and foreign exchange) are used for performance evaluations, where the ESN, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) are used as the benchmarks. Results show that the proposed PSO-QESN model achieves a good performance for the time series predication tasks and is better than the benchmarking algorithms. Thus, it is feasible to apply quantum computing to the ESN model, which provides a novel method to improve the ESN performance.},

  abstract     = {Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks in portable devices can improve many applications of robotics, neurorobotics or prosthetic fields in terms of power consumption, high-speed processing and learning mechanisms. Analog and digital platforms have been previously proposed to run these networks. Analog designs are closer to biology since they implement the original mathematical model. However, digital platforms are, to some extent, abstractions of this model so far. In this paper, a full digital platform to design, implement and run real-time analog-like spiking neural networks is presented. Specifically, we present the design and implementation of digital circuits to run real-time biologically plausible spiking neural networks on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The circuit designed for the neuron implements the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model. The synapsis implemented is a bi-exponential current-based one. The synaptic circuit design consists of one static memory with the baseline current and a dynamic memory which stores the updated contribution over time of each pre-synaptic connection. All the parameters of both the neuron and the synapse are configurable. The results of the circuits are validated by running the same experiments on the Brian simulator. The circuits, which are totally original and independent of the technology, use only 136 slice registers of hardware resources. Thus, these designs allow the scale of the network. These circuits aim to be the basis of the spiking neural networks on digital devices. This platform allows the user to first simulate their network within the Brian simulator and then, confidently, move to the hardware platform replicating the same performance or even replace their analog platform with the digital one.},

Then, the global stability, finite-time convergence, and robustness against external disturbances are rigorously proven in the theory. Finally, illustrative coordination motion control tasks, comparisons and performance tests demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ST-ZNN model for coordination motion control of multiple robot manipulators.},

In order to overcome the poor performance of ℓ 2 -norm loss function with the outliers under the impulsive noise, we employ the ℓ 1 -norm as the loss function for the residual error , which is less sensitive to outliers in the measurements than the popular ℓ 2 -loss. To rise to the challenges introduced by the non-smooth problem, we first employ two smoothing strategies to approximate the ℓ 1 -norm loss function: one introduces a relaxation factor in the ℓ 1 -norm and the other uses the infimal convolution smoothing technique to transform it into a smooth counterpart. Both of them can approximate the ℓ 1 -norm with arbitrary degree of accuracy and provide a Lipschitz continuous gradient loss function. Then, we employ the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) and monotone APG (mAPG) frameworks for the convex and non-convex regularization functions, respectively. The convergence performance is discussed for generalized regularization penalty. The simulation result demonstrates our conclusions and indicates that the algorithm proposed in this paper can improve the reconstruction quality.},

However, it remains as an enormous challenge to model long texts in document-level sentiment classification as well as to explore semantics between sentences and dependencies between features. Moreover, most existing methods can hardly differentiate the importance of different contents when constructing a document representation. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel neural network model: AttDR-2DCNN, which mainly consists of two parts. The first part utilizes a two-layer compositional bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to obtain the compositional semantics of the document, where the first layer learns the feature vector of the sentence, and the second layer learns the document matrix representation consisting of two dimensions of the time-step dimension and feature dimension, from the sentence vectors. The second part applies a two-dimensional convolution operation and two-dimensional max pooling to capture more dependencies between sentences features. We further utilize different types of attention mechanism in these two parts to distinguish the importance of words, sentences and features in the document. Experiments are conducted on four publicly available document-level review datasets and the result shows that the proposed model outperforms some existing models.},

Nevertheless, current translation methods do not take the Chinese semantics and structure into account. In this paper, we propose a method called Structure-Semantic Net (SSNet) for Chinese typography generation, which utilizes disentangled stroke features from the structure module, pre-trained semantic features from the semantic module to generate target typographies. Furthermore, a novel loss called dual-masked Hausdorff distance is proposed to punish the incorrectly generated pixels to regularize the character contours, stabilizing the training process. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed SSNet surpasses existing image translation methods in image quality, and the ablation study of SSNet verifies the effectiveness of each module and loss function.},
