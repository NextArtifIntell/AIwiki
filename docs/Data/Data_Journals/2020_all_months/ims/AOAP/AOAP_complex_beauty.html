In this paper, we provide sharp sufficient conditions for the regular variation property of product-type functions of regularly varying random vectors, generalizing and extending the univariate theory in various directions. The main result is then applied to characterize the regular variation property of products of i.i.d. regularly varying quadratic random matrices and of solutions to affine stochastic recurrence equations under nonstandard conditions.},

Here one has to specify what the controller knows when about the exogenous shocks and how and when she can act on this information. We propose to use Meyer-$\sigma $-fields as a flexible tool to model information flow in such situations. The possibilities of this approach are illustrated first in a very simple linear stochastic control problem and then in a fairly general formulation for the singular stochastic control problem of irreversible investment with inventory risk. For the latter, we illustrate in a first case study how different signals on exogenous jumps lead to different optimal controls, interpolating between the predictable and the optional case in a systematic manner.},

The spread of each strain in the absence of the other one is described by the stochastic SIS logistic epidemic process, and we assume that there is perfect cross-immunity between the two strains, that is, individuals infected by one are temporarily immune to re-infections and infections by the other. For the case where one strain is strictly stronger than the other, and the stronger strain on its own is supercritical, we derive precise asymptotic results for the distribution of the time when the weaker strain disappears from the population. We further extend our results to certain parameter values where the difference between the basic reproductive ratios of the two strains may tend to 0 as $N\to\infty$. In our proofs, we illustrate a new approach to a fluid limit approximation for a sequence of Markov chains in the vicinity of a stable fixed point of the limit differential equation, valid over long time intervals.},

  abstract     = {The neutron transport equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons across a planar cross-section in an inhomogeneous fissile medium when the process of nuclear fission is active. Classical work on the NTE emerges from the applied mathematics literature in the 1950s through the work of R. Dautray and collaborators (Méthodes Probabilistes Pour les équations de la Physique (1989) Eyrolles; Mathematical Analysis and Numerical Methods for Science and Technology. Vol. 6: Evolution Problems. II (1993) Springer; Mathematical Topics in Neutron Transport Theory: New Aspects (1997) World Scientific). The NTE also has a probabilistic representation through the semigroup of the underlying physical process when envisaged as a stochastic process (cf. Méthodes Probabilistes pour les équations de la Physique (1989) Eyrolles; Introduction to Monte-Carlo Methods for Transport and Diffusion Equations (2003) Oxford Univ. Press; IMA J. Numer. Anal. 26 (2006) 657–685; Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 7 (1971/72) 153–179). More recently, Cox et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 176 (2019) 425–455) and Cox et al. (2019) have continued the probabilistic analysis of the NTE, introducing more recent ideas from the theory of spatial branching processes and quasi-stationary distributions. In this paper, we continue in the same vein and look at a fundamental description of stochastic growth in the supercritical regime. Our main result provides a significant improvement on the last known contribution to growth properties of the physical process in (Publ. Res. Inst. Math. Sci. 7 (1971/72) 153–179), bringing neutron transport theory in line with modern branching process theory such as (Ann. Probab. 44 (2016) 235–275; Ann. Probab. 43 (2015) 2545–2610). An important aspect of the proofs focuses on the use of a skeletal path decomposition, which we derive for general branching particle systems in the new context of nonlocal branching generators.},

That is, when agents make decisions based on their private information, as well as observing the actions of those before them, then it might be rational to ignore their private signal and imitate the action of previous individuals. If the individuals are choosing between a right and a wrong state, and the initial actions are wrong, then the whole cascade will be wrong. This issue is due to the fact that cascades can be based on very little information. We show that if agents occasionally disregard the actions of others and base their action only on their private information, then wrong cascades can be avoided. Moreover, we study the optimal asymptotic rate at which the error probability at time $t$ can go to zero. The optimal policy is for the player at time $t$ to follow their private information with probability $p_{t}=c/t$, leading to a learning rate of $c&#39;/t$, where the constants $c$ and $c&#39;$ are explicit.},

Bismut–Elworthy–Li formulae for the gradient and the Hessian of the integro-differential operators associated with these expansions are also presented. The article also provides explicit Dyson–Phillips expansions and a refined analysis of the norm of these integro-differential operators. Under some natural and easily verifiable regularity conditions we derive a series of exponential decays inequalities with respect to the time horizon. We illustrate the impact of these results with a second order extension of the Alekseev–Gröbner lemma to nonlinear measure valued semigroups and interacting diffusion flows. This second order perturbation analysis provides direct proofs of several uniform propagation of chaos properties w.r.t. the time parameter, including bias, fluctuation error estimate as well as exponential concentration inequalities.},

By reformulating the NTE in its mild form and identifying its solution as an expectation semigroup, we use modern techniques to develop a Perron–Fröbenius (PF) type decomposition, showing that growth is dominated by a leading eigenfunction and its associated left and right eigenfunctions. In the spirit of results for spatial branching and fragmentation processes, we use our PF decomposition to show the existence of an intrinsic martingale and associated spine decomposition. Moreover, we show how criticality in the PF decomposition dictates the convergence of the intrinsic martingale. The mathematical difficulties in this context come about through unusual piecewise linear motion of particles coupled with an infinite type-space which is taken as neutron velocity. The fundamental nature of our PF decomposition also plays out in accompanying work (Harris, Horton and Kyprianou (2020), Cox et al. (2020)).},

  abstract     = {The Bradley–Terry model is a fundamental model in the analysis of network data involving paired comparison. Assuming every pair of subjects in the network have an equal number of comparisons, Simons and Yao (Ann. Statist. 27 (1999) 1041–1060) established an asymptotic theory for statistical estimation in the Bradley–Terry model. In practice, when the size of the network becomes large, the paired comparisons are generally sparse. The sparsity can be characterized by the probability $p_{n}$ that a pair of subjects have at least one comparison, which tends to zero as the size of the network $n$ goes to infinity. In this paper, the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimate of the Bradley–Terry model are shown under minimal conditions of the sparsity. Specifically, the uniform consistency is proved when $p_{n}$ is as small as the order of $(\log n)^{3}/n$, which is near the theoretical lower bound $\log n/n$ by the theory of the Erdos–Rényi graph. Asymptotic normality and inference are also provided. Evidence in support of the theory is presented in simulation results, along with an application to the analysis of the ATP data.},

We prove a functional large deviations principle for the equilibrium queue length process. The model is motivated by a linear feed-forward gene regulatory network, in which the rate of protein synthesis is modulated by the number of RNA molecules present in a cell. The system can be modelled as a nonstandard tandem of infinite-server queues, in which the number of customers present in a queue modulates the arrival rate into the next queue in the tandem. We establish large deviation principles for this queueing system in the asymptotic regime in which the arrival process is sped up, while the service process is not scaled.},

Previous proofs of this fact relied on reflection positivity and were thus limited to random surfaces defined on highly symmetric graphs, whereas our argument applies to general graphs. Our proof makes use of a cluster algorithm and reflection transformation for random surfaces of the type introduced by Swendsen–Wang, Wolff and Evertz et al. We discuss the general framework for such cluster algorithms, reviewing several particular cases with emphasis on their use in obtaining theoretical results. Two additional applications are presented: A reflection principle for random surfaces and a proof that pair correlations in the spin $O(n)$ model have monotone densities, strengthening Griffiths’ first inequality for such correlations.},

Our motivation is to apply this result to measure-valued Pólya processes (MVPPs, also known as infinitely-many Pólya urns). Our main idea is to use Foster–Lyapunov type criteria in a novel way to generalize stochastic-approximation methods to measure-valued Markov processes with a noncompact underlying space, overcoming in a fairly general context one of the major difficulties of existing studies on this subject. From the MVPPs point of view, our result implies almost-sure convergence of a large class of MVPPs; this convergence was only obtained until now for specific examples, with only convergence in probability established for general classes. Furthermore, our approach allows us to extend the definition of MVPPs by adding “weights” to the different colors of the infinitely-many-color urn. We also exhibit a link between non-“balanced” MVPPs and quasi-stationary distributions of Markovian processes, which allows us to treat, for the first time in the literature, the nonbalanced case. Finally, we show how our result can be applied to designing stochastic-approximation algorithms for the approximation of quasi-stationary distributions of discrete- and continuous-time Markov processes on noncompact spaces.},

Our study was prompted by some concrete problems in battery modelling (Contin. Mech.

This paper can be seen as an attempt to advertize the ideas, power and simplicity of the pathwise appproach, not so easily extracted from (Bailleul, Catellier and Delarue (2018); Proc. Lond. Math.

In this paper, we analyze the case where only a few diffusions start outside of an accessible trap. Our main result shows that in this “sparse regime” the system of weakly interacting diffusions converges in distribution to a forest of excursions from the trap.

Second, we consider the limiting behavior of the neighborhood of a point in the permutation through local limits.

We study basic analytic properties of these random generalized functions, such as what spaces of distributions these objects live in, along with their basic stochastic properties, such as moment and tail estimates. After this, we discuss connections between imaginary multiplicative chaos and the critical planar Ising model, namely that the scaling limit of the spin field of the critical planar XOR-Ising model can be expressed in terms of the cosine of the Gaussian free field, that is, the real part of an imaginary multiplicative chaos distribution. Moreover, if one adds a magnetic perturbation to the XOR-Ising model, then the scaling limit of the spin field can be expressed in terms of the cosine of the sine-Gordon field, which can also be viewed as the real part of an imaginary multiplicative chaos distribution.

The positions of the obstacles are sampled independently from the walk and according to a renewal process. The increments between consecutive obstacles, or gaps, are assumed to have a power-law decaying tail with exponent $\gamma&gt;0$. We prove convergence in law for the properly rescaled logarithm of the quenched survival probability as time goes to infinity. The normalization exponent is $\gamma/(\gamma+2)$, while the limiting law writes as a variational formula with both universal and nonuniversal features. The latter involves (i) a Poisson point process that emerges as the universal scaling limit of the properly rescaled gaps and (ii) a function of the parameter $\beta$ that we call asymptotic cost of crossing per obstacle and that may, in principle, depend on the details of the gap distribution. Our proof suggests a confinement strategy of the walk in a single large gap. This model may also be seen as a $(1+1)$-directed polymer among many repulsive interfaces, in which case $\beta$ corresponds to the strength of repulsion, the survival probability to the partition function and its logarithm to the finite-volume free energy.},

The results are then applied to a class of RBMs considered in (Blanchet and Xinyun (2016)) and to rank-based diffusions including the Atlas model. In both cases, we obtain explicit rates and bounds on relaxation times. In the first case we improve the relaxation time estimates of $O(d^{4}(\log d)^{2})$ obtained in (Blanchet and Xinyun (2016)) to $O((\log d)^{2})$. In the latter case, we give the first results on explicit parameter and dimension dependent rates under the Wasserstein distance. The proofs do not require an explicit form for the stationary measure or reversibility of the process with respect to this measure, and cover settings where these properties are not available. In the special case of the standard Atlas model (In Stochastic Portfolio Theory (2002) 1–24 Springer), we obtain a bound on the relaxation time of $O(d^{6}(\log d)^{2})$.},

The interaction is either repulsive (partial exclusion process) or attractive (inclusion process). We provide an exact formula for the Laplace–Fourier transform of the transition probabilities of the two-particle dynamics. From this we derive a general scaling limit result, which shows that the possible scaling limits are coalescing Brownian motions, reflected Brownian motions and sticky Brownian motions. In particle systems with duality, the solution of the dynamics of two dual particles provides relevant information. We apply the exact formula to the the symmetric inclusion process, that is self-dual, in the condensation regime. We thus obtain two results. First, by computing the time-dependent covariance of the particle occupation number at two lattice sites we characterise the time-dependent coarsening in infinite volume when the process is started from a homogeneous product measure. Second, we identify the limiting variance of the density field in the diffusive scaling limit, relating it to the local time of sticky Brownian motion.},

Probab. 47 (2019) 1541–1586), while the latter case ($b\ll (\log k)/N$) macroscopic equilibrium is not sufficient for mixing and one must wait till local fluctuations equilibrate, similarly to what happens in the symmetric case worked out in (Ann. Probab. 44 (2016) 1426–1487). In both cases, convergence to equilibrium is abrupt: we have a cutoff phenomenon for the total-variation distance.

The strength of the bottleneck is measured by a parameter $\alpha $ which roughly corresponds to the fraction of edges that go from one community to the other. We show that if $\alpha\gg \frac{1}{\log N}$, then the nonbacktracking random walk exhibits cutoff at the same time as in the one-community case, but with a larger cutoff window, and that the distance profile inside this window converges to the Gaussian tail function. On the other hand, if $\alpha \ll \frac{1}{\log N}$ or $\alpha \asymp \frac{1}{\log N}$, then the mixing time is of order $1/\alpha $ and there is no cutoff.},

Our results apply to approximations such as explicit finite difference schemes and Trotter–Kato type mixing formulas. The irregular time dependence disrupts the usual methods from the classical viscosity theory for creating schemes that are both monotone and convergent, an obstacle that cannot be overcome by incorporating higher order correction terms, as is done for numerical approximations of stochastic or rough ordinary differential equations. The novelty here is to regularize those driving paths with nontrivial quadratic variation in order to guarantee both monotonicity and convergence. We present qualitative and quantitative results, the former covering a wide variety of schemes for second-order equations. An error estimate is established in the Hamilton–Jacobi case, its merit being that it depends on the path only through the modulus of continuity, and not on the derivatives or total variation. As a result, it is possible to choose a regularization of the path so as to obtain efficient rates of convergence. This is demonstrated in the specific setting of equations with multiplicative white noise in time, in which case the convergence holds with probability one. We also present an example using scaled random walks that exhibits convergence in distribution.},

The initial condition $\theta_{0}$ and diffusion coefficient $\kappa$ are assumed to be known and the data consist of point observations of the scalar field $\theta$ corrupted by additive, i.i.d. Gaussian noise. We adopt a Bayesian approach to this estimation problem and establish that the inference is consistent, that is, that the posterior measure identifies the true background flow as the number of scalar observations grows large. Since the inverse map is ill-defined for some classes of problems even for perfect, infinite measurements of $\theta$, multiple experiments (initial conditions) are required to resolve the true fluid flow. Under this assumption, suitable conditions on the observation points, and given support and tail conditions on the prior measure, we show that the posterior measure converges to a Dirac measure centered on the true flow as the number of observations goes to infinity.},

Previous work on this problem took two forms. First, when the $n$-player equilibria are open-loop, compactness arguments permit a characterization of all limit points of $n$-player equilibria as weak MFG equilibria, which contain additional randomness compared to the standard (strong) equilibrium concept. On the other hand, when the $n$-player equilibria are closed-loop, the convergence to the MFG equilibrium is known only when the MFG equilibrium is unique and the associated “master equation” is solvable and sufficiently smooth. This paper adapts the compactness arguments to the closed-loop case, proving a convergence theorem that holds even when the MFG equilibrium is nonunique. Every limit point of $n$-player equilibria is shown to be the same kind of weak MFG equilibrium as in the open-loop case. Some partial results and examples are discussed for the converse question, regarding which of the weak MFG equilibria can arise as the limit of $n$-player (approximate) equilibria.},

We observe that conditional optimization is time-inconsistent due to the dynamic change of the conditioning probability and develop an equilibrium approach in the spirit of R. H. Strotz’ work for sophisticated agents in discrete time. Equilibria are found to be essentially unique in the case of a finite time horizon whereas an infinite horizon gives rise to nonuniqueness and other interesting phenomena.

  abstract     = {Discrete time analogues of ergodic stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are one of the most popular and flexible tools for sampling high-dimensional probability measures. Non-asymptotic analysis in the $L^{2}$ Wasserstein distance of sampling algorithms based on Euler discretisations of SDEs has been recently developed by several authors for log-concave probability distributions. In this work we replace the log-concavity assumption with a log-concavity at infinity condition. We provide novel $L^{2}$ convergence rates for Euler schemes, expressed explicitly in terms of problem parameters. From there we derive nonasymptotic bounds on the distance between the laws induced by Euler schemes and the invariant laws of SDEs, both for schemes with standard and with randomised (inaccurate) drifts. We also obtain bounds for the hierarchy of discretisation, which enables us to deploy a multi-level Monte Carlo estimator. Our proof relies on a novel construction of a coupling for the Markov chains that can be used to control both the $L^{1}$ and $L^{2}$ Wasserstein distances simultaneously. Finally, we provide a weak convergence analysis that covers both the standard and the randomised (inaccurate) drift case. In particular, we reveal that the variance of the randomised drift does not influence the rate of weak convergence of the Euler scheme to the SDE.},

  abstract     = {Rare events play a key role in many applications and numerous algorithms have been proposed for estimating the probability of a rare event. However, relatively little is known on how to quantify the sensitivity of the rare event’s probability with respect to model parameters. In this paper, instead of the direct statistical estimation of rare event sensitivities, we develop novel and general uncertainty quantification and sensitivity bounds which are not tied to specific rare event simulation methods and which apply to families of rare events. Our method is based on a recently derived variational representation for the family of Rényi divergences in terms of risk sensitive functionals associated with the rare events under consideration. Inspired by the derived bounds, we propose new sensitivity indices for rare events and relate them to the moment generating function of the score function. The bounds scale in such a way that we additionally develop sensitivity indices for large deviation rate functions.},

There are several ways to define surface and volume here: the simplest method is to count boundary edges (for the surface) and vertices (for the volume). We show that for a geometric (possibly weighted) graph on $n$ random points in a $d$-dimensional domain with Lipschitz boundary and with distance parameter decaying more slowly (as a function of $n$) than the connectivity threshold, the Cheeger constant (under several possible definitions of surface and volume), also known as conductance, suitably rescaled, converges for large $n$ to an analogous Cheeger-type constant of the domain. Previously, García Trillos et al. had shown this for $d\geq 3$ but had required an extra condition on the distance parameter when $d=2$.},

What does the ancestral tree drawn out by these $k$ particles look like? Some special cases are known but we give a more complete answer. We concentrate on near-critical cases where the mean number of offspring is $1+\mu/T$ for some $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$, and show that a scaling limit exists as $T\to\infty$. Viewed backwards in time, the resulting coalescent process is topologically equivalent to Kingman’s coalescent, but the times of coalescence have an interesting and highly nontrivial structure. The randomly fluctuating population size, as opposed to constant size populations where the Kingman coalescent more usually arises, have a pronounced effect on both the results and the method of proof required. We give explicit formulas for the distribution of the coalescent times, as well as a construction of the genealogical tree involving a mixture of independent and identically distributed random variables. In general subcritical and supercritical cases it is not possible to give such explicit formulas, but we highlight the special case of birth–death processes.},

We investigate the following transport-information $T_{\mathcal{V}}I$ inequality: $\alpha (T_{\mathcal{V}}(\nu ,\mu ))\le I(\nu |P,\mu )$ for all probability measures $\nu $ on some metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$, where $\mu $ is an invariant and ergodic probability measure of some given transition kernel $P(x,dy)$, $T_{\mathcal{V}}(\nu ,\mu )$ is some transportation cost from $\nu $ to $\mu $, $I(\nu |P,\mu )$ is the Donsker–Varadhan information of $\nu $ with respect to $(P,\mu )$ and $\alpha :[0,\infty )\to [0,\infty ]$ is some left continuous increasing function. Using large deviation techniques, we show that $T_{\mathcal{V}}I$ is equivalent to some concentration inequality for the occupation measure of the $\mu $-reversible Markov chain $(X_{n})_{n\ge 0}$ with transition probability $P(x,dy)$. Its relationships with the transport-entropy inequalities are discussed. Several easy-to-check sufficient conditions are provided for $T_{\mathcal{V}}I$. We show the usefulness and sharpness of our general results by a number of applications and examples. The main difficulty resides in the fact that the information $I(\nu |P,\mu )$ has no closed expression, contrary to the continuous time or independent and identically distributed case.},

We study a variant of the inverse first passage time problem for killed Brownian motion. We show that if $\lambda&gt;0$ is a killing rate parameter and $𝟙_{(-\infty,0]}$ is the indicator of the set $(-\infty,0]$ then, under certain compatibility assumptions, there exists a unique continuous function $b:\mathbb{R}_{+}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathbb{E}[-\lambda\int_{0}^{t}𝟙_{(-\infty,0]}(B_{s}-b(s))\,ds]=\mathbb{P}{\zeta&gt;t}$ holds for all $t\geq0$. This is a significant improvement of a result of the first two authors (Ann. Appl. Probab. 24 (2014) 1–33). The main difficulty arises because $𝟙_{(-\infty,0]}$ is discontinuous. We associate a semilinear parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) coupled with an integral constraint to this version of the inverse first passage time problem. We prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to this constrained PDE system. In addition, we use the recent Feynman–Kac representation results of Glau (Finance Stoch. 20 (2016) 1021–1059) to prove that the weak solutions give the correct probabilistic interpretation.},

This is what is known as the cut-off phenomenon in the context of Markov chains of increasing complexity.

This captures instances of models such as (i) broadcasting on trees, (ii) block models, (iii) synchronization on grids, (iv) spiked Wigner models. The paper gives an upper bound on the mutual information between two vertices in terms of a bond percolation estimate. Namely, the information between two vertices’ spins is bounded by the probability that these vertices are connected when edges are opened with a probability that “emulates” the edge-information. Both the information and the open-probability are based on the Chi-squared mutual information. The main results allow us to re-derive known results for information-theoretic nonreconstruction in models (i)–(iv), with more direct or improved bounds in some cases, and to obtain new results, such as for a spiked Wigner model on grids. The main result also implies a new subadditivity property for the Chi-squared mutual information for symmetric channels and general graphs, extending the subadditivity property obtained by Evans–Kenyon–Peres–Schulman (Ann. Appl. Probab. 10 (2000) 410–433) for trees. Some cases of nonsymmetrical channels are also discussed.},

Given that the position of the Brownian particle is being observed in real time, the problem is to detect as soon as possible and with minimal probabilities of the wrong terminal decisions, which spatial coordinate has the nonzero drift. We solve this problem in the Bayesian formulation, under any prior probabilities of the nonzero drift being in any of the three spatial coordinates, when the passage of time is penalised linearly. Finding the exact solution to the problem in three dimensions, including a rigorous treatment of its nonmonotone optimal stopping boundaries, is the main contribution of the present paper.

  abstract     = {We show that if either the process is strong Feller and the boundary point is probabilistically regular for the stopping set, or the process is strong Markov and the boundary point is probabilistically regular for the interior of the stopping set, then the boundary point is Green regular for the stopping set. Combining this implication with the existence of a continuously differentiable flow of the process we show that the value function is continuously differentiable at the optimal stopping boundary whenever the gain function is so. The derived fact holds both in the parabolic and elliptic case of the boundary value problem under the sole hypothesis of probabilistic regularity of the optimal stopping boundary, thus improving upon known analytic results in the PDE literature, and establishing the fact for the first time in the case of integro-differential equations. The method of proof is purely probabilistic and conceptually simple. Examples of application include the first known probabilistic proof of the fact that the time derivative of the value function in the American put problem is continuous across the optimal stopping boundary.},

  abstract     = {The master equation is a type of PDE whose state variable involves the distribution of certain underlying state process. It is a powerful tool for studying the limit behavior of large interacting systems, including mean field games and systemic risk. It also appears naturally in stochastic control problems with partial information and in time inconsistent problems. In this paper we propose a novel notion of viscosity solution for parabolic master equations, arising mainly from control problems, and establish its wellposedness. Our main innovation is to restrict the involved measures to a certain set of semimartingale measures which satisfy the desired compactness. As an important example, we study the HJB master equation associated with the control problems for McKean–Vlasov SDEs. Due to practical considerations, we consider closed-loop controls. It turns out that the regularity of the value function becomes much more involved in this framework than the counterpart in the standard control problems. Finally, we build the whole theory in the path dependent setting, which is often seen in applications. The main result in this part is an extension of Dupire’s (2009) functional Itô formula. This Itô formula requires a special structure of the derivatives with respect to the measures, which was originally due to Lions in the state dependent case. We provided an elementary proof for this well known result in the short note (2017), and the same arguments work in the path dependent setting here.},

We assume that the dispatching decisions are made by a central dispatcher endowed with a finite memory, and with the ability to exchange messages with the servers. We study the fundamental resource requirements (memory bits and message exchange rate), in order to drive the expected queueing delay in steady-state of a typical job to zero, as $n$ increases. We develop a novel approach to show that, within a certain broad class of “symmetric” policies, every dispatching policy with a message rate of the order of $n$, and with a memory of the order of $\log n$ bits, results in an expected queueing delay which is bounded away from zero, uniformly as $n\to \infty $. This complements existing results which show that, in the absence of such limitations on the memory or the message rate, there exist policies with vanishing queueing delay (at least with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times).},

For any $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $\theta &gt;-\alpha $ Pitman (Combinatorial Stochastic Processes (2006) Springer, Berlin) showed that $n^{-\alpha }K_{n}\stackrel{\text{a.s.}}{\longrightarrow }S_{\alpha,\theta }$ as $n\rightarrow +\infty $, where the limiting random variable, referred to as Pitman’s $\alpha $-diversity, is distributed according to a polynomially scaled Mittag–Leffler distribution function. Our main result is a Berry–Esseen theorem for Pitman’s $\alpha $-diversity $S_{\alpha,\theta }$, namely we show that \[\mathop{\mathrm{sup}}_{x\geq 0}\biggl\vert \mathsf{P}\biggl[\frac{K_{n}}{n^{\alpha }}\leq x\biggr]-\mathsf{P}[S_{\alpha,\theta }\leq x]\biggr\vert \leq\frac{C(\alpha,\theta )}{n^{\alpha }}\] holds for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ with an explicit constant term $C(\alpha,\theta )$, for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $\theta &gt;0$. The proof relies on three intermediate novel results which are of independent interest: (i) a probabilistic representation of the distribution of $K_{n}$ in terms of a compound distribution; (ii) a quantitative version of the Laplace’s approximation method for integrals; (iii) a refined quantitative bound for Poisson approximation. An application of our Berry–Esseen theorem is presented in the context of Bayesian nonparametric inference for species sampling problems, quantifying the error of a posterior approximation that has been extensively applied to infer the number of unseen species in a population.},

Previous research on nonlinear large deviations has only focused on random variables supported on ${-1,+1}^{n}$, and accordingly we build theory for random variables with general distributions, increasing flexibility in the applications. As examples, we compute the large deviation rate functions for monochromatic subgraph counts in edge-colored complete graphs, and for triangle counts in dense random graphs with continuous edge weights.

We prove here that the extremal process converges to a Cox process with exponential intensity. This entails, in particular, that the first passage time converges weakly to a random shift of the Gumbel distribution. The random shift, which has an explicit, universal distribution related to modified Bessel functions of the second kind, is the sole manifestation of correlations ensuing from the geometry of Euclidean space in infinite dimensions. The proof combines the multiscale refinement of the second moment method with a conditional version of the Chen–Stein bounds, and a contraction principle.},

Under very general conditions, we show that an optimal consumption and investment plan exists and is unique, and provide a dual characterization in terms of an optional strong supermartingale deflator and a decreasing part, which charges only the times when the no-borrowing constraint is binding. The analysis relies on the infinite-dimensional parametrization of the income/liability streams and, therefore, provides the first-order dependence of the optimal investment and consumption plans on future income/liabilities (as well as a pricing rule).},

Thanks to the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, the total curvature is directly related to the Euler characteristic of the excursion set. We show that the level perimeter and the total curvature integrals can be computed in two different frameworks: smooth (at least $C^{2}$) functions and piecewise constant functions (also called here elementary functions). Considering 2D random fields (in particular shot noise random fields), we compute their mean perimeter and total curvature integrals, and this provides new “explicit” computations of the mean perimeter and Euler characteristic densities of excursion sets, beyond the Gaussian framework: for piecewise constant shot noise random fields, we give some examples of completely explicit formulas, and for smooth shot noise random fields the provided examples are only partly explicit, since the formulas are given under the form of integrals of some special functions.},

It is proved that if the timestep is bounded appropriately, then over a finite time interval the numerical approximation is stable, and the expected number of timesteps is finite. Furthermore, the order of strong convergence is the same as usual, that is, order $\frac{1}{2}$ for SDEs with a nonuniform globally Lipschitz volatility, and order $1$ for Langevin SDEs with unit volatility and a drift with sufficient smoothness. For a class of ergodic SDEs, we also show that the bound for the moments and the strong error of the numerical solution are uniform in $T$, which allow us to introduce the adaptive multilevel Monte Carlo method to compute the expectations with respect to the invariant distribution.

  abstract     = {In the trace reconstruction problem, an unknown bit string ${\mathbf{x}}\in{0,1}^{n}$ is sent through a deletion channel where each bit is deleted independently with some probability $q\in(0,1)$, yielding a contracted string ${\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}}$. How many i.i.d. samples of ${\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}}$ are needed to reconstruct ${\mathbf{x}}$ with high probability? We prove that there exist ${\mathbf{x}},{\mathbf{y}}\in{0,1}^{n}$ such that at least $cn^{5/4}/\sqrt{\log n}$ traces are required to distinguish between ${\mathbf{x}}$ and ${\mathbf{y}}$ for some absolute constant $c$, improving the previous lower bound of $cn$. Furthermore, our result improves the previously known lower bound for reconstruction of random strings from $c\log^{2}n$ to $c\log^{9/4}n/\sqrt{\log\log n}$.},

In sharp contrast to the complex and quaternion Ginibre ensemble, real eigenvalues in the real Ginibre ensemble attain positive likelihood. In turn, the spectral radius $R_{n}=\max_{1\leq j\leq n}|z_{j}(\mathbf{X})|$ of the eigenvalues $z_{j}(\mathbf{X})\in \mathbb{C}$ of a real Ginibre matrix $\mathbf{X}$ follows a different limiting law (as $n\rightarrow \infty $) for $z_{j}(\mathbf{X})\in \mathbb{R}$ than for $z_{j}(\mathbf{X})\in \mathbb{C}\setminus \mathbb{R}$.

  abstract     = {The random-cluster model with parameters $(p,q)$ is a random graph model that generalizes bond percolation ($q=1$) and the Ising and Potts models ($q\geq 2$). We study its Glauber dynamics on $n\times n$ boxes $\Lambda_{n}$ of the integer lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, where the model exhibits a sharp phase transition at $p=p_{c}(q)$. Unlike traditional spin systems like the Ising and Potts models, the random-cluster model has non-local interactions. Long-range interactions can be imposed as external connections in the boundary of $\Lambda_{n}$, known as boundary conditions. For select boundary conditions that do not carry long-range information (namely, wired and free), Blanca and Sinclair proved that when $q&gt;1$ and $p\neq p_{c}(q)$, the Glauber dynamics on $\Lambda_{n}$ mixes in optimal $O(n^{2}\log n)$ time. In this paper, we prove that this mixing time is polynomial in $n$ for every boundary condition that is realizable as a configuration on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}\setminus\Lambda_{n}$. We then use this to prove near-optimal $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ mixing time for “typical” boundary conditions. As a complementary result, we construct classes of nonrealizable (nonplanar) boundary conditions inducing slow (stretched-exponential) mixing at $p\ll p_{c}$.},

  abstract     = {We show that repulsive random variables can yield Monte Carlo methods with faster convergence rates than the typical $N^{-1/2}$, where $N$ is the number of integrand evaluations. More precisely, we propose stochastic numerical quadratures involving determinantal point processes associated with multivariate orthogonal polynomials, and we obtain root mean square errors that decrease as $N^{-(1+1/d)/2}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the ambient space. First, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for the linear statistics of a class of determinantal point processes, when the reference measure is a product measure supported on a hypercube, which satisfies the Nevai-class regularity condition; a result which may be of independent interest. Next, we introduce a Monte Carlo method based on these determinantal point processes, and prove a CLT with explicit limiting variance for the quadrature error, when the reference measure satisfies a stronger regularity condition. As a corollary, by taking a specific reference measure and using a construction similar to importance sampling, we obtain a general Monte Carlo method, which applies to any measure with continuously derivable density. Loosely speaking, our method can be interpreted as a stochastic counterpart to Gaussian quadrature, which at the price of some convergence rate, is easily generalizable to any dimension and has a more explicit error term.},

Initially, only the particles occupying $\mathbf{o}$ are active. Active particles perform $t\in \mathbb{N}\cup {\infty }$ steps of the walk they picked before vanishing and activate all inactive particles they hit. This system is often taken as a model for the spread of an epidemic over a population. Let $\mathcal{R}_{t}$ be the set of vertices which are visited by the process, when active particles vanish after $t$ steps. We study the susceptibility of the process on the underlying graph, defined as the random quantity $\mathcal{S}(G):=\inf {t:\mathcal{R}_{t}=V}$ (essentially, the shortest particles’ lifespan required for the entire population to get infected). We consider the cases that the underlying graph is either a regular expander or a $d$-dimensional torus of side length $n$ (for all $d\ge 1$) $\mathbb{T}_{d}(n)$ and determine the asymptotic behavior of $\mathcal{S}$ up to a constant factor. In fact, throughout we allow the particle density ${\lambda }$ to depend on $n$ and for $d\ge 2$ we determine the asymptotic behavior of $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{T}_{d}(n))$ up to smaller order terms for a wide range of ${\lambda }={\lambda }_{n}$.},

Our main focus is on this process on the product graph $\mathbb{Z}^{2}\times K_{n}^{2}$, where $K_{n}$ is a complete graph. We investigate how $p$ scales with $n$ so that a typical site is eventually occupied. Under critical scaling, the dynamics with even $\theta $ exhibits a sharp phase transition, while odd $\theta $ yields a gradual percolation transition. We also establish a gradual transition for bootstrap percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}\times K_{n}$. The community structure of the product graphs connects our process to a heterogeneous bootstrap percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.

  abstract     = {Consider a system of $N$ parallel single-server queues with unit-exponential service time distribution and a single dispatcher where tasks arrive as a Poisson process of rate $\lambda (N)$. When a task arrives, the dispatcher assigns it to one of the servers according to the Join-the-Shortest Queue (JSQ) policy. Eschenfeldt and Gamarnik (Math. Oper. Res. 43 (2018) 867–886) identified a novel limiting diffusion process that arises as the weak-limit of the appropriately scaled occupancy measure of the system under the JSQ policy in the Halfin–Whitt regime, where $(N-\lambda (N))/\sqrt{N}\to \beta &gt;0$ as $N\to \infty$. The analysis of this diffusion goes beyond the state of the art techniques, and even proving its ergodicity is nontrivial, and was left as an open question. Recently, exploiting a generator expansion framework via the Stein’s method, Braverman (2018) established its exponential ergodicity, and adapting a regenerative approach, Banerjee and Mukherjee (Ann. Appl. Probab. 29 (2018) 1262–1309) analyzed the tail properties of the stationary distribution and path fluctuations of the diffusion. However, the analysis of the bulk behavior of the stationary distribution, namely, the moments, remained intractable until this work. In this paper, we perform a thorough analysis of the bulk behavior of the stationary distribution of the diffusion process, and discover that it exhibits different qualitative behavior, depending on the value of the heavy-traffic parameter $\beta$. Moreover, we obtain precise asymptotic laws of the centered and scaled steady-state distribution, as $\beta $ tends to 0 and $\infty$. Of particular interest, we also establish a certain intermittency phenomena in the $\beta \to \infty$ regime and a surprising distributional convergence result in the $\beta \to 0$ regime.},

  abstract     = {PageRank is a well-known algorithm for measuring centrality in networks. It was originally proposed by Google for ranking pages in the World Wide Web. One of the intriguing empirical properties of PageRank is the so-called ‘power-law hypothesis’: in a scale-free network, the PageRank scores follow a power law with the same exponent as the (in-)degrees. To date, this hypothesis has been confirmed empirically and in several specific random graphs models. In contrast, this paper does not focus on one random graph model but investigates the existence of an asymptotic PageRank distribution, when the graph size goes to infinity, using local weak convergence. This may help to identify general network structures in which the power-law hypothesis holds. We start from the definition of local weak convergence for sequences of (random) undirected graphs, and extend this notion to directed graphs. To this end, we define an exploration process in the directed setting that keeps track of in- and out-degrees of vertices. Then we use this to prove the existence of an asymptotic PageRank distribution. As a result, the limiting distribution of PageRank can be computed directly as a function of the limiting object. We apply our results to the directed configuration model and continuous-time branching processes trees, as well as to preferential attachment models.},
