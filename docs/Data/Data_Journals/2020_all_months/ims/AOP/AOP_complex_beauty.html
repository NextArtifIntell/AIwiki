  abstract     = {Oliveira conjectured that the order of the mixing time of the exclusion process with $k$-particles on an arbitrary $n$-vertex graph is at most that of the mixing-time of $k$ independent particles. We verify this up to a constant factor for $d$-regular graphs when each edge rings at rate $1/d$ in various cases: (1) when $d=\Omega (\log _{n/k}n)$, (2) when $\mathrm{gap}:=$ the spectral-gap of a single walk is $O(1/\log ^{4}n)$ and $k\ge n^{\Omega (1)}$, (3) when $k\asymp n^{a}$ for some constant $0&lt;a&lt;1$. In these cases, our analysis yields a probabilistic proof of a weaker version of Aldous’ famous spectral-gap conjecture (resolved by Caputo et al.). We also prove a general bound of $O(\log n\log \log n/\mathrm{gap})$, which is within a $\log \log n$ factor from Oliveira’s conjecture when $k\ge n^{\Omega (1)}$. As applications, we get new mixing bounds: (a) $O(\log n\log \log n)$ for expanders, (b) order $d\log (dk)$ for the hypercube ${0,1}^{d}$, (c) order $(\mathrm{Diameter})^{2}\log k$ for vertex-transitive graphs of moderate growth and for supercritical percolation on a fixed dimensional torus.},

In particular, an atypical logarithmic correction appears in the scaling of the variance. The proof is based on new asymptotic estimates, which hold in any dimension $d\ge5$, for the probability that the ranges of two independent random walks intersect.

As an application of the covariance formula, we derive strong mixing bounds for topological events, as well as lower concentration inequalities for additive topological functionals (e.g., the number of connected components) of the level sets that satisfy a law of large numbers. The covariance formula also gives an alternate justification of the Harris criterion, which conjecturally describes the boundary of the percolation university class for level sets of stationary Gaussian fields. Our work is inspired by (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincaré Probab.

This demonstrates a novel rigorous connection between probabilistic number theory and the theory of multiplicative chaos—the latter is known to be connected to various branches of modern probability theory and mathematical physics. We also investigate the statistical behavior of the zeta function on the mesoscopic scale. We prove that if we let $\delta _{T}$ approach zero slowly enough as $T\to \infty $, then $t\mapsto \zeta (1/2+i\delta _{T}t+i\omega T)$ is asymptotically a product of a divergent scalar quantity suggested by Selberg’s central limit theorem and a strictly Gaussian multiplicative chaos. We also prove a similar result for the characteristic polynomial of a Haar distributed random unitary matrix, where the scalar quantity is slightly different but the multiplicative chaos part is identical. This says that up to scalar multiples, the zeta function and the characteristic polynomial of a Haar distributed random unitary matrix have an identical distribution on the mesoscopic scale.},

  abstract     = {In (Combin. Probab. Comput. 9 (2000) 191–204), Aldous investigates a symmetric Markov chain on cladograms and gives bounds on its mixing and relaxation times. The latter bound was sharpened in (Random Structures Algorithms 20 (2002) 59–70). In the present paper, we encode cladograms as binary, algebraic measure trees and show that this Markov chain on cladograms with a fixed number of leaves converges in distribution as the number of leaves tends to infinity. We give a rigorous construction of the limit as the solution of a well-posed martingale problem. The existence of a continuum limit diffusion was conjectured by Aldous, and we therefore refer to it as Aldous diffusion. We show that the Aldous diffusion is a Feller process with continuous paths, and the algebraic measure Brownian CRT is its unique invariant distribution. Furthermore, we consider the vector of the masses of the three subtrees connected to a sampled branch point. In the Brownian CRT, its annealed law is known to be the Dirichlet distribution. Here, we give an explicit expression for the infinitesimal evolution of its quenched law under the Aldous diffusion.},

Several interesting phenomena that do not occur in the single constraint case can happen under the multiple constraints case. We systematically analyze the detailed structures of such microcanonical ensembles in two orthogonal directions using the theory of large deviations. First of all, we establish the equivalence of ensembles result, which exhibits an interesting phase transition phenomenon. Secondly, we study the localization and delocalization phenomena by obtaining large deviation results for the joint law of empirical distributions and the maximum component. Some concrete examples for which the theory applies will be given as well.},

Theory Related Fields 170 (2018) 821–845), for convergence in quadratic Wasserstein transportation distance for bounded random vectors; (b) we derive the first nonasymptotic convergence rate for the entropic CLT in arbitrary dimension, for general log-concave random vectors (this adds to (Ann.

  abstract     = {In classical optimal transport, the contributions of Benamou–Brenier and McCann regarding the time-dependent version of the problem are cornerstones of the field and form the basis for a variety of applications in other mathematical areas. We suggest a Benamou–Brenier type formulation of the martingale transport problem for given $d$-dimensional distributions $\mu $, $\nu $ in convex order. The unique solution $M^{*}=(M_{t}^{*})_{t\in [0,1]}$ of this problem turns out to be a Markov-martingale which has several notable properties: In a specific sense it mimics the movement of a Brownian particle as closely as possible subject to the conditions $M^{*}_{0}\sim \mu $, $M^{*}_{1}\sim \nu $. Similar to McCann’s displacement-interpolation, $M^{*}$ provides a time-consistent interpolation between $\mu $ and $\nu $. For particular choices of the initial and terminal law, $M^{*}$ recovers archetypical martingales such as Brownian motion, geometric Brownian motion, and the Bass martingale. Furthermore, it yields a natural approximation to the local vol model and a new approach to Kellerer’s theorem. This article is parallel to the work of Huesmann–Trevisan, who consider a related class of problems from a PDE-oriented perspective.},

This singular part is actually unavoidable bearing in mind that some Gaussian processes have a positive probability to keep a constant sign on some compact domain. Our strategy mainly consists in proving closed Kac–Rice type formulas allowing one to express the volume of the set ${f=0}$ as integrals of explicit functionals of $(f,\nabla f,\operatorname{Hess}(f))$ and next to deduce that the random nodal volume belongs to the domain of a suitable Malliavin gradient.

In (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 73 (2020) 350–383) it was shown that, when $\varepsilon &gt;0$ is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, the (thermodynamic) limit $\lim_{T\to \infty }\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_{\varepsilon ,T}={\widehat{\mathbb{P}}}_{\varepsilon }$ exists as a process with stationary increments, and this limit was identified explicitly as a mixture of Gaussian processes. In the present article the strong coupling limit or the vanishing Kac parameter limit $\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_{\varepsilon }$ is investigated. It is shown that this limit exists and coincides with the increments of the so-called Pekar process, a stationary diffusion with generator $\frac{1}{2}\Delta +(\nabla \psi /\psi )\cdot \nabla $, where $\psi $ is the unique (up to spatial translations) maximizer of the Pekar variational problem \begin{equation*}g_{0}=\mathop{\mathrm{sup}}_{\Vert \psi \Vert _{2}=1}\biggl{\int _{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\int _{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\psi ^{2}(x)\psi ^{2}(y)\vert x-y\vert ^{-1}\,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y-\frac{1}{2}\Vert \nabla \psi \Vert _{2}^{2}\biggr}.\end{equation*} As the Pekar process was also earlier shown (Ann.

Math. 70 (2017) 1598–1629) to be the limiting object of the mean-field polaron measures, the present identification of the strong coupling limit is a rigorous justification of the mean-field approximation of the polaron problem (on the level of path measures) conjectured by Spohn in (Ann. Physics 175 (1987) 278–318). Replacing the Coulomb potential by continuous function vanishing at infinity and assuming uniqueness (modulo translations) of the relevant variational problem, our proof also shows that path measures coming from a Kac interaction of the above form with translation invariance in space converge to the increments of the corresponding mean-field model.},

  abstract     = {We study the algorithmic thresholds for principal component analysis of Gaussian $k$-tensors with a planted rank-one spike, via Langevin dynamics and gradient descent. In order to efficiently recover the spike from natural initializations, the signal-to-noise ratio must diverge in the dimension. Our proof shows that the mechanism for the success/failure of recovery is the strength of the “curvature” of the spike on the maximum entropy region of the initial data. To demonstrate this, we study the dynamics on a generalized family of high-dimensional landscapes with planted signals, containing the spiked tensor models as specific instances. We identify thresholds of signal-to-noise ratios above which order 1 time recovery succeeds; in the case of the spiked tensor model, these match the thresholds conjectured for algorithms such as approximate message passing. Below these thresholds, where the curvature of the signal on the maximal entropy region is weak, we show that recovery from certain natural initializations takes at least stretched exponential time. Our approach combines global regularity estimates for spin glasses with pointwise estimates to study the recovery problem by a perturbative approach.},

Assuming that the environment is invariant under space-time shifts and fulfills a mild mixing hypothesis, we establish a law of large numbers and a concentration inequality around the asymptotic speed. The mixing hypothesis imposes a polynomial decay rate of covariances on the environment with sufficiently high exponent but does not impose uniform mixing. Examples of environments for which our methods apply include the contact process and Markovian environments with a positive spectral gap, such as the East model. For the East model, we also obtain that the distinguished zero satisfies a law of large numbers with strictly positive speed.},

We show how to relate these scaling limits to a stationary distribution of a natural coalescent-type Markov process on a state space of abstract graphs with real-valued edge weights. This Markov process can be interpreted as a renormalization flow. This provides a model for which one can rigorously implement the formalism proposed by the third author in order to relate the law of the scaling limit of a critical model to a stationary distribution of such a renormalization/Markov process. When starting from any two-dimensional lattice with constant edge weights, the Markov process does indeed converge in law to this stationary distribution that corresponds to a scaling limit of UST with Poissonian deletions. The results of this paper heavily build on the convergence in distribution of branches of the UST to $\mathrm{SLE}_{2}$ (a result by Lawler, Schramm and Werner) as well as on the convergence of the suitably renormalized length of the loop-erased random walk to the “natural parametrization” of the $\mathrm{SLE}_{2}$ (a recent result by Lawler and Viklund).},

We introduce a more general model: the replacement rule depends on the colour of the drawn ball and the value of the time ($\operatorname{mod}p$). We extend the work of Flajolet et al. on Pólya urns: the generating function encoding the evolution of the urn is studied by methods of analytic combinatorics. We show that the initial partial differential equations lead to ordinary linear differential equations which are related to hypergeometric functions (giving the exact state of the urns at time $n$). When the time goes to infinity, we prove that these periodic Pólya urns have asymptotic fluctuations which are described by a product of generalized gamma distributions. With the additional help of what we call the density method (a method which offers access to enumeration and random generation of poset structures), we prove that the law of the southeast corner of a triangular Young tableau follows asymptotically a product of generalized gamma distributions. This allows us to tackle some questions related to the continuous limit of random Young tableaux and links with random surfaces.},

This formula is the simplest instance of dimensional reduction, discovered in the physics literature by Parisi and Sourlas (Phys. Rev. Lett. 43 (1979) 744–745), which links the law of an elliptic SPDE in $d+2$ dimension with a Gibbs measure in $d$ dimensions. This phenomenon is similar to the relation between a $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ dimensional parabolic SPDE and its $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ dimensional invariant measure. As such, dimensional reduction of elliptic SPDEs can be considered a sort of elliptic stochastic quantisation procedure in the sense of Nelson (Phys. Rev. 150 (1966) 1079–1085) and Parisi and Wu (Sci. Sin. 24 (1981) 483–496). Our proof uses in a fundamental way the representation of the law of the SPDE as a supersymmetric quantum field theory. Dimensional reduction for the supersymmetric theory was already established by Klein et al. (Comm. Math. Phys. 94 (1984) 459–482). We fix a subtle gap in their proof and also complete the dimensional reduction picture by providing the link between the elliptic SPDE and the supersymmetric model. Even in our $d=0$ context the arguments are nontrivial and a nonsupersymmetric, elementary proof seems only to be available in the Gaussian case.},

Let $\mu=\lim_{n}c_{n}^{1/n}$ denote the connective constant of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. In 1962, Hammersley and Welsh (Quart. J. Math. Oxford Ser. (2) 13 (1962) 108–110) proved that, for each $d\geq2$, there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ such that $c_{n}\leq\exp(Cn^{1/2})\mu^{n}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. While it is anticipated that $c_{n}\mu^{-n}$ has a power-law growth in $n$, the best-known upper bound in dimension two has remained of the form $n^{1/2}$ inside the exponential. The natural first improvement to demand for a given planar lattice is a bound of the form $c_{n}\leq\exp(Cn^{1/2-\varepsilon})\mu^{n}$, where $\mu$ denotes the connective constant of the lattice in question. We derive a bound of this form for two such lattices, for an explicit choice of $\varepsilon&gt;0$ in each case. For the hexagonal lattice $\mathbb{H}$, the bound is proved for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$; while for the Euclidean lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, it is proved for a set of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ of limit supremum density equal to one. A power-law upper bound on $c_{n}\mu^{-n}$ for $\mathbb{H}$ is also proved, contingent on a nonquantitative assertion concerning this lattice’s connective constant.},

In fact, they showed that the latter is a general phenomenon in that a phase transition presents an obstruction for being ffiid. The question remained whether this is the only such obstruction. We make progress on this, showing that certain spatial mixing conditions (notions of weak dependence on boundary conditions, not to be confused with other notions of mixing in ergodic theory) imply ffiid. Our main result is that weak spatial mixing implies ffiid with power-law tails for the coding radius, and that strong spatial mixing implies ffiid with exponential tails for the coding radius. The weak spatial mixing condition can be relaxed to a condition which is satisfied by some critical two-dimensional models. Using a result of the author (Spinka (2018)), we deduce that strong spatial mixing also implies ffiid with stretched-exponential tails from a finite-valued i.i.d. process. We give several applications to models such as the Potts model, proper colorings, the hard-core model, the Widom–Rowlinson model and the beach model. For instance, for the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ at inverse temperature $\beta $, we show that it is ffiid with exponential tails if $\beta $ is sufficiently small, it is ffiid if $\beta \beta_{c}(q,d)$ and, when $d=2$ and $\beta =\beta _{c}(q,d)$, it is ffiid if and only if $q\le 4$.},

In contrast to the previous research, we (i) consider very general driving processes and interaction functions, (ii) allow for inhomogeneous connection structures and (iii) analyze a game in which the particles determine their connections strategically. Hereby, we uncover two completely new phenomena. First, we characterize the “times of fragility” of such systems (e.g., the times when a macroscopic part of the population defaults or gets infected simultaneously, or when the neuron cells “synchronize”) explicitly in terms of the dynamics of the driving processes, the current distribution of the particles’ values and the topology of the underlying network (represented by its Perron–Frobenius eigenvalue). Second, we use such systems to describe a dynamic credit-network game and show that, in equilibrium, the system regularizes, that is, the times of fragility never occur, as the particles avoid them by adjusting their connections strategically. Two auxiliary mathematical results, useful in their own right, are uncovered during our investigation: a generalization of Schauder’s fixed-point theorem for the Skorokhod space with the M1 topology, and the application of max-plus algebra to the equilibrium version of the network flow problem.},

  abstract     = {We study the adjacency graph of bubbles, that is, complementary connected components of a $\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa }$ curve for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, with two such bubbles considered to be adjacent if their boundaries intersect. We show that this adjacency graph is a.s. connected for $\kappa \in (4,\kappa _{0}]$, where $\kappa _{0}\approx 5.6158$ is defined explicitly. This gives a partial answer to a problem posed by Duplantier, Miller and Sheffield (2014). Our proof in fact yields a stronger connectivity result for $\kappa \in (4,\kappa _{0}]$, which says that there is a Markovian way of finding a path from any fixed bubble to $\infty$. We also show that there is a (nonexplicit) $\kappa _{1}\in (\kappa _{0},8)$ such that this stronger condition does not hold for $\kappa \in [\kappa _{1},8)$. Our proofs are based on an encoding of $\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa }$ in terms of a pair of independent $\kappa /4$-stable processes, which allows us to reduce our problem to a problem about stable processes. In fact, due to this encoding, our results can be rephrased as statements about the connectivity of the adjacency graph of loops when one glues together an independent pair of so-called $\kappa /4$-stable looptrees, as studied, for example, by Curien and Kortchemski (2014). The above encoding comes from the theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), but the paper can be read without any knowledge of LQG if one takes the encoding as a black box.},

When a spatial point is fixed and time tends to infinity, we show that the solution develops unusually high peaks over short time intervals, even in the case of additive noise, which leads to a breakdown of an intuitively expected strong law of large numbers. More precisely, if we normalize the solution by an increasing nonnegative function, we either obtain convergence to $0$, or the limit superior and/or inferior will be infinite. A detailed analysis of the jumps further reveals that the strong law of large numbers can be recovered on discrete sequences of time points increasing to infinity. This leads to a necessary and sufficient condition that depends on the Lévy measure of the noise and the growth and concentration properties of the sequence at the same time. Finally, we show that our results generalize to the stochastic heat equation with a multiplicative nonlinearity that is bounded away from zero and infinity.},

This is satisfied by the Rademacher law and the uniform law on $[-\sqrt{3},\sqrt{3}]$. We extend our result to complex entries Wigner matrices and Wishart matrices.},

This generalizes an earlier result of Tao and the third author for the case $M=1$. We also prove Gaussian limits for the centered linear spectral statistics of products of $M$ independent i.i.d. random matrices. This is done in two steps. First, we establish the result for product random matrices with Gaussian entries, and then extend to the general case of non-Gaussian entries by another moment matching argument. Prior to our result, Gaussian limits were known only for the case $M=1$. In a similar fashion, we establish Gaussian limits for the centered linear spectral statistics of products of independent truncated random unitary matrices. In both cases, we are able to obtain explicit expressions for the limiting variances. The main difficulty in our study is that the entries of the product matrix are no longer independent. Our key technical lemma is a lower bound on the least singular value of the translated linearization matrix associated with the product of $M$ normalized independent random matrices with independent and identically distributed sub-Gaussian entries. This lemma is of independent interest.},

We derive asymptotic large deviation upper bounds on the probability that the local averages of the occupation times deviate from a specific function depending on the harmonic potential of $A$, when disconnection occurs. If certain critical levels coincide, which is plausible but open at the moment, these bounds imply that conditionally on disconnection, the occupation-time profile undergoes an entropic push governed by a specific function depending on $A$. Similar entropic repulsion phenomena conditioned on disconnection by level-sets of the discrete Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\geq 3$, have been obtained by the authors in (Chiarini and Nitzschner (2018)).

  abstract     = {In his seminal work from the 1950s, William Feller classified all one-dimensional diffusions on $-\infty \leq a&lt;b\leq \infty $ in terms of their ability to access the boundary (Feller’s test for explosions) and to enter the interior from the boundary. Feller’s technique is restricted to diffusion processes as the corresponding differential generators allow explicit computations and the use of Hille–Yosida theory. In the present article, we study exit and entrance from infinity for the most natural generalization, that is, jump diffusions of the form \begin{equation*}dZ_{t}=\sigma (Z_{t-})\,dX_{t},\end{equation*} driven by stable Lévy processes for $\alpha \in (0,2)$. Many results have been proved for jump diffusions, employing a variety of techniques developed after Feller’s work but exit and entrance from infinite boundaries has long remained open. We show that the presence of jumps implies features not seen in the diffusive setting without drift. Finite time explosion is possible for $\alpha \in (0,1)$, whereas entrance from different kinds of infinity is possible for $\alpha \in [1,2)$. Accordingly, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions on $\sigma $. Our proofs are based on very recent developments for path transformations of stable processes via the Lamperti–Kiu representation and new Wiener–Hopf factorisations for Lévy processes that lie therein. The arguments draw together original and intricate applications of results using the Riesz–Bogdan–Żak transformation, entrance laws for self-similar Markov processes, perpetual integrals of Lévy processes and fluctuation theory, which have not been used before in the SDE setting, thereby allowing us to employ classical theory such as Hunt–Nagasawa duality and Getoor’s characterisation of transience and recurrence.},

  abstract     = {A hypergraph $(V,E)$ is called an interval hypergraph if there exists a linear order $l$ on $V$ such that every edge $e\in E$ is an interval w.r.t. $l$; we also assume that ${j}\in E$ for every $j\in V$. Our main result is a de Finetti-type representation of random exchangeable interval hypergraphs on $\mathbb{N}$ (EIHs): the law of every EIH can be obtained by sampling from some random compact subset $K$ of the triangle ${(x,y):0\leq x\leq y\leq1}$ at i.i.d. uniform positions $U_{1},U_{2},\dots$, in the sense that, restricted to the node set $[n]:={1,\dots,n}$ every nonsingleton edge is of the form $e={i\in[n]:x&lt;U_{i}&lt;y}$ for some $(x,y)\in K$. We obtain this result via the study of a related class of stochastic objects: erased-interval processes (EIPs). These are certain transient Markov chains $(I_{n},\eta_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $I_{n}$ is an interval hypergraph on $V=[n]$ w.r.t. the usual linear order (called interval system). We present an almost sure representation result for EIPs. Attached to each transient Markov chain is the notion of Martin boundary. The points in the boundary of EIPs can be seen as limits of growing interval systems. We obtain a one-to-one correspondence between these limits and compact subsets $K$ of the triangle with $(x,x)\in K$ for all $x\in[0,1]$. Interval hypergraphs are a generalizations of hierarchies and as a consequence we obtain a representation result for exchangeable hierarchies, which is close to a result of Forman, Haulk and Pitman in (Probab. Theory Related Fields 172 (2018) 1–29). Several ordered discrete structures can be seen as interval systems with additional properties, that is, Schröder trees (rooted, ordered, no node has outdegree one) or even more special: binary trees. We describe limits of Schröder trees as certain tree-like compact sets. These can be seen as an ordered counterpart to real trees, which are widely used to describe limits of discrete unordered trees. Considering binary trees, we thus obtain a homeomorphic description of the Martin boundary of Rémy’s tree growth chain, which has been analyzed by Evans, Grübel and Wakolbinger in (Ann. Probab. 45 (2017) 225–277).},

We showed in previous work that if the noise is mollified in space on scale $\varepsilon $ and its strength is scaled as $\hat{\beta }/\sqrt{|\log \varepsilon |}$, then a transition occurs with explicit critical point $\hat{\beta }_{c}=\sqrt{2\pi }$. Recently Chatterjee and Dunlap showed that the solution admits subsequential scaling limits as $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$, for sufficiently small $\hat{\beta }$. We prove here that the limit exists in the entire subcritical regime $\hat{\beta }\in (0,\hat{\beta }_{c})$ and we identify it as the solution of an additive stochastic heat equation, establishing so-called Edwards–Wilkinson fluctuations. The same result holds for the directed polymer model in random environment in space dimension $2$.},

  abstract     = {Consider a negatively drifted one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at positive initial position, its first hitting time to 0 has the inverse Gaussian law. Moreover, conditionally on this hitting time, the Brownian motion up to that time has the law of a three-dimensional Bessel bridge. In this paper, we give a generalization of this result to a family of Brownian motions with interacting drifts, indexed by the vertices of a conductance network. The hitting times are equal in law to the inverse of a random potential that appears in the analysis of a self-interacting process called the vertex reinforced jump process (Ann. Probab. 45 (2017) 3967–3986; J. Amer. Math. Soc. 32 (2019) 311–349). These Brownian motions with interacting drifts have remarkable properties with respect to restriction and conditioning, showing hidden Markov properties. This family of processes are closely related to the martingale that plays a crucial role in the analysis of the vertex reinforced jump process and edge reinforced random walk (J. Amer. Math. Soc. 32 (2019) 311–349) on infinite graphs.},

  abstract     = {The $(d+1)$-dimensional KPZ equation is the canonical model for the growth of rough $d$-dimensional random surfaces. A deep mathematical understanding of the KPZ equation for $d=1$ has been achieved in recent years, and the case $d\ge 3$ has also seen some progress. The most physically relevant case of $d=2$, however, is not very well understood mathematically, largely due to the renormalization that is required: in the language of renormalization group analysis, the $d=2$ case is neither ultraviolet superrenormalizable like the $d=1$ case nor infrared superrenormalizable like the $d\ge 3$ case. Moreover, unlike in $d=1$, the Cole–Hopf transform is not directly usable in $d=2$ because solutions to the multiplicative stochastic heat equation are distributions rather than functions. In this article, we show the existence of subsequential scaling limits as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of Cole–Hopf solutions of the $(2+1)$-dimensional KPZ equation with white noise mollified to spatial scale $\varepsilon $ and nonlinearity multiplied by the vanishing factor $|\log \varepsilon |^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. We also show that the scaling limits obtained in this way do not coincide with solutions to the linearized equation, meaning that the nonlinearity has a nonvanishing effect. We thus propose our scaling limit as a notion of KPZ evolution in $2+1$ dimensions.},

We prove that there is a crossover in the behavior of the extreme eigenvalues at $p\sim N^{-2/3}$. In the case that $N^{-7/9}\ll p\ll N^{-2/3}$, we prove that the extreme eigenvalues have asymptotically Gaussian fluctuations. Under a mean zero condition and when $p=CN^{-2/3}$, we find that the fluctuations of the extreme eigenvalues are given by a combination of the Gaussian and the Tracy–Widom distribution. These results show that the eigenvalues at the edge of the spectrum of sparse Erdős–Rényi graphs are less rigid than those of random $d$-regular graphs (Bauerschmidt et al.

The idea to perform this computation is to introduce certain auxiliary functions resembling holomorphic observables of conformal field theory that will be solutions of hypergeometric equations. Solving these equations then provides nontrivial relations that completely determine the moments we wish to compute. We also include a detailed discussion of the so-called reflection coefficients appearing in tail expansions of GMC measures and in Liouville theory. Our theorem provides an exact value for one of these coefficients.

  abstract     = {Probabilistic models of directed polymers in random environment have received considerable attention in recent years. Much of this attention has focused on integrable models. In this paper, we introduce some new computational tools that do not require integrability. We begin by defining a new kind of abstract limit object, called “partitioned subprobability measure,” to describe the limits of endpoint distributions of directed polymers. Inspired by a recent work of Mukherjee and Varadhan on large deviations of the occupation measure of Brownian motion, we define a suitable topology on the space of partitioned subprobability measures and prove that this topology is compact. Then using a variant of the cavity method from the theory of spin glasses, we show that any limit law of a sequence of endpoint distributions must satisfy a fixed point equation on this abstract space, and that the limiting free energy of the model can be expressed as the solution of a variational problem over the set of fixed points. As a first application of the theory, we prove that in an environment with finite exponential moment, the endpoint distribution is asymptotically purely atomic if and only if the system is in the low temperature phase. The analogous result for a heavy-tailed environment was proved by Vargas in 2007. As a second application, we prove a subsequential version of the longstanding conjecture that in the low temperature phase, the endpoint distribution is asymptotically localized in a region of stochastically bounded diameter. All our results hold in arbitrary dimensions, and make no use of integrability.},

Our proof uses the path coupling technique of Bubley and Dyer, and the analysis of a suitable hydrodynamic limit.

We consider initial points $x$ lying in a set of positive distance from the origin. We show that there exist constants $C^{*},c^{*}&gt;0$ not depending on $n$, such that if $F&gt;C^{*}n$ then the image of the initial set under the flow has probability 0 of hitting the origin. If $0\leq F\leq c^{*}n^{3/4}$, and if the initial set has a nonempty interior, then the image of the set has positive probability of hitting the origin.},

We study the maximal flow between a compact convex subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and infinity. The study of maximal flow is associated with the study of sets of edges of minimal capacity that cut $A$ from infinity. We prove that the rescaled maximal flow between $nA$ and infinity $\phi (nA)/n^{d-1}$ almost surely converges toward a deterministic constant depending on $A$. This constant corresponds to the capacity of the boundary $\partial A$ of $A$ and is the integral of a deterministic function over $\partial A$.

The model is conditioned on the rare event that the number of edges observed, $|E|$, is greater than $(1+\delta )\mathbb{E}(|E|)$, for some fixed $\delta &gt;0$. This article proves that upon conditioning, with high probability there exists a ball of diameter $r_{n}$ which contains a clique of at least $\sqrt{2\delta \mathbb{E}(|E|)}(1-\varepsilon )$ vertices, for any given $\varepsilon &gt;0$. Intuitively, this region contains all the “excess” edges the graph is forced to contain by the conditioning event, up to lower order corrections. As a consequence of this result, we prove a large deviations principle for the upper tail of the edge count of the random geometric graph. The rate function of this large deviation principle turns out to be nonconvex.},

We prove a KPZ-type formula which relates the Hausdorff dimension of any Borel subset $A$ of the range of $\eta $, which can be defined as a function of $\eta $ (modulo time parameterization) to the Hausdorff dimension of the corresponding time set $\eta^{-1}(A)$. This result serves to reduce the problem of computing the Hausdorff dimension of any set associated with an $\mathrm{SLE}$, $\mathrm{CLE}$ or related processes in the interior of a domain to the problem of computing the Hausdorff dimension of a certain set associated with a Brownian motion. For many natural examples, the associated Brownian motion set is well known. As corollaries, we obtain new proofs of the Hausdorff dimensions of the $\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa}$ curve for $\kappa \neq4$; the double points and cut points of $\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa }$ for $\kappa &gt;4$; and the intersection of two flow lines of a Gaussian free field. We obtain the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $m$-tuple points of space-filling $\mathrm{SLE}_{\kappa }$ for $\kappa &gt;4$ and $m\geq 3$ by computing the Hausdorff dimension of the so-called $(m-2)$-tuple $\pi /2$-cone times of a correlated planar Brownian motion.},

We investigate the general question of deriving fine (asymptotic) estimates for the probability that $\Omega_{\mathbf{p}}$ is an independent set in $\Gamma $, which is an omnipresent problem in probabilistic combinatorics. Our main result provides a sequence of upper and lower bounds on this probability, each of which can be evaluated explicitly in terms of the joint cumulants of small sets of edge indicator random variables. Under certain natural conditions, these upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically, thus giving the precise asymptotics of the probability in question. We demonstrate the applicability of our results with two concrete examples: subgraph containment in random (hyper)graphs and arithmetic progressions in random subsets of the integers.},

(ii) The Markov chain is geometrically ergodic in $L_{\infty}^{v,1}$: There is a unique invariant probability measure $\pi$ and constants $B0$ such that, for each $f\in L_{\infty}^{v,1}$, any initial condition $X(0)=x$, and all $t\geq0$: \begin{eqnarray*}\vert \mathsf{E}_{x}[f(X(t))]-\pi(f)\vert &amp;\le&amp;B\Vert f\Vert_{v,1}e^{-\delta t}v(x),\\\Vert \nabla\mathsf{E}_{x}[f(X(t))]\Vert_{2}&amp;\le&amp;B\Vert f\Vert_{v,1}e^{-\delta t}v(x),\end{eqnarray*} where $\pi(f)=\int f\,d\pi$.

  abstract     = {Kinetically constrained models (KCM) are a class of interacting particle systems which represent a natural stochastic (and nonmonotone) counterpart of the family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap percolation. A key issue for KCM is to identify the divergence of the characteristic time scales when the equilibrium density of empty sites, $q$, goes to zero. In (Ann. Probab. 47 (2019) 324–361; Comm. Math. Phys. 369 (2019) 761–809), a general scheme was devised to determine a sharp upper bound for these time scales. Our paper is devoted to developing a (very different) technique which allows to prove matching lower bounds. We analyse the class of two-dimensional supercritical rooted KCM and the Duarte KCM. We prove that the relaxation time and the mean infection time diverge for supercritical rooted KCM as $e^{\Theta ((\log q)^{2})}$ and for Duarte KCM as $e^{\Theta ((\log q)^{4}/q^{2})}$ when $q\downarrow 0$. These results prove the conjectures put forward in (European J. Combin. 66 (2017) 250–263; Comm. Math. Phys. 369 (2019) 761–809) for these models, and establish that the time scales for these KCM diverge much faster than for the corresponding $\mathcal{U}$-bootstrap processes, the main reason being the occurrence of energy barriers which determine the dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the bootstrap dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We study a sequence of symmetric $n$-player stochastic differential games driven by both idiosyncratic and common sources of noise, in which players interact with each other through their empirical distribution. The unique Nash equilibrium empirical measure of the $n$-player game is known to converge, as $n$ goes to infinity, to the unique equilibrium of an associated mean field game. Under suitable regularity conditions, in the absence of common noise, we complement this law of large numbers result with nonasymptotic concentration bounds for the Wasserstein distance between the $n$-player Nash equilibrium empirical measure and the mean field equilibrium. We also show that the sequence of Nash equilibrium empirical measures satisfies a weak large deviation principle, which can be strengthened to a full large deviation principle only in the absence of common noise. For both sets of results, we first use the master equation, an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation that characterizes the value function of the mean field game, to construct an associated McKean–Vlasov interacting $n$-particle system that is exponentially close to the Nash equilibrium dynamics of the $n$-player game for large $n$, by refining estimates obtained in our companion paper. Then we establish a weak large deviation principle for McKean–Vlasov systems in the presence of common noise. In the absence of common noise, we upgrade this to a full large deviation principle and obtain new concentration estimates for McKean–Vlasov systems. Finally, in two specific examples that do not satisfy the assumptions of our main theorems, we show how to adapt our methodology to establish large deviations and concentration results.},

  abstract     = {Let $Y=(Y(t))_{t\geq 0}$ be a zero-mean Gaussian stationary process with covariance function $\rho :\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\rho (0)=1$. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a square-integrable function with respect to the standard Gaussian measure, and suppose the Hermite rank of $f$ is $d\geq 1$. If $\int_{\mathbb{R}}|\rho (s)|^{d}\,ds&lt;\infty $, then the celebrated Breuer–Major theorem (in its continuous version) asserts that the finite-dimensional distributions of $Z_{\varepsilon }:=\sqrt{\varepsilon }\int_{0}^{\cdot /\varepsilon }f(Y(s))\,ds$ converge to those of $\sigma W$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$, where $W$ is a standard Brownian motion and $\sigma $ is some explicit constant. Since its first appearance in 1983, this theorem has become a crucial probabilistic tool in different areas, for instance in signal processing or in statistical inference for fractional Gaussian processes. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate the tightness in the Breuer–Major theorem. Surprisingly, this problem did not receive a lot of attention until now, and the best available condition due to Ben Hariz [J. Multivariate Anal. 80 (2002) 191–216] is neither arguably very natural, nor easy-to-check in practice. In contrast, our condition very simple, as it only requires that $|f|^{p}$ must be integrable with respect to the standard Gaussian measure for some $p$ strictly bigger than 2. It is obtained by means of the Malliavin calculus, in particular Meyer inequalities. Second, and motivated by a problem of geometrical nature, we extend the continuous Breuer–Major theorem to the notoriously difficult case of self-similar Gaussian processes which are not necessarily stationary. An application to the fluctuations associated with the length process of a regularized version of the bifractional Brownian motion concludes the paper.},

  abstract     = {We consider branching random walk in spatial random branching environment (BRWRE) in dimension one, as well as related differential equations: the Fisher–KPP equation with random branching and its linearized version, the parabolic Anderson model (PAM). When the random environment is bounded, we show that after recentering and scaling, the position of the maximal particle of the BRWRE, the front of the solution of the PAM, as well as the front of the solution of the randomized Fisher–KPP equation fulfill quenched invariance principles. In addition, we prove that at time $t$ the distance between the median of the maximal particle of the BRWRE and the front of the solution of the PAM is in $O(\ln t)$. This partially transfers classical results of Bramson (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 31 (1978) 531–581) to the setting of BRWRE.},

  abstract     = {We develop a perturbation theory for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) by which we mean both stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). In particular, we estimate the $L^{p}$-distance between the solution process of an SDE and an arbitrary Itô process, which we view as a perturbation of the solution process of the SDE, by the $L^{q}$-distances of the differences of the local characteristics for suitable $p,q&gt;0$. As one application of the developed perturbation theory, we establish strong convergence rates for numerical approximations of a class of SODEs with nonglobally monotone coefficients. As another application of the developed perturbation theory, we prove strong convergence rates for spatial spectral Galerkin approximations of solutions of semilinear SPDEs with nonglobally monotone nonlinearities including Cahn–Hilliard–Cook-type equations and stochastic Burgers equations. Further applications of the developed perturbation theory include regularity analyses of solutions of SDEs with respect to their initial values as well as small-noise analyses for ordinary and partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {We show that the winding of the branches in a uniform spanning tree on a planar graph converge in the limit of fine mesh size to a Gaussian free field. The result holds assuming only convergence of simple random walk to Brownian motion and a Russo–Seymour–Welsh type crossing estimate, thereby establishing a strong form of universality. As an application, we prove universality of the fluctuations of the height function associated to the dimer model, in several situations. The proof relies on a connection to imaginary geometry, where the scaling limit of a uniform spanning tree is viewed as a set of flow lines associated to a Gaussian free field. In particular, we obtain an explicit construction of the a.s. unique Gaussian free field coupled to a continuum uniform spanning tree in this way, which is of independent interest.},
