  abstract     = {Essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and weighted ENO (WENO) schemes were designed for solving hyperbolic and convection–diffusion equations with possibly discontinuous solutions or solutions with sharp gradient regions. The main idea of ENO and WENO schemes is actually an approximation procedure, aimed at achieving arbitrarily high-order accuracy in smooth regions and resolving shocks or other discontinuities sharply and in an essentially non-oscillatory fashion. Both finite volume and finite difference schemes have been designed using the ENO or WENO procedure, and these schemes are very popular in applications, most noticeably in computational fluid dynamics but also in other areas of computational physics and engineering. Since the main idea of the ENO and WENO schemes is an approximation procedure not directly related to partial differential equations (PDEs), ENO and WENO schemes also have non-PDE applications. In this paper we will survey the basic ideas behind ENO and WENO schemes, discuss their properties, and present examples of their applications to different types of PDEs as well as to non-PDE problems.},

  abstract     = {We review recent advances in algorithms for quadrature, transforms, differential equations and singular integral equations using orthogonal polynomials. Quadrature based on asymptotics has facilitated optimal complexity quadrature rules, allowing for efficient computation of quadrature rules with millions of nodes. Transforms based on rank structures in change-of-basis operators allow for quasi-optimal complexity, including in multivariate settings such as on triangles and for spherical harmonics. Ordinary and partial differential equations can be solved via sparse linear algebra when set up using orthogonal polynomials as a basis, provided that care is taken with the weights of orthogonality. A similar idea, together with low-rank approximation, gives an efficient method for solving singular integral equations. These techniques can be combined to produce high-performance codes for a wide range of problems that appear in applications.},

It poses the combined computational challenges of high oscillations and high dimensions. This paper reviews and studies numerical approaches that are robust to the small semiclassical parameter. We present and analyse variationally evolving Gaussian wave packets, Hagedorn’s semiclassical wave packets, continuous superpositions of both thawed and frozen Gaussians, and Wigner function approaches to the direct computation of expectation values of observables. Making good use of classical mechanics is essential for all these approaches. The arising aspects of time integration and high-dimensional quadrature are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Phase retrieval, i.e. the problem of recovering a function from the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform, arises in many applications, such as X-ray crystallography, diffraction imaging, optics, quantum mechanics and astronomy. This problem has confounded engineers, physicists, and mathematicians for many decades. Recently, phase retrieval has seen a resurgence in research activity, ignited by new imaging modalities and novel mathematical concepts. As our scientific experiments produce larger and larger datasets and we aim for faster and faster throughput, it is becoming increasingly important to study the involved numerical algorithms in a systematic and principled manner. Indeed, the past decade has witnessed a surge in the systematic study of computational algorithms for phase retrieval. In this paper we will review these recent advances from a numerical viewpoint.},

  abstract     = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are used with huge success to model phenomena across all scientific and engineering disciplines. However, across an equally wide swath, there exist situations in which PDEs fail to adequately model observed phenomena, or are not the best available model for that purpose. On the other hand, in many situations, nonlocal models that account for interaction occurring at a distance have been shown to more faithfully and effectively model observed phenomena that involve possible singularities and other anomalies. In this article we consider a generic nonlocal model, beginning with a short review of its definition, the properties of its solution, its mathematical analysis and of specific concrete examples. We then provide extensive discussions about numerical methods, including finite element, finite difference and spectral methods, for determining approximate solutions of the nonlocal models considered. In that discussion, we pay particular attention to a special class of nonlocal models that are the most widely studied in the literature, namely those involving fractional derivatives. The article ends with brief considerations of several modelling and algorithmic extensions, which serve to show the wide applicability of nonlocal modelling.},
