In this short paper we consider the quantitative version of Lovász’s criterion. That is, we ask how many pairs of edges intersecting at a single vertex should belong to a non-2-colourable ; -uniform hypergraph. Our main result is an ; answer to this question, which further characterizes all the extremal hypergraphs. The proof combines Bollobás’s two families theorem with Pluhar’s randomized colouring algorithm.},

In this paper we investigate Ramsey questions in the setting of ; . This is a random graph model introduced by Bohman, Frieze and Martin [8] in which one starts with a dense graph and then adds a given number of random edges to it. The study of Ramsey properties of randomly perturbed graphs was initiated by Krivelevich, Sudakov and Tetali [30] in 2006; they determined how many random edges must be added to a dense graph to ensure the resulting graph is with high probability (; , ; ) -Ramsey (for ; ≽ 3). They also raised the question of generalizing this result to pairs of graphs other than (; , ; ). We make significant progress on this question, giving a precise solution in the case when ; = ; and ; = ; where ; , ; ≽ 5. Although we again show that one requires polynomially fewer edges than in the purely random graph, our result shows that the problem in this case is quite different to the (; , ; ) -Ramsey question. Moreover, we give bounds for the corresponding (; , ; ) -Ramsey question; together with a construction of Powierski [37] this resolves the (; , ; ) -Ramsey problem.; We also give a precise solution to the analogous question in the case when both ; = ; and ; = ; are cycles. Additionally we consider the corresponding multicolour problem. Our final result gives another generalization of the Krivelevich, Sudakov and Tetali [30] result. Specifically, we determine how many random edges must be added to a dense graph to ensure the resulting graph is with high probability (; , ; ) -Ramsey (for odd ; ≽ 5 and ; ≽ 4).; To prove our results we combine a mixture of approaches, employing the container method, the regularity method as well as dependent random choice, and apply robust extensions of recent asymmetric random Ramsey results.},

We consider a biased version of the chain, where we are more likely to add a cube than to remove it, thereby favouring surfaces that are ‘higher’ or have more cubes below it. We prove that the chain is rapidly mixing for any uniform bias in ℤ; and for bias λ &gt; ; in ℤ; when ;  &gt; 2. In ℤ; we match the optimal mixing time achieved by Benjamini, Berger, Hoffman and Mossel in the context of biased card shuffling [2], but using much simpler arguments.

It is known that the required minimum degree condition is approximately best possible for this result.; For ; = 3 this result was obtained by Łuczak (2006) and, more recently, Goddard and Lyle (2011) deduced the general case from Łuczak’s result. Łuczak’s proof was based on an application of Szemerédi’s regularity lemma and, as a consequence, it only gave rise to a tower-type bound on ; (3, ; ). The proof presented here replaces the application of the regularity lemma by a probabilistic argument, which yields a bound for ; (; , ; ) that is doubly exponential in poly(; ).},

The spatial mixing requirement is that for a pair of vertices the correlation between their corresponding configurations becomes weaker with their distance.; Furthermore, our approach generalizes in that it allows us to compute the Gibbs marginals for small sets of nearby vertices.

In particular, we study the class of Markov chains whose transition kernel is in the similarity orbit of a normal transition kernel, such as that of birth–death chains or reversible Markov chains. We start by identifying a set of sufficient conditions for a Markov chain to belong to the similarity orbit of a birth–death chain. As by-products, we obtain a spectral representation in terms of non-self-adjoint resolutions of identity in the sense of Dunford [21] and offer a detailed analysis on the convergence rate, separation cutoff and L; -cutoff of this class of non-reversible Markov chains. We also look into the problem of estimating the integral functionals from discrete observations for this class. In the last part of this paper we investigate a particular similarity orbit of reversible Markov kernels, which we call the pure birth orbit, and analyse various possibly non-reversible variants of classical birth–death processes in this orbit.},

The case of a regular tree was previously considered by Pearl, who showed that as ; → ∞ the value of the game converges to a constant, and by Ali Khan, Devroye and Neininger, who obtained a distributional limit under a suitable rescaling.; For a general offspring distribution, there is a surprisingly rich variety of behaviour: the (unrescaled) value of the game may converge to a constant, or to a discrete limit with several atoms, or to a continuous distribution. We also give distributional limits under suitable rescalings in various cases.; We also address questions of ; . Suppose the game is played on a tree with many levels, so that the terminal values are far from the root. To be confident of playing a good first move, do we need to see the whole tree and its terminal values, or can we play close to optimally by inspecting just the first few levels of the tree? The answers again depend in an interesting way on the offspring distribution.; We also mention several open questions.},

  abstract     = {Random constraint satisfaction problems play an important role in computer science and combinatorics. For example, they provide challenging benchmark examples for algorithms, and they have been harnessed in probabilistic constructions of combinatorial structures with peculiar features. In an important contribution (Krzakala ; 2007, ; ), physicists made several predictions on the precise location and nature of phase transitions in random constraint satisfaction problems. Specifically, they predicted that their satisfiability thresholds are quite generally preceded by several other thresholds that have a substantial impact both combinatorially and computationally. These include the condensation phase transition, where long-range correlations between variables emerge, and the reconstruction threshold. In this paper we prove these physics predictions for a broad class of random constraint satisfaction problems. Additionally, we obtain contiguity results that have implications for Bayesian inference tasks, a subject that has received a great deal of interest recently (; Banks ; 2016, ; ).},

As a consequence, its support is almost surely totally disconnected, has Hausdorff dimension one, and enjoys self-similarity properties inherited from those of the Brownian excursion. The density function of the averaged permuton is computed and a connection with the shuffling of the Brownian continuum random tree is explored.},

Bollobás proposes that this is likely to hold for ; (; ) = log ; . We show that for the ; chromatic number, the answer to the analogous question is negative. In fact, there is a subsequence ; of the integers where ; is concentrated on exactly one explicitly known value. This constitutes surprisingly narrow concentration since in this range the equitable chromatic number, like the normal chromatic number, is rather large in absolute value, namely asymptotically equal to ; /(2log; ) where ; = 1/(1 − ; ).},

Among applications, we show, for example, that the main results of [20], which are on the maximum possible number of ; -cliques in an ; -vertex graph without a path with ℓ vertices (and without cycles of length at least ; ), can be easily deduced from this extension. Indeed, to prove these results, Luo [20] generalized a classical theorem of Kopylov and established a tight upper bound on the number of ; -cliques in an ; -vertex 2-connected graph with circumference less than ; . We prove a similar result for an ; -vertex 2-connected graph with circumference less than ; and large minimum degree.

  abstract     = {Given a graph ; and a bijection ; : ; (; ) → {1, 2,…,; (; )}, we say that a trail/path in ; is ; -; if the labels of consecutive edges of this trail/path form an increasing sequence. More than 40 years ago Chvátal and Komlós raised the question of providing worst-case estimates of the length of the longest increasing trail/path over all edge orderings of ; . The case of a trail was resolved by Graham and Kleitman, who proved that the answer is ; -1, and the case of a path is still wide open. Recently Lavrov and Loh proposed studying the average-case version of this problem, in which the edge ordering is chosen uniformly at random. They conjectured (and Martinsson later proved) that such an ordering with high probability (w.h.p.) contains an increasing Hamilton path.; In this paper we consider the random graph ; = ; with an edge ordering chosen uniformly at random. In this setting we determine w.h.p. the asymptotics of the number of edges in the longest increasing trail. In particular we prove an average-case version of the result of Graham and Kleitman, showing that the random edge ordering of ; has w.h.p. an increasing trail of length (1-; (1)); , and that this is tight. We also obtain an asymptotically tight result for the length of the longest increasing path for random Erdős-Renyi graphs with ; = ; (1).},

  abstract     = {In an earlier paper, the present authors (2015) introduced the ; of graphs and used Tucker’s lemma, an equivalent combinatorial version of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem, to prove that the altermatic number is a lower bound for chromatic number. A matching Kneser graph is a graph whose vertex set consists of all matchings of a specified size in a host graph and two vertices are adjacent if their corresponding matchings are edge-disjoint. Some well-known families of graphs such as Kneser graphs, Schrijver graphs and permutation graphs can be represented by matching Kneser graphs. In this paper, unifying and generalizing some earlier works by Lovász (1978) and Schrijver (1978), we determine the chromatic number of a large family of matching Kneser graphs by specifying their altermatic number. In particular, we determine the chromatic number of these matching Kneser graphs in terms of the generalized Turán number of matchings.},
