  abstract     = {Abstract Expert finding and expert profiling are two important tasks for organizations, researchers, and work seekers. This importance can also be seen in online communities especially with the explosion of social networks. Expert finding on one hand addresses the task of finding the right person with the appropriate knowledge or skills. Expert profiling on the other hand gives a concise and meaningful description of a candidate expert. This paper focuses on what social tagging can bring to improve expert finding and profiling. A novel expertise indicator that models and assesses an expert based on the expert&#39;s tagging activities is proposed. First, tags are used as interest indicator to build candidate&#39;s profiles; then, Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm (LDA) is used to construct the tags distribution over topics by exploiting the tag&#39;s semantic characteristics. Topics of interest are then filtered using tag&#39;s depth. The latter is finally used as the expertise indicator. Experiments performed on the stack overflow dataset show the accuracy of the proposed approach. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The growth of global patents increased over the last decade as enterprises and inventors sought greater protection of their intellectual property (IP) rights. Global patents represent state-of-the-art knowledge for given domains. This research develops a hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based approach as a computational intelligent method to discover topics and form a top-down ontology, a semantic schema, representing the collective patent knowledge. To validate the knowledge extraction, 1,546 smart retailing patents collected from the Derwent Innovation platform from 2011 and 2016 are used to build the domain ontology schema. The patent set focuses on in-use, globally established, and non-disputed IP covering payment, user experience, and information integration for smart retailing. The clustering and LDA-based ontology system automatically build the knowledge map, which identifies the technology trends and the technology gaps enabling the development of competitive R&amp;D and management strategies.

To enhance the IC with domain knowledge of the document, an automatic enhanced CM generation using word embedding based concept and relation representation along with organization using latent semantic structure is proposed. To improve the concept significance, precise identification of similar items, clustering topically associated concepts, and hierarchical clustering of semantically related concepts are carried out. This augments the IC of the CM with additional information and generates CM with concise and informative content. The joint word embedding based on various contexts is utilized to determine distributional features critical for these enhancements. Summarization of the ECM to visualize the document summary is used to illustrate its resourcefulness. The work is evaluated using ACL anthology, Genia, and CRAFT dataset, and the information gain is approximately three times more in comparison with general CM.

  abstract     = {Abstract With an increasing number of web users, the data traffic generated by these users generates tremendous network traffic which takes a long time to connect with the web server. The main reason is, the distance between the client making requests and the servers responding to those requests. The use of the CDN (content delivery network) is one of the strategies for minimizing latency. But, it incurs additional cost. Alternatively, web caching and preloading are the most viable approaches to this issue. It is therefore decided to introduce a novel web caching strategy called optimized popularity-aware modified least frequently used (PMLFU) policy for information retrieval based on users&#39; past access history and their trends analysis. It helps to enhance the proxy-driven web caching system by analyzing user access requests and caching the most popular web pages driven on their preferences. Experimental results show that the proposed systems can significantly reduce the user delay in accessing the web page. The performance of the proposed system is measured using IRCACHE data sets in real time. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

Sensors are crucial components of IoT that relay the collected data in the form of the data stream for further processing. Interoperability of various connected digital resources is a key challenge in IoT environments. The enrichment of raw sensor data with semantic annotations using concept definitions from ontologies enables more expressive data representation that supports knowledge discovery. In this paper, a systematic review of integration of semantics into sensor data for the IoT is provided. The conducted review is focused on analyzing the main solutions of adding semantic annotations to the sensor data, standards that enable all types of sensor data via the web, existing models of stream data annotation, and the IoT trend domains that use semantics.

Realizing the incorrect annotations of existing NER, four categories of false negatives have been identified. The NEs not annotated contain nationalities, have corresponding resource in DBpedia, are acronyms of other NEs. A rule-based system, CustNER, has been proposed that utilizes existing NERs and DBpedia knowledge base. CustNER has been trained on the open knowledge extraction (OKE) challenge 2017 dataset and evaluated on OKE and CoNLL03 (Conference on Natural Language Learning) datasets. The OKE dataset has also been annotated with the three types. Evaluation results show that CustNER outperforms existing NERs with F score 12.4% better than Stanford NER and 3.1% better than Illinois NER. On another standard evaluation dataset for which the system is not trained, the CoNLL03 dataset, CustNER gives results comparable to existing systems with F score 3.9% better than Stanford NER, though Illinois NER F score is 1.3% better than CustNER.

Predictive and descriptive analytics add interesting insights for significant aspects the education. The purpose of this article is to summarize a novel approach for the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques towards forecasting of academic performance. The added value of applying AI techniques for advanced decision making in education is the realization that the scientific approach to standard problems in academia, like the enhancement of academic performance is feasible. For the purpose of this research the authors promote a research in Saudi Arabia. The vision of the Knowledge Society in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a critical milestone towards digital transformation. The human capital and the integration of industry and academia has to be based on holistic approaches to skills and competencies management. One of the main objectives of an academic decision maker is to ensure that academic resources are adequately planned and that students are properly advised. To achieve such an objective, an extensive analysis of large volumes of data may be required. This research develops a decision support system (DSS) that is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) model that can be deployed for effective academic planning and advising. The system is based on evaluating academic metrics against academic performance for students. The model integrates inputs from relevant academic data sources into an autonomous ANN. A simulation of real data on an ANN is conducted to validate the system&#39;s accuracy. Moreover, an ANN is compared with different mathematical approaches. The system enables the quality assurance of planning, advising, and the monitoring of academic decisions. The overall contribution of this work is a novel approach to the deployment of Artificial Intelligent for advanced decision making in higher education.

It can be a part of traditional machine or equipment to daily household objects as well as wireless sensor networks and devices. IoT has a huge potential which is still to be unleashed. However, as the foundation of IoT is the Internet and all the data collected by these devices is over the Internet, these devices also face threats to security and privacy. At the physical or sensor layer of IoT devices the most commonly used technology is RFID. Thus, securing the RFID tag by cryptographic mechanisms can secure our data at the device as well as during communication. This article first discusses the flaws of our previous ultra-lightweight protocol due to its vulnerability to passive secret disclosure attack. Then, the authors propose a new protocol to overcome the shortcomings of our previous work. The proposed scheme uses timestamps in addition to bitwise operation to provide security against de-synchronization and disclosure. This research also presents a security and performance analysis of our approach and its comparison with other existing schemes.

They can interlink them, annotate them, and share them with other users, thus enabling collaborative editing, as well as enrich them with links to externally linked data resources. Resources are inherently modeled and published as resource description framework (RDF) and can be explicitly interlinked and dereferenced by external applications. LinkZoo supports creation of dynamic communities that enable web-based collaboration through resource sharing and annotating, exposing objects on the linked data Cloud under controlled vocabularies and permissions.

  abstract     = {Abstract Learning text representation is forming a core for numerous natural language processing applications. Word embedding is a type of text representation that allows words with similar meaning to have similar representation. Word embedding techniques categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of text data. Although these techniques are very efficient, handling semantic and pragmatics ambiguity with high accuracy is still a challenging research task. In this article, we propose a new feature as a semantic score which handles ambiguities between words. We use external knowledge bases and the Huffman Coding algorithm to compute this score that depicts the semantic relatedness between all fragments composing a given text. We combine this feature with word embedding methods to improve text representation. We evaluate our method on a hashtag recommendation system in Twitter where text is noisy and short. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our method achieves good results. Request access from your librarian to read this article&#39;s full text.},

  abstract     = {Abstract E-learning systems use web service technology to develop distributed applications. Therefore, with the tremendous growth in the number of web services, finding the proper services while ensuring the independence and reusability of the learning objects in a different context has become an important issue and has attracted much interest. This article first proposes an extension of the Ontology Web Language for Services Learning Object (OWLS-LO) model to describe a multi-intentional learning object. This description ensures accessibility to learning objects. This research then presents a service discovery mechanism that uses the new semantic model for service matching. Experimental results show that the proposed semantic discovery mechanism using multi-intention model performs better than discovery mechanism based on single intention.

Although great effort has been devoted to achieve this dream, the commonly used web search engines still provide a “one-fit-all” results. One of the barriers is lack of an accurate representation of user search context that supports personalised web search. This article presents a method to represent user search context and incorporate this representation to produce personalised web search results based on Google search results. The key contributions are twofold: a method to build contextual user profiles using their browsing behaviour and the semantic knowledge represented in a domain ontology; and an algorithm to re-rank the original search results using these contextual user profiles. The effectiveness of proposed new techniques were evaluated through comparisons of cases with and without these techniques respectively and a promising result of 35% precision improvement is achieved.

The customer feedback functions and social networks of many e-commerce websites allow for the creation of extremely large databases that can be mined to model the customers&#39; perceptions toward online purchases. This research uses online customer reviews as the business intelligence corpus to help companies redesign products that better satisfy consumer preferences and differentiate their product offerings. After identifying the specific webpages of customer reviews, a web crawler collects review text. Computer-supported text mining, cluster analysis, and perceptual mapping are combined as a systematic analytic approach to compare products in a given domain. The study assists phone manufacturers to understand the positive and negative perceptions of customers related to their post-purchase experiences. The customer-preferred product functions, features, and price positions provide valuable strategic intelligence for new product designs and market differentiation.

The first one uses only the SerWN, both for generating class hierarchy and instances of classes, while the other method combines the SerWN with a domain ontology. The first method was used to automatically generate the FoodOntology, whereas the second method to generate the ontology of rhetorical figures tropes. Preliminary evaluation results corroborate the soundness of the approach. Since BN consists of individual WNs for five Balkan languages and Czech, the methodology presented in this article can also be used for all these languages.

To address these problems, we propose a distant supervised relation extraction model via DiSAN-2CNN on feature level, in which multi-dimension self-attention mechanism is utilized to encode the features of the words and DiSAN-2CNN is used to encode the sentence to obtain the long-term dependency, the prior knowledge of the structure, the time sequence, and the entity dependence in the sentence. Experiments conducted on the NYT-Freebase benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed DiSAN-2CNN on a feature level model achieves better performance than the current two state-of-art distant supervised relation extraction models PCNN+ATT and ResCNN-9, and it has d generalization ability with the least artificial feature engineering.

This article proposes a technique that aims at measuring customers&#39; satisfaction with cloud service providers, based on their tweets. Existing techniques focused on classifying sentimental text as either positive or negative, while the proposed technique classifies the tweets into five categories to provide better information. A hybrid approach of dictionary-based and Fuzzy Inference Process (FIP) is developed for this purpose. This direction was selected for its advantages and flexibility in addressing complex problems, using terms that reflect on human behaviors and experiences. The proposed hybrid-based technique used fuzzy systems in order to accurately identify the sentiment of the input text while addressing the challenges that are facing sentiment analysis using various fuzzy parameters.

  abstract     = {Abstract Semantic web rule language (SWRL) combines web ontology language (OWL) ontologies with horn logic rules of the rule markup language (RuleML) family. Being supported by ontology editors, rule engines and ontology reasoners, it has become a very popular choice for developing rule-based applications on top of ontologies. However, SWRL is probably not going to become a WWW Consortium standard, prohibiting industrial acceptance. On the other hand, SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) has become a de-facto industry standard to represent SPARQL rules and constraints on semantic web models, building on the widespread acceptance of SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). In this article, we argue that the life of existing SWRL rule-based ontology applications can be prolonged by converting them to SPIN. To this end, we have developed the SWRL2SPIN tool in Prolog that transforms SWRL rules into SPIN rules, considering the object-orientation of SPIN, i.e. linking rules to the appropriate ontology classes and optimizing them, as derived by analysing the rule conditions.

The addition of semantics is intended to enhance the description of web services with information that enables automatic agents to understand their data. However, the existence of different languages to semantically describe services makes it difficult to discover and select the service that best meets a requirement. Furthermore, relatively few proposals have a RESTful service semantic description, making the discovery process for RESTful services more difficult. This work proposes a RESTful semantic web service discovery architecture based on semantic interfaces (SERIN). SERIN is an ontology with annotations that semantically describe RESTful web services. This architecture enables software agents to automatically discover and make service calls in order to execute a determined task.
