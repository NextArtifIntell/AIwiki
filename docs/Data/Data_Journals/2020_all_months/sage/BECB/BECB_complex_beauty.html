  abstract     = {Force myography (FMG) is an appealing alternative to traditional electromyography in biomedical applications, mainly due to its simpler signal pattern and immunity to electrical interference. Most FMG sensors, however, send data to a computer for further processing, which reduces the user mobility and, thus, the chances for practical application. In this sense, this work proposes to remodel a typical optical fiber FMG sensor with smaller portable components. Moreover, all data acquisition and processing routines were migrated to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B microprocessor, ensuring the comfort of use and portability. The sensor was successfully demonstrated for 2 input channels and 9 postures classification with an average precision and accuracy of ~99.5% and ~99.8%, respectively, using a feedforward artificial neural network of 2 hidden layers and a competitive output layer.},

  abstract     = {The integration of nanomaterials in microfluidic devices has emerged as a new research paradigm. Microfluidic devices composed of ZnO nanowires have been developed for the collection of urine extracellular vesicles (EVs) at high efficiency and in situ extraction of various microRNAs (miRNAs). The devices can be used for diagnosing various diseases, including kidney diseases and cancers. A major research need for developing micro total analysis systems is to enhance extraction efficiency. This article presents a novel fabrication method for a herringbone-patterned microfluidic device anchored with ZnO nanowire arrays. The substrates with herringbone patterns were created by maskless photolithography. The ZnO nanowire arrays were grown on the substrates by chemical bathing. The patterned design was to introduce turbulent flows as opposed to laminar flow in traditional devices to increase the mixing and contact of the urine sample with ZnO nanowires. The device showed reduced flow rates compared with conventional planar microfluidic channels and successfully extracted urine EV-encapsulated miRNAs.},
