  abstract     = {Biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms invest billions of dollars in R&amp;D, primarily in new drug discovery. Nonetheless, the industry is facing declining returns on R&amp;D investments. Failure to discontinue less‐promising new drug discovery projects is a key driver of this decreased productivity. Hence, firms are scrambling to restructure the new drug discovery process to improve decision‐making and to limit the attrition rate to the early stages of drug discovery. Drawing on insights from the exploration–exploitation literature, our study addresses this timing problem by using a formal model and empirically testing its implications on how the time to discontinuation of new drug discovery projects are impacted by project‐ and firm‐specific characteristics, so that a firm&#39;s resources can be promptly redeployed to more fruitful endeavors. Our findings, based on an analysis of 1274 early‐stage drug discovery projects worldwide, suggest that the time to discontinuation of early‐stage drug discovery projects requires careful consideration of these project‐ and firm‐specific characteristics. These findings hold important implications for the industry, which is undergoing tremendous stress and transformation. The results also contribute to the exploration–exploitation literature by modeling and testing the time‐allocation decision between exploratory and exploitative activities.},

We focus on the perspective of four types of organizations operating at the forefront of the response to major hurricanes in the United States. These include government agencies and non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) at the regional and local levels. We analyze qualitative evidence from managers and directors from a total of 54 organizations regarding their organization’s relationships before and during the response stage of major hurricanes in the United States. Evidence suggests that collaborative relationships are viewed and strengthened in different ways by the four types. Whereas local NGOs view their relationship with others as communal (non‐reciprocal), national NGOs view them as exchange (reciprocal). Government agencies (local and regional) have a hybrid view, a combination of communal and exchange. Evidence suggests that during the dormant stage, organizations build up collaborative relationships that can facilitate their efforts during the response stage. During the response stage, a general shift toward communal and away from exchange relationships is noted across all four types. Notable counter‐intuitive findings, alongside theoretical and managerial insights, are offered based on the findings.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the optimization problem of an infinite stage discrete time Markov decision process (MDP) with a long‐run average metric considering both mean and variance of rewards together. Such performance metric is important since the mean indicates average returns and the variance indicates risk or fairness. However, the variance metric couples the rewards at all stages, the traditional dynamic programming is inapplicable as the principle of time consistency fails. We study this problem from a new perspective called the sensitivity‐based optimization theory. A performance difference formula is derived and it can quantify the difference of the mean‐variance combined metrics of MDPs under any two different policies. The difference formula can be utilized to generate new policies with strictly improved mean‐variance performance. A necessary condition of the optimal policy and the optimality of deterministic policies are derived. We further develop an iterative algorithm with a form of policy iteration, which is proved to converge to local optima both in the mixed and randomized policy space. Specially, when the mean reward is constant in policies, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Finally, we apply our approach to study the fluctuation reduction of wind power in an energy storage system, which demonstrates the potential applicability of our optimization method.},

  abstract     = {Classification of agents such as suppliers and customers into good and bad types based on their attributes is ubiquitous in business. In adversarial classification contexts, firms face agents who fake their attributes to receive favorable decisions from the classifier; for instance, suppliers could misrepresent their safety or quality features in order to qualify as a firm’s accredited vendor. Anticipating such faking by agents, firms may strategically design their classifiers and may also verify the information presented by agents. We examine the impact of agents’ faking on the firm and on agents in a context in which agents of two types—good‐risk and bad‐risk—have possibly different faking costs. We find that the firm is hurt when bad‐risk agents’ faking costs decrease, and the firm benefits when good‐risk agents’ faking costs decrease. We find that agents do not always benefit when faking becomes easier. Further, a decrease in faking costs of one type will sometimes benefit the other type. We show that when the faking costs decrease the firm may be better off using some attributes that do not offer a positive value to the firm at the higher faking cost. Though supplementing a strategic classifier with verification of the agents’ information could benefit the firm, 100% verification may not be optimal even if there was no cost incurred in conducting verification. Experiments conducted using a Naive Bayes classifier on a real‐world dataset demonstrate that our findings hold for extant (and potentially non‐optimal) commercial classifiers.},

Either, (i) offer the same price to all arriving customers and disclose no leadtime information, in which case customers know only an expected leadtime, or, (ii) vary the price dynamically based on the current inventory status, and disclose leadtime information dynamically. The second option allows the firm to offer a price discount for a long leadtime, and to offer a short leadtime when it has a large inventory. In order to determine which pricing and leadtime disclosure policy attains higher maximum profit, we formulate and solve a Markov decision problem for each policy and compare the two solutions. The comparison suggests that, typically, there is a critical inventory level, above which static pricing and no leadtime disclosure yields higher profit, and, below that level, dynamic pricing and leadtime disclosure yields a higher profit. We also identify certain situations where the static policy leads to profits at least as large as those under the dynamic policy for any state , and we examine the price differences between the two policies. Finally, the structure of the solution is similar to the situation where the system manager can pause the production process, except that now this extra lever partly mitigates the superiority of the static policy.},

  abstract     = {We study a coin supply chain problem in the context of improving efficiency. While most consumer products are distributed in one direction, coins are recirculated and reused through the economy. The Federal Reserve System (FRS), the central banking system of the United States, plays a crucial role in managing the U.S. coin supply chain (CSC). It spends a significant fraction of its annual budget on operating the U.S. CSC in order to provide banking services to depository institutions (DIs) and the public. The objective of this study is to provide a near‐optimal or an optimal operating policy that minimizes the total cost of producing, supplying, and managing coin inventory in the U.S. CSC. The study demonstrates a modeling approach that not only can be applied for effectively and efficiently managing the coin supply in the United States, but also for managing similar coin supply chains around the world. The extensive tools and insights developed in this study may prove to be beneficial to the Federal Reserve’s Cash Product Office (CPO) that manages the distribution of the nation’s coin inventory. Managing demand uncertainty and streamlining its processes to be more adaptable to changes in demand are critical for the CPO to reduce supply chain costs. The robust optimization framework and the resulting insights presented in this study could potentially help the CPO to manage shifts in coin demand and achieve its cost reduction goals.},

  abstract     = {Governments across the world constantly use a variety of measures to contain drug costs in order to increase patient access to critical medications. External Reference Pricing (ERP), or international price comparison, is a commonly employed policy to control prices of pharmaceuticals. External Reference Pricing uses the price(s) of a medicinal product in one or several countries in order to derive a benchmark or reference price for the purposes of setting the price of the product in a given country. Despite potential drawbacks, empirical studies show ERP has been successful in reducing drug prices. Another strategy that can reduce drug prices is legalizing parallel imports of drugs from low‐price countries. Motivated by the differences between government policies and the absence of national price management policies in the Unites States, in this study we compare the effects of implementing ERP or authorizing parallel imports on firm profit and different social welfare measures. We find that authorizing parallel imports can result in higher firm profit and/or social welfare than using ERP. We also examine, in a decentralized supply chain, two variations of ERP that are used in practice, the ex‐factory‐based ERP and the pharmacy purchase price (PPP)‐based ERP. We show that despite the ex‐factory‐based ERP being more common, PPP‐based ERP can increase both firm profits and social welfare. Therefore, governments should consider using PPP‐based ERP policies. Our findings help generate insights for ongoing policy discussions around measures for controlling drug prices in the United States.},

To ensure the rapid and broad diffusion of this resource, humanitarian organizations (HOs) have become increasingly intent on building larger follower networks on social media platforms. Our study examines the growth of these networks, particularly in response to the sharing of social media content originally produced by the HOs during periods of normalcy and emergency. To analyze this phenomenon, we formulate a structural model grounded in theoretical work on strategic network formation. Our model evaluates the probability of individual users deciding to follow a HO in response to content sharing as a function of their utility and costs of doing so. We estimate the model using a unique Twitter dataset from a natural experiment involving a major earthquake. We find that content sharing more effectively contributes to the expansion of HOs’ follower networks after the earthquake. Our results also indicate that content sharing stimulates the formation of follower links to HOs from users who are at the highest risk of receiving obsolete information. Moreover, strategically engaging with users to share and diffuse content can yield greater follower link formation activity. Based on these findings, we derive operational implications for HOs that aim to increase the size of their follower networks on social media platforms.},

In settings where consumers face significant value uncertainty, rentals also provide a mechanism for consumers to discover whether they like a product. For some products, such as movies and books, the rental option may yield a significant proportion of the utility associated with ownership. The convenience of renting products in digital forms (e.g., e‐books) makes the managerial challenge of jointly pricing rentals and sales increasingly relevant. Rental and sales prices are interdependent not only because consumers can choose between the two options, but also because a customer may rent before purchasing. Given these considerations, and allowing for consumer uncertainty, we analyze the optimal joint pricing of product rentals and sales. We show that when consumers have a relatively high probability of liking a product, and will experience a significant drop in their post‐rental residual utility, then the practice of allowing a portion of the rental price to apply to a future purchase is optimal.},

  abstract     = {Red packets have symbolized happiness and good luck in Asian culture for centuries. An emerging number of online merchants in Asia are adopting social red packets as a promotion strategy. Social red packets not only digitalize traditional coupons to be readily transferred within consumer social networks but also can reallocate the promotional rewards based on consumers’ social network value rather than their personal value to the firm. In this study, we conceptualize social red packets as an implementation of the social promotion framework, where consumers with higher social network value receive better promotional rewards. Leveraging a unique dataset from an online retailing platform, our vector auto‐regression (VAR) analysis reveals that: (1) under the social red packet design, consumers with higher social network value (who are connected to more new consumers or frequent consumers) will enjoy better promotional rewards; and (2) in order to receive better promotion rewards, consumers under the social red packet design are encouraged to voluntarily enhance their social network value (e.g., by recruiting more new customers or cultivating more frequent consumers). Moreover, we identify several critical characteristics of focal consumers and their social networks that can moderate the effectiveness of social red packets. Our findings provide important managerial insights for online retailing platforms on how to design effective social promotion strategies.},

These decisions are known to be difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose policies that are much simpler and easier to implement than existing ones in the literature. Our analysis revealed interesting insights into the circumstances under which perishability is negligible. This intuition not only leads to the construction of our simple policies, but also helps to establish theoretical performance bounds on the proposed policies. The bounds vanish asymptotically as the market size becomes large and clearly specify a required size for our policies to achieve any given optimality gap. Numerical studies suggest that our policies can work well even for small‐to‐medium‐sized systems and achieve comparable performance to existing heuristic polices.},

  abstract     = {Direct‐Store‐Delivery (DSD) is an arrangement in which a retailer allows a manufacturer to execute in‐store operations such as shelf replenishments. This paper studies the economic drivers and implications of DSD for retailers and manufacturers. We consider a distribution channel where two competing manufacturers sell their products via a shelf‐space constrained retailer. The shelf space allocated to each product affects the cost associated with in‐store operations. The retailer can offer DSD to neither, one, or both manufacturers. The manufacturers respond by accepting or rejecting the retailer’s DSD offer. After the channel arrangement is determined, the manufacturers set their wholesale prices and then the retailer sets retail prices. Our results suggest that DSD is adopted when (i) the operational cost associated with shelf replenishments is convex, and (ii) competition between the manufacturers is intense enough to ensure the retailer’s willingness to offer DSD, but not so intense to deter the manufacturers from adopting DSD. Furthermore, we find that DSD increases the wholesale prices, decreases the retail prices, and increases demand for each product. The implication of this finding is that DSD can benefit not only the involved retailer and manufacturer but also the consumers.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, several Global Health Organizations (GHOs) have experimented with market‐based procurement contracts to encourage pharmaceutical companies to bring late‐stage vaccines to developing‐country markets. Pharmaceutical companies often find such markets financially unattractive because the opportunity cost of capacity commitment is high, developing countries have limited ability to pay, and demand is uncertain. A contract design recently implemented by one GHO offers the manufacturer a per‐dose sales subsidy, which is paid by the GHO, on top of the base price paid by developing countries. The subsidy is required because the base price is not enough, by itself, to induce the manufacturer to commit capacity for developing‐country markets. A natural question that arises in this context is whether, within a fixed budget, alternate contract designs lead to higher capacity commitment. This study proposes and analyzes three contract designs that include the current practice and two alternatives inspired by contracts studied in the operations management literature. It also considers two types of budget constraints that may arise in practice and quantifies the impact of each type of budget constraint on the manufacturer’s capacity commitment. We show that the best contract design depends on the size of the budget, and that GHOs can increase capacity commitment (over the contract design used in practice) by choosing the budget‐appropriate contract design and optimal parameters for the chosen design.},

These state‐of‐the‐art mechanisms offer many economic benefits but also introduce challenges such as the increased complexity in decision‐making for the participants. Our primary goal in this study is to study how decision complexity affects the economic outcomes and acceptability of an advanced economic mechanism: the continuous combinatorial auction. We identify three aspects of complexity—auction size, competition, and the number of active bids. We examine these complexity aspects with five types of auctions conducted with a general consumer population in an experimental environment with real payoffs. We find that various aspects of complexity affect economic outcomes in different ways. Furthermore, competition is a critical factor for conducting efficient auctions. We also conduct a secondary analysis of bidder behavior through a granular examination of clickstream data collected during the auctions. We find that decision complexity influences bidder strategies leading to differences in auction outcomes. Based on our analysis, we develop valuable insights for auction practitioners.},

  abstract     = {We study a single‐period inventory planning problem for a category of substitutable products. This is an important practical problem facing category managers who have to maintain high service levels for constantly expanding product catalogs. We formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization model that minimizes the total stocking cost subject to service level requirements, which consist of product‐specific and category‐wide targets for inventory availability (ready rates) through the selling season. Our model accounts for stochastic customer arrivals, captures stockout‐based substitutions, and determines initial stocking quantities jointly for all products. Recognizing the challenges that these aspects pose in solving the problem, we propose an optimization‐based method that estimates the ready rates using a deterministic approximation and discretizes the selling season into a finite number of time intervals. This novel modeling approach permits us to recast the stochastic optimization model as a deterministic mixed integer linear program that can accommodate several common stockout‐based substitution schemes. We characterize the worst‐case behavior of this approach to develop performance guarantees. We also implemented and applied this model to randomly generated numerical instances featuring different types of product differentiation and varying in parameter values. We observe that the approach is robust to changes in problem parameter values and yields solutions very quickly, outperforming an enumeration‐based alternative, a practical heuristic, and an approach based on extant literature. Finally, we applied our approach to data from a re‐seller of Information Technology products. Results illustrate that our approach scales well and has the potential to generate savings in inventory costs.},

  abstract     = {The timing of vulnerability disclosures (by vulnerability discoverers) has significant implications for software producers and users. Immediate disclosure (before a patch becomes available) could result in exploits with subsequent harm to installed systems. Therefore, it is important to understand the determinants of this timing. In this study, we investigate the impacts of (i) the perception of the vulnerability discoverer about the software producer, (ii) the type of vulnerable software, and (iii) the severity of the vulnerability, on a vulnerability discoverer&#39;s choice of disclosure timing. We collect data from three different sources and control for the vulnerability discoverer&#39;s motivations and beliefs. Our results indicate that those who perceive a software producer to be timely in its patch release, reward it by delaying the disclosure. We also find that it is more likely that the disclosure is delayed for open source software and it is less likely that the disclosure is delayed for more severe vulnerabilities. The findings of this study are relevant to software producers in their decision‐making process on resource allocation for software patches and should also help policy‐makers to devise regulations relevant to the timing of disclosures and patch releases. Furthermore, these findings could be relevant to software consumers searching for a particular software product that they would like to use. This study attempts to provide insights into an ongoing discussion in the operations management community regarding how to allocate and divide resources between software development and software maintenance.},

The demand in these events is very uncertain, but clickstream data can potentially help retailers with detailed information about the shopping process, thereby allowing them to manage such risks. For this purpose, we build a predictive model for shoppers’ sequential decisions about visiting a campaign, obtaining product information and placing a purchase, which we validate using a large data set from a leading flash sales firm. The proposed hierarchical approach mirrors the different stages of the shopping funnel and allows for a direct decomposition of its main sources of variation, from customers arrival to products purchase. We identify life‐cycle dynamics and heterogeneity across campaigns and products as the main sources of variation: these allow us to provide the best predictions from a statistical standpoint, which outperform machine learning alternatives in out‐of‐sample accuracy. Our model thus enables flash sales retailers to learn about the performance of new products in a few hours and to update prices so as to better match supply and demand forecast and improve profits. We simulate our forecasting and optimization procedures on several campaigns including thousands of products and show that our model can successfully separate popular and unpopular products and lift revenues significantly.},

In this study, we aim to make headway in understanding adaptive decision‐making in a dynamic interplay between changing situation, volatile information, and emerging coordination structures. Starting from theories of sensemaking, coordination, and decision‐making, we present two case studies that represent the response to two different humanitarian disasters: Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and the Syria Crisis, one of the most prominent ongoing conflicts. For both, we highlight how volatile information and the urge to respond via sensemaking lead to fragmentation and misalignment of emergent coordination structures and decisions, which, in turn, slow down adaptation. Based on the case studies, we derive propositions and the need to continuously align laterally between different regions and hierarchically between operational and strategic levels to avoid persistence of coordination‐information bubbles. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of methods and theory to ensure that humanitarian operations management captures the critical role of information as a driver of emergent coordination and adaptive decisions.},

The use of utility functions is key in our framework because it allows the decision‐maker to establish priorities by representing the heterogeneous effects of distributing supply to different demand locations (location effect) and to different individuals in the same demand location (diminishing returns effect). We propose the use of two fractional objectives with the utility functions embedded into them: an efficiency measure and a new inequity measure related to the Gini coefficient. The suggested problem has the form of a bi‐objective integer linear fractional program and our resolution optimization technique is designed to solve for multiple fractional objective measures. Novel analytical results for the worst‐case performance of the proposed resolution technique are provided. Our numerical experiments assess computational efficiency and provide concrete managerial prescriptions. Finally, an illustrative application of our approach in the context of the food crisis in Angola is presented based on an efficiency‐inequity trade‐off analysis.},

  abstract     = {We analytically study a value chain consisting of three independent parties: a manufacturer, a retailer, and a sales agent. Either the manufacturer or the retailer may compensate the sales agent, and a variety of supply contracts may be used between the manufacturer and the retailer: price‐only, buyback, and channel rebate. We first compare the efficiency of different supply contracts under either compensation scheme, and then compare the two compensation schemes when executed with the best performing supply contract for the parameter range. Under manufacturer compensation, we find that the price‐only contract may perform well in encouraging sales effort and it can dominate the distribution channel coordinating contracts in certain parameter (production and sales effort costs) range. Under retailer compensation, we find that, within the value chain, the buyback contract performs better in quantity coordination and the channel rebate contract performs better in sales effort coordination. Interestingly, our results show that an appropriate supply contract in support of a salesforce compensation scheme helps mitigate the inefficiency brought by the asymmetric sales effort information, and can lead to value chain first best for a wide range of parameters. When this is not the case, manufacturer compensation executed via the price‐only contract dominates for stable demand markets and retailer compensation executed via channel rebate contract dominates when the market’s uncertain outcomes are distinct.},

  abstract     = {Using a unique dataset that includes individually identifiable consumer online browsing and purchase data in the restaurant industry, this paper examines how individual consumer shopping characteristics and product characteristics moderate the effect of online reviews on individual consumer choice based on information search theory and signaling theory. We find that different dimensions of reviews have distinctive impacts on consumers with different information search needs and behaviors based on their shopping experience, inertia tendency and proneness to coupon promotions. Online reviews also influence consumers’ purchase decisions differently depending on the available information and signals indicated by the product’s ongoing coupon promotions and other signaling characteristics such as the overall price level. Specifically, the valence of reviews primarily affects the consumers who have more shopping experience, who demonstrate less inertia, or who are less prone to coupons, whereas the volume of reviews more significantly affects the highly coupon prone consumers or consumers with high inertia tendency. When the product is of low price or the seller offers a coupon for the product, the number of reviews plays a more important role in affecting consumers’ decision. This research not only enriches the online review literature by highlighting the differential effects of online reviews but also offers practical guidelines to sellers and platforms that wish to use online reviews together with coupon promotions to stimulate sales. Our research also highlights how companies can take advantage of the powerful combination of consumers’ shopping behavior data with online review browsing data to design timely and innovative marketing activities.},

  abstract     = {Consumers of experience goods typically face some uncertainty about the fit between their tastes and the features of products being offered. Information technology has given consumers the ability to conduct research online about their potential fit with products before buying, and modern sellers the ability to disseminate product information to consumers. This study investigates a manufacturer’s and retailers’ incentives to disclose such product fit information to consumers when the manufacturer sells to consumers through competing retailers. We show that whether a manufacturer selling through retailers is more or less likely to disclose fit information compared to a manufacturer selling directly to consumers depends on the degree of retail competition. If the disclosure decisions are made before the manufacturer sets its wholesale price, then all channel members want to disclose fit information for low‐quality products, no one wants to disclose it for medium‐quality products, and only the retailers prefer to disclose fit information for high‐quality products. This disclosure conflict for high‐quality products can be resolved if the manufacturer can commit to a wholesale price before the disclosure decisions. The retailers also then prefer to not disclose fit information for high‐quality products. Regardless of whether the wholesale price is set before or after disclosure decisions, a mandatory product‐fit disclosure policy can decrease consumer welfare and social surplus, depending on the level of product quality and the degree of retail competition.},

  abstract     = {The provision of essential supplies is a key service provided by retailers when demand spikes due to consumer stockpiling during environmental emergencies. Moreover, it is important for retailers to quickly recover from these events by replenishing the stock of essential supplies to meet the continuing needs of local residents. The main purpose of this research is to study consumer precautionary stockpiling behavior prior to the onset of hurricane landfalls and determine the impact of this behavior on in‐store product availability for various formats of retail store outlets. Specifically, we focus on the bottled water product category, an essential emergency category in hurricane preparedness. This study combines an event analysis methodology with econometric models using archival retail scanner data from 60 US retail chains located in 963 counties and real‐time data from four recent US continental hurricanes. We find that supply‐side characteristics (retail network and product variety), demand‐side characteristics (hurricane experience and household income), and disaster characteristics (hazard proximity and hazard intensity) significantly affect consumer stockpiling propensity as the hurricanes approach. The increased consumer stockpiling has immediate and longer‐term impacts on retail operations, namely, in‐store product availability. Among various retail formats, drug stores are associated with the highest consumer stockpiling propensity before hurricanes, while dollar stores and discount stores are associated with the lowest in‐store product availability following hurricanes. Our study points to the need for retailers and policymakers to carefully monitor factors affecting consumer stockpiling behavior that will allow for better allocation of critical supplies during the hurricane season.},

  abstract     = {We study a multi‐period, multi‐item dynamic pricing problem faced by a retailer. The objective is to maximize the total profit by choosing prices, while satisfying several business rules. The strength of our work lies in our graphical model reformulation, which allows us to use ideas from combinatorial optimization. We do not make any assumptions on the structure of the demand function. The complexity of our method depends linearly on the number of time periods but is exponential in the memory of the model (number of past prices that affect current demand) and in the number of items. We prove that the profit maximization problem is NP‐hard by showing an approximation preserving reduction from the weighted Max‐3‐SAT problem. We next introduce the discrete reference price model which is a discretized version of the reference price model, accounting for an exponentially smoothed contribution of all past prices. We show that our problem can be solved efficiently under this model. We then approximate common demand functions using the discrete reference price model. To handle cross‐item effects among multiple items, we propose to use a virtual reference price that assigns a reference price for each category of items (as opposed to a reference price for each item). To enhance the tractability of our approach, we cluster items into blocks and show how to adapt our method to include business constraints across blocks. Finally, we apply our solution approach using demand models calibrated with supermarket data and validate its practical performance.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates the efficacy of zero‐interest early payment financing (alternatively referred to as early payment) and positive‐interest in‐house factoring financing in a pull supply chain with a capital‐constrained manufacturer selling a product through a capital‐abundant retailer. Early payment is the prepayment of a wholesale cost to the manufacturer, whereas in‐house factoring is a loan service provided to the manufacturer by a branch financing firm of the same retailer. We find that the retailer prefers early payment financing to bank financing when the manufacturer’s production cost is low. If the retailer instead offers positive‐interest in‐house factoring financing to the manufacturer, then the financing equilibrium domain enlarges as compared to bank financing. Interestingly, early payment financing can outplay positive‐interest in‐house factoring financing if the production cost is considerably low; otherwise, vice versa. When the production cost is big enough, the retailer will not provide either early payment or in‐house factoring. Furthermore, our main qualitative result sustains with an identical wholesale price across all three financing schemes and the financing equilibrium domain of early payment shrinks as demand variability grows.},

  abstract     = {We study a manufacturer&#39;s product preannouncement decision in a setting where there is uncertainty about when an innovative new product design will be finalized for production, and a key component supplier needs to reserve the capacity before the realization of the final product design. The marketing literature has shown that product preannouncement changes the product demand: it may create buzz about the new product so the demand increases; or it may induce stronger competition from rivals so the demand decreases. We characterize the supplier&#39;s optimal response in reserving capacity given the uncertainty in the product design timing and the changing demand. Furthermore, we characterize the conditions under which the manufacturer may benefit from preannouncing her product release date. We show that even when preannouncement leads to a shorter sales window of the product, the manufacturer may still be better off in preannouncing her new product release date because the supplier&#39;s response of reserving the capacity earlier improves the manufacturer&#39;s profit. For a similar reason, we find that the manufacturer&#39;s expected profit may increase in the wholesale price that she pays to the supplier for the key component. In addition, we show that the supplier trusts the manufacturer&#39;s preannounced product release date only when this date is sufficiently late; otherwise, he ignores the preannounced product release date. Finally, we demonstrate that the supplier reserves less capacity, but reserves earlier when the competitive response is stronger, the market potential is smaller, and the sales window is shorter.},

  abstract     = {Volunteer convergence refers to the influx of volunteers to affected areas after large‐scale disasters. There are not only many benefits to volunteer convergence, but it also creates significant logistical challenges that can impede relief efforts. This study examines polices for admitting volunteers into organized relief operations, and for assigning admitted volunteers to relief tasks. We represent this problem as a queueing system where, in addition to customer arrivals and departures, random server arrivals and abandonments are also present. Then, using a Markov decision process framework, we analyze server admission and assignment policies that seek to minimize relief tasks holding costs as well as volunteer holding and rejection costs. We show that the classic c μ rule, a server allocation policy that determines where to put servers based on relief tasks holding costs and processing requirements, is optimal under both collaborative and non‐collaborative service regimes and when batch server arrivals are allowed. Additionally, we find that the optimal server admission policy is a complex state‐dependent policy. As a result, we propose a class of admission heuristics that depend on the number of workers in the system and the remaining system workload. In a numerical study, we show that our heuristic policies perform well with respect to long‐run average costs, waiting times, number of volunteers in the system, and number of volunteers idling in the system over a range of parameter values and distributions that are based on real data from a case study. As such, they promise volunteer coordinators an effective and simple way to manage disaster volunteers.},

We find that tier‐1 suppliers of direct material to VW suffered a mean stock price reaction of ‒2.69% in the week following the scandal, but this effect varied by region. European suppliers were the most impacted with a mean stock price reaction of ‒5.52%. Suppliers with larger revenue dependence on VW experienced greater negative stock price reactions, as did suppliers of components for engines and/or emissions systems. Non‐VW parts manufacturers experienced a positive effect. We find a mean stock price reaction of ‒5.28% to VW’s European customers, but no significant effects for non‐VW customers. European motor vehicle manufacturers experienced a mean stock price reaction of ‒7.60%. Our results suggest that firms should not just focus on selecting and monitoring responsible suppliers but also apply some of the same principles to developing responsible customers.

However, the impacts of using feedback to emphasize speed, quality, and quantity remain unclear in production settings. This study employs controlled laboratory experiments to examine the impact of real‐time feedback on production quantities, first time yield percentages, and rework percentages. Drawing on concepts from speed‐accuracy tradeoffs, we study four types of feedback: speed, accuracy, joint speed and accuracy, and yields. Laboratory activities focus on the repetitive task of converting paper‐based medical records to electronic data formats. These tasks are critical inputs to data analytics and are similar in nature to simple independent manufacturing and service tasks. We study feedback effects in a setting critical to practice but rarely studied in research, where workers are incentivized for both speed and quality as they perform production tasks that explicitly allow rework. The results show that production yields worsen under speed feedback but improve under each form of quality‐containing feedback. Results also show that each form of quality‐containing feedback increases the proportion of correctly reworked to produced errors through different mechanisms of increased error fixing, decreased error production, or both.},

Demand interdependence (product substitutability) among various brands is critical and thus we investigate its impact on firms’ profits. Using an economic framework with manufacturers operating as Stackelberg leaders, our analysis reveals unique and substantive insights dependent on the underlying market demand structure, and in some cases, the extent of supply coverage. For the Spence–Dixit–Vives demand structure, we find that competing manufacturers prefer to offer brands with low levels of substitutability while retailer’s preferences are moderated by the interaction effect between the number of competing brands and level of product substitutability (essentially the retailer prefers high levels of substitutability when the number of brands is “small,&quot; and vice versa). For the Shubik–Levitan demand structure, manufacturers may prefer high or low levels of product substitutability depending on the extent of supply coverage while the retailer always prefers high levels of product substitutability. These findings offer useful prescriptions for category management and persuasive advertising.},

  abstract     = {Same‐day delivery of online orders is becoming an indispensable service for large retailers. We explore an environment in which in‐store customers supplement company drivers and deliver online orders on their way home. We consider a highly dynamic and stochastic same‐day delivery environment in which online orders as well as in‐store customers willing to make deliveries arrive throughout the day. Studying settings in which delivery capacity is uncertain is novel and practically relevant. Our proposed approaches are simple, yet produce high‐quality solutions in a short amount of time that can be employed in practice. We develop two rolling horizon dispatching approaches: a myopic one that considers only the state of the system when making decisions, and one that also incorporates probabilistic information about future online order and in‐store customer arrivals. We quantify the potential benefits of a novel form of crowdshipping for same‐day delivery and demonstrate the value of exploiting probabilistic information about the future. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of this form of crowdshipping and show the impact of changes in environment characteristics, for example, online order arrival pattern, company fleet size, and in‐store customer compensation on its performance, that is, service quality and operational cost.},

  abstract     = {Material flow control mechanisms determine: (i) whether an order should be released onto the shop floor; and (ii) whether a station should be authorized to produce. Well‐known approaches include Kanban, Drum‐Buffer‐Rope (DBR), Constant Work‐in‐Process (ConWIP), Paired‐cell Overlapping Loops of Cards with Authorization (POLCA), Workload Control (WLC), and Control of Balance by Card Based Navigation (COBACABANA). The literature typically treats these approaches as competing, meaning studies argue for the superiority of one over another. However, a closer look reveals that existing mechanisms either focus on order release (ConWIP, DBR, WLC, and COBACABANA) or on production authorization (Kanban and POLCA). This study therefore calls for a paradigm shift and argues that the different mechanisms may play complementary rather than competing roles. Using simulation, we assess the performance of COBACABANA and POLCA in a high‐variety make‐to‐order shop, a type of shop arguably in most need of material flow control given the importance of throughput times and delivery time adherence. Results demonstrate that COBACABANA outperforms POLCA, but the simultaneous adoption of both control mechanisms outperforms the use of either one in isolation. More specifically, adding POLCA production authorization to COBACABANA order release enables the superfluous direct load to be further reduced, resulting in shop floor throughput time reductions of between 15% and 26% while further reducing the percentage tardy and mean tardiness by up to 14%. Compared to no material flow control, the new combined mechanism realizes a reduction of almost 50% in the percentage tardy and more than 30% in mean tardiness.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates a firm&#39;s return window decision in a distribution channel. Conventional wisdom posits that compared to a centralized channel, a decentralized channel induces worse services (e.g., a shorter return window) because of double marginalization. We build a model consisting of one manufacturer, one retailer, and consumers who are heterogeneous in their willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) for product quality. Counterintuitively, we find that the return window can be longer in a decentralized channel than in a centralized channel. Furthermore, the return window can decrease along with product quality, which means that high‐quality products can be offered shorter return windows than low‐quality products. When endogenizing product quality, we reveal, contrary to previous findings, that the product quality in a decentralized channel may be higher, even when consumer heterogeneity in product quality follows a uniform distribution. This higher product quality induces a decentralized channel to generate a consumer surplus higher than that of a centralized channel.},

  abstract     = {Earlier publications indicate that the price of young wines cannot be estimated accurately through weather conditions. Considering that a majority of fine wine is sold in the form of wine futures, even before the wine is bottled, determining realistic prices for these wine futures accurately is one of the most critical decisions. Surveys of leading wine merchants and industry experts exhibit significant departures from the realized market prices. We develop a pricing model for fine wines using weather, market, and expert reviews. The financial exchange for fine wines called Liv‐ex has already adopted our estimated prices and tagged them as “realistic prices.” Our approach combines temperature, rainfall, market fluctuations, and tasting expert scores and leads to accurate estimations that the wine industry has not seen before. Our study shows that higher temperatures, lower levels of precipitation, appreciation in the Liv‐ex 100 index as a market indicator, and higher barrel scores increase market prices. We conduct a comprehensive set of robustness checks and show that the mean absolute deviation of actual market prices from our estimated prices is substantially smaller than any academic benchmark. Our realistic prices help create transparency in this highly opaque market. When compared with the realized prices, our realistic prices guide buyers (e.g., distributors, restaurateurs, merchants) in their purchase decisions as they can determine whether a wine is underpriced or overpriced.},

One of the methods for forecasting events consists of prediction markets where participants can take financial positions that may generate returns depending on whether certain events occur or not. Results in experimental psychology and behavioral economics have shown that individuals, including experts, can be subject to judgment bias when making probability estimates for future events. We examine, in this study, whether prediction markets are immune to such bias in estimating event probability. We find that even when there are large numbers of transactions and high volumes of trades, probabilistic fallacies still occur. Moreover, when they occur, they tend to be persistent over a certain period of time, and they tend to happen in situations similar to the ones where individual probabilistic fallacies are reported to occur. Our results have implications for the design of prediction markets and at the same time call for caution when using forecasts generated this way.},

We analyze the performance of output dependent, effort dependent, and hybrid (both effort and output dependent) payment structures, and find the best one under various scenarios. In particular, we find that if the output is relatively more sensitive to second party&#39;s effort, the hybrid payment structure should be preferred by the first partner. Furthermore, if the output is highly sensitive to second party&#39;s effort, the output‐dependent payment structure yields more value to the first partner (compared to the effort dependent structure). We further find that the time that has passed in the collaboration and the length of the planning horizon affect the behavior of the effort levels and some other characteristics in the collaboration. We also study and derive interesting results in the following additional settings: the first partner or the second partner gets utility from the output even after the project finishes.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates manufacturer guarantor financing (MG) and third‐party logistics (3PL) guarantor financing (LG) in a four‐party supply chain game that features a manufacturer, a 3PL, a capital‐constrained retailer, and a bank. The manufacturer or 3PL can act as the guarantor for the retailer who borrows bank credit. Two different leadership structures are investigated, namely, Nash game and manufacturer leadership Stackelberg game, where the manufacturer and 3PL decide simultaneously and sequentially, respectively. The supply chain under both leadership structures prefers guarantor financing to traditional bank financing when the supply chain is sufficiently cost‐efficient. In the Nash game, however, firms encounter a free‐rider dilemma when choosing between MG and LG, wherein both potential guarantors prefer the other to be the guarantor. This free‐rider dilemma can be resolved in the Stackelberg game. We also observe the follower–guarantor advantage in the Stackelberg game, wherein all firms favor the follower to provide guarantor financing. Our analysis shows that the supply chain under guarantor financing with a longer decision hierarchy (i.e., the Stackelberg game) can be conditionally more effective than that with a shorter one (i.e., the Nash game). By further analyzing different cost structures, pricing mechanism, and retailer’s initial capital, we find that most of our qualitative results remain accurate under more sophisticated conditions. These findings enhance our understanding of the value of guarantor financing in a capital‐constrained supply chain and the impact of leadership structure on financing decisions.},

  abstract     = {Emerging technologies such as drone delivery services enable retailers to cost‐effectively offer unprecedented delivery speed and adaptable delivery lead times using dedicated aerial vehicles for individual orders. A natural and important question arises: What is the impact of a drone delivery system (DDS) on a retailer’s extant logistics parameters, for example, the number of customer‐facing delivery centers (last‐mile warehouses) it uses and delivery lead times it offers? On the one hand, the ability to reach customers faster than through traditional means argues for more centralization of delivery services. On the other hand, more decentralization can allow the retailer to offer hitherto unheard‐of delivery lead times and thereby spur demand. We show that, as drone technology matures and becomes more cost‐effective, delivery networks will become increasingly decentralized while delivering products at faster speeds. While perfect delivery customization—under which each demand location is offered a customized delivery guarantee—is theoretically feasible under a DDS, it may not be practical to implement such a finely differentiated delivery strategy. Instead, we show that retailers can recover a significant portion of the profit under this ideal scenario by offering limited delivery‐time customization, that is, partitioning the market into a few delivery “zones” and offering the best feasible delivery guarantee for each zone. In physically congested metropolitan markets, where retailers may be forced to operate with only a few delivery centers, it may be optimal to operate a DDS by offering delivery guarantees that are inferior to the best possible in order to throttle unprofitable demand. In such markets, the effectiveness of limited delivery‐time customization increases as the extent of physical congestion increases.},

  abstract     = {Product expirations at retail stores erode profits and burden the environment. We investigate whether manufacturers can leverage salesforce compensation design as a waste‐reduction tool. We propose a data‐driven framework that uses structural econometric modeling and agency theory. Our analysis starts with a game theoretic model in which a salesperson interacts with a manufacturer that reimburses retailers and penalizes its own salesforce for expired products. We then use our model’s equilibrium outcome to estimate factors that determine the effort exerted by the sales representatives of a consumer‐packaged‐goods manufacturer. We first show theoretically that a manufacturer can simultaneously increase profits and reduce waste by increasing its sales representatives’ penalty for product expiration that occurs at the retailer. Based on this, we formulate a manufacturer’s profit maximization problem to compute optimum expiration penalties. Solving this problem for the manufacturer, we find the potential to simultaneously reduce waste and improve profits for 14% of the product–market combinations in our dataset. For these cases, we find that charging the salesperson 2.1 times the commission (on average) for each expired unit can increase the manufacturer’s profits by 0.58% and reduce waste by 23.3%. This study determines that a profit‐seeking manufacturer can reduce waste at retailers by optimizing its salesforce incentive structure. Our work bridges the salesforce compensation and sustainable operations literatures. Furthermore, our framework allows consumer‐packaged‐goods manufacturers to identify win‐win opportunities for the environment and their bottom line.},

  abstract     = {Emergency systems are designed to almost always have enough capacity to respond to emergencies. However, capacity shortage periods do occur and these systems need to recover quickly. In this study, we apply queueing models and study whether it is better for an emergency system to add or to expedite servers, in order to quickly recover from a capacity shortage period. We focus on emergency medical service (EMS) systems and use Erlang loss models to study Red Alerts (when all ambulances are busy) and Yellow Alerts (when the number of available ambulances falls below a threshold). We analyze two loss models: one with Markovian state‐dependent service rates and one with generally and independently distributed service times. We validate the two models against EMS data sets from two cities. Despite the fact that the distribution of ambulance service times is a mixture of lognormal distributions, which is far from being exponential, we find that the loss model with Markovian state‐dependent service rates provides a better representation of empirical Yellow and Red alert statistics. We build on the model with state‐dependent rates and use the theory of absorbing Markov chains to quantify the impact of adding or expediting ambulances, with respect to two performance measures: (i) the duration of alert periods, and (ii) the number of lost calls. This quantification helps EMS staff (dispatchers and supervisors) to make better decisions to avoid, and to recover from, alert periods. For example, staff should not wait until a Red Alert before adding ambulances, which is a common practice, because the expected number of lost calls rapidly increases as the number of available ambulances at the action epoch decreases.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigate a seller&#39;s voluntary disclosure strategy when serving two groups of consumers who arrive sequentially and are reference dependent with respect to product quality. Consumers may be naive or sophisticated, depending on whether they can make rational inferences from the seller&#39;s disclosure behavior and an experienced consumer&#39;s quality review. We show that when consumers are naive, the seller can strategically withhold high‐quality information and disclose low‐quality information to boost the reference‐dependent early adopter&#39;s subjective quality review, which in turn enhances the follower&#39;s quality expectation and allows the seller to extract more surplus in the second period. However, when consumers are sophisticated, it is difficult for the seller to enhance their quality expectations by designing his disclosure strategy to manipulate the early adopter&#39;s quality review. The seller discloses all the quality information to consumers. When the market contains both naive and sophisticated consumers, the seller is able to withhold relatively low‐quality information in advance. In such a situation, the seller exclusively serves naive customers in the first period by charging a high retail price. The earlier results are quite robust, regardless of whether the review rating is bounded or whether consumers possess heterogeneous preferences with respect to product quality.},

  abstract     = {We analyze a case where two competing firms, a personalizing firm that makes product recommendations and a non‐personalizing firm that does not recommend products, compete with each other and may participate in a data sharing alliance (in which the non‐personalizing firm shares its data with the personalizing firm). The customer is strategic as she first visits the personalizing firm to find out what product to purchase among the recommended ones and purchases the product eventually from one of the firms. Overall, the customer distributes all her purchases across both the firms—she purchases from the personalizing firm to maintain a profile quality with the firm (to continue to obtain good recommendations) and from the non‐personalizing firm to benefit from the lower prices of that firm. We analyze this setup in a two‐stage game to find the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium. In the first stage, firms decide to share data, or not. In the second stage they play a simultaneous move price game. We find that the non‐personalizing firm is always willing to share its data with the personalizing firm, but the personalizing firm uses it only when the learning rate influence dominates the profile influence. When the personalizing firm improves its system and both firms share data, its own profit always increases and under certain conditions the profit of the non‐personalizing firm also increases. Finally, social surplus may increase as well when firms share data. This result has important implications for the policy‐makers controlling information sharing between firms.},

An attack is more likely to successfully harm the firm if the ability of its IDS to discriminate between malicious and benign traffic is low, implying loopholes or vulnerabilities in the firm’s security. A novel aspect of this study is the modeling of both continuous degradation in system discrimination ability (drift) and the arrival of abrupt shocks that can suddenly lower discrimination ability. We model shocks to arrive randomly and cause a random decrease in discrimination ability. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a steady‐state level of discrimination ability that firms should strive to reach and maintain. When discrimination ability is below this steady‐state level, full effort must be exerted to reach it. We also compare our model with alternative settings, examine the impact of parameter estimation error, and study scenarios in which the arrival rate of malicious traffic is a function of the steady‐state discrimination ability chosen by the firm.},

  abstract     = {Much of the prominent literature describing behavior in eBay‐like marketplaces emphasizes the successful use of “sniping” agents that wait until the last moments of an auction to bid (truthfully) on behalf of a human user. These agents fare well against “naïve” agents (typically assumed to be those who bid incrementally on the most profitable open auction) who do not get the chance to respond to the snipe‐bid placed in the final seconds. This reasoning, however, tends to ignore the effect of the poor coordination that occurs as more and more players attempt the sniping agent strategy, thereby raising prices above their minimum possible competitive equilibrium levels. Using proprietary data purchased from eBay, encompassing all bids submitted on four specific product types over a 3‐month period, we analyze the allocative efficiency, price, and bidder surplus using a software agent and compare this to the historical performance. After showing a significant amount of “money left on the table” in the historical record, we proceed to demonstrate how bidders can significantly improve their surplus (i.e., observed profit) by adopting a “seek‐and‐protect” agent. If bidders go further and implement sequential‐auction shading strategies, they can incrementally improve their surplus, but sometimes at the expense of allocative efficiency. Acknowledging that each bidder’s time window of interest is inherently unobservable, we vary the length of bidders’ consumption windows and find similar results.},

  abstract     = {To tackle the severe pollution caused by electronic waste (e‐waste), several developing countries have introduced e‐waste legislation based on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). A major challenge to implement EPR in developing countries is the lack of formal recycling infrastructure. In this paper, we study if a collective form of EPR implementation where producers may jointly invest in recycling facilities can promote their incentives to do so. We develop a Nash bargaining model that captures the decision dynamics underlying joint recycling facility investment. We show that despite its advantage in reducing producers’ fixed investment costs, joint investment in the collective system may lead to a worse recycling infrastructure development outcome than independent investment in an individual system. This can particularly happen when the collective system involves products whose recycling costs are highly differentiated. We further show that cost sharing based on the principle of Individual Producer Responsibility (IPR) may undermine the recycling infrastructure development outcome in the collective system compared to simple proportional cost sharing rules. In practice, it is generally believed that IPR leads to better design incentives than proportional cost sharing rules. Accordingly, our result indicates that there exists a tradeoff between these two cost sharing rules, and promoting recycling infrastructure development via collective systems may come at the expense of design incentives and vice versa.},

Furthermore, we consider the situation in which along with the subscription‐based legal content on the platform, there is free illegal content that may generate revenues through advertisements for the platform. Specifically, we analyze three scenarios of illegal content monitoring: (i) only the content developer monitors, (ii) only the platform firm monitors, and (iii) both the content developer and platform firm monitor the illegal content. We find that, under certain conditions, it is beneficial for the platform firm to exert a higher monitoring effort than the content developer even though the former may gain advertisement revenues through the display of illegal content. In addition, while it is expected that the content developer’s profit is highest when only it exerts the monitoring effort, we observe that the scenario where both players exert monitoring efforts results in a win‐win situation. We also analyze the social welfare under all the three illegal content monitoring scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Retailers such as Best Buy are reinventing their supply chains for the era of Omnichannel with new strategies like ship‐from‐store‐to‐store (SFSTS) where stores are also used as shipping points. Under the SFSTS practice, to fill the demand (offline and online) from a customer region, two or more nearby stores of the retailers’ frequently replenish from each other as well as from a distribution center (DC) to better prepare inventory before the demand arrives. We study how to best replenish the DC and multiple nearby stores under this new practice using a multi‐period inventory model with proactive transshipments. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to solve this model, and the characterized optimal replenishment policy is valuable especially as it differs significantly from the past relevant literature on single‐period models. In contrast, for the DC, although the procure‐up‐to policy is still optimal, the procure‐up‐to level is no longer constant but depends on all stores’ on‐hand inventory. For each store, the optimal policy no longer remains the same structure but changes with whether the DC procures inventory from the supplier. When the DC procures inventory, the stores’ optimal policy is no longer single‐threshold, but two‐threshold (order‐up‐to and ship‐down‐to); and these thresholds decrease in any other store’s on‐hand inventory. When the DC does not procure inventory, the stores ship between each other only when their inventories are imbalanced enough, and they ship until the benefit drops to just cover the shipping cost. Our results demonstrate that it is important to constantly track every store’s on‐hand inventory and it is much more complex to implement SFSTS with more nearby stores, despite the additional profit earned.},

Accordingly, we review articles from the 25 top journals, [following procedures developed by Gupta et al.

In addition, we searched some selected journals in the fields of Information Sciences, Political Science, and Economics.

The retailer’s orders are randomly distributed around the optimal order quantity. We develop a behavioral model which incorporates human retailers’ bounded rationality in the supplier’s contractual decisions. In contrast to a supply chain with a fully rational retailer, where a wholesale price contract usually cannot outperform more complicated nonlinear contracts, we find that when the retailer is boundedly rational a wholesale price contract can dominate commonly used nonlinear contracts, such as buyback and revenue sharing contracts, in terms of a supplier’s profit and supply chain profit. We characterize the conditions under which a wholesale price contract outperforms more sophisticated nonlinear contracts for the supplier. In particular, we show that a wholesale price contract is more likely to be implemented by the supplier when the supply chain profit margin is low, the retailer is less rational, the demand variance is large, and the retailer’s reservation value is high. We then conduct a series of laboratory experiments to test whether the behavioral model’s predictions are still salient even when the supplier is not necessarily rational. Our results provide an explanation for the prevalence of wholesale price contracts in business practice where the rationality of a retailer cannot always be guaranteed. We also find that a retailer’s bounded rationality plays a more important role in determining supply chain profit than a supplier’s bounded rationality.},

  abstract     = {Many governing bodies have launched efforts to shape the operations of manufacturers, administration of civic entities, and behavior of individuals to limit waste generation. Typically, such efforts commence with the enactment of targeted legislations that create operational changes (e.g., recycling fees, collection centers) to the waste collection and disposal processes. For example, over 25 states in the United States have enacted legislations that aim to properly dispose used electronic and electrical goods (i.e., e‐waste) and divert such waste away from landfills. We argue that such legislations can have an impact that extends beyond just reducing e‐waste. This is because such laws may not only motivate individuals to restrict e‐waste but also induce broader behavioral spillovers that can prompt individuals to reduce waste in general. To explore this idea, we exploit a quasi‐experimental setup that arises from California&#39;s enactment of the Electronic Waste Recycling Act (EWRA). Specifically, a difference‐in‐differences analysis reveals that the introduction and implementation of the EWRA resulted in at least 4.93% reduction in municipal solid waste (MSW). A plausibility analysis illustrates that these MSW reductions are much larger than what can be attributed purely to the decline of e‐waste. Furthermore, we show that the effect of e‐waste laws is stronger when consumers have increased market access through (i) online connectivity and (ii) offline proximity . Our study informs policy makers on the effects of e‐waste legislation and the critical role of market access in enhancing the impact of such legislation.},

To use these limited doses of vaccine effectively, health agencies can decide to cooperate and share their doses. In this study, we analyze this type of cooperation. Typically cooperation leads to an increased total return, but cooperation is only plausible when this total return can be distributed in a stable way. This makes cooperation a delicate matter. Using cooperative game theory, we derive theoretical sufficient conditions under which cooperation is plausible (i.e., the core is non‐empty) and we show that the doses of vaccine can be traded for a market price in those cases. We perform numerical analyses to generalize these findings and we derive analytical expressions for market prices that can be used in general for distributing the total return. Our results demonstrate that cooperation is most likely to be plausible in case of severe shortages and in case of sufficient supply, with possible mismatches between supply and demand. In those cases, trading doses of vaccine for a market price often results in a core allocation of the total return. We confirm these findings with a case study on the redistribution of influenza vaccines.},

Our study demonstrates that a firm’s organizational structure can affect its marketing decisions. Specifically, a decentralized firm with separate manufacturing and remanufacturing divisions can benefit from indirect selling with higher firm profit, supply chain profit, and total consumer demand than direct selling. Moreover, this structure also induces a remanufacturable product design. In contrast, a centralized firm in which the manufacturing and remanufacturing divisions are consolidated is intuitively better off by choosing direct selling than indirect selling. Furthermore, we show that, surprisingly, when the focal firm sells through an independent retailer, a decentralized internal structure can result in higher supply chain profit than a centralized internal structure. We further investigate the case of dual dedicated channels and conclude that, while direct selling of remanufactured products and indirect selling of new products can better induce a remanufacturable product design and higher supply chain profit, it is not in the best interest of the firm in terms of total sales and firm profit.},

Despite this trend, relatively little is known about the impact of information asymmetries in these settings. We investigate two such differences in first‐price sealed‐bid reverse auctions with a common value. In a design that mirrors real construction procurement auctions, our laboratory experiment tests the impact of the precision of a bidder&#39;s cost estimate and the degree to which bidders know the inherent cost estimate precisions in the auction. We find that more understanding of estimate precision decreases bidder profit, counter to our expectation; however, we also find evidence of strategic behavior from those bidders that ratchets up pressure on competitors and pushes competitors toward bankruptcy. Most notably, understanding just one&#39;s own precision can help avoid the winner&#39;s curse in some settings. The same result does not apply if bidders also know their competitor&#39;s precision; more information does not help. The implication from our realistic setting—that reduced uncertainty may not help the bidder—raises important questions about the degree of transparency that is optimal in procurement auctions.},

  abstract     = {Although much research has been carried out to examine various contextual issues and moderating factors for successful R&amp;D investments, very little research has been conducted to explore the role of a firm&#39;s operational and process characteristics. In this study, we explore how firms could possibly enhance the financial returns of R&amp;D investments through quality management, using Six Sigma implementation as an example, and efficiency improvement, using the stochastic frontier estimation of relative efficiency as a proxy. Based on data from 468 manufacturing firms in the United States over the period 2007–2014, we construct a dynamic panel data model to capture the effects of R&amp;D investments on firms’ financial returns in terms of Tobin&#39;s q . Using the system generalized method of moments estimator, our results indicate that the financial returns of R&amp;D investments are significantly enhanced when firms adopt Six Sigma and improve efficiency in operations. Our additional analyses further suggest that such an enhancement effect through quality and efficiency improvements is more pronounced under high operational complexity as approximated by labor intensity and geographical diversity. Instead of considering innovation activities and process management as contradictory functions, we show that quality and efficiency improvements indeed support firms’ R&amp;D investments, leading to higher financial returns.},

  abstract     = {We propose the first learning algorithm for single‐product, periodic‐review, backlogging inventory systems with random production capacity. Different than the existing literature on this class of problems, we assume that the firm has neither prior information about the demand distribution nor the capacity distribution, and only has access to past demand and supply realizations. The supply realizations are censored capacity realizations in periods where the policy need not produce full capacity to reach its target inventory levels. If both the demand and capacity distributions were known at the beginning of the planning horizon, the well‐known target interval policies would be optimal, and the corresponding optimal cost is referred to as the clairvoyant optimal cost. When such distributional information is not available a priori to the firm, we propose a cyclic stochastic gradient descent type of algorithm whose running average cost asymptotically converges to the clairvoyant optimal cost. We prove that the rate of convergence guarantee of our algorithm is O ( 1 / T ) , which is provably tight for this class of problems. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates how the affiliation of dialysis facilities within chain organizations of varying sizes impacts efficiency and quality outcomes of these facilities. We develop our hypotheses by building on the literature base that relates to organizational learning. The paper uses a panel dataset spanning the years 2008–2013. The efficiency of the dialysis facilities is operationalized by means of a data envelopment analysis model. This model considers the number of treatments in the dialysis facility as the output variable. The model uses four inputs—number of dialysis stations, number of full‐time equivalents of physicians, number of full‐time equivalents of clinical staff, and the number of employee hours per week at a dialysis facility. Quality is operationalized by considering facilities’ performance scores on three measures developed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The findings point to distinct effects of chain organization size on quality and efficiency performance of dialysis facilities. Specifically, the results obtained by analyzing a dynamic panel data model show that chain organization size has an inverse U‐shaped curvilinear effect on quality outcomes and a U‐shaped curvilinear effect on efficiency. The findings suggest that dialysis facilities affiliated with chain organizations of varying sizes experience learning effects and causal ambiguities depending on the specific performance measure under consideration. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice and present directions for future research.},

Our results suggest that confirmation bias does not improve firms’ profits in the short run. However, it confers benefits to products that are frequently purchased in the longer time horizon. We also show that confirmation bias‐inducing advertising can have an inverse relationship with the degree of product differentiation. Furthermore, we show that our results are robust whether confirmation bias is positive or negative, whether consumers have perfect memory or suffer from memory loss, and whether the price premium induced by confirmation bias is fixed or endogenous. Our laboratory experiments test some of these key model predictions. The studies show that individuals behave in a manner consistent with the predictions of our model.},

  abstract     = {A transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is widely assumed to be an important step along the road to environmental sustainability. However, large‐scale adoption of EVs may put electricity grids under critical strain, since peaks in electricity demand are likely to increase radically. Efforts to manage demand peaks through pricing schemes may create new peaks at low‐price periods, if large numbers of EV owners use smart charging to benefit from low prices. This effect is expected to be amplified when EV owners adopt smart decision support to assist them with optimal charging decisions. Therefore, energy policymakers are interested in advanced pricing schemes that can smooth demand or induce demand that comes as close as possible to a desired profile. We show, through simulations calibrated with real‐world data, that current approaches to electricity pricing are limited in their ability to induce desired demand profiles. To address this challenge, we present adaptive pricing , a method to learn from EV owner reactions to prices and adjust announced prices accordingly. Our method draws on the Green Information Systems principles and can assist grid operators in ensuring the reliable operation of the grid. We evaluate our results in simulations, where we find that adaptive pricing outperforms current electricity pricing schemes, yielding results close to the theoretically optimal ones. We test our method in inducing both flat and extremely volatile demand profiles, and we see that in both cases it manages to induce EV charging close to the ideal scenario under perfect information.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we consider a company that uses two channels for trading: long‐term contracts and spot markets. With a quantity flexibility long‐term contract, the buyer commits to purchasing at least as much as the minimum order quantity and is able to reserve capacity with the forward contract supplier up to the maximum order quantity in each period at a predetermined price. Through the spot market, the buyer can order or sell inventory at an uncertain future spot price without quantity limitations. A fixed setup cost is incurred in each instance of buying or selling in the spot market. This study considers very general inventory‐related (not necessarily convex) costs, and demand is random following a one‐sided Pólya distribution. We introduce a concept called “non‐( K 1 , K 2 )‐decreasing with changeovers” and characterize the optimal trading policy in the spot market. We show that the optimal policy can be characterized by five critical points. We also characterize optimal procurement from the contracted supplier under certain conditions. Two simple, yet efficient, heuristics that yield near‐optimal results in many cases are presented as well in order to calculate procurement quantities. Moreover, we show that our results also apply to uniform demand, which is not Pólya, and numerical tests assuming uniform demand are performed to discern which factors are most important and to gain managerial insights.},

The context of our problem is the irradiation by electron beam (eBeam) of fresh produce imported from Mexico to reduce the threat of insects and pests to the U.S. agriculture. Because too few irradiation facilities exist to serve the current demand, we focus on two parties to be coordinated: the eBeam Services Provider, who will choose the facilities’ locations and capacities, and the Distributor, who will determine routes for transporting fruits from Mexico to commercial hubs in the United States via these facilities. We demonstrate the value of cooperation and how that cooperation can be achieved and enforced for a supply chain that must coordinate the independent companies by the strategic decisions of facility location and capacity construction, as opposed to the more common coordination by capacity allocation or pricing. The parties’ interactions are modeled as a sequential game with perfect information. Specifically, we formulate the sequential and cooperative decision‐making problems as mixed‐integer programs, analyze the computational complexity of the problems, and conduct extensive computational experiments. Additionally, we detail three schemes by which the parties can engage in profitable and enforceable cooperation. These methods progressively increase each party’s commitment as trust is built and profits rise. Total cooperation increases overall profit by an average of 8.6%. Further, a stochastic program that uses sample average approximation is applied to demonstrate the results’ robustness to nature’s supply variations while maximizing the supply chain’s overall profit.},

Previous academic literature ignores logistics operations costs in supply chain contracting. In this paper, we study contracting between a retailer in a developed country and a supplier in an emerging country while incorporating total landed cost (including logistics operations costs) in contracting. The retailer faces stochastic demand and stochastic lead time and determines the warehousing strategy. She can hold cycle stock and safety stock at the retail location (developed country warehousing) or allow the supplier to hold second‐tier cycle stock at a warehouse in the emerging country in addition to her holding inventory at the retail location (emerging country warehousing). We study the retailer’s optimal warehousing strategy in a centralized supply chain and a decentralized supply chain with the retailer as the Stackelberg leader. When emerging country warehousing is adopted in the decentralized supply chain, the retailer and supplier could achieve a win–win or a win–lose outcome compared to developed country warehousing. Our results show that the retailer’s warehousing strategies in the centralized and decentralized supply chains could be different. We further study the retailer’s optimal warehousing strategy under the Nash bargaining framework where the wholesale price and logistics decisions are negotiated simultaneously given the warehousing strategy. We compare this contract to that where logistics costs are excluded from contract negotiation. Our results show that by including logistics costs into contract negotiation the retailer and supplier could achieve lose–win , win–win and win–lose outcomes.},

  abstract     = {To enhance performance, buying firms often use supplier governance mechanisms, such as explicit contracts, to coordinate efforts. Yet, it is unclear how these governance mechanisms would perform in extralegal exchanges, whereby suppliers may renege on the contract with little or no legal recourse. Furthermore, there is a paucity of studies examining these extralegal exchanges in the presence of an external market willing to pay higher prices, thus tempting suppliers to renege on existing agreements. Accordingly, we seek insight into the effectiveness of implicit and explicit contracts juxtaposed with the evolving payoff for a supplier&#39;s reneging. We do so with a dataset from a buying firm and its suppliers in the for‐hire trucking industry. Our results reveal that implicit contracts do, indeed, enhance performance (i.e., suppliers reject business offerings less often), eventhough the buying firm has no viable legal recourse for rejected business offerings. Likewise, we find that explicit contracts (i.e., providing more specificity to the supplier) further enhance performance; yet, as the external market conditions change in the supplier&#39;s favor, more explicit contracts’ effectiveness drastically weakens. Indeed, when external market prices reach their highest, our results suggest that explicit contracts’ benefits virtually disappear. Overall, our results provide a rare look into implicit and explicit contracts’ outcomes in an extralegal exchange when suppliers’ reneging becomes more/less threatening, thereby offering insight for researchers and managers.},

The benefits from these activities, however, are constrained by how a platform is designed, as a platform&#39;s design defines what activities can be done and how individuals can engage and interact on the platform. In this study, we focus on weight‐loss communities and social tools that facilitate social communication and establish a variety of relationships between users. In particular, we examine the effectiveness of one‐way and two‐way social relationships on individuals’ weight‐loss management. Drawing from theories of social support, social reciprocity, and social indebtedness, we use two‐way friendship relationships to proxy perceived support and one‐way commenting relationships to proxy received support and conjecture that they work through different pathways. We find, through empirical analyses, that both types of social relationships as well as self‐monitoring are effective in promoting weight loss, but perceived and received support have different impacts. Whereas both perceived and received support are positively related to weight‐loss outcomes, the effect of received support is found to be higher than that of perceived support and the difference is statistically significant. Moreover, we find that received support is positively associated with self‐monitoring behaviors, whereas perceived support is not. These findings provide insights for platform providers to improve the social design aspect of online services and for healthcare practitioners in their efforts to advise individuals on weight self‐management. Our results also can be used to design and implement more effective online interventions.},

  abstract     = {Many manufacturing and service systems require a finite number of heterogeneous jobs to be processed by two stations in tandem. Each station serves at most one job at a time and there is a finite buffer between the two stations. We consider two flexible servers that are cross‐trained to work at both stations. The duration for a server to finish a job at a station is exponentially distributed with a rate that depends on the server, the station, and the job. Our goal is to identify an efficient policy to dynamically assign the servers to the stations such that the expected makespan (duration to complete all the jobs) is minimized. Given that an optimal policy is non‐idling, we focus on non‐idling policies. We first derive the expected makespan of a general non‐idling policy. We then analyze three simple non‐idling policies: the summation‐myopic, the product‐myopic, and the teamwork policies. We prove that (i) the product‐myopic policy is optimal if the servers maintain the same service‐rate ratio at each station for all the jobs, (ii) the teamwork policy is optimal if the servers maintain the same service‐rate ratio at different stations for jobs that are sequenced near each other, and (iii) the summation‐myopic policy is no worse than the teamwork policy. Our numerical study based on general service rates suggests that the summation‐myopic policy can be better or worse than the product‐myopic policy. We also extend the model to incorporate moving costs and service defects.},

  abstract     = {The classical newsvendor problem seeks to minimize the expected inventory cost or maximize the expected profit. But optimizing an expected value alone does not fully capture the stochastic nature of the newsvendor problem. Inspired by the higher‐moment analyses explored in finance literature, we conduct a mean‐variance‐skewness‐kurtosis (MVSK) analysis for the newsvendor problem. We first derive the analytical expressions for the profit’s mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis in the standard newsvendor setting, and reveal their structural properties. We then establish various MVSK optimization problems and find the solution to each of them. We show that kurtosis aversion always induces the newsvendor to order less, while skewness seeking can induce the newsvendor to order either more or less depending on the specific structure of the profit’s skewness, which is affected by the symmetric and asymmetric properties of the demand distribution. Finally, based on the Pareto‐optimality concept, we address the challenge of supply chain coordination (SCC) in the presence of MVSK agents in two specific cases: (i) each agent maximizes its MVSK‐objective‐function and (ii) each agent maximizes its expected profit function, subject to given constraints on the profit’s variance, skewness, and kurtosis. In each case, we explore whether and how the supply chain can be coordinated. We find that considering the MVSK preferences of supply chain agents will affect the achievability of SCC and flexibility of the coordinating contract. We also uncover that if we assume an individual MVSK agent to be an MV one, the achievability of SCC by contracts will be very much negatively affected.},

  abstract     = {We investigate price and stock competition between two retailers selling to a market with uncertain size. Prior to knowing the actual market size, retailers choose stocking quantities before prices under prestocking but adopt the reverse sequence under prepricing. After the actual market size is realized, each customer chooses to purchase from a retailer to maximize utility. Each retailer satisfies its local demand up to availability. A customer with unmet demand at the local retailer may continue to visit the other retailer; we call this phenomenon customer switching. Absent customer switching, retailers always choose the same price and stocking quantity, and tailor decisions to suit market conditions. In the presence of customer switching, product value and market condition are crucial to whether and how retailers adapt their strategies. Retailers can adopt differential strategies, whereby the retailer that overprices the other stocks more as well, to profit from accommodating the spillover demand. Customer switching can also force the retailers to price low and stock less while both could benefit from pricing high and stocking more. These findings are robust with respect to the decision sequence. Compared to prepricing, prestocking weakens retailers’ incentive for strategic divergence but enables them to make higher profits when the market condition is sufficiently optimistic.},

  abstract     = {Automated vehicles (AVs) have emerged rapidly in recent years, becoming a focus of high expectations and heated debates. Advocates argue that the arrival of AVs will make driving safer, greener, cheaper, and faster, bringing ubiquitous access to transportation while significantly reducing traffic congestion and environmental impacts. Skeptics, in contrast, suggest that the appeal of AVs will induce additional driving, offsetting or even overwhelming the positive effects of increased automation. Many analysts now believe that the solution lies in ensuring that most vehicle trips are shared to serve the same number of passenger miles with fewer vehicle miles, reducing traffic congestion. However, these analyses fail to recognize that reducing congestion will induce yet more demand for driving and attract riders from other transportation modes including public transit, which is already experiencing falling ridership in many cities. In this study, we explore the impact of AVs and pooling on consumer mode choice and the effect on the performance of both road and public transit systems. We show that the well‐intentioned move to promote pooling may have the unintended consequence of triggering a public transit death spiral, leading to both worse public transit quality and more rather than less traffic congestion. We argue that the deployment of AVs and pooling can be effective at accelerating the transition to sustainable urban mobility, but only when accompanied by policies that make driving less attractive, not more.},

Such negative effects are more pronounced for customers with stronger bargaining power vis‐à‐vis dependent suppliers. Additional tests show that the reduced supplier operating margins are due to weakened top lines and, more specifically, to squeezed selling prices. Finally, consistent with increased labor costs, unionization is shown to significantly increase cost of goods sold and slow labor‐force downsizing among customer firms. Overall, our evidence suggests that increased labor costs and financial inflexibility due to unionization induce customers to price‐squeeze their dependent suppliers.},

  abstract     = {When firms post prices to sell their products in a competitive market, buyers often seek to bargain down the prices. The existing studies on dynamic competition, however, focus on firms’ dynamic pricing strategies without considering the possibility of bargaining. We model a random stream of buyers with heterogeneous valuations who may choose to negotiate for a discount from a posted price. When bargaining is allowed, a seller firm&#39;s competing strategy depends not only on her reservation value (i.e., her gain from an unsold item when losing the current buyer to the opponent) but also on her disagreement point (i.e., the value of an unsold item when the negotiation with an arriving buyer breaks down). We show that the reservation values and the disagreement points can play opposite roles in competition—the seller firms’ posted prices are increasing in their reservation values but are decreasing in their disagreement points. In general, a seller becomes more aggressive in price competition when her reservation value becomes lower. However, it is not always the case that a seller with a lower reservation value can successfully win the deal from an arriving buyer, as it is in pure price competition. Because of the possibility of bargaining, the buyer may end up purchasing from a seller who has a higher inventory level and a higher reservation value when the seller&#39;s disagreement point is lower than that of her opponent. Interestingly, such an equilibrium outcome can only arise when the selling season is sufficiently long. Our analysis highlights the intriguing role played by negotiation in dynamic competition for sequential selling.},

Buyer response is highly uncertain, and the seller only observes whether buyers accept or reject the offered prices. These deals are also subject to high opportunity cost, since revenue is zero if the price is rejected. The seller must adapt to this uncertain environment and learn quickly from new deals as they take place. We propose a new framework for statistical and optimal learning in this problem, based on approximate Bayesian inference, which has the ability to measure and update the seller’s uncertainty about the demand curve based on new deals.

With cord‐cutting consumers seeking alternative viewing experiences, online streaming providers are gaining “eyeball shares,” strengthening their bargaining positions in subsequent licensing negotiations. We capture the market dynamics between content owners, cable networks, and streaming providers by analyzing a prevalent practice—windowing—that aims to create temporal exclusivities across distribution channels. We derive conditions under which windowing would affect the split of subscription and advertising revenues between competing distribution channels; we also show how content values would change the choice of redistributor and the length of windowing delay between cable and streaming runs. Results here suggest how content owners can best benefit from the streaming provider&#39;s on‐demand content access and the cable network&#39;s more diversified revenue streams.},

Specifically, the model uses decision theory to determine an optimal level of sustainability to integrate into a bid to balance economic vs. sustainable trade‐offs based on perceived buyer preference. To illustrate the model&#39;s utility, it is then applied to a rich scenario, using data from an industrial supplier bidding for a contract to distribute a fuel additive in Brazil by balancing the trade‐off between decreased carbon emissions and increased distribution cost. A sensitivity analysis is then performed to illustrate how different forms of the buyer&#39;s objective function would influence the propagation of sustainability into optimal supplier bids.

Return rates can vary a great deal across stores within a company and across salespersons within a store. We empirically examine returns across these two levels with respect to three retail service quality dimensions: salesperson friendliness, salesperson competence, and store environment. We conduct a detailed analysis using transaction data and customer survey responses from 25,131 customers at a national jewelry retailer. We find salesperson friendliness, salesperson competence, and store environment are significantly associated with subsequent return events, since, theoretically, customers use the three service quality dimensions as information cues to form their product quality perceptions. Our analysis reveals managerially relevant insights for retailers. The empirical associations suggest retailer management might obtain the most benefit in reducing returns from improving salesperson competence, which is followed by improving store environment and improving salesperson friendliness. We also conduct analyses using customer shopping attributes to identify how retailers might modify service for different customer segments to increase the efficacy of return prevention. Lastly, our counterfactual analysis predicts substantial improvements in return rates and net sales due to potential store execution efforts targeted at improving salesperson friendliness, salesperson competence, or store environment. The predictions support the idea that return prevention should start at the point of sale.},

In this paper, we construct a portfolio of incentive contracts with a three‐piece “linear–quadratic–linear” structure and study their incentive effects. It is well known that such contracts can extract 100% of the incremental benefits (i.e., optimal) when the performance levels of the agents are exponentially or uniformly distributed, but its effect is still unknown in the more natural case when performance levels are normally distributed. We show that the proposed three‐piece contract can capture more than 95.32% of the incremental benefits, obtained from the optimal incentive contract over fixed salary contract, when the cost functions of efforts are quadratic, and the performance levels are normally distributed. In this case, the more traditional three‐piece linear contract has a corresponding tight lower bound of 82.64%. Interestingly this is the same as the tight lower bound from a two‐piece linear contract, and thus adding more linear pieces to the contract does not help to improve the lower bound when the performance levels follow the normal distributions. This provides a partial theoretical explanation for the superiority of the portfolio approach advocated by Steenburgh and Ahearne (2012).},

Realizing the residual value in used electronics, consumers frequently look for ways to sell their devices, whereas independent parties (IPs) such as Gazelle and NextWorth and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Apple compete in acquiring them. These firms also compete with online marketplaces such as eBay, which offer a channel for individuals to sell used devices to others. To succeed in this highly competitive market, buying firms (i.e., OEMs andIPs) must understand factors that influence sellers’ estimated utility and their decisions in a resale process. We conduct laboratory experiments with a two‐stage resale process, where subjects in the first stage choose a resale channel to sell their used cell phone. In the second stage, subjects evaluate a potential counteroffer decision, that is, post‐choice decision. Our results from the resale‐channel choice stage show that individuals have a higher sensitivity to price, time until payment, and online ratings when selling to an IP than when selling to an OEM or through an OM. No significant difference exists, however, in their sensitivity to IP or OEM data security policies. Our results from the post‐choice decision stage show that a seller&#39;s share in the counteroffer increases the likelihood of acceptance in all resale channels, whereas higher online ratings might increase or decrease the likelihood of accepting a counteroffer depending on the resale channel. Our laboratory experiment results generally are consistent, with some differences, when replicated on Amazon&#39;s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).},

  abstract     = {The population of truck drivers plays a key role in the spread of HIV and other infectious diseases in sub‐Saharan Africa. Truck drivers thereby affect the health and lives of many, but also suffer from poor health and significantly reduced life expectancy themselves. Due to professional circumstances, their health service needs are generally not well addressed. Therefore, the non‐governmental organization North Star Alliance builds a network of healthcare facilities along the largest trucking routes in sub‐Saharan Africa. This paper studies the problem where to place additional facilities, and which health service packages to offer at each facility. The objective combines the maximization of the patient volume at these facilities and the maximization of the effectiveness of the health service delivery to the population served. The latter criterion is modeled through three novel access measures which capture the needs for effective service provisioning. The resulting optimization problem is essentially different from previously studied healthcare facility location problems because of the specific mobile nature of health service demand of truck drivers. Applying our model to the network of major transport corridors in South‐East Africa, we investigate several prominent questions managers and decision‐makers face. We show that the present network expansion strategy, which primarily focuses on patient volumes, may need to be reconsidered: substantial gains in effectiveness can be made when allowing a small reduction in patient volumes.

  abstract     = {Our study investigates the effects of introducing performance‐based incentives in a competitive health care market. We consider a market in which a payer applies a performance‐based compensation contract to two competing hospitals. We use G / G / m queuing dynamics to describe the patient care process and include information asymmetry between the payer and the hospitals regarding the hospital operating costs. Our paper is the first to study the performance‐based contracting problem in a health care market in the presence of competition on both the quality of and the access to care and the cost information asymmetry between the payer and care providers. We analyze the socially optimal and Nash equilibrium outcomes under bonus compensation where each of the competing hospitals is rewarded based on patient benefits delivered at that hospital. We show that both the stronger competition among hospitals and the introduction of bonus incentives can enhance patient benefits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the presence of information asymmetry between the payer and the hospitals regarding hospitals&#39; operating costs, the social welfare loss generated by the fee‐for‐service compensation as well as by the optimal bonus contract can be partially mitigated by increasing the degree of competition for patients. Such mitigation effect is amplified when the potential cost differential between the hospitals is sufficiently high and, simultaneously, the correlation between their cost parameters is not too negative.},

  abstract     = {Two‐sided platforms are often coupled with exclusive hardware products that connect two sides of users, the consumers of the hardware product (i.e., buyers) and the application developers (i.e., sellers). The hardware product in the platform business model introduces three important issues that are not yet well understood in the literature of platform pricing: potentially downward‐trending production cost, product quality improvements, and consumers’ strategic behaviors. Using analytical modeling, our study explicitly factors in these issues in analyzing a monopoly platform owner’s two‐sided pricing problem. The platform sequentially introduces and prices quality‐improving hardware products, for which the costliness of quality may decrease. Strategic buyers make purchasing and upgrading decisions, which dynamically determine the buyer‐side network size. Meanwhile, the seller‐side network size is determined endogenously. We find that, an increase in the likelihood or magnitude of the future costliness reduction raises the initial buyer‐side price of the low‐quality product and lowers the seller‐side fee. This strategy, in turn, creates an indirect intertemporal effect that allows the platform to also raise the buyer‐side price(s) of the product(s) sold later. These findings contrast with conventional wisdom and provide an economic explanation for premium introductory pricing of many platform products. Moreover, we find that strengthening the network effect can result in more pronounced increases in the buyer‐side prices.},

  abstract     = {Manufacturers moving into services must design a service delivery system that can effectively and efficiently support their product‐service offerings. Commonly, such manufacturers outsource customer service and support to independent service suppliers, while maintaining the ownership and control of certain service units. Despite the increasing number of studies in service triads investigating ways that may improve service performance and customer satisfaction, the dynamics of mixed‐ownership service delivery systems have remained understudied. By deploying the Motivation–Opportunity–Ability (MOA) framework, and synthesizing insights from research in franchising and the literature on training effectiveness, we hypothesize that manufacturer‐led formal training increases the service performance of the entire network, but that outsourced service units choose more suitable training courses and derive comparatively higher performance benefits than company‐owned ones. We test (and find support for) our hypotheses within the UK service network of a major commercial vehicles manufacturer, using several panel data regression models and objective measures of training and performance. This study primarily contributes to the literature on servitization and service triads by showing the performance‐enhancing capacity of manufacturer‐led training. The results have practical implications for the development and implementation of the service operations strategy of servitized manufacturers that support customers through mixed‐ownership service networks.},

We demonstrate the importance of this framework using the case of the United States Navy (USN). On a broader level, we offer a strategy for the decision makers to deploy appropriate assets for executing HADR smartly. Such a method, when employed with relevant data, can enhance efficiency for various organizations involved in HADR, whether military or not. We collected a large amount of data on the assets, specifically ships, of the USN. This collected data alone are a contribution to the literature. We use factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality and make the dataset manageable while simultaneously retaining the variation and maximal information in the data. Our results, in this case, show that planners need to consider costs to truly maximize utility, especially in cases where two assets, or a combination of them, have similar utility ratings but significantly different costs. Our findings also demonstrate that asset capabilities, proximity, and the duration of an HADR response matter. Finally, we employ our framework to illustrate how HADR responses to the 2010 Haiti and 2011 Tohoku earthquakes could have been conducted more effectively and efficiently.},

  abstract     = {We first theoretically identify the factors that may impact individuals’ routing decisions before empirically examining a large operational dataset in a casual restaurant setting. Analytical models have identified various routing algorithms for service operations management. Although each model may offer advantages over others, they all make a key assumption ‐ decision makers will actually follow the algorithms, if implemented. However, in many settings routing is not done by a computer that is programmed, but instead by a human. People make routing decisions at their own discretion which may hurt or help system performance. We analyze granular transaction data to examine how hosts revise a given routing rule when seating customers. Thereafter, we empirically analyze the effect of the dispersion of table assignments on restaurant performance, and estimate the counterfactual sales impact of adopting an alternative routing priority. Our setting instructs its hosts to follow a round‐robin rule to assign tasks because it ensures fairness and smooths work flow. We find that hosts assign more incoming parties than the round‐robin rule suggests to those waiters who have low contemporaneous workload or high speed skills. The prioritization of high speed skill waiters increases with higher levels of demand. In addition, we show an inverted‐U‐shaped relationship between the inequality of table assignments (measured in terms of the Gini Coefficient of the numbers of tables assigned to each waiter during the same hour) and total sales. Our results suggest that properly adjusting the round‐robin rule is productive; however, too much deviation lowers performance. Our paper empirically highlights the value of routing decisions and front‐line personnel, such as the hosts in our context.},

Backers individually decide whether to contribute, but their total contributions collectively determine whether the project will be successfully funded. This study models the dynamics of backers’ contributions in the presence of success uncertainty and analyzes managerial promotion strategies to maximize the likelihood of funding success. Two opposing forces affect backer decisions: backers are more likely to back a project that has already reached a greater fraction of its funding goal (positive externalities), but the backing propensity declines over time (negative deadline effects). These two competing forces give rise to a time‐dependent critical threshold of funding that a project must attain to achieve successful funding.

Even though TCE is a broadly applicable theory of governance, one of its specific topics of interest—the make‐or‐buy decision—readily aligns with some of the central research questions on how firms manage supply chains. However, both general management and operations management researchers sometimes misunderstand and misapply TCE&#39;s aims, assumptions, and logic. A common mistake is to read TCE as a theory of competence or of power. While TCE relates to both, TCE is essentially a theory of efficient governance of transactions in particular and exchange relationships in general. Our purpose in this study is to review the intellectual and theoretical foundations of TCE, its primary aims, and its applicability as a theory of supply chain efficiency. To this end, we discover much common ground between TCE and research in operations and supply chain management. We close by discussing implications for future research, focusing on how operations and supply chain management researchers could contribute to broader academic conversations on management and governance.},

Thus, through 25,724 BOPS instances used by 16,202 unique customers via a hybrid retailer, this study investigated the impact of customers’ BOPS usage on their online and offline purchase frequency and purchase amount. The moderating effect of offline store factors was investigated based on data from a focal retailer consisting of 110 stores in four cities. Using a combination of propensity score matching and difference‐in‐difference (DID) identification, our research found the significant positive effects of BOPS usage on offline purchase frequency and online purchase amount. We also found nuanced moderating effects of offline store characteristics (i.e., store density, product variety, and competition intensity) in the influence of BOPS usage on purchase behaviors.

  abstract     = {Learning by doing is a fundamental driver of productivity among knowledge workers. As workers accumulate experience working on certain types of tasks (i.e., they become specialized), they also develop proficiency in executing these tasks. However, previous research suggests that organizations may struggle to leverage the knowledge workers accrue through specialization because specialized workers tend to lose interest and reduce effort during task execution. This study investigates how organizations can improve specialized workers’ performance by mitigating the dysfunctional effects of specialization. In particular, we study how other sources of task experiences from the worker&#39;s immediate manager as well as the organization itself help manage the relationship between worker specialization and performance. We do so by analyzing a proprietary dataset that comprises of 39,162 software service tasks that 310 employees in a Fortune 100 organization executed under the supervision of 92 managers. Results suggest that the manager role experience (i.e., the manager&#39;s experience supervising workers) is instrumental in mitigating the potential negative effect of worker specialization on performance, measured as task execution time. Such influence, however, is contingent on cases in which organizational task experience (i.e., the organization&#39;s experience in executing tasks of the same substantive content as the focal task) is limited. Taken together, our research contributes to multiple streams of research and unearths important insights on how multiple sources of experience beyond the workers themselves can help capture the elusive benefits of worker specialization.},

In this problem, the operator, upon observing its distribution of idle vehicles, proactively allocates the idle vehicles to serve future uncertain demands. With perfect information of demand distribution, the problem can be formulated as a stochastic transportation problem. Yet, the non‐stationarity and spatial correlation of demands pose significant challenges in estimating its distribution accurately from historical data. We employ a novel distributionally robust optimization approach that can utilize covariate information as well as the moment information of demand to construct a scenario‐wise ambiguity set. We further illustrate how the key parameters required by the new ambiguity set, such as the scenarios and their probabilities, can be estimated via multivariate regression tree. Although information about uncertain covariates provides no value when there is perfect knowledge of demand distribution, we show that it could alleviate the over‐conservativeness of the robust solution. The resulting distributionally robust optimization problem can be exactly and tractably solved using linear decision rule technique. We further validate the performance of our solution via extensive numerical simulations, and a case study using trip and vehicle status data from our partner taxi operator, paired with the rainfall data from the Meteorological Service Singapore.},

We investigate how organizational forgetting affects such quality gains obtained from spillover. We analyze the quality data of 191 suppliers who supply similar products to two distinct businesses: a car and a commercial vehicle manufacturer. A latent class analysis identifies that the spillover of quality knowledge is significant at 93 of the 191 shared suppliers. Spillover is more likely at shared suppliers when there are higher product and process commonality between the components supplied to the different buyers, but less likely when suppliers use multiple facilities to cater to the requirements of the different buyers. Further investigation of the retention of quality knowledge of 93 suppliers with significant spillover reveals that forgetting erodes the quality gains obtained from spillover by 19.09% annually. This effect is larger than the depreciation of quality gains obtained from working directly with suppliers (10.93%). Moreover, the impact of forgetting depends on where the quality knowledge is retained: the quality knowledge embedded in routines erodes faster than the quality knowledge embedded in technology or organizational members. Furthermore, the impact of forgetting on spillover depends on where the quality improvement initiatives are implemented: gains from initiatives in the output activities depreciate less than gains from efforts in the in‐process activities. Our work provides managers guidance on managing the spillover of quality knowledge at suppliers.},

  abstract     = {We study a two‐stage decision problem, namely, the allocation and deployment of reserved inventories (RIs) in a supply network with random demand surges. The demand surge follows a time‐dependent stochastic process and our objective is to minimize the expected total unmet demand in the presence of positive transshipment lead times. We first solve the optimal deployment problem given that the demand surges have occurred at some locations. We show that the optimal deployment policy is a “nested” policy with respect to the shadow price at each location, where a shadow price represents the marginal reduction of the expected total unmet demand due to a marginal increase of RIs. Specifically, locations with higher shadow prices have higher priority in inventory allocation. We then consider the optimal allocation problem in the pre‐positioning stage. We show that under certain conditions the optimal allocation is increasing in the total amount of RIs. We introduce a new stochastic order for distributions defined on sets called the first‐order stochastic dominance and use it to show that the expected total unmet demand is higher when one of the following is true: the demand surges tend to occur simultaneously at more locations, the post‐surge delivery takes a longer time, more demand arrives earlier, or the demand has a higher volatility.},

In a model with internal reference price effects, we find that as the salience of reference price effect increases, (a) product differentiation first decreases and then increases; and (b) firm profits first decrease and then increase.

  abstract     = {Trade‐in programs for electronics products, e.g., mobile phones, have been increasingly popular. These programs target at customers (we call them “bargainers”) who seek to salvage or upgrade their old devices. There are two widely adopted trade‐in options: trade‐in‐for‐upgrade and trade‐in‐for‐cash. In this study, we consider a firm who offers both trade‐in options, that is, a hybrid trade‐in program, to acquire old products, then refurbishes and resells them, together with new product over a finite selling horizon. The bargainers choose which option to trade in their products while new customers decide whether to buy a new product or a refurbished one. When the selling price of new product is exogenous, we derive the optimal trade‐in prices of old product and resale price of refurbished product. We show that the optimal trade‐in and resale policies are of a threshold‐type and trade‐in‐for‐upgrade should be offered with a premium refund (compared to trade‐in‐for‐cash) only in early periods of the selling horizon. We further consider two variants of the above base model. In the first extension, the new product has a fixed amount of initial inventory and is not replenishable during the selling horizon. In the second extension, the new product price can also be determined by the firm. Our numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid trade‐in program could generate significantly more profit than either upgrade‐only or cash‐only trade‐in program.},

  abstract     = {This research examines the performance benefits of the Office of Patient Experience (OPX), a new administrative innovation in the health care industry. OPX is an independent structure within a hospital, having its own annual budget and full‐time staff, and is responsible for improving patient experience during the hospital stay. We specifically investigate the effectiveness of OPXs in improving experiential quality (EQ), measured as the quality of interactions between hospital&#39;s caregivers and patients. In addition, we look at how the operation of these offices help hospitals manage variability during the delivery of care, which introduces additional challenges to maintaining high EQ. Specifically, we investigate the impact of variability in care delivery introduced due to two factors—patient case mix index (CMI) and resident intensity. CMI is an indicator of patient acuity and their care burden on hospitals while resident intensity is measured as a ratio of residents to beds at a hospital and is a proxy for variability introduced due to disruptions in caregiver teams due to the presence of residents who are getting trained at the hospital. Our empirical analyses involve tracking the operation of these offices across 3615 US acute care hospitals for the years 2007–2014. To account for endogeneity, we used an instrumental variable fixed effects regression model with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) on the first‐stage to identify and select the strongest instruments. Findings suggest that the OPX is associated with 1.95% higher EQ for each year of its operation. Furthermore, we find that an OPX is more effective in improving EQ for hospitals that deal with high CMI patients (6.5% for high vs. −0.3% for low) or high resident intensity (1.8% for high vs. 0.9% low). Moreover, we find evidence of operating efficiencies associated with OPXs, with a 1.4% reduction in operating cost for each year of its operation. Preliminary evidence also suggests that Chief Patient Experience Officers (CXOs), leaders of OPX, with medical backgrounds (i.e., MD or nursing degree) are more effective at improving EQ. Finally, we validate our findings through interviews with OPX and hospital staff at a prominent teaching hospital with an active OPX.},

  abstract     = {In response to highly unpredictable sudden‐onset natural disasters, efficient and effective management of disaster relief inventory (DRI) is essential. This study proposes a simple framework based on three fundamental DRI‐related decision themes, which are (1) who respond to DRI calling, (2) where to locate DRI, and (3) how to control DRI, aiming at identifying the research gaps between the realities’ calling and the literature’s consideration with a focus on DRI management. We review relevant literature for each decision theme, summarize the insights provided by the literature, assess the practical needs and procedures and present our detailed perspectives on the research gaps in practice. The chief implication from our observations and arguments is that scaling up a DRI response for catastrophic disasters and events which prepares the whole community for worst‐case scenarios has been highlighted in academics and practice but lack operational research in the area of relevant decision‐making tactics. Existing research concerning the DRI management issues of various coordination forms of disaster responders, the location‐allocation decision‐making determinants with DRI prepositioning and the DRI control policy in the face of various disaster uncertainties is still far from being fully understood, appropriately characterized and profoundly discussed. We recommend the potential future research areas with the implications of this review in the last conclusion section, wishing to provide researchers a better understanding of the needs in the real‐world.},

To ensure tractability, conditions that assure the objective function has a unique solution are enormously helpful. So far, several technical assumptions have been proposed for the continuous case, but comparatively little attention has been given to the discrete counterpart despite its prevalence in practice. Thus, this study aims to develop new technical assumptions, built upon relevant economic concepts, to guarantee the tractability of revenue management models in discrete settings. In particular, we present two sufficient conditions for the revenue function to be concave, in terms of quantity or price and propose a condition for the revenue function to be unimodal, called discrete increasing generalized failure rate (IGFR). Our definition has an appropriate economic interpretation and offers comparable properties to those of the continuous version. Finally, we show the discrete IGFR property holds for several discrete distributions.},

  abstract     = {Through Central Procurement Organizations (CPOs), large firms with multiple divisions have begun adopting a center‐led sourcing approach that allows firms to centralize strategic sourcing activities, while permitting decentralized execution by divisions, allowing the firm to leverage large purchase volumes with vendors. This new center‐led procurement environment has brought a new decision requirement: How should a CPO select vendors for each division&#39;s requirements to minimize the firm&#39;s total procurement cost and simultaneously develop a fair and alignment‐inducing mechanism to allocate the costs (and savings) of company‐wide procurement to the divisions? Past research and current practice have not addressed this linkage between vendor selection and cost allocation in multi‐division firms. This work models this sourcing and procurement cost allocation (SPC) problem facing CPOs of large firms as a mixed‐integer optimization problem. This model is flexible and can incorporate several commonly‐used cost allocation rules. We show that the SPC problem is NP‐hard. Therefore, to support practical decision‐making in this context, we develop a tailored solution approach for the SPC problem. Our approach enhances the base model by adding strong valid inequalities. We tested our model and its enhancements in an extensive numerical study, solving over 160 instances. Results reveal that (a) the CPO can ensure fair cost allocation at a modest cost (relative to the centralized solution) with our model, and (b) the proposed tailored approach is effective and necessary in solving a wide variety of instances.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the recent reshoring initiatives, we study firms’ global sourcing strategies from two different supply sources, offshore and onshore supply bases, under supply and demand uncertainty. Interestingly, even though onshore sourcing has a significant benefit from market responsiveness, offshore sourcing having no cost advantage also provides benefits in the presence of yield uncertainty and market competition. If competing firms commit single sourcing, one firm may choose inferior offshore sourcing to dampen competition. When a dual‐sourcing option is available, firms always utilize dual sourcing, offshore sourcing as well as onshore sourcing, for risk pooling purpose. Our result shows that risk pooling is an essential driver in supplier selection in that the need for dual sourcing cannot be eliminated by other influential factors (e.g., responsiveness and competition effect). However, we find that firms may suffer from a dual‐sourcing option under competition. This contrasts with the conventional wisdom that dual sourcing benefits firms in the presence of supply uncertainty. When it comes to order allocation, market responsiveness is not necessarily an order winner since it does not lead to a larger order to an onshore supplier if demand is guaranteed above a certain level. Under competition, firms’ order allocation is mainly determined by supply yield correlations.},

The establishment of a direct sales channel expands market potential, induces the supplier to adopt a more frequent disclosure strategy, and ultimately leads to a higher level of information transparency in the supply chain. Since more quality information is revealed in the presence of a dual channel, the retailer is able to free ride on the supplier’s disclosure to enhance consumers’ quality expectations. In most cases, such a free‐riding effect is positive and can even create a higher ex ante payoff for the retailer in face of the supplier’s encroachment. Conversely, more transparent product quality information does not necessarily benefit the supplier, who can then no longer hide negative quality information from consumers due to the potential change in the channel structure. Thus, we show that the supplier’s ex ante payoff may become lower with encroachment and that the supplier may commit not to encroach on the retail market, even when it has a free option to open a direct sales channel.},

Unlike physical music, digital music is provided by several emerging digital music providers through the Internet to consumers. Pricing models of digital music are also drastically different from those of physical music. In this study, we identify three common schemes for selling digital music: ownership, subscription and mixed pricing models. Under the ownership model, consumers purchase and download their preferred songs and enjoy music using their local devices. Under the subscription model, music is provided through an online streaming service. The mixed pricing model is a combination of the previous two. Our paper explores and compares the three pricing models. Through a stylized model, we find that several factors, including the advertisement revenue rate and consumers’ reservation value for the music service, have crucial effects on the comparison of the three pricing models.},

With complementary resources, the effective capacity of a JV is constrained by the most scarce resource. We show that multiple Nash equilibria could exist. Nevertheless, there exists a unique Strong Nash equilibrium. We show that there is an efficient and fair fixed‐rate revenue‐sharing contract which induces the system optimal outcome in the Strong Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, with substitutable a resource, the effective capacity of a JV is measured by aggregating individual contributions. We show that there does not exist a fixed‐rate revenue‐sharing contract that induces the system optimum. We quantify that the efficiency of a JV which decreases with the number of participants, the cost asymmetry and the cost margin of the JV. We propose provably‐good fixed‐rate revenue‐sharing contracts with performance guarantees. We also propose a simple modified contract to achieve the channel coordination. Finally, we fit our model with historical data to shed some insights on two JV examples in the motion picture industry.},

We find that subjects reduce order‐up‐to levels significantly at the end of the current budget cycle, which results in a cyclic pattern during the budget cycle. This indicates that the subjects are short‐sighted with respect to future budget cycles. To control for inventory that is carried over from one period to the next, we introduce a starting‐inventory factor and find that order‐up‐to levels increase in the starting inventory.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the causes behind the underwhelming adoption of voluntary Time‐of‐Use (TOU) tariffs in the residential electricity market. TOU tariffs are deployed by utilities to better match electricity generation capacity with market demand by giving consumers price incentives to reduce their consumption when electricity demand is at its peak. However, consumers in residential electricity markets are heterogeneous in their consumption preferences. Hence, utilities face a trade‐off when deploying voluntary TOU tariffs—to provide aggressive price incentives that will only appeal to consumers with flatter profiles or milder incentives to appeal to a larger proportion of the market. Using a game‐theoretic model, we identify the key factors that determine the viability of voluntary TOU tariff deployment. On the supply side, the gap between wholesale prices in the peak and off‐peak periods determines how much the utility stands to benefit by inducing demand response. On the demand side, heterogeneity within target consumer sets determines how much demand response the utility can induce with a certain price incentive. We show that misaligned incentives between utilities and regulators lead to underwhelming TOU tariff adoption compared to the socially desirable level, and that this under‐adoption is worse when consumption preferences are uniformly distributed. We also evaluate the degree of cross‐subsidization across tariff structures to identify their implications for equity among the different consumer types, and find that low levels of voluntary TOU adoption are less equitable than the default tariffs.},

This study investigates the interaction between a manufacturer’s product quality information acquisition and different product quality information disclosure systems in a supply chain wherein the manufacturer can privately acquire the precise quality information of its product by affordable means initially. We consider two different quality information disclosure systems for the quality information acquisition: voluntary disclosure (i.e., the manufacturer determines whether to disclose the quality information that he has acquired), and mandatory disclosure (i.e., the manufacturer is mandated to disclose the quality information that he has acquired). We examine the effects of voluntary disclosure and mandatory disclosure on the equilibrium strategies and payoffs of the manufacturer and the retailer and on the consumer surplus. It is shown that mandatory disclosure significantly reduces the manufacturer’s incentive to acquire the precise product quality information and leads to a reduction in the product quality information that the retailer and the consumers can receive. Interestingly, although the manufacturer is ex ante better off, the retailer’s ex ante payoff and the expected consumer surplus become lower under mandatory disclosure, as opposed to voluntary disclosure of product quality information.},

In this study, we analyze an incentive design problem faced by a budget‐constrained humanitarian organization managing a health care service program (e.g., maternal health or HIV services) with different emphasis on the two measures of quality—structural and process. Incentives offered to the health care provider (referred to as supply‐side incentives) are aimed at improving the availability of good quality services and demand‐side incentives are used to encourage patients to seek care. In many developing country health programs, incentive schemes tend to be purely supply‐side focused or purely demand‐side focused. However, our results suggest that by offering the right combination of incentives to the patients and the provider, program performance can be increased up to 20 times, on average, depending on the service offered. Even within the current practice of using one‐sided incentives, there is significant scope for improvement (as much as 14 times, on average) by ensuring that there is better alignment between the incentive scheme and the service offered. In particular, pure supply‐side incentive schemes perform better than pure demand‐side incentive schemes in programs where there is a higher emphasis on structural quality. The opposite result holds true for programs that place a higher emphasis on process quality.},

  abstract     = {Product proliferation and changes in demand require that retailers regularly determine how items should be allocated to retail shelves. The existing shelf‐space literature mainly deals with regular retail shelves onto which customers only have a frontal perspective. This study provides a modeling and solution approach for two‐dimensional shelves, e.g., for meat, bread, fish, cheese, or clothes. These are categories that are kept on tilted shelves. Customers have a total perspective on these shelves and can observe units of one particular item horizontally and vertically instead of just seeing the foremost unit of an item, as is the case of regular shelves. We develop a decision model that optimizes the two‐dimensional shelf‐space assignment of items to a restricted, tilted shelf. We contribute to current literature by integrating the assortment decision and accounting for stochastic demand, space elasticity and substitution effects in the setting of such self types. To solve the model, we implement a specialized heuristic that is based on a genetic algorithm (GA). By comparing it to an exact approach and other benchmarks, we prove its efficiency and demonstrate that results are near‐optimal with an average solution quality of above 99% in terms of profit. Based on a numerical study with data from one of Germany’s largest retailers, we were able to show within the scope of a case study that our approach can lead to an increase in profits of up to 15%. We demonstrate with further simulated data that integration of stochastic demand, substitution, and space elasticity results in up to 80% higher profits.},

In the context of the model analyzed in this study, the operational gains are subject to inherent volatility in both the price and the output of the intermediate product transferred within the vertically integrated structure. Our model framework provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the value (NPV) of an integrated system to exceed the sum of two optimized subsystems on their own. We then calibrate the model in Germany and Texas for systems that combine wind energy with Power‐to‐Gas (PtG) facilities that produce hydrogen. Depending on the prices for hydrogen in different market segments, we find that a synergistic investment value emerges in some settings. In the context of Texas, for instance, neither electricity generation from wind power nor hydrogen production from PtG is profitable on its own in the current market environment. Yet, provided both subsystems are sized optimally in relative terms, the attendant operational gains from vertical integration more than compensate for the stand‐alone losses of the two subsystems.},

We further demonstrate that the decreasing rate is sizable enough that the relationship between the online consumer purchase probability and the call intensity is an inverted U‐shaped curve. In addition, there exists a strong carryover effect where the online call intensity in the past 4 weeks does not fade away but has a positive effect on recent consumer purchases. Our estimations show that both too much and too little call intensity will result in considerably worse outcomes. As compared with the call intensity at the optimal level, too much call intensity potentially reduces the online consumer purchase probability by 29.11%, and too little call intensity potentially reduces the online consumer purchase probability by 54.90%.

  abstract     = {Ideation contests are commonly used across public and private sectors to generate new ideas for solving problems, creating designs, and improving products or processes. In such a contest, a firm or an organization (the seeker) outsources an ideation task online to a distributed population of independent agents (solvers) in the form of an open call. Solvers compete to exert efforts and the one with the best solution wins a bounty. In evaluating solutions, the seeker typically has subjective taste that is unobservable to solvers. In practice, the seeker often provides solvers with feedback, which discloses useful information about her private taste. In this study, we develop a game‐theoretic model of feedback in unblind ideation contests, where solvers’ solutions and the seeker&#39;s feedback are publicly visible by all. We show that feedback plays an informative role in mitigating the information asymmetry between the seeker and solvers, thereby inducing solvers to exert more efforts in the contest. We also show that some key contest and solver characteristics (CSC, including contest reward, contest duration, solver expertise, and solver population) have a direct effect on solver effort. Interestingly, by endogenizing the seeker&#39;s feedback decision, we find that the optimal feedback volume increases with contest reward, contest duration, solver expertise, but decreases with solver population. Thus, CSC elements also have an indirect effect on solvers’ effort level, with feedback volume mediating this effect. Employing a dataset from Zhubajie.com , a leading online ideation platform in China, we find empirical evidence that is consistent with these theoretical predictions.},

However, a new environment may involve higher cost uncertainty and severer information asymmetry. Motivated by these observations, we consider a sourcing game where competing firms choose between a supplier with transparent certain cost (type‐C supplier) and a supplier with potentially lower but less transparent, uncertain cost (type‐U supplier). We characterize the equilibrium of the sourcing game and study how different parameters affect the firms’ sourcing strategy and profit performance. First, we find that due to information asymmetry, a large market size can make firms prefer the C‐supplier to the U‐supplier even if the latter has a lower average cost. Second, reducing the cost uncertainty or improving the signal accuracy of the U‐supplier does not necessarily make it more attractive to sourcing firms, which cautions the suppliers when making efforts to mitigate cost uncertainty or improve cost estimation. Third, higher competition intensity makes the diversified sourcing strategy more likely to be adopted under certain conditions. Interestingly, increasing the cost of the C‐supplier (e.g., a cost hike in China) may make both sourcing firms better off because it can lead to a new sourcing equilibrium. Finally, this study shows that the direction of quantity distortion under the optimal competitive mechanism differs from that under the traditional monopolistic setting.},

The failure of any task terminates the project immediately. We show that for projects with certain decreasing failure rates, the ENPV optimization problem can be solved using a linear program. The main focus of our work is on how constant task failure rates contribute to decreasing project risk as tasks are completed. Under constant task failure rate, earlier completion of a task improves its probability of success and the risk profile of the project. However, it may also accelerate costs, which worsen discounted cash flow. We show the equivalence of cash flow discount rate and failure rate. Further, if task failures are independent, then the failure rates are additive. We develop a model that (a) recognizes the reduction in project risk when a task is completed, (b) implements this risk reduction into the ENPV calculation, and (c) permits optimization of the ENPV through sequencing and timing decisions for the tasks. We design an algorithm to solve the problem optimally. This enables us to validate the contributions of our work using two computational studies. The first study demonstrates a significant increase in maximum project ENPV from improved project scheduling. The second study demonstrates a significant increase in total project portfolio value as a result of better informed project selection.

By conducting a field quasi‐experiment using outgoing spam as a focal security issue, this study investigates the effectiveness of reputational sanctions in reducing security negligence in a global context. In the quasi‐experiment, a reputational sanction mechanism based on outgoing spam was established for four countries, and for each country, reputational sanctions were imposed on the 10 organizations with the largest outgoing spam volumes—that is, these organizations were listed publicly. We find that because of our reputational sanction mechanism, organizations in the four countries, including those that were not listed, reduced outgoing spam significantly compared to those in similar countries. Within each country, the listed organizations, whose reputations were actually sanctioned, reduced spam to a greater extent than those that were not listed. The spam reduction in the not‐listed organizations is mainly driven by increased security awareness, while the reduction in the listed organizations is primarily due to reputation effect. Among the listed organizations, those ranked lower were more responsive to the reputational sanctions. Moreover, we find that reputational sanctions have a stronger effect on large organizations and important organizations that provide network access and transit to others.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on determining the appointment scheduling for healthcare facilities with series patients. “Series” patients are patients who are scheduled for a series of appointments instead of a single appointment. Examples of healthcare services with series patients include radiotherapy/chemotherapy for cancer, physical therapy, kidney dialysis, diabetes treatment, etc. The aim of this study is to design appointment scheduling policies taking into account revenues per service per patient, costs of staffing, overtime, overbooking and delay. The appointment scheduling problem is formulated using an MDP model. However, due to the huge state space, computing the optimal policy is impractical. Hence, we propose the Index Policy (IP) based on a one‐step policy improvement algorithm applied to the MDP model. We study a further simplification obtained by approximating the distribution of the number of patient visits by a Geometric distribution. A key analytical contribution is to prove the MDP to be a uni‐chain, which implies that there exists an optimal policy that maximizes the long‐run average profit. We also find that the IP provides a significant improvement over the other policies. Especially with the Geometric approximation, the IP requires minimal effort in implementing, and works almost as well. To test the effectiveness of our proposed IP in a real‐world setting, we use the data from a local physical therapy center to compare its performance with two other commonly used policies, namely, the Next Available Day Policy and the Shortest Queue Policy. We recommend the IP with Geometric approximation for series patients’ scheduling, which is computationally efficient and can significantly increases profits by incorporating the series feature of the patients’ appointments. Finally, we provide analysis that incorporates several practical considerations such as accounting for patient heterogeneity in number of visits and inter‐visit times, the option to reject new patients when the system is at full capacity, and incorporating patients with known number of visits at the time of the scheduling decision.},

The mediator designs a mechanism based on quantity discounts to minimize the overall system costs, attempting to reach a win–win situation for both entities. Using the Revelation Principle, we show that it is in the entities’ self‐interest to reveal their information and we prove that coordination is attainable even under bilateral information asymmetry. The acceptable cost allocation is not unique, providing adequate flexibility to the mediator during mechanism design; the flexibility may reflect the relative power of the entities and is quantified in our work by a series of computational experiments.

  abstract     = {Motivated by the emergence of the Internet‐enabled inventory sharing across firms, we investigate different commitment scenarios of decentralized inventory sharing platforms, through a behavioral lens. In particular, we consider two transfer price commitment settings ( ex ante or ex post depending on whether or not the inventory transfer price is committed before demand realization) and two sharing commitment rules ( automatic or voluntary depending on whether or not inventory sharing are pre‐committed). Our experimental results suggest that individuals set transfer prices much lower, and order much less, than what Nash equilibrium predicts. We also find substantial treatment effects that the rational model cannot explain. The magnitude of disparities relative to the Nash equilibrium prediction appears to be most substantial in the situation where transfer price is set ex ante (i.e., transfer price commitment) and inventory sharing is voluntary (i.e., no sharing commitment). Motivated by these observations, we develop a behavioral model that incorporates quantal response equilibrium and fairness concerns. Empirical analysis indicates that our model provides a compelling explanation of the behavior observed in the data. This study provides implication on the design of the commitment rules in decentralized inventory‐sharing platforms. Specifically, in order to gain the most benefit from inventory sharing, parties should either postpone the decision of transfer price until the need for sharing arises, or pre‐commit to sharing.},

Classical models and conventional wisdom have long ignored that the framing of these buyback schemes, whether through trade‐ins or upgrades, can matter for theory. Using the reference‐point shift mechanism, we provide experimental evidence that the alternative frames are not equivalent and that the framing effect induces customers to change which prices they anchor to as their reference points for the price for their current version. We then use the experimental findings to extend a reference‐dependence version of the classical model of trade‐ins and upgrades and show how the behavioral extension modifies key predictions of the classical model and provides predictions more in line with today&#39;s durable goods markets.},

  abstract     = {We consider a model where a monopolist can profile consumers in order to price discriminate among them, and consumers can take costly actions to protect their identities and make the profiling technology less effective. A novel aspect of the model consists in the profiling technology: the signal that the monopolist gets about a consumer’s willingness‐to‐pay can be made more accurate either by having more consumers revealing their identities, or by spending larger amounts of money (e.g., on third‐party complementary data or data analytics capabilities). We show that both consumer surplus and social welfare are convex in the ability of consumers to conceal their identities. The interest of this result stems from the fact that consumers’ concealing cost can be interpreted as a policy tool: a stricter privacy law would make the concealing cost lower, and vice‐versa. Consequently, a policymaker who promotes total welfare should either make data protection very easy or very costly. The right direction of data regulations depends on data requirements. In particular, a higher (lower) data requirement is an instance when more (less) consumers are needed to achieve the same signal precision. We show that a strict data privacy law is preferable under a high data requirement so that firms are less likely to invest in profiling inefficiently, whereas there is less concern with little or no data regulations under a low data requirement. We also discuss when greater data protection may be beneficial to the firm.},

We investigate whether the benefits of increased volume through pooling patients outweigh the disadvantages of increased heterogeneity and pursue our analysis in the context of neonatal care. Our empirical studies relies on 4020 patient episodes collected in 18 German neonatal intensive care units and we distinguish between two patient clusters that differ with respect to the inherent medical risk and operational heterogeneity. Cluster 1 consists of very‐low birth weight (VLBW) infants with increased risk of complications but similar service trajectories and lower operational heterogeneity. Cluster 2 contains non‐VLBW infants with lower risk of complications but more diversity in disease patterns and higher operational heterogeneity. Our analysis shows that cluster volume, that is, the unit&#39;s absolute patient volume in a cluster, is positively related to process outcomes as indicated by decreasing length of stay. This relationship is found for both clusters. Regarding focus, we do not find any evidence of positive effects. In fact, we even find that cluster focus, that is, the unit&#39;s relative volume of the cluster, is detrimentally related to process outcomes for non‐VLBW patients with lower risk of complications and more operational heterogeneity. This indicates that organizational units providing services for complex patients should not have a narrow focus, but should rather provide services for related patient clusters in order to achieve higher volume levels within the unit.},

In this study, we are concerned with a capacity planning problem in a network of stem‐cell donation centers. The underlying optimization model integrates the operations for a donor search and aims to maximize the number of transplantations. A scenario‐based stochastic programming approach is introduced to investigate the effect of the demand and service time variabilities into the capacity planning problem. We consider the maximum possible waiting time during the search process to obtain robust solutions against uncertainties. For this purpose, we approximate the maximum waiting time in the advanced blood testing with a robust queuing approach.

We first consider a benchmark model in which both retailers adopt traditional category management. Then, we consider a CC model in which the focal retailer implements CC. Comparing the equilibrium outcomes of these two models leads to the following insights: First, despite preventing the emergence of CC in some cases, retail competition increases the upside potential of CC for the focal retailer. Second, the focal retailer’s CC implementation can increase the competing retailer’s market share and profit. Third, a manufacturer may agree to serve as a captain even though CC decreases the profit it generates through the focal retailer channel because retail competition enables it to recoup its losses through the competing retailer channel. Last, retail competition alleviates concerns about the potential negative impact of CC on consumers. We discuss the implications of the study for retailers, manufacturers, and policymakers.},

  abstract     = {This study considers the scheduling of limited resources to a large number of jobs (e.g., medical treatment) with uncertain lifetimes and service times, in the aftermath of a mass casualty incident. Jobs are subject to triage at time zero, and placed into a number of classes. Our goal is to maximize the expected number of job completions. We propose an effective yet simple index policy based on Whittle’s restless bandits approach. The problem concerned features a finite and uncertain time horizon that is dependent upon the service policy, which also determines the decision epochs. Moreover, the number of job classes still competing for service diminishes over time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Whittle’s index policies to such problems. Two versions of Lagrangian relaxation are proposed in order to decompose the problem. The first is a direct extension of the standard Whittle’s restless bandits approach, while in the second the total number of job classes still competing for service is taken into account; the latter is shown to generalize the former. We prove the indexability of all job classes in the Markovian case, and develop closed‐form indices. Extensive numerical experiments show that the second proposal outperforms the first one (that fails to capture the dynamics in the number of surviving job classes, or bandits) and produces more robust and consistent results as compared to alternative heuristics suggested from the literature, even in non‐Markovian settings.},

  abstract     = {Developing a complex new product requires the firm both to deconstruct that product into subsystems and to create an organizational structure aligned with the product architecture. However, empirical evidence indicates that misalignments do occur and are usually one of two general forms: a “hidden dependency,” which is a missing link between teams responsible for two interacting subsystems; or “spurious communications” between two teams that interact even though their respective subsystems are not linked. We model the product development process as a search on a rugged landscape and study how misalignments affect the performance of the process in both design quality and convergence time. We find that the effects are mediated by the organizational decision‐making structure, and also by the interaction pattern among product subsystems. For instance, with a modular design, a project with a hidden dependency yields higher quality design solutions than a project with spurious communications or an aligned project. However, hidden dependencies cause a longer convergence time. Further, in modular designs spurious communications do not impact quality or convergence time when compared with aligned projects. The effect in non‐modular product designs depends on the organizational decision‐making structure and managerial capability. When decisions are made in a centralized organization that employs a capable manager, spurious communications improve the design quality but could delay the convergence time. We trace the cause of these effects to errors committed by teams in rejecting superior designs, which make the search process more exploratory and covering a wider area of the search landscape.},

To address such issues, we build on the literature on goal programming and frame the problem of generating competitive intelligence at the product‐market level as a matrix‐balancing problem, where products, firms, and markets represent the dimensions of the market‐sensing matrix. We develop a decision support system for firms to generate and update the market‐sensing matrix over time using weighted integer goal programming. Utilizing data from multiple sources (internal firm data, commercial market data, and secondary data), we create a set of linear restrictions and use goal programming approach to update the market‐sensing matrix. We demonstrate—(i) the proposed approach using data from a large multimedia firm that offers multiple products in various markets with many competitors, and (ii) benefits of implementing our approach.

Selective assembly is a strategy that is widely used by high‐precision manufacturing companies to gain a competitive advantage in product quality. The use of inexpensive intermediary components (e.g., bearings) to ensure that all mating components are matched with acceptable clearance is a contemporary way of reducing shortage and surplus component costs associated with the traditional fixed‐bin selective assembly process. We develop and analyze a Bayesian model for information sharing in this environment, with results indicating that substantial savings occur with the use of shared information from the supplier in a fixed‐bin selective assembly of an intermediary‐component (FBSAI) context. However, there is a hierarchy regarding benefits, whereas the sharing of information which includes the process mean is most beneficial, and the sharing of only process variance information is least beneficial. The savings can assist the assembler in determining the investment required to create and maintain a profitable quality‐distribution information‐sharing network of suppliers, thus making the shared information advantageous for both the buying and selling organization.},

  abstract     = {We consider a discrete‐time infinite‐horizon inventory system with non‐stationary demand, full backlogging, and deterministic replenishment lead time. Demand arrives according to a probability distribution conditional on the state of the world that undergoes Markovian transitions over time. But the actual state of the world can only be imperfectly estimated based on past demand data. We model the inventory replenishment problem for this system as a Markov decision process (MDP) with an uncountable state space consisting of both the inventory position and the most recent belief , a conditional probability mass function, about the actual state of the world. Assuming that the state of the world evolves as an ergodic Markov chain, using the vanishing discount method along with a coupling argument, we prove the existence of an optimal average cost that is independent of the initial system state. For our linear cost structure, we also establish the average‐cost optimality of a belief‐dependent base‐stock policy. We then discretize the uncountable belief space into a regular grid and observe that the average cost under our discretization converges to the optimal average cost as the number of grid points grows large. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the use of a myopic belief‐dependent base‐stock policy as a heuristic for our MDP with the uncountable state space. On a test bed of 108 instances, the average cost obtained from the myopic policy deviates by no more than a few percent from the best lower bound on the optimal average cost obtained from our discretization.},

  abstract     = {Effective operations require the coordination of distributed knowledge. Division and distance across teams and specialties form barriers to communication, creating insulated pockets of knowledge along geographic and specialty borders. Such fragmentation can hamper a company&#39;s ability to fully utilize existing knowledge, potentially hurting its productivity in the long run. As such, many companies have created internal online knowledge communities, in which employees can exchange solutions in various knowledge domains anywhere in the world. Although online knowledge communities offer an exciting potential to mobilize knowledge across locations and specialties virtually, little is known about whether such mobilization of knowledge happens in reality. The objective of this study is to advance our understanding of the effectiveness of an online knowledge community in promoting distance‐ and specialty‐crossing knowledge sharing. To this end, we analyze knowledge sharing patterns in an online knowledge community of a global Fortune 500 consulting company that provides knowledge‐intensive services. We find that, despite the global connectivity enabled by the Internet, knowledge is still circulated mostly within a smaller group of employees who are nearby or who have the same specialties in the online knowledge community. This finding indicates that existing knowledge is not efficiently utilized across locations and specialties; thus, companies are missing learning opportunities.},

  abstract     = {There is a vast literature on optimizing store brand quality, but it does not address the individual and joint effects of sourcing and pricing power; this is the focus of our paper. We study a retailer’s store‐brand quality‐positioning problem under three sourcing structures and two types of price leadership. The three sources are in‐house (IH), a leading national‐brand manufacturer (NBM) with a competing product, and a strategic third‐party manufacturer (3M). We consider two forms of price leadership, Manufacturer‐Stackelberg (MS) and Retailer‐Stackelberg (RS). We fully characterize the retailer’s optimal quality levels and their relative values across the six scenarios, as well as equilibrium prices, retail profits, consumer welfare, and supply chain profits. Among other things, we find that the retailer chooses lower quality when sourcing from NBM than from other sources to benefit from quality differentiation as there are few other points of leverage. On the other hand, she chooses a higher quality when sourcing from 3M vs. producing IH because, despite the double marginalization, a higher‐quality store brand induces greater competition between 3M and NBM, which benefits the retailer. We also show that the power to decide the source is more important to the retailer than having pricing power.},

  abstract     = {Inventory management in most practical settings faces challenges due to various restrictions on storage and replenishment of products. These restrictions may be posed by budget availability, different production/supply schedules for different products, and limited storage space shared by a number of products—very common in retail, food, and the pharmaceutical industry. Motivated by this, we investigate in this study how simultaneous restrictions on shared storage capacity and product‐specific order capacities impact optimal replenishments in a multi‐product system. We formulate the inventory replenishment problem as a multi‐period stochastic dynamic program, where products face stochastic demand with general distributions and excess demand is lost or fulfilled by emergency orders. We first fully characterize the optimal replenishment policy for two‐product systems, and provide a methodology to compute optimal replenishment quantities, which can be described as a dynamic priority‐based replenishment rule. Our results show that for each product, the optimal replenishment priority as well as quantity depends on the inventory levels of both products and all available capacities. More interestingly, the results show that capacity restrictions can flip the stocking priorities of products. Based on the optimal policy for two‐product systems, we develop a heuristic for multi‐product systems whose complexity scales linearly with the number of products. Under moderate storage capacities, our heuristic significantly outperforms the naive heuristics that ignore dynamic priority assignment, and closely captures the benefits of the optimal policy for systems with large number of products.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study customers’ learning behaviors in service operations systems, when the customers hold incorrect beliefs about the population distribution (“projection effects”). We propose a basic model wherein the customers are heterogeneous in both delay sensitivity and awareness of service quality, which explains “rational hesitations”: The uninformed and patient customers obfuscate the quality signaled by the queue length for the uninformed and impatient customers, who wait and join when the queue becomes longer. Ironically, with such bounded rationality, the customers who are more averse to waiting will react more sensitively to the observed long queue, which leads to an overestimation of the service quality and waiting in the long queue. Such bounded rationality also impedes effective learning by inducing decision errors, which, among other consequences, reduces the social welfare due to a blind “buying frenzy” even if the service quality is low.},

  abstract     = {A manufacturer commonly distributes through a set of retailers who are authorized to sell its product; demand‐enhancing services may also be provided by the manufacturer. These services may be granted to all authorized retailers ( uniform service provision) or to a favored few authorized retailers ( differential service provision). To determine when a manufacturer does—or does not—bestow equal service levels, we develop a model of one manufacturer selling through two competing retailers. We find manufacturer optimality to entail uniform service at some parametric values, while differential service is optimal at other values. Counterintuitively, with differential service, the recipient of lower service may be better off than it would be with higher service. Equally surprisingly, there are conditions for which the high‐service retailer prefers its rival to also receive a high level of service—but only if its rival is sufficiently small. While the three channel members often have different service‐provision preferences, there are also parametric values that place them in harmony with either differential or uniform service provision. Retailers sharing the cost of manufacturer‐provided service need not lessen firms’ preference confliction over the preferred service provision but can improve channel efficiency when the cost‐sharing rate is relatively low. We also investigate the effect of retailer‐provided services and the impact of service asymmetry level.},

Instead, the optimal compensation is S‐shaped under certain conditions. Second, under the stochastic demand response, the classical optimality result of the menu of linear compensation schemes fails to hold with the consideration of supply–demand mismatch costs.

  abstract     = {Opaque selling is a marketing strategy under which firms sell end‐of‐the‐season inventory of different products as a single opaque good and customers find out the specific products they actually get only after they have made the purchase. Opaque selling entails a “double‐blind” process: customers do not know the inventory level of each product, and the seller does not know their product preferences. This double‐blind process can result in customer dissatisfaction when customers do not receive the products they were hoping for, and the seller is unable to allocate the right product to the right customer. To reduce customer dissatisfaction arising from the double‐blind process, we examine whether the seller should: (i) reveal its inventory information to customers, (ii) solicit each customer’s product preference, or (iii) charge customers a higher price for removing product uncertainty; that is, sell specific goods and opaque good at the same time. To examine these issues, we analyze a model in which a firm sells two products as a single opaque good. We show that revealing inventory information or soliciting customer preferences results in higher customer surplus, but lower revenue for the firm. We then consider the case when the firm sells specific goods and opaque good at the same time. We show that relative to the case of selling only the opaque good, the firm’s revenue is strictly higher and customer surplus may be higher or lower. Specifically, when the price of specific goods is product dependent, selling specific goods and opaque good at the same time benefits the firm the most when the inventory levels of the two products are relatively balanced and their valuations are strongly skewed. When the price of specific goods is product independent, however, the firm gains the most when the inventory levels are relatively balanced but their valuations are not too strongly skewed. We also identify conditions under which the customer surplus is higher.},

  abstract     = {We study a horizontal merger in an oligopolistic market in which firms compete on production quantities. Each firm has its own in‐house manufacturing facility, and the production is subject to random yield. After the consolidation of two firms, the merged entity can use both manufacturing facilities that belong to the merging firms. It is well known that diversification can reduce the aggregate supply uncertainty of a firm, but this diversification benefit has not been explored in a merger analysis. We model the effects of reduced competition, cost synergy, and supply diversification from a merger and characterize their combined impact on firms’ production quantities and expected profits. Our analysis highlights the importance of yield correlation. In the postmerger model, although an increase in yield correlation intensifies end‐market competition and lowers the diversification benefit, it can increase the merged firm&#39;s expected profit. This is more likely to occur as the synergy effect increases, the number of competing firm increases, and the yield variance decreases. We also compare the premerger and postmerger equilibrium production quantity and expected profit of each firm. We show that there exists threshold levels of cost synergy above (or below) which the postmerger equilibrium profits or quantities exceed their premerger counterparts. We also show that, under yield uncertainty, firms may have an incentive to merge even without cost synergy due to the diversification benefit. With deterministic demand, cost synergy is necessary to justify a merger.},

Besides, they may also supply disruption risk, under which a supplier could fail to deliver the quantity ordered at all. In this study, we discuss how to mitigate supply disruption and recall risks in the perspective of ( outbound ) product distribution strategy in joint with ( inbound ) sourcing decision. Specifically, we compare the dedicated and uniform distribution strategies as follows: in the dedicated strategy, the firm divides its market into several regions, and ships products from different suppliers based on the regions; whereas, in the uniform strategy, the firm serves the entire market by randomly shipping the products from several suppliers without distinguishing their sources. Through the comparison of both strategies, we show that the role of recall risk is different from that of supply disruption on the sourcing and distribution decision. In particular, single sourcing is optimal when both recall risk and disruption probability are low; dual sourcing with the dedicated strategy is optimal when the disruption probability is moderate and the recall risk is high; dual sourcing with the uniform strategy is optimal when the disruption probability is high. We also find that the positive correlation in recalls improves (undermines) the performance of the uniform (dedicated) strategy. In contrast, the positive correlation in supply disruptions only undermines the performance of the uniform strategy.},
