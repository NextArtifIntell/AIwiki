  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the success of representation-based classification method (RBCM) in the domain of face recognition. Collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) and linear regression-based classification (LRC) are two representative approaches. CRC is a global representation method which uses all training samples to represent test samples and utilizes representation residuals to perform classification, whereas LRC is a local representation method which exploits training samples from each class to represent test samples. Related researches indicate that the combination of LRC and CRC can fully exploit the representation residuals produced by them, thus improving the performance of RBCM. However, the representation coefficients obtained by CRC usually contain negative values which may result in overfitting problem. Therefore, to solve this problem to some extent, the combination of LRC and non-negative least square-based classification (NNLSC) is proposed in this paper. Experimental results on benchmark face datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the combination of LRC and CRC and other state-of-the-art RBCMs. The source code of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/li-zi-qi/score-level-fusion-of-NNLS-and-LRC .},

As a tremendous amount of efforts have been devoted to develop mathematical models for investigating the elastic behaviors of human blood vessels, high performance numerical algorithms aiming at solving these models have attracted attention. In this work, we present an efficient finite element solver for an elastodynamic model which is commonly used for simulating soft tissues under external pressure loadings. In particular, the elastic material is assumed to satisfy the Saint–Venant–Kirchhoff law, the governing equation is spatially discretized by a finite element method, and a fully implicit backward difference method is used for the temporal discretization. The resulting nonlinear system is then solved by a Newton–Krylov–Schwarz method. It is the first time to apply the Newton–Krylov–Schwarz method to the Saint–Venant–Kirchhoff model for a patient-specific blood vessel. Numerical tests verify the efficiency of the proposed method and demonstrate its capability for bioengineering applications.},

Traditional transform domain-based image fusion methods usually ignore the dependencies between coefficients and may lead to the inaccurate representation of source image. To improve the quality of fused image, a medical image fusion method based on the dependencies of quaternion wavelet transform coefficients is proposed. First, the source images are decomposed into low-frequency component and high-frequency component by quaternion wavelet transform. Then, a clarity evaluation index based on quaternion wavelet transform amplitude and phase is constructed and a contextual activity measure is designed. These measures are utilized to fuse the high-frequency coefficients and the choose-max fusion rule is applied to the low-frequency components. Finally, the fused image can be obtained by inverse quaternion wavelet transform. The experimental results on some brain multi-modal medical images demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved advanced fusion result.},

Therefore, the paper is to propose a control method based on generalized internal model control, which is based on feedback and Youla parameterization, including performance controller and compensation controller. The performance controller is used to make the electric power steering system work well, while the compensation controller is used to solve model uncertain and external interference. First of all, the paper is to establish the model of electric power steering system, introduce the 2DOF vehicle and the tire model, set up the state space of the electric steering system including model uncertain and interference and design the generalized internal model controller. Finally, the simulation and the hardware-in-the-loop experiment are carried out to verify the controller. The results show that the proposed controller takes advantages of better control performance, solving model uncertain and external interference, and improving the performance and robustness of the system.},

The model consists in solving a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation by weighting the diffusion operator with a function which will be selected locally and adaptively.

  abstract     = {Based on the study of multi-objective flexible workshop scheduling problem and the learning of traditional genetic algorithm, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is proposed to solve and optimize the scheduling model with the objective functions of processing cycle, advance/delay penalty and processing cost. In the process of optimization, non-dominated fast ranking operator and competition operator are used to select the descendant operator, which improves the computational efficiency and optimization ability of the algorithm. Non-repetitive non-dominant solutions and frontier sets are found in the iteration operation to retain the optimal results. Finally, taking a manufacturing workshop as an example, the practicability of the proposed algorithm is verified by the simulation operation of the workshop scheduling information and the comparison with other algorithms. The results show that the algorithm can obtain the optimal solution more quickly than the unimproved algorithm. The improved algorithm is faster and more effective in searching, and has certain feasibility in solving the job shop scheduling problem, which is more suitable for industrial processing and production.},

The original problem is split into linear and nonlinear subproblems. The Fourier spectral method is adopted for the linear part, and a second-order SSP-RK method together with the Fourier spectral method is used for the nonlinear part. The scheme takes advantage of avoiding nonlinear iteration. However, the temporal error is dominated by the operator splitting error, which is second order for Strang splitting. In order to achieve higher order numerical algorithm in time, we consider a semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method to reduce the splitting error. Specifically, the temporal order is increased by one with each correction loop in the SDC framework. Numerical results are given to illustrate that the high order temporal algorithm is a practical, accurate and efficient simulation tool for molecular beam epitaxial growth models.},

Compared with the traditional data processing methods, artificial intelligence, as the main big data analysis method, is more and more applied to the manufacturing industry. However, the ability of different AI models to process real-time data of smart job shop production is also different. Based on this, a real-time big data processing method for the job shop production process based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed. This method uses the historical production data extracted by the IoT job shop as the original data set, and after data preprocessing, uses the LSTM and GRU model to train and predict the real-time data of the job shop. Through the description and implementation of the model, it is compared with KNN, DT and traditional neural network model. The results show that in the real-time big data processing of production process, the performance of the LSTM and GRU models is superior to the traditional neural network, K nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT). When the performance is similar to LSTM, the training time of GRU is much lower than LSTM model.},

The first devise an energy optimization algorithm to reduce the motor losses by calculation of the stator flux reference according to the electromagnetic torque and the rotation speed. The second is concerned with controller parameters adjustment using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to improve the efficacy and robustness of the drive. The performance of this strategy is evaluated in terms of torque, flux ripples, and transient response to step variations of the torque control. A comparative study of the designed PI controllers based on PSO with four other control algorithms and tuning methods is established in order to prove the efficiency of PI_PSO.

  abstract     = {Different from image segmentation, developing a deep learning network for image registration is less straightforward because training data cannot be prepared or supervised by humans unless they are trivial (e.g. pre-designed affine transforms). One approach for an unsupervised deep leaning model is to self-train the deformation fields by a network based on a loss function with an image similarity metric and a regularisation term, just with traditional variational methods. Such a function consists in a smoothing constraint on the derivatives and a constraint on the determinant of the transformation in order to obtain a spatially smooth and plausible solution. Although any variational model may be used to work with a deep learning algorithm, the challenge lies in achieving robustness. The proposed algorithm is first trained based on a new and robust variational model and tested on synthetic and real mono-modal images. The results show how it deals with large deformation registration problems and leads to a real time solution with no folding. It is then generalised to multi-modal images. Experiments and comparisons with learning and non-learning models demonstrate that this approach can deliver good performances and simultaneously generate an accurate diffeomorphic transformation.},

  abstract     = {Variational methods for image registration basically involve a regularizer to ensure that the resulting well-posed problem admits a solution. Different choices of regularizers lead to different deformations. On one hand, the conventional regularizers, such as the elastic, diffusion and curvature regularizers, are able to generate globally smooth deformations and generally useful for many applications. On the other hand, these regularizers become poor in some applications where discontinuities or steep gradients in the deformations are required. As is well-known, the total (TV) variation regularizer is more appropriate to preserve discontinuities of the deformations. However, it is difficult in developing an efficient numerical method to ensure that numerical solutions satisfy this requirement because of the non-differentiability and non-linearity of the TV regularizer. In this work we focus on computational challenges arising in approximately solving TV-based image registration model. Motivated by many efficient numerical algorithms in image restoration, we propose to use augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). At each iteration, the computation of our ALM requires to solve two subproblems. On one hand for the first subproblem, it is impossible to obtain exact solution. On the other hand for the second subproblem, it has a closed-form solution. To this end, we propose an efficient nonlinear multigrid (NMG) method to obtain an approximate solution to the first subproblem. Numerical results on real medical images not only confirm that our proposed ALM is more computationally efficient than some existing methods, but also that the proposed ALM delivers the accurate registration results with the desired property of the constructed deformations in a reasonable number of iterations.},

The dynamic cooperation between the particles by using the context vector increases the population diversity helps to improve the search ability of the swarm and cooperatively searches for the global optimum. The performance of CRDPSO is tested on standard benchmark problems including multimodal and unimodal functions. The empirical results show that CRDPSO outperforms other well-known stochastic optimization methods.},

  abstract     = {Human action recognition is a very popular field in computer vision research, and the research results are widely used in people&#39;s lives. This paper explores Kinect-based algorithm of human action recognition and applies it to the quality evaluation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) operation. At present, the main means of CRP training is through physical auxiliary equipment, which has a large limitation and can only be carried out under specific conditions. CPR simulation training under general conditions can be effectively carried out by means of computer vision, which is a strategy worth popularizing. Using Kinect&#39;s powerful skeleton tracking capabilities to obtain key human skeleton data and then perform fine-grained human action analysis. Our model can obtain the critical compression depth (CCD) and compression frequency (CCF) of CPR. Compared with the-state-of-the-art, our algorithm has better stability and real-time performance. At the same time, our algorithm improves the time efficiency by about 60% while guaranteeing high accuracy. In addition, we guide the human body to perform standard movements by setting joint angle specifications.Moreover, our system has been proven to be valid by professional medical staff.},
