It also plans traversal across wavefields generated by these vessels and minimizes the risk of failure. Our method searches over a state-space consisting of pose and time. And, it produces collision-free and minimum-risk trajectory. It uses a lookup table to account for motion uncertainty and failure risk. We also present speed-up techniques to increase performance. Our wave-aware planner produces plans that (1) have shorter execution times and safer when compared to previously developed reactive planning schemes and (2) comply with user-defined wave-traversal constraints and Collision Regulations (COLREGs)},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a robust place recognition measurement in natural environments based on salient landmark screening and convolutional neural network (CNN) features. First, the salient objects in the image are segmented as candidate landmarks. Then, a category screening network is designed to remove specific object types that are not suitable for environmental modeling. Finally, a three-layer CNN is used to get highly representative features of the salient landmarks. In the similarity measurement, a Siamese network is chosen to calculate the similarity between images. Experiments were conducted on three challenging benchmark place recognition datasets and superior performance was achieved compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including FABMAP, SeqSLAM, SeqCNNSLAM, and PlaceCNN. Our method obtains the best results on the precision–recall curves, and the average precision reaches 78.43%, which is the best of the comparison methods. This demonstrates that the CNN features on the screened salient landmarks can be against a strong viewpoint and condition variations.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition plays an important role in many robotic and human–computer interaction systems. To this end, in recent years, sparse-representation-based classification and its variants have drawn extensive attention in compress sensing and pattern recognition. For image classification, one key to the success of a sparse-representation-based approach is to extract consistent image feature representations for the images of the same subject captured under a wide spectrum of appearance variations, for example, in pose, expression and illumination. These variations can be categorized into two main types: geometric and textural variations. To eliminate the difficulties posed by different appearance variations, the article presents a new collaborative-representation-based face classification approach using deep aligned neural network features. To be more specific, we first apply a facial landmark detection network to an input face image to obtain its fine-grained geometric information in the form of a set of 2D facial landmarks. These facial landmarks are then used to perform 2D geometric alignment across different face images. Second, we apply a deep neural network for facial image feature extraction due to the robustness of deep image features to a variety of appearance variations. We use the term deep aligned features for this two-step feature extraction approach. Last, a new collaborative-representation-based classification method is used to perform face classification. Specifically, we propose a group dictionary selection method for representation-based face classification to further boost the performance and reduce the uncertainty in decision-making. Experimental results obtained on several facial landmark detection and face classification data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The proposed ILC algorithm is applied in accordance with the observed motion information to increase the robustness of the system in path tracking. The convergence of the presented learning algorithm is derived as the number of iterations tends to infinity under a specified condition.

  abstract     = {With the growth of the number of elderly and disabled with motor dysfunction, the demand for assisted exercise is increasing. Wearable power assistance robots are developed to provide athletic ability of limbs for the elderly or the disabled who have weakened limbs to better self-care ability. Existing wearable power-assisted robots generally use surface electromyography (sEMG) to obtain effective human motion intentions. Due to the characteristics of sEMG signals, it is limited in many applications. To solve the above problems, we design a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model based on human mechanomyography (MMG) signals to estimate the motion acceleration of knee joint. The acceleration can be further calculated by the torque required for movement control of the wearable power assistance robots for the lower limb. We detect MMG signals on the clothed thigh, extract features of the MMG signals, and then, use principal component analysis to reduce the features’ dimensions. Finally, the dimension-reduced features are inputted into the LSTM neural network model in time series for estimating the acceleration. The experimental results show that the average correlation coefficient ( R ) is 94.48 ± 1.91% for the estimation of acceleration in the process of continuously performing under approximately π /4 rad/s. This approach can be applied in the practical applications of wearable field.},

First, we propose an artificial vector field method by following the global optimally path and the current to maximize the known environmental information. Then, to improve the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) based planner by the environment heuristics, a Gaussian sampling scheme is adopted to seek for the likely samples that locate near obstacles. Meanwhile, a multisampling strategy is proposed to choose low-cost path tree extensions locally. The vector field guidance, the Gaussian sampling scheme, and the multisampling strategy are used to improve the efficiency of RRT* to obtain a low-cost path for the virtual leader of USVs. To promote the accuracy of collision detection during the execution process of RRT*, an ellipse function-based bounding box for USVs is proposed with the consideration of the current. Finally, an information consensus scheme is employed to quickly calculate cooperative paths for a fleet of USVs guided by the virtual leader. Simulation results show that our online cooperative path planning method is performed well in the practical marine environment.},

In this work, a model-based control approach is proposed to control the position of the head, that is, the rigid body attached to the top of the continuum mechanism. Herein, the system is modeled as a rigid body on top of a nonlinear Cartesian spring, with an experimentally obtained deflection characteristic which provides a simple and real-time capable model. By nonlinear feedback, the output dynamics are linearized and decoupled, which enables the design of single-input single-output fractional-order controllers for the regulation of each output independently. The design of a fractional-order P D α controller is discussed to incorporate robustness and a fast transient response. The proposed control approach is tested in several experiments on the real system.},

On the other hand, semiautonomous vehicles achieve partial realization of autonomy with human intervention, for example, in driver-assisted vehicles. Autonomous vehicles first interact with their surrounding using mounted sensors. Typically, visual sensors are used to acquire images, and computer vision techniques, signal processing, machine learning, and other techniques are applied to acquire, process, and extract information. The control subsystem interprets sensory information to identify appropriate navigation path to its destination and action plan to carry out tasks. Feedbacks are also elicited from the environment to improve upon its behavior. To increase sensing accuracy, autonomous vehicles are equipped with many sensors [light detection and ranging (LiDARs), infrared, sonar, inertial measurement units, etc.], as well as communication subsystem. Autonomous vehicles face several challenges such as unknown environments, blind spots (unseen views), non-line-of-sight scenarios, poor performance of sensors due to weather conditions, sensor errors, false alarms, limited energy, limited computational resources, algorithmic complexity, human–machine communications, size, and weight constraints. To tackle these problems, several algorithmic approaches have been implemented covering design of sensors, processing, control, and navigation. The review seeks to provide up-to-date information on the requirements, algorithms, and main challenges in the use of machine vision–based techniques for navigation and control in autonomous vehicles. An application using land-based vehicle as an Internet of Thing-enabled platform for pedestrian detection and tracking is also presented.},

An approximate friction model which is proposed by Kostic et al. is applied to establish the dynamic model with Lagrange method. Parameters identification is completed by least square method, and the tracking accuracy and the stability of the robot are systematically analyzed before and after dynamic compensation at different speeds. Its position error of the robot after compensation is only 0.98 mm at low speed. The accuracy is improved 10 times than that before compensation. In addition, the peak velocity errors are 3.97 mm·s −1 and 1.49 mm·s −1 at high and low speed, respectively, which are reduced 2.5 times than that before compensation. The experimental data also indicate that velocity tracking curve has no obvious peak error compared with the common method based on Coulomb and viscous friction model. The curve is much smoother with proposed model, and the motion stability of robot at high speed has been greatly improved. The proposed method just needs the robot to collect some positions before path tracing, and the parameters identification of dynamic model can be completed quickly. The compensation effect is much more better than common method. So the proposed method can be extended to complete the dynamic identification for complex robot with more joints. It is helpful to further improve the stability and the accuracy at high speed.},

A dedicated assist-as-needed control is designed to operate the device for the required movements. The proposed control strategy is also integrated into a gaming software for stimulating the exercising by means of various interactions with patients. Experimental tests are carried out with 14 healthy subjects at the Physiotherapy Clinical Hospital of the Federal University of Uberlandia. Also, three patients with stroke have been enrolled in a pilot clinical testing. Each of the patients has been involved in four sessions per month with 15 min of assisted treatment. Results of experimental tests are analyzed in terms of improvements and amplitude gains for the flexion and extension wrist movements.

  abstract     = {The utilization of upper extremity exoskeleton robots has been proved to be a scientifically effective approach for rehabilitation training. In the process of rehabilitation training, it is necessary to detect the fatigue degree during rehabilitation training in order to formulate a reasonable training plan and achieve better training efficiency. Based on the integral value of surface electromyography (sEMG), heart rate variability, and instantaneous heart rate, this article proposes a fatigue judgment method for multi-information fusion. Based on the integral value data, the feature extraction of the bioelectrical signals were implemented separately, then the fatigue recognition was conducted using the decision-level data fusion method. The bioelectrical signal acquisition system of electromyogram signals and electrocardiograph signals was developed for upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot, and the acquisition and processing of electromyogram signals and electrocardiograph signals were completed. Finally, the fuzzy logic controller with instantaneous heart rate, heart rate variability, and surface electromyography signal was designed to judge fatigue degree, including the fuzzy device, fuzzy rule selector, and defuzzifier. The moderate fatigue state data were selected for testing, and the experimental results showed that the error of fatigue judgment is 4.3%, which satisfies the requirements of fatigue judgment.},

  abstract     = {Path tracking is one of the most important aspects of autonomous vehicles. The current research focuses on designing path-tracking controllers taking into account the stability of the yaw and the nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle. In most cases, the lateral controller design relies on identifying a path reference point, the one with the shortest distance to the vehicle giving the current state of the vehicle. That restricts the controller’s ability to handle sudden changes of the trajectory heading angle. The present article proposes a new approach that imitates human behavior while driving. It is based on a discrete prediction model that anticipates the future states of the vehicle, allowing the use of the control algorithm in future predicted states augmented with the current controller output. The performance of the proposed approach is verified through several simulations on V-REP simulator with different types of maneuvers (double lane change, hook road, S road, and curved road) and a wide range of velocities. Predictive Stanley controller was used compared to the original Stanley controller. The obtained results of the proposed control approach show the advantage and the performance of the technique in terms of minimizing the lateral error and ensuring yaw stability by an average of 53% and 22%, respectively.},

For a long time, it has been very difficult to develop machines capable of generating or understanding even fragments of natural languages; the fused sight, smelling, touching, and so on provide machines with possible mediums to perceive and understand. This article presents a detailed review of recent advances in audiovisual speech recognition area. After explicitly representing audiovisual speech recognition development phase divided by timeline, we focus on typical audiovisual speech database descriptions in terms of single view and multi-view, since the public databases for general purpose should be the first concern for audiovisual speech recognition tasks. For the following challenges that are inseparably related to the feature extraction and dynamic audiovisual fusion, the principal usefulness of deep learning-based tools, such as deep fully convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory network, 3D convolutional neural network, and so on, lies in the fact that they are relatively simple solutions of such problems. As the principle analyses and comparisons related to computational load, accuracy, and applicability of well-developed audiovisual speech recognition frameworks have been conducted, we further illuminate our insights into the future audiovisual speech recognition architecture design. We argue that end-to-end audiovisual speech recognition model and deep learning-based feature extractors will guide multimodality human–computer interaction directly to a solution.},

It is a challenge to detect such defects in a vision system because of the unequal reflection property of oil seal surfaces and low contrast between the defect and the background. This article proposes a visual detection method (VDM) for oil seal surface defects and outlines two key issues of VDMs. First, we present a superpixel segmentation algorithm based on the significant gray level variation in the radial direction of an oil seal surface image. This image is then divided into several ring belts. Subsequently, considering the reflection inequality and low contrast, we propose a new circumferential background difference algorithm based on the small variation along the circumferential direction of the image. This algorithm eliminates the influence of the reflection inequality and improves the contrast distinction between the defects and the background. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method with a recall and precision as high as 95.2% and 86.8%, respectively.},

However, this problem usually interacts with robot calibration because robot geometric parameters are not very precise. In this article, a new calibration method considering the rotation parameters of the robot pose is proposed. First, a constraint least square model is established assuming that each spherical center measurement of standard ball is equal in the robot base frame, which provides an initial solution. To further improve the solution accuracy, a nonlinear calibration model in the sensor frame is established. Since it can reduce one error accumulation process, a more accurate reference point can be used for optimization. Then, the rotation parameters of the robot pose whose slight errors cause large disturbance to the solution are selected by analyzing the coefficient matrices of the error items. Finally, the hand-eye transformation parameters are refined together with the rotation parameters in the nonlinear optimization solution. Some comparative simulations are performed between the modified least square method, constrained least square method, and the proposed method. The experiments are conducted on a 5-axis hybrid robot named TriMule to demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method.},

Aiming at the above problems, this article proposes an improved V-SLAM method based on scene segmentation and incremental optimization strategy. In the front end, this article proposes a scene segmentation algorithm considering camera motion direction and angle. By segmenting the trajectory and adding camera motion direction to the tracking thread, an effective prediction model of camera motion in the scene with sparse landmarks and large view transformation is realized. In the back end, this article proposes an incremental optimization method combining segmentation information and an optimization method for tracking prediction model. By incrementally adding the state parameters and reusing the computed results, high-precision results of the camera trajectory and feature points are obtained with satisfactory computing speed. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated by two well-known datasets: TUM RGB-D and NYUDv2 RGB-D. The experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the computational efficiency by 10.2% compared with state-of-the-art V-SLAMs on the desktop platform and by 22.4% on the embedded platform, respectively.

  abstract     = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) have been focused on improving people’s lifestyles with motor or communication disabilities. However, the utilization of this technology has found news applications, such as increasing human capacities. Nowadays, several researchers are working on probing human capabilities to control several robotic devices simultaneously. The design of BCI is an intricate work that needs a long time to its implementation. For this reason, an architecture to design and implement different types of BCIs is presented in this article. The architecture has a modular design capable of reading various electroencephalography (EEG) sensors and controlling several robotic devices similar to the plug-and-play paradigm. To test the proposed architecture, a BCI was able to manage a hexapod robot and a drone was implemented. Firstly, a mobile robotic platform was designed and implemented. The BCI is based on eye blinking, where a single blinking represents a robot command. The command orders the robot to initiate or stops their locomotion for the hexapod robot. For the drone, a blink represents the takeoff or landing order. The blinking signals are obtained from the prefrontal and frontal regions of the head by EEG sensors. The signals are then filtered using temporal filters, with cutoff frequencies based on delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves. The filtered signals were labeled and used to train a classifier based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. To generate the robot command, the proposal BCI used two models of MLP to ensure the classifier prediction. So, when the two classifiers make the same prediction, within a defined time interval, send the signal to the robot to start or stop its movement. The obtained results show that it is possible to get high precision to control the hexapod robot with a precision of 91.7% and an average of 81.4%.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a tracking control design for two-link robot manipulators. To achieve robust tracking control performance, a super-twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) is derived. The stability of the system based on the proposed approach is proved based on the Lyapunov theorem. However, one problem with the designed STSMC is to properly set its parameters during the design. Therefore, it is proposed a social spider optimization (SSO) to tune these design parameters to improve the dynamic performance of the robot manipulator controlled considering STSMC. The performance of the STSMC approach based on SSO is compared to that based on particle swarming optimization (PSO) in terms of dynamic performance and robustness characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed optimal controllers is verified by simulations within the MATLAB software. It is verified that the performance given by SSO-based STSMC outperforms that resulting from PSO-based STSMC. The experimental results are conducted based on LabVIEW 2019 software to validate the numerical simulation.},

  abstract     = {Human drivers have rich and diverse driving characteristics on curved roads. Finding the characteristic quantities of the experienced drivers during curve driving and applying them to the steering control of autonomous vehicles is the research goal of this article. We first recruited 10 taxi drivers, 5 bus drivers, and 5 driving instructors as the representatives of experienced drivers and conducted a real car field experiment on six curves with different lengths and curvatures. After processing the collected driving data in the Frenet frame and considering the free play of a real car’s steering system, it was interesting to observe that the shape enclosed by steering wheel angles and the coordinate axis was a trapezoid. Then, we defined four feature points, four feature distances, and one feature steering wheel angle, and the trapezoidal steering wheel angle (TSWA) model was developed by backpropagation neural network with the inputs were vehicle speeds at four feature points, and road curvature and the outputs were feature distances and feature steering wheel angle. The comparisons between TSWA model and experienced drivers, model predictive control, and preview-based driver model showed that the proposed TSWA model can best reflect the steering features of experienced drivers. What is more, the concise expression and human-like characteristic of TSWA model make it easy to realize human-like steering control for autonomous vehicles. Lastly, an autonomous vehicle composed of a nonlinear vehicle model and electric power steering (EPS) system was established in Simulink, the steering wheel angles generated by TSWA model were tracked by EPS motor directly, and the results showed that the EPS system can track the steering angles with high accuracy at different vehicle speeds.},

Ghost imaging as a new imaging technique has attracted much attention due to its special physical properties and potential for imaging of objects in optically harsh or noisy environments. In this work, we experimentally study three categories of image reconstruction methods of ghost imaging for objects of different transmittance. For high-transmittance objects, the differential ghost imaging is more efficient than traditional ghost imaging. However, for low-transmittance objects, the reconstructed images using traditional ghost imaging and differential ghost imaging algorithms are both exceedingly blurred and cannot be improved by increasing the number of measurements. A compressive sensing method named augmented Lagrangian and alternating direction algorithm (TVAL3) is proposed to reduce the background noise imposed by the low-transmittance. Experimental results show that compressive ghost imaging can dramatically subtract the background noise and enhance the contrast of the image. The relationship between the quality of the reconstructed image and the complexity of object itself is also discussed.},

Attempting to well adjust the global and local search abilities and address the stagnation issue of particle swarm optimization, the proposed particle swarm optimization enhances a widely used standard particle swarm optimization algorithm with the evolutionary game theory, in which a novel self-adaptive strategy is proposed to update the three main control parameters of particles. Since the convergence of particle swarm optimization significantly influences its optimization efficiency, the convergence of the proposed particle swarm optimization is analytically investigated and a parameter selection rule, sufficiently guaranteeing the convergence of this particle swarm optimization, is provided in this article. The performance of the proposed planning method is verified through different scenarios both in single-robot and in multi-robot path planning problems. The numerical simulation results reveal that, compared to its contenders, the proposed method is highly promising with respect to the path optimality.

An upper-limb wearable robot, as a 6-DOF dual-arm exoskeleton, which was designed to augment workers’ strength and minimize muscular activation in the arm during repetitive lifting tasks. To adjust the robot joint trajectory, the user needs to apply an interactive torque to operate the robot during lifting tasks when a standard virtual mechanical impedance control structure is used. To reduce overshooting of the interactive torque on the user’s joint, a three-tier hierarchical control structure was developed for the robot in this study. At the highest level, a human arm movement detection module is used to detect the user’s arm motion according to the surface electromyography signals. Then, a Hammerstein adaptive virtual mechanical impedance controller is used at the middle level to reduce overshooting and yield an acceptable value of torque for the user’s elbow joint in actual lifting tasks. At the lowest level, the actuator controller on each joint of the robot controls the robot to complete lifting tasks. Several experiments were conducted, and the results showed that the interactive torque on the user’s elbow was limited and the muscular activations of erector spinae and biceps brachii muscles were effectively decreased. The proposed scheme prevents potential harm to the user due to excessive interactive torque on the human elbow joint, such as related muscle fatigue and joint injuries.},

  abstract     = {To enhance the capability of neural networks, research on attention mechanism have been deepened. In this area, attention modules make forward inference along channel dimension and spatial dimension sequentially, parallelly, or simultaneously. However, we have found that spatial attention modules mainly apply convolution layers to generate attention maps, which aggregate feature responses only based on local receptive fields. In this article, we take advantage of this finding to create a nonlocal spatial attention module (NL-SAM), which collects context information from all pixels to adaptively recalibrate spatial responses in a convolutional feature map. NL-SAM overcomes the limitations of repeating local operations and exports a 2D spatial attention map to emphasize or suppress responses in different locations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show at least 0.58% improvements on variant ResNets. Furthermore, this module is simple and can be easily integrated with existing channel attention modules, such as squeeze-and-excitation and gather-excite, to exceed these significant models at a minimal additional computational cost (0.196%).},

  abstract     = {In robotics, the tough problem about the dynamic target capturing consists of tracking the target by the robot manipulator and grasping the target by the robot finger. For the sake of space, this article deals with only the first problem, tracking the dynamic target by the robot manipulator. The traditional approaches of capturing the dynamic target may work well when they are employed in low-dimensional space by reinforcement learning or physical modeling. However, they fail to work well in high-dimensional space. The traditional approaches have four limitations with respect to Cartesian space, configuration space, reinforcement learning, and physical modeling. To overcome these limitations, this article implements improved dynamic A* algorithm in high-dimensional configuration space map to capture the target. First, a space injection model injects the collision detection and target position from the Cartesian space into the configuration space to construct a high-dimensional map. Then, the target capturing method including the improved dynamic A* algorithm is applied on the map to track and capture the target. Finally, the experiment performed in time-varying environment and the dynamic target achieves a reliable result. This article has proposed an approach that makes the robot manipulator motion planning more accurate in high-dimensional dynamic configuration space. This approach enables the multi-joint manipulator to avoid the obstacle while tracking the target in high-dimensional configuration space. It takes the advantages of heuristic algorithms in the process of target capturing method designing. It adds precision and speed to target tracking. The success of the approach may apply to any industrial robot tracking target, surgical operation, and space probes. And, it may lay a solid foundation for dynamics control with a scope for future investigations.},

This article proposes a reward–punishment feedback control strategy based on energy information. Firstly, an engagement estimated approach based on energy information is developed to evaluate subjects’ performance. Secondly, the estimated result forms a reward–punishment term, which is introduced into a standard model-based adaptive controller. This modified adaptive controller is capable of giving the reward–punishment feedback to subjects according to their engagement. Finally, several experiments are implemented using a wrist rehabilitation robot to evaluate the proposed control strategy with 10 healthy subjects who have not cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The results of these experiments show that the mean coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of the data obtained by the proposed approach and the classical approach is 0.7988, which illustrate the reliability of the engagement estimated approach based on energy information. And the results also demonstrate that the proposed controller has great potential to promote patients’ engagement for wrist rehabilitation.},

In this work, we propose a novel multimodal convolutional neural network method for RGB-D solid waste object detection. The depth information is introduced as the new modal to improve the object detection performance. Our method fuses two individual features in multiple scales, which forms an end-to-end network. We evaluate our method on the self-constructed solid waste data set.

In the algorithm, a virtual light source is set up at the goal point, and a light beam propagation method is adopted on the map to generate a map of light intensity distribution. The phototropism rapidly exploring random tree expands its node toward the space where the light intensity is higher, while the original rapidly exploring random tree expands its node based on the uniform sampling strategy. The performance of the phototropism rapidly exploring random tree is tested in three scenarios which include the simulation environment and the real-world environment.

On this basis, a continuous low-thrust control strategy for maintaining the loosely displaced formation is designed. The control objective is to reduce more fuel consumption during the formation-keeping. For achieving that, we proposed a forward-feedback control strategy by using pseudo-spectral method and sliding mode theory. To be specific, the control strategy includes two parts: a forward control and a feedback control. For the forward control, a numerical optimization with the Legendre pseudo-spectral method is attempted to convert the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming problem and fuel consumption is selected as the optimization index. For stability issue, the feedback control via adaptive finite-time sliding mode theory is introduced as an additional control component. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that propellant mass is effectively saved as well as the formation can be tracked accurately with this control strategy proposed in this article.},

All possible groups of joint angles for one tool pose in the joint range are obtained in the inverse kinematics. Secondly, the nonlinear error evaluation based on the interpolation is derived according to the kinematics. The nonlinear error of one numerical control (NC) code or one tool pose is obtained. The principle of minimum nonlinear error of joint angle is proposed to select the appropriate solution of joint angle for the postprocessing. Thirdly, a path smoothing method by inserting new tool poses adaptively is proposed to reduce the nonlinear error of the whole printing path. The smooth level in the smoothing is proposed to avoid the endless insertion near the singular area.

Although actuators account for a large proportion of the total mass of a robot, they have yet to become a positive factor that enables the robot to achieve gravity balance. This study presents a host–parasite structure to reconstruct the distribution of actuators and achieve gravity balance in robots. First, based on the characteristics of tree–rattan mechanisms, a method for calculating the degrees of freedom and a symbolic representation method for the distribution of branched chains are formulated for host–parasite mechanisms. Second, a configuration analysis and optimization method for host–parasite structure-based robots and a robot prototype are presented. Finally, four host–parasite mechanisms/robots (A, B, C, and D) are compared. The results are as follows. If more parasitic branched chains are added to the yz plane, the loads along axes 2 and 3 become more balanced, which significantly increases the stiffnesses of the mechanism in the y - and z -directions ( K y and K z , respectively). If the additional branched chains are closer to the site of maximum deformation, the stiffness of the mechanism in the z -direction ( K z ) increases more significantly. Of the four mechanisms, mechanism D has the best overall performance. The joint torques of mechanism D along axes 2 and 3 are lower than those of mechanism A by 99.78% and 99.18%, respectively. In addition, K x , K y , and K z of mechanism D are 100.56%, 336.19%, and 385.02% of those of mechanism A, respectively. Moreover, the first-order natural frequency of mechanism D is 135.94% of that of mechanism A. Host–parasitic structure is conducive to improving the performance of industrial robots.},

First, analyze the structure and environment of the offshore platform, use Fluent software to simulate the diffusion process of natural gas leaked from the platform, and establish a diffusion model of natural gas leaked from various aspects, such as the layout of different platforms, the number of leaked gas sources, and the concentration of leaked gas sources. In terms of multirobot cooperative control, we analyzed and improved the ant colony algorithm and proposed a multirobot cooperative search strategy for gas search, gas tracking, and gas source positioning. The multirobot search process was simulated using MATLAB software, and the robot on the detection effect of multirobots was analyzed in many aspects, such as quantity, location of leak source, and a number of leak sources, which verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the multirobot control strategy based on optimized ACO.

This article develops a two-dimensional dynamics model that predicts the relative position between a robot’s end-of-arm tooling and an approaching object or threat. The safety strategy applied to the robot is derived from the calculation of three parameters: the time of collision predicted from the linear motion between the approaching object and the robot’s end-of-arm tooling, the relative absolute distance, and the overlapping area ratio. These parameters combined are updated in a cost function that is sufficiently alarming the collision severity of an approaching object in real time. This model enables deployment a safe and a productive collaborative interaction in the manufacturing environment where workers and robots are seemingly moving in close proximity within an open workspace with less safeguard barriers.},

In this article, by establishing the polychromatic sets of aircraft, aircraft equipment, and flight actions, creating the fuzzy relational matrix between equipment and actions and between actions and actions, this article realizes the standardized and generalized expression of the constraint condition of the route planning problem. Then the analysis and inspection of the constraint conditions are realized by the polychromatic sets operation rules.},

  abstract     = {Multiagent coordination is highly desirable with many uses in a variety of tasks. In nature, the phenomenon of coordinated flocking is highly common with applications related to defending or escaping from predators. In this article, a hybrid multiagent system that integrates consensus, cooperative learning, and flocking control to determine the direction of attacking predators and learns to flock away from them in a coordinated manner is proposed. This system is entirely distributed requiring only communication between neighboring agents. The fusion of consensus and collaborative reinforcement learning allows agents to cooperatively learn in a variety of multiagent coordination tasks, but this article focuses on flocking away from attacking predators. The results of the flocking show that the agents are able to effectively flock to a target without collision with each other or obstacles. Multiple reinforcement learning methods are evaluated for the task with cooperative learning utilizing function approximation for state-space reduction performing the best. The results of the proposed consensus algorithm show that it provides quick and accurate transmission of information between agents in the flock. Simulations are conducted to show and validate the proposed hybrid system in both one and two predator environments, resulting in an efficient cooperative learning behavior. In the future, the system of using consensus to determine the state and reinforcement learning to learn the states can be applied to additional multiagent tasks.},

As its shape can be actively controlled by changing the prestress of its members, it has great potential to be used as a shape-controllable locomotive system. Particularly, the six-strut spherical tensegrity has been studied intensively as a rolling locomotive system. In this study, the rolling gaits of a strut-actuated six-strut spherical tensegrity are investigated. Specifically, a mathematical model for generating the rolling gaits of locomotive spherical tensegrities is presented, and a numerical method combining dynamic relaxation method and genetic algorithm is used to solve the model. Various rolling gaits for the strut-actuated six-strut locomotive spherical tensegrity are identified using this approach. Two basic types of touching-ground triangles, two basic distributions of payload, and six cases for the numbers of used active struts are considered. Several rolling gait primitives are noted, their motion features analyzed, and a simple path-generating strategy is proposed based on idealized rolling gait primitives. A physical prototype of the strut-actuated six-strut locomotive tensegrity is manufactured, and experiments are conducted to verify the rolling gaits and locomotion paths generated by the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the absorption and scattering effect on light when traveling in water, underwater images exhibit serious weakening such as color deviation, low contrast, and blurry details. Traditional algorithms have certain limitations in the case of these images with varying degrees of fuzziness and color deviation. To address these problems, a new approach for single underwater image enhancement based on fusion technology was proposed in this article. First, the original image is preprocessed by the white balance algorithm and dark channel prior dehazing technologies, respectively; then two input images were obtained by color correction and contrast enhancement; and finally, the enhanced image was obtained by utilizing the multiscale fusion strategy which is based on the weighted maps constructed by combining the features of global contrast, local contrast, saliency, and exposedness. Qualitative results revealed that the proposed approach significantly removed haze, corrected color deviation, and preserved image naturalness. For quantitative results, the test with 400 underwater images showed that the proposed approach produced a lower average value of mean square error and a higher average value of peak signal-to-noise ratio than the compared method. Moreover, the enhanced results obtain the highest average value in terms of underwater image quality measures among the comparable methods, illustrating that our approach achieves superior performance on different levels of distorted and hazy images.},

  abstract     = {Stand–sit–stand (STS) motions are the most frequently performed activities of everyday life and require extensive movement of knee joint. People suffering from knee joint disorders face difficulties in performing this motion. The compact knee exoskeleton (KE) has proven to be a viable, less complex, and cheaper alternative to the available entire lower-, upper-, and full-body exoskeletons. With growing number of technical glitches and finite battery life problems, there exist risks of sudden failure of the actuator of KE that could be detrimental for the vulnerable users. To overcome this problem, there is a need to accommodate a backup actuator in KE which can continue providing assistance during movement if the primary actuator ceases to function. This article provides a performance comparison of a four-bar mechanism-driven KE that can accommodate both the linear and the rotary actuators. The modelling and simulation of the system are performed using the bond graph (BG) technique. The results successfully showed that both actuators offered desired ranges of motions needed for STS motion. Furthermore, the knee joint torques developed by the linear and rotary actuators were found to be 40 Nm and 57 Nm, respectively, which corresponds to 60% and 85% of the total torque required by the knee joint to perform STS motions, thereby reducing the user effort to 40% and 15%, respectively. Thus, both actuators are self-capable to provide necessary assistance at the knee joint even if the primary actuator ceases to work due to a sudden fault, the secondary actuator will provide the required rotation of the thigh link and will continue to deliver the assistive torque. The article also effectively shows the application of BG approach to model the multidisciplinary systems like KE as it conveniently models the system containing various elements in different energy domains.},

However, although the discriminator completely confuses the two domains, adversarial domain adaptation still cannot guarantee the consistent feature distribution of the two domains, which may further deteriorate the recognition accuracy. Therefore, in this article, we propose a deep adversarial domain adaptation network, which optimises the feature distribution of the two confused domains by adding multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy to the feature layer and designing a new loss function to ensure good recognition accuracy. In the last part, some simulation results based on the Office-31 and Underwater data sets show that the deep adversarial domain adaptation network can optimise the feature distribution and promote positive transfer, thus improving the classification accuracy.},

The navigation observation model is established by considering the multipath bias as additive positioning errors, and the assumption for the proposed method is that global navigation satellite system signals contaminated due to multipath are the minority among the received signals, which makes the unknown bias vector sparse. We investigated an improved elastic net method to estimate the sparse multipath bias vector, and the global navigation satellite system measurements can be corrected by subtracting the estimated multipath error.

Because of the diversity and correlation of robotic global performance indexes, the two multivariate statistical methods principal component analysis and kernel principal component analysis methods can be used, respectively, to comprehensively evaluate the global performance of PUMA560 robot with different dimensions. When using the kernel principal component analysis method, the kernel function and parameters directly have an effect on the result of comprehensive performance evaluation. Because kernel principal component analysis with polynomial kernel function is time-consuming and inefficient, a new kernel function based on similarity degree is proposed for the big sample data. The new kernel function is proved according to Mercer’s theorem. By comparing different dimension reduction effects of principal component analysis method, the kernel principal component analysis method with polynomial kernel function, and the kernel principal component analysis method with the new kernel function, the kernel principal component analysis method with the new kernel function could deal more effectively with the nonlinear relationship among indexes, and its calculation result is more reasonable for containing more comprehensive information.

  abstract     = {Planning collision-free trajectories is essential for wheeled mobile robots operating in dynamic environments safely and efficiently. Most current trajectory generation methods focus on achieving optimal trajectories in static maps and considering dynamic obstacles as static depending on the precise motion estimation of the obstacles. However, in realistic applications, dealing with dynamic obstacles that have low reliable motion estimation is a common situation. Furthermore, inaccurate motion estimation leads to poor quality of motion prediction. To generate safe and smooth trajectories in such a dynamic environment, we propose a motion planning algorithm called trend-aware motion planning (TAMP) for dynamic obstacle avoidance, which combines with timed-elastic band . Instead of considering dynamic obstacles as static, our planning approach predicts the moving trends of the obstacles based on the given estimation. Subsequently, the approach generates a trajectory away from dynamic obstacles, meanwhile, avoiding the moving trends of the obstacles. To cope with multiple constraints, an optimization approach is adopted to refine the generated trajectory and minimize the cost. A comparison of our approach against other state-of-the-art methods is conducted. Results show that trajectories generated by TAMP are robust to handle the poor quality of obstacles’ motion prediction and have better efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Under the complex agricultural operation environment, reliable navigation system is the basic guarantee to realize the agricultural robot automated operation. This study focuses on improving navigation accuracy and control accuracy and conducts related research on autonomous navigation control of agricultural robots. This article discusses the advantages of using strict convergence criteria and combining Sage–Husa adaptive filtering with strong tracking Kalman filtering and then proposes an improved adaptive Kalman filter algorithm. The new algorithm can effectively suppress the filter divergence, improve the dynamic performance of the filter, and ensure its better filtering accuracy and strong adaptive ability to improve navigation accuracy of GPS. Further variable structure switching method is used to prevent proportional integral differential (PID) controller integral saturation phenomenon, which effectively solves the controller over-saturation problem. And combining this method with an improved adaptive filtering algorithm not only can effectively inhibit control interference but also achieve the anti-saturation effect, thereby enhancing the stability and accuracy of the control system. Finally, the simulation and experiment of the new method show that the proposed method greatly improves the ability of the filter to suppress divergence and control precision.},

The purpose of the work is to provide an effective means of describing an individual-specific finger motion during flexion or extension movements as precisely as possible. Based on the finger’s geometric postures that are observed when fingers naturally grasp a cylindrical object with a circular cross-section, its geometric relation between each phalanx of a finger and the object is extracted, and forms of contact between them are taken into consideration to secure more degrees of freedom for representing finger motions and are parameterized in the model development. A parameter identification approach is adopted to find model parameters that can be used to describe an individual-specific grasping style. For the validation of the proposed models, a set of optical motion capture experiments is performed. From the simulation study, one can see that the models provide one of the feasible and viable solutions to imitate the human finger’s flexion and/or extension movements.},

In order to make the walking mechanism possess a combination of passability, stability, and mobility, a coordinated variable wheel-track walking mechanism was designed. The coordinated variable triangle track can change the landing area through the deformation structure to improve the ability of the walking mechanism to adapt to different terrains. The kinematics equation of the wheel-track walking mechanism was established, and the front wheel steering angle equation during motion was derived. Based on RecurDyn software, the motion simulation of the walking mechanism was carried out under the conditions of straight walking and turning on the flat ground, climbing hillsides, and crossing ditches. The simulation results show that the coordinated variable wheel-track walking mechanism has the mobility of wheeled walking mechanism and the passability and stability of the tracked walking mechanism. The stability and climbing ability of the wheel-track walking mechanism was better when the coordinated variable triangle track in the stretch state, and the mobility and steering ability was better in the contraction state.},

The method utilizes the calculus of variation setting to address the problem for which the optimal trajectory may be computed by solving the initial value problem of the system of ordinary differential equations rather than the two-point boundary value problem. Online optimal trajectory may then be input to a suitable tracking controller for controlling the robot in real time. Effectively, the robot closed-loop dynamics is shaped to the optimal system such that the locomotion minimizes the difference of the weighted generalized momentum and the assigned potential energy under the constraints imposed on by the tracking task, joint angle, and actuator torque limits. Desired locomotion behaviors may be achieved by properly adjusting the weighting, spring, and damping matrices. Exploiting the induced dynamical force from the cooperative motion of the constituent linkages through the momentum minimization basis, the robot is able to outperform conventional locomotion pattern actuated by the platform solely.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at the problems of common methods in trotting gait control of a load-carrying quadruped walking vehicle, a control method, combining virtual model and centroidal dynamics, is proposed. The control of the walking vehicle is divided into two parts, meaning the motion control of the vehicle body and the motion control of the swing leg. The virtual model control method is used to work out the accelerations of the vehicle body, while the centroidal dynamics approach is used to obtain the resultant forces acting on the vehicle. Next, quadratic programming is used to distribute the resultant forces to the foot-ends of the supporting legs. Last, combining the Jacobian matrices of supporting legs, the vehicle body’s motion control is achieved. The virtual forces, acting on the swing leg foot-end, are obtained using the virtual model control method. Combining the swing leg’s Jacobian matrix, joint torques of swing leg are worked out. Simulink and Adams are adopted to jointly simulate omnidirectional trotting of the vehicle, under the condition of fixed and shifting position of eccentric weight. The effects of the virtual model and centroidal dynamics control method are compared with that of the virtual model control method. The results show that the errors of roll angle and pitch angle are reduced by 50%, 89% and 50%, 80%, respectively, as derived by virtual model and centroidal dynamic control method, under the two conditions.

We present a tactile perception strategy that a manipulator with tactile sensors in its grippers manipulates an object to measure a set of tactile features. It shows that tactile sensing system can use these features and the extreme learning machine algorithm to recognize household objects—purely from tactile sensing—from a small training set. The complex matrixes show the recognition rate is up to 83%.},

YOLOv3 (You only look once v3) is the state-of-the-art object detector with good performance in both aspects of accuracy and speed; however, the scale variation is still the challenging problem which needs to be improved. Considering that the detection performances of multi-scale objects are related to the receptive fields of the network, in this work, we propose a novel dilated spatial pyramid module to integrate multi-scale information to effectively deal with scale variation problem. Firstly, the input of dilated spatial pyramid is fed into multiple parallel branches with different dilation rates to generate feature maps with different receptive fields. Then, the input of dilated spatial pyramid and outputs of different branches are concatenated to integrate multi-scale information. Moreover, dilated spatial pyramid is integrated with YOLOv3 in front of the first detection header to present dilated spatial pyramid-You only look once model. Experiment results on PASCAL VOC2007 demonstrate that dilated spatial pyramid-You only look once model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in mean average precision, while it still keeps a satisfying real-time detection speed. For 416 × 416 input, dilated spatial pyramid-You only look once model achieves 82.2% mean average precision at 56 frames per second, 3.9% higher than YOLOv3 with only slight speed drops.},

The contents of the article are to classify the sonar image segmentation methods with wavelets and to describe main ideas, advantages, disadvantages, and conditions of use of every method. In the methods for sonar image region (or texture) segmentation, the thought of multiscale (or multiresolution) analysis of the wavelet transform is usually combined with other theories or methods such as the clustering algorithms, the Markov random field, co-occurrence matrix, Bayesian theory, and support vector machine. In the methods for sonar image edge detection, the space–frequency local characteristics of the wavelet transform are usually utilized. The wavelet packet-based and beyond wavelet-based methods can usually reach more precise segmentation. The article also gives 12 directions (or development trends predicted) of the sonar image segmentation methods with wavelets which should be researched deeply in the future.

The first one is mounted on the head of the snake-like robot for target recognition and the other is an overhead camera which is responsible for locating the robot and identifying surrounding obstacles. All dead ends in the environment can thus be recognized using a template-based method. A search strategy for traversal of the dead ends is employed for generating exploration paths. Several gaits are developed for the snake-like robot. By switching between these gaits, the snake-like robot is able to follow the paths to search for the target. Two experiments are conducted in a maze environment. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system for snake-like robots exploring in structured environments.},

The possible position of moving vertices is predicted by the Kalman filter, and an objective search region is generated around the centre position. Moreover, particle swarm optimisation is performed to search for the best target position in this region.

In this work, we present an improved boundary-aware face alignment method by using stacked dense U-Nets. The proposed method consists of two stages: a boundary heatmap estimation stage to learn the facial boundary lines and a facial landmark localization stage to predict the final face alignment result. With the constraint of boundary lines, facial landmarks are unified as a whole facial shape. Hence, the unseen landmarks in a shape with occlusions can be better estimated by message passing with other landmarks. By introducing the stacked dense U-Nets for feature extraction, the capacity of the model is improved. Experiments and comparisons on public datasets show that the proposed method obtains better performance than the baselines, especially for facial images with large pose variation, shape variation, and occlusions.},

The designed controller uses a double closed-loop control structure to track the desired trajectory in the joint space of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system, and its inner and outer loop systems use integral sliding surface to enhance the robustness of the whole system. Then, the continuous switching mode based on hyperbolic tangent function is used instead of the traditional discontinuous switching mode to reduce the chattering of the control input of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system. In addition, the control method proposed in this article does not need to estimate the uncertainties of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system control system through online identification, but also can ensure the robustness of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system motion control in underwater environment. Therefore, it is easier to be implemented on the embedded platform of the underwater vehicle and manipulator system and applied to the actual marine operation tasks. At last, the stability of the control system is proved by the Lyapunov theory, and its effectiveness and feasibility are verified by the simulation experiments in MATLAB software.},

Since the dynamics of the actuator is assumed highly nonlinear with uncertainties, the adaptive neural network is presented in the inner loop to ensure the control system robustness against uncertainties, and the self-tuning weighting vector is adjusted online according to the updated law obtained by Lyapunov stability theory. In the outer loop, a model reference sliding mode controller is developed to track the desired states of the hybrid reference model that combines skyhook and groundhook control methods. Besides, to obtain the unmeasured states of the system, an unscented Kalman filter is utilized to provide necessary information for the controller. Simulation results show that the exerted force can be tracked precisely even in the existence of uncertainties.

Hence, the dynamic modeling and especially the inverse dynamic analysis of the flexible robots with the prismatic joints are challenging. In this article, we present a new development of the dynamic modeling method for a generic two-link flexible robot that consists of a prismatic joint and a revolute joint. Moreover, a new bisection method-based algorithm is proposed to analyze the inverse dynamic responses of the flexible robots. Since the bisection method is a rapid converging method in mathematics, the proposed algorithm is effectively applicable to solving the inverse dynamic problem of a flexible robot in a robust manner.

Thus, windshield or bumper region detection is making sense to extract useful information. But the existing windshield and bumper detection methods based on traditional artificial features are not robust enough. Those features may become invalid in many real situations (e.g. occlude, illumination change, viewpoint change.). In this article, we propose a multi-attribute-guided vehicle discriminately region detection method based on convolutional neural network and not rely on bounding box regression. We separate the net into two branches, respectively, for identification (ID) and Model attributes training. Therefore, the feature spaces of different attributes become more independent. Additionally, we embed a self-attention block into our framework to improve the performance of local region detection. We train our model on PKU_VD data set which has a huge number of images inside. Furthermore, we labeled the handcrafted bounding boxes on 5000 randomly picked testing images, and 1020 of them are used for evaluation and 3980 as the training data for YOLOv3 . We use Intersection over Union for quantitative evaluation. Experiments were conducted in three different latest convolutional neural network trunks to illustrate the detection performance of the proposed method. Simultaneously, in terms of quantitative evaluation, the performance of our method is close to YOLOv3 even without handcrafted bounding boxes.},

This article considers using multi-AGVs as delivery robots to coordinate and sort baggage in the large international airport. This system has the merit of enlarging the accuracy of baggage sorting and delivering. Due to the inaccurate transportation efficiency, a time-dependent stochastic baggage delivery system is proposed and a stochastic model is constructed to characterize the running priority and optimal path planning for multi-AGVs according to the flight information. In the proposed system, ultra-wideband technology is applied to realize precisely positioning and navigation for multi-AGVs in the baggage distribution center. Furthermore, the optimal path planning algorithm based on time-window rules and rapidly exploring random tree algorithm is considered to avoid collision and maneuverability constraints and to determine whether the running path for each AGV is feasible and optimal. Computer simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

A Bayesian network (BN) model has been established to further classify them into five classes, including pedestrian, cyclist, car, van, and truck. The BN model is trained using substantial data samples. The optimized structure of the model is determined from the necessary path condition method with a presupposition constraint (NPC+PC). The conditional probability table of the discrete nodes and the conditional probability distribution of the continuous nodes are determined from expectation maximization (EM) training algorithm with consideration of prior domain knowledge. Experiments were conducted using the object detection data set on the public KITTI benchmark, and the results show that the proposed BN model exhibits an excellent performance for obstacle classification while the full pipeline of the method including detection and classification is in the upper middle level compared with other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Modeling and control for a novel coaxial ducted fan aerial robot in-ground-effect is presented in this article. Based on experiments using the ducted fan bench test, the fitting curve of the ground effect thrust of the ducted fan aerial robot at different heights is obtained. In addition, the flow field simulation results of the prototype with ground effect at different heights can be obtained using computational fluid dynamics software. A simplified model of the prototype for control can be designed based on several reasonable hypotheses that are established using blade element and momentum theory. To compensate for the disturbance associated with ground effect, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to estimate the disturbance, and control structure of the closed-loop system is composed of a nonlinear disturbance observer combined with a double-loop proportion–integration–differentiation controller. The results of several numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller structure. The performances of tracking trajectory and system stability are improved significantly, compared to the situation that the ground effect is not compensated for.},

  abstract     = {Path planning of lunar robots is the guarantee that lunar robots can complete tasks safely and accurately. Aiming at the shortest path and the least energy consumption, an adaptive potential field ant colony algorithm suitable for path planning of lunar robot is proposed to solve the problems of slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local optimum of ant colony algorithm. This algorithm combines the artificial potential field method with ant colony algorithm, introduces the inducement heuristic factor, and adjusts the state transition rule of the ant colony algorithm dynamically, so that the algorithm has higher global search ability and faster convergence speed. After getting the planned path, a dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy is designed according to the predictable and unpredictable obstacles. Especially a geometric method based on moving route is used to detect the unpredictable obstacles and realize the avoidance of dynamic obstacles. The experimental results show that the improved adaptive potential field ant colony algorithm has higher global search ability and faster convergence speed. The designed obstacle avoidance strategy can effectively judge whether there will be collision and take obstacle avoidance measures.},

  abstract     = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) constitutes an effective and affordable solution to the outdoor positioning problem. When combined with precise positioning techniques, such as the real time kinematic (RTK), centimeter-level positioning accuracy becomes a reality. Such performance is suitable for a whole new range of demanding applications, including high-accuracy field robotics operations. The RTKRCV, part of the RTKLIB package, is one of the most popular open-source solutions for real-time GNSS precise positioning. Yet the lack of integration with the robot operating system (ROS), constitutes a limitation on its adoption by the robotics community. This article addresses this limitation, reporting a new implementation which brings the RTKRCV capabilities into ROS. New features, including ROS publishing and control over a ROS service, were introduced seamlessly, to ensure full compatibility with all original options. Additionally, a new observation synchronization scheme improves solution consistency, particularly relevant for the moving-baseline positioning mode. Real application examples are presented to demonstrate the advantages of our rtkrcv_ros package. For community benefit, the software was released as an open-source package.},

The accuracy of scan registration is critical for the quality of mapping and the accuracy of robot navigation. During all of the scan registration methods, normal distribution transform is an efficient and wild-using one. But normal distribution transform will lead to the unreasonable interruption when splitting the grid and can’t express the points’ local geometric feature by prefixed grid. In this article, we propose a novel method, composite clustering normal distribution transform, which comprises the density-based clustering and k -means clustering to aggregate the points with similar local distributing feature. It takes singular value decomposition to judge the suitable degree of one cluster for further division. Meanwhile, to avoid the radiating phenomenon of LIDAR in measuring the points’ distance, we propose a method based on trigonometric to measure the internal distance. The clustering method in composite clustering normal distribution transform could ensure the expression of LIDAR’s local distribution and matching accuracy. The experimental result demonstrates that our method is more accurate and more stable than the normal distribution transform and iterative closest point methods.},

This article presents a detailed review of recent advances in semantic simultaneous localization and mapping, which mainly covers the treatments in terms of perception, robustness, and accuracy. Specifically, the concept of “semantic extractor” and the framework of “modern visual simultaneous localization and mapping” are initially presented. As the challenges associated with perception, robustness, and accuracy are being stated, we further discuss some open problems from a macroscopic view and attempt to find answers. We argue that multiscaled map representation, object simultaneous localization and mapping system, and deep neural network-based simultaneous localization and mapping pipeline design could be effective solutions to image semantics-fused visual simultaneous localization and mapping.},

In recent two decades, autonomous surface vessels have gained increasing attention from both industry and research communities, previous related work mainly focuses on the design of maneuver controllers, most algorithms are under some specific assumptions and always involve too many parameters that need to be tuned, leading to the lack of practical application or validation in real autonomous surface vessel platform. To tackle the issues, an integrated autonomous surface vessel prototype is designed and implemented, both navigation and maneuver control subsystems are improved, especially in terms of autonomous control, a simple geometrical model and constrained pure pursuit algorithm is firstly tried in autonomous surface vessel, the results show that the proposed system can achieve the path tracking with the error smaller than 40 cm, and even given a complicated waypoint mission, it can still maintain the accuracy of path tracking, demonstrating the stability and validity of the autonomous surface vessel prototype.},

One of the basic problems of swarm robotics involves the target search process, which entails a cooperative search using limited perception and local interaction of robots under a self-organizing mechanism. When communication is limited, the connectivity of swarm robotics may decrease, leading to the failure of the target search task. This article describes a new target search method based on the robot chain model and the elimination mechanism. The proposed method allows the target search task to be completed efficiently and reliably while maintaining the connectivity of the robots. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm offers better performance than conventional techniques in terms of search speed and success rate, and provides an effective method for solving the target search problem using swarm robotics in limited-communication environments.},

Besides, an optimal B-spline is proposed to generate a smoother and shorter path, and this scheme is especially suitable for closed paths. In motion profile planning, a generalized formulation of time-optimal velocity profiles is proposed, which can be implemented to any types of motion profiles with equality and inequality constraints. Also, a multisegment cubic velocity profile is proposed by solving a multiobjective optimization problem.

To effectively address these issues, a novel control scheme considering roll stabilization is designed by combing terminal hierarchical sliding mode control with Lyapunov direct method, which can quickly ensure a small formation error in a finite-time for vessels. Meanwhile, a new switching gain adaptation mechanism is utilized to reduce chattering and acquire faster adaptive rate without the excessive temporary tracking errors. Radial basis function neural network and finite-time observer are employed to deal with model uncertainties and disturbances, respectively. Furthermore, dynamic surface control technology is introduced to reduce the complexity of control law.

An adaptive sliding mode control is designed to complete the target tracking task with the effect of disturbances and continuously time-varying topologies. This means that the communication between the robots is not switching among constant topologies but changes continuously along with time. The continuously time-varying topology is constructed by a set of fixed Laplacian matrices and variable scheduling functions, which is known as polytopic model structure. The designed adaptive sliding mode control can effectively lower the influence of disturbance and improve tracking performance even under the continuously time-varying topology.

Furthermore, the steering sensitivity coefficient of the vehicle is compensated linearly with the change in the steering angular frequency and vehicle speed. In addition, to minimize the tracking errors caused by vehicle nonlinearity and external disturbances, an active disturbance rejection control feedback controller that tracks the desired lateral displacement and desired yaw angle is designed. Finally, CarSim® obstacle avoidance simulation results show that an autonomous vehicle with the four-wheel steering path tracking controller consisting of feed-forward control and feedback control could not only improve the tire lateral forces but also reduce tail flicking (oversteer) and pushing ahead (understeer) under high-speed emergency obstacle avoidance conditions.},

The RL helps the Helper and Defender to improve the ability of their policy selection on the real-time confrontation.

However, there are still some difficulties in vision system integration. The capability of such system (e.g. assembly or technological system) depends on several factors, for instance, the camera position, lightning conditions, pattern recognition algorithms, precise setup, as well as well-trained programmer and engineer. The skills of the engineering staff and the precise analysis of conditions and process requirements seem to be crucial for successful solution, what was proved also in our experimental test. The main aim of the article is development and complex performance analysis of robotized screwing application with integrated vision system, concretely the case study of automated assembly system in automotive industry—bolting tightening robotized station as a part of car seat assembly process. The main key elements of the designed workplace are industrial robot FANUC M-20 i A/20M with integrated i RVision system containing the industrial camera Sony XC-56. The real influence of inaccuracies during the design process, gradual “step-by-step” refinement, and final influence of all changings on the final quality and efficiency of designed system was demonstrated. At the end, we reached the point where the total number of screwing operations with NOK results (not OK / negative results) is about six single negative results per day, which represents less than 0.1% of all recognitions (overall reliability is higher than 99.9%).},

The state feedback control containing more state information of the system was adopted to replace the traditional output feedback and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, through the real-time calculation of the time-varying parameters of the servo valve flow, the nonlinear state space expression of the system was derived, the state feedback matrix and the input transformation amplifier were obtained and the full-dimensional state observer was designed. The experimental results show that the designed full-dimensional state observer can track the state variables of the actual system better. Compared with the traditional output feedback and PID control, state feedback control performs better in aspects of accuracy and system dynamics for the position-based impedance control system, which can further improve the compliance performance of the robot.},

  abstract     = {The time-varying ocean currents and the delay of underwater acoustic communication have caused the uncertainty of single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) tracking target and the inconsistency of multi-AUV coordination, which make it difficult for multiple AUVs to form a hunting alliance. To solve the above problems, this article proposes the multi-AUV consistent collaborative hunting method based on generative adversarial network (GAN). Firstly, the three-dimensional (3D) kinematic model of AUV is established for the underwater 3D environment. Secondly, combined with the Laplacian matrix, the topology of the hunting alliance in the ideal environment is established, and the control rate of AUV is calculated. Finally, using the GAN network model, the control relationship after environmental interference is used as the input of the generative model. The control rate in the ideal environment is used as the comparison object of the discriminative model. Using the iterative training of GAN to generate a control rate that adapts to the current interference environment and combining multi-AUV topological hunting model to achieve successful hunting of noncooperative target, the experimental results show that the algorithm reduces the average hunting time to 62.53 s and the success rate of hunting is increased to 84.69%, which is 1.17% higher than the particle swarm optimization-constant modulus algorithm (PSO-CMA) algorithm.},

Integrated process planning and scheduling is a significant research focus in recent years, which could improve the performance of manufacturing system. At present, the research on integrated process planning and scheduling is insufficient to consider the multi-objective and uncertain characteristics widely existing in real manufacturing environment. Therefore, multi-objective integrated process planning and scheduling problem with uncertain processing time and due date is addressed in this article. The mathematical model of multi-objective uncertain integrated process planning and scheduling problem with uncertain processing time and fuzzy due date is established based on fuzzy set, in which the calculation method of uncertainty measurement objective is designed. An effective modified honey bees mating optimization algorithm has been designed to solve the proposed model. Queens set is constructed to maintain the non-dominated solutions found in the optimization process. The calculation method of mating probability between drone and queen bee based on Euclidean distance is designed. Fuzzy operators were utilized to evaluate fitness, judge the non-dominated relationship, and decode the scheduling solution. Different instances were designed and carried out to test the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is very effective for solving multi-objective uncertain integrated process planning and scheduling.},

Motivated by these observations, we design the method called abnormal object detection in a specific region based on Mask R-convolutional neural network: A bnormal O bject D etection in S pecific R egion. In this method, the initial instance segmentation model is obtained by the traditional Mask R-convolutional neural network method, then the region overlap of the specific region is calculated and the overlapping ratio of each instance is determined, and these two parts of information are fused to predict the exceptional object. Finally, the abnormal object is restored and detected in the original image.

  abstract     = {Human–robot interaction is a vital part of human–robot collaborative space exploration, which bridges the high-level decision and path planning intelligence of human and the accurate sensing and modelling ability of the robot. However, most conventional human–robot interaction approaches rely on video streams for the operator to understand the robot’s surrounding, which lacks situational awareness and force the operator to be stressed and fatigued. This research aims to improve efficiency and promote the natural level of interaction for human–robot collaboration. We present a human–robot interaction method based on real-time mapping and online virtual reality visualization, which is implemented and verified for rescue robotics. At the robot side, a dense point cloud map is built in real-time by LiDAR-IMU tightly fusion; the resulting map is further transformed into three-dimensional normal distributions transform representation. Wireless communication is employed to transmit the three-dimensional normal distributions transform map to the remote control station in an incremental manner. At the remote control station, the received map is rendered in virtual reality using parameterized ellipsoid cells. The operator controls the robot with three modes. In complex areas, the operator can use interactive devices to give low-level motion commands. In the less unstructured region, the operator can specify a path or even a target point. Afterwards, the robot follows the path or navigates to the target point autonomously. In other words, these two modes rely more on the robot’s autonomy. By virtue of virtual reality visualization, the operator can have a more comprehensive understanding of the space to be explored. In this case, the high-level decision and path planning intelligence of human and the accurate sensing and modelling ability of the robot can be well integrated as a whole. Although the method is proposed for rescue robots, it can also be used in other out-of-sight teleoperation-based human–robot collaboration systems, including but not limited to manufacturing, space, undersea, surgery, agriculture and military operations.},

  abstract     = {The unmanned surface vehicle has the characteristics of high maneuverability and flexibility. Object detection and tracking skills are required to improve the ability of unmanned surface vehicle to avoid collisions and detect targets on the surface of the water. Mean-shift algorithm is a classic target tracking algorithm, but it may fail when pixel interference and occlusion occur. This article proposes a tracking algorithm for unmanned surface vehicle based on an improved mean-shift optimization algorithm. The method uses the self-organizing feature map spatial topology to reduce the interference of the background pixels on the target object and predicts the center position of the object when the target is heavily occluded according to the extended Kalman filter. First, a self-organizing feature map model is built to classify pixels in a rectangular frame and the background pixels are extracted. Then, the method optimizes the extended Kalman filter solution process to complete the prediction and correction of the target center position and introduces a similarity function to determine the target occlusion. Finally, numerical analyses based on a ship model sailing experiment are performed with the help of OpenCV library. The experimental results validated that the proposed method significantly reduces the cumulative error in the tracking process and effectively predicts the position of the target between continuous frames when temporary occlusion occurs. The research can be used for target detection and autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vehicle.},

The proposed method takes the advantage of finite-time fast convergence to avoid singularity problem and ensure its robustness against system uncertainty and unknown disturbance. To achieve fast convergence from any initial condition to system origin, a full-order terminal sliding-mode controller containing differential terms is proposed based on the property of n -order nonlinear systems. Then the continuous and smooth actual control law is obtained by integrating the differential control law containing the discontinuous sign function to realize chattering free. Meanwhile, instead of evaluating the fixed upper bound of system uncertainty and interference in practical implementations, an adaptive method is utilized for its unknown upper bound estimation. The convergence of the adaptive terminal sliding-mode controller in finite time is verified based on Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, two simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

  abstract     = {An impedance control method in null-space for 7-degree-of-freedom redundant manipulators is presented in this article. The null-space impedance motion of the redundant manipulator was described in the angle domain and a null-space impedance equation was established. To successfully obtain joint angular velocity, a high-gain observer is designed. The stability of the proposed control method was proved based on passive theory. The proposed null-space impedance control method not only preserved the Cartesian space impedance characteristics of the redundant manipulator but also achieved null-space impedance control. When the manipulator interacted with the outside world, the position error of the end effector asymptotically converged due to the self-motion of the manipulator. Simulations and experiments of the general impedance control method and the proposed impedance control method verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {For the inverse calculation of laser-guided demolition robot, its global nonlinear mapping model from laser measuring point to joint cylinder stroke has been set up with an artificial neural network. Due to the contradiction between population diversity and convergence rate in the optimization of complex neural networks by using differential evolution, a gravitational search algorithm and differential evolution is proposed to accelerate the convergence rate of differential evolution population driven by gravity. Gravitational search algorithm and differential evolution is applied to optimize the inverse calculation neural network mapping model of demolition robot, and the algorithm simulation shows that gravity can effectively regulate the convergence process of differential evolution population. Compared with the standard differential evolution, the convergence speed and accuracy of gravitational search algorithm and differential evolution are significantly improved, which has better optimization stability. The calculation results show that the output accuracy of this gravitational and differential evolution neural network can meet the calculation requirements of the positioning control of demolition robot’s manipulator. The optimization using gravitational search algorithm and differential evolution is done with the connection weights of a neural network in this article, and as similar techniques can be applied to the other hyperparameter optimization problem. Moreover, such an inverse calculation method can provide a reference for the autonomous positioning of large hydraulic series manipulator, so as to improve the robotization level of construction machinery.},

  abstract     = {To better monitor the state of isolating switches, an efficient binocular vision-based state measurement system is proposed in this article. Two optimal cameras are selected as the vision of our inspection system. Firstly, stereo calibration and distortion rectification are performed on acquired image pair. Secondly, to recover the three-dimensional information of switch, we propose a semi-global stereo matching method by using data- and structure-driven cost volume fusion and then optimizing raw disparity map with weighted- and edge discriminated-smoothness prior. Gradient content is enforced on the weight for suppressing small-weight-accumulation problem in weak-textured regions. Besides, Hough transform with feature constraints is implemented for removing the chaotic lines and extracting center line of the switch arm. Finally, based on the center line and corresponding disparity map of the switch arm, triangulation principle is used for calculating the true angle between the switch arm and insulator such that whether or not the isolating switch is fully closed can be detected. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed stereo matching method can achieve good performance in Middlebury v.3 data set and switch images, and the system can precisely measure the state of switches.},

  abstract     = {The article puts forward the new layout methodology of the multi-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout. The proposed equipment layout methodology not just breaks the conventional single-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout but also meets the layout requirements of the intelligent manufacturing workshop for the stereoscopic aisle manufacturing cell. The layout methodology takes into account the least space occupation as well as the shortest total distance of logistics as the objective function, besides considering the limitations that exist between the equipment, different planes, different levels, and so on; also, a mathematical model is put forward. The multi-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout is solved based on the self-adapting multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm that refers to an algorithm combining fruit fly optimization algorithm and NSGA-II. Self-adapting multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm makes use of the fast nondominated sorting for the multi-target food concentration calculation, together with designing the adaptive olfactory search and visual search, and employing the perturbation operations for flight strategies, aimed at ensuring the population diversity. Simulation cases suggest that self-adapting multi-objective fruit fly optimization algorithm has stronger advantages as compared with multi-objective fruit fly algorithm and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in the solution of multi-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout problems. The final engineering case application sheds light on the fact that multi-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout saves 57.6% of the area, in addition to 23.7% of space, and 29.2% of the handling distance as compared with single-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout. Accordingly, multi-floor linear cellular manufacturing layout has a specific reference value in the layout of facilities in the intelligent manufacturing plants.},

First, we investigate previous contributions and evaluate their performances using KITTI, Technische Universität München (TUM), and New College data sets. In practical scenario, pose graph optimization starts optimizing when loop closure happens. An estimated robot pose meets more than one loop closures; Schur complement is the common method to obtain sequential pose graph results. We put forward a new algorithm without managing complex Bayes factor graph and obtain more accurate pose graph result than state-of-art algorithms. In the proposed method, we transform the problem of estimating absolute poses to the problem of estimating relative poses. We name this incremental pose graph optimization algorithm as G-pose graph optimization algorithm. Another advantage of G-pose graph optimization algorithm is robust to outliers. We add loop closure metric to deal with outlier data. Previous experiments of pose graph optimization algorithm use simulated data, which do not conform to real world, to evaluate performances. We use KITTI, TUM, and New College data sets, which are obtained by real sensor in this study. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed incremental pose graph algorithm model is stable and accurate in real-world scenario.},

  abstract     = {An advanced driving assistant system is one of the most popular topics nowadays, and depth estimation is an important cue for advanced driving assistant system. Depth prediction is a key problem in understanding the geometry of a road scene for advanced driving assistant system. In comparison to other depth estimation methods using stereo depth perception, determining depth relation using a monocular camera is considerably challenging. In this article, a fully convolutional neural network with skip connection based on a monocular video sequence is proposed. With the integration framework that combines skip connection, fully convolutional network and the consistency between consecutive frames of the input sequence, high-resolution depth maps are obtained with lightweight network training and fewer computations. The proposed method models depth estimation as a regression problem and trains the proposed network using a scale invariance optimization based on L2 loss function, which measures the relationships between points in the consecutive frames. The proposed method can be used for depth estimation of a road scene without the need for any extra information or geometric priors. Experiments on road scene data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods for monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes. Compared with the currently proposed method, our method has achieved good results when using the Eigen split evaluation method. The obvious prominent one is that the linear root mean squared error result is 3.462 and the δ &lt; 1.25 result is 0.892.},

In the present study, it is intended to optimize the conventional you only look once algorithm and propose the modified you only look once algorithm. Comparing the obtained results with the experiment shows that the modified you only look once method can be effectively applied in the graphics processing unit to reach the panoramic recognition speedup to 32 frames rate per second, which meets the real-time requirements in diverse applications.

Therefore, most of the methods are manual cleaning, which is inefficient and prone to accidents. It is of great social significance and practical value to develop an intelligent flexible warehouse cleaning robot that replaces the manual cleaning of cement. When the top of the cement warehouse is small and the volume of the cement warehouse is very large, how to ensure that the working range of the cleaning system can cover the entire area, and effectively and quickly complete the cleaning operation, and the automatic control of the cleaning robot has become an automatic control. Key issues to be addressed. Although the human–machine interface configuration technology has been widely used in automated monitoring systems, its graphical and componentized interface construction methods and the flexibility and scalability of the configuration interface have been widely recognized, but the human–machine interface, the coding method is still used in the construction, the development efficiency is low, and the interface is not open and flexible enough. At the same time, there are few research attempts on interface configuration. Interface configuration mostly only stays in the graphical phase of interface construction. Data and interactive control cannot meet the configuration requirements, and there is no complete implementation plan for configuration. Therefore, it has become an urgent need to change the traditional interface development mode and realize the configuration of man–machine interface. Based on the above background, the research content of this article is the research on the automatic control system of intelligent flexible clearing robot. Based on the understanding of the relevant properties of cement powder, this article discusses its flow state in the cement storehouse theoretically and provides a basis for subsequent structural design and stability research. A modularized and component-based configuration method for the numerical control interface is proposed. The interface is divided into three modules: data, graphics, and interactive control. The functional modules are assembled and the components are combined to implement the interface configuration. The experimental simulation results in this article show that compared to the traditional method, the amount of code editing of the configured human–machine interface is reduced by 46.34%, the development cycle is shortened by 43.72%, and the development efficiency of the configured human–machine interface has been greatly improved. It is confirmed that the configuration technology studied in this article can meet the requirements of automatic control systems.},

  abstract     = {The robotic articulated arm coordinate measuring machine (RAACMM) is a special robotic structural measuring instrument used to perform industrial field inspection. The accuracy of a RAACMM in different poses presents certain characteristics due to the influence of various dynamic factors. However, the existing error compensation model of the RAACMM cannot include dynamic factors, which imposes certain limits on improving the accuracy of the RAACMM. In this article, a residual correction method for the RAACMM based on a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is proposed to compensate the dynamic factors and improve the accuracy of the RAACMM. Firstly, the influence of the pose configuration of the RAACMM on the residual error of the probe is analyzed. The periodic characteristics of the residual error are obtained based on the analysis results. Secondly, a relationship model between the residual errors and the structural parameters is established in the cylindrical coordinate system. Then, a residual correction model based on the single point repeatability and RBFNN is proposed to further enhance the accuracy of the RAACMM. The probe of the RAACMM is constrained with a cone-hole gauge to acquire the single point repeatability data. The residual correction model is trained with the data of single point repeatability, and residual errors are calculated via the residual correction model. Experimental results show that the repeatability and measurement accuracy of the RAACMM are all improved after the residual correction, which validates the effectiveness of the residual correction method.},

  abstract     = {Fire is a fierce disaster, and smoke is the early signal of fire. Since such features as chrominance, texture, and shape of smoke are very special, a lot of methods based on these features have been developed. But these static characteristics vary widely, so there are some exceptions leading to low detection accuracy. On the other side, the motion of smoke is much more discriminating than the aforementioned features, so a time-domain neural network is proposed to extract its dynamic characteristics. This smoke recognition network has these advantages:(1) extract the spatiotemporal with the 3D filters which work on dynamic and static characteristics synchronously; (2) high accuracy, 87.31% samples being classified rightly, which is the state of the art even in a chaotic environments, and the fuzzy objects for other methods, such as haze, fog, and climbing cars, are distinguished distinctly; (3) high sensitiveness, smoke being detected averagely at the 23rd frame, which is also the state of the art, which is meaningful to alarm early fire as soon as possible; and (4) it is not been based on any hypothesis, which guarantee the method compatible. Finally, a new metric, the difference between the first frame in which smoke is detected and the first frame in which smoke happens, is proposed to compare the algorithms sensitivity in videos. The experiments confirm that the dynamic characteristics are more discriminating than the aforementioned static characteristics, and smoke recognition network is a good tool to extract compound feature.},

  abstract     = {When carrier phase observations are applied to high-precision positioning, how to handle the cycle slip is an unavoidable problem. For cycle slip correction, detection combination noise and the ionospheric delay are two crucial factors. Specifically, the drastic changes in the ionosphere and the increased noise of code observations will increase the failure probability of cycle slip detection. To reduce the influence of code observation noise and ionospheric bias, a novel cycle slip detection method for BDS-3 satellites is proposed. Considering that code measurement noise is closely related to the satellite elevation angle, an elevation-based model is built to evaluate the code measurement noise. Firstly, two modified code-phase combinations are selected optimally based on 1% missed detection rate and 99% success detection rate to minimize the effects of code measurement noise. However, the second modified code-phase combination is more affected by ionospheric delay bias, so ionospheric bias of current epoch needs to be corrected. To reduce the influence of ionospheric bias, two moving windows of time-differenced ionospheric delay are introduced to correct the ionospheric bias of the second code-phase combination. Experiments with BeiDou-3 data are implemented in three different scenarios. To verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the environment of high code observations noise, Gaussian noise is added to the code observations in the first scenario, and the results demonstrate that the success rate of cycle slip detection and repair is still greater than 95% when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise is 0.8 m. The second scenario is carried out under low ionospheric activity, and results indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces the times of failed detection and repair. Moreover, in the third scenario, BeiDou-3 data with cycle slips of different types under high ionospheric activity are tested, and all cycle slips can be correctly detected and corrected.},

The drive motors and corresponding reducers are removed from the joints to the base; meanwhile, force and motion are transmitted remotely through cables. Thanks to this design, the moving mass has been greatly reduced. In the meantime, the application of cable-driven technology also brings about extra difficulties for high-precise control of cable-driven manipulators. Hence, we design a nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller using time-delay estimation. The time-delay estimation is applied to obtain lumped system dynamics and found an attractive model-free scheme, while the nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is utilized to enhance the control performance. Stability is analyzed based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, the designed light cable-driven manipulator and presented time-delay estimation-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller are analyzed. Corresponding results show that (1) our proposed cable-driven manipulator has high load to mass ratio of 0.8 if we only consider the moving mass and (2) our proposed time-delay estimation-based nonsingular terminal sliding mode is model-free and can provide higher accuracy than the widely used time-delay estimation-based proportional–derivative (PD) controller.},

However, the current research on omnidirectional motion handling robots at home and abroad is too limited, and many problems cannot be solved well, such as single operating systems, complex algorithms, and low recognition rates. To make a high-efficiency handling robot with high recognition rate, this article studies the problem of robot image feature extraction and matching and proposes an improved speeded up robust features (SURF) algorithm that combines the advantages of both SURF and Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features. The algorithm greatly simplifies the complexity of the algorithm. Experiments show that the improved algorithm greatly improves the speed of matching and ensures the real-time and robustness of the algorithm. In this article, the problem of positioning the target workpiece of the robot is studied. The three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the target workpiece position is performed to obtain the 3-D coordinates of the target workpiece position, thereby completing the positioning work. This article designs a software framework for real-time 3-D object reconstruction. A Bayesian-based matching algorithm combined with Delaunay triangulation is used to obtain the relationship between supported and nonsupported points, and 3-D reconstruction of target objects from sparse to dense matches is achieved.},

Visual recognition system that automatically classifies wheel types is a key component in the wheel production line. Traditional recognition methods are mainly based on extracted feature matching. Their accuracy, robustness, and processing speed are often compromised considerably in actual production. To overcome this problem, we proposed a convolutional neural network approach to adaptively classify wheel types in actual production lines with a complex visual background. The essential steps to achieve wheel identification include image acquisition, image preprocessing, and classification. The image differencing algorithm and histogram technique are developed on acquired wheel images to remove track disturbances. The wheel images after image processing were organized into training and test sets. This approach improved the residual network model ResNet-18 and then evaluated this model based on the wheel test data. Experiments showed that this method can obtain an accuracy over 98% on nearly 70,000 wheel images and its single image processing time can reach millisecond level.},

Firstly, the decentralization protocols of desired line-of-sight angles are constructed based on the information of neighboring missiles. Secondly, a biased proportional navigation guidance law that can arbitrarily designate the impact angle is cited. The missiles can achieve all-aspect attack on the target in an encirclement manner by combining the biased proportional navigation guidance law and dynamic virtual targets strategy. Thirdly, the consensus protocol of simultaneous attack is designed, which can guarantee that all missiles’ time-to-go estimates achieve consensus asymptotically, and the convergence of the closed-loop system is proved strictly via the Lyapunov stability theory.

This is caused by actuator error, tire slipping, or other factors relevant to and included in the parking process. In such situations, the parking path needs to be updated to finish parking successfully which is referred to as secondary path planning. Herein, a new geometry-based method is proposed to deal with this issue, which can be called the pattern-based method. In this method, a predefined path pattern set consisting of 24 multi-segment patterns is developed first. These patterns are composed of straight lines and arcs and account for constraints due to motion and the immediate environment. Then, a traversal policy is adopted to select the path pattern from the set, and the sequential quadratic programming algorithm is used to determine the optimal parameters that fine-tune the pattern to meet the current constraints. In the simulation section, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated. Moreover, compared to the search-based method represented by a variation of rapidly exploring random tree*, the proposed method has a higher planning performance.},

  abstract     = {Faced with the problem of frequent slippage of the wheel-arm inspection robot in overhead high-voltage transmission lines, a magnetic linear drive method, based on high-voltage direct current (HVDC) magnetic field, is proposed: The ampere force of an enhanced HVDC magnetic field, generated by an innovatively arranged current-carrying coil, is used as the driving force for the traction robot, replacing the traditional wheel-arm driving method, thereby eliminating the slip. A physical model for the magnetic driving force is established, according to the characteristics of the magnetic field around the HVDC transmission line and the driving force requirements of the robot. The relationship between the magnetic driving force, the physical model size, and the number of coil windings is analyzed. The magnetic drive model is simulated using the COMSOL software version is 5.0. The simulation results of the magnetic drive force model are compared to theoretical calculations, proving the proposed method as correct. The magnetic drive device is constructed according to the proposed magnetic drive model and experiments are carried out. The results show that the magnetic drive device can provide enough traction to drive the robot motion, proving that the proposed magnetic linear drive method is technically feasible.},

  abstract     = {Pedestrian navigation with daily smart devices has become a vital issue over the past few years and the accurate heading estimation plays an essential role in it. Compared to the pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) based solutions, this article constructs a scalable error model based on the inertial navigation system and proposes an adaptive heading estimation algorithm with a novel method of relative static magnetic field detection. To mitigate the impact of magnetic fluctuation, the proposed algorithm applies a two-way Kalman filter process. Firstly, it achieves the historical states with the optimal smoothing algorithm. Secondly, it adjusts the noise parameters adaptively to reestimate current attitudes. Different from the pedestrian dead reckoning-based solution, the error model system in this article contains more state information, which means it is more sensitive and scalable. Moreover, several experiments were conducted, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed heading estimation algorithm obtains better performance than previous approaches and our system outperforms the PDR system in terms of flexibility and accuracy.},

An integrated navigation algorithm suitable for large azimuth misalignment is established under launching point inertial coordinate and local geographical coordinate system based on altitude angle and azimuth angles. Meanwhile, a Bayesian method for data dropouts aided by the strapdown celestial angles is presented for the rapid variability in the celestial star angle with active galaxies. A nonlinear Bayesian filter is applied to implement the simulation on account of the nonlinear feature of the state and measurement equations. The simulation results showed that the Bayesian method for integrated navigation data dropouts could be accomplished by altitude angle and azimuth angle aiding in both launching point inertial coordinate and local geographical coordinate systems, which converge to 1′ in 10 s. The method indicated that the integrated navigation significant errors derived from initial localization and initial attitude alignment could be modified by the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) supported by the star sensor’s celestial angle in the local geographic coordinate system in the early launch stage. For the seconds of the flight phase, the integrated navigation aided by celestial angles in the launching point inertial coordinate system was guaranteed for the feasibility and validity. During the flight, the feasibility and validity of integrated navigation were guaranteed aided by celestial angles in launching point inertial coordinate system.},

In addition, a new scheme, combining particle swarm optimization and artificial neural network training, is applied to obtain real-time parameters. The stability of the proposed methods is verified according to the Lyapunov stability criteria, and the effectiveness is verified in the application examples of spatial linear and curve trajectories with a seven-axis manipulator. The simulation results show that the improved singular robust inverse method has better optimization performance and stability. In the allowable range, the terminal error is smallest, and there is no lasting oscillation or large amplitude. The least singular value is largest, and the joint angular velocity is smallest, exactly as expected. The derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative definite. Comparing the two extended methods, the constant improved singular robust method performs better in terms of joint angular velocity and least singular value optimization, and the intelligent improved singular robust inverse method can achieve a smaller terminal error. There is little difference between their overall optimization effects. However, the adaptability of the real-time parameters makes the intelligent improved singular robust inverse method the first choice for kinematic control of redundant serial manipulators.},

  abstract     = {High tracking frame rates have been achieved based on traditional tracking methods which however would fail due to drifts of the object template or model, especially when the object disappears from the camera’s field of view. To deal with it, tracking-and-detection-combination has become more and more popular for long-term unknown object tracking, whose detector almost does not drift and can regain the disappeared object when it comes back. However, for online machine learning and multiscale object detection, expensive computing resources and time are required. So it is not a good idea to combine tracking and detection sequentially like Tracking-Learning-Detection algorithm. Inspired from parallel tracking and mapping, this article proposes a framework of parallel tracking and detection for unknown object tracking. The object tracking algorithm is split into two separate tasks—tracking and detection which can be processed in two different threads, respectively. One thread is used to deal with the tracking between consecutive frames with a high processing speed. The other thread runs online learning algorithms to construct a discriminative model for object detection. Using our proposed framework, high tracking frame rates and the ability of correcting and recovering the failed tracker can be combined effectively. Furthermore, our framework provides open interfaces to integrate state-of-the-art object tracking and detection algorithms. We carry out an evaluation of several popular tracking and detection algorithms using the proposed framework. The experimental results show that different tracking and detection algorithms can be integrated and compared effectively by our proposed framework, and robust and fast long-term object tracking can be realized.},

There are many challenges in traditional point feature-based approaches, such as insufficient point features, motion jitter, and low localization accuracy in low-texture scenes, which reduce the performance of the algorithms. In this article, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system to handle these situations, which is named Point-Line Fusion (PLF)-SLAM. We utilize both points and line segments throughout the process of our work. Specifically, we present a new line segment extraction method to solve the overlap or branch problem of the line segments, and then a more rigorous screening mechanism is proposed in the line matching section. Instead of minimizing the reprojection error of points, we introduce the reprojection error based on points and lines to get a more accurate tracking pose. In addition, we come up with a solution to handle the jitter frame, which greatly improves tracking success rate and availability of the system. We thoroughly evaluate our system on the Technische Universität München (TUM) RGB-D benchmark and compare it with ORB-SLAM2, presumably the current state-of-the-art solution. The experiments show that our system has better accuracy and robustness compared to the ORB-SLAM2.},

This observer fuses a linear matrix inequality convex optimization strategy, with the dynamics of land vehicles established mathematically, the consequent problems associated with augmented descriptor system state-space model, Lyapunov stability and linear matrix inequality convex optimization are discussed in detail. The numerical simulations on vehicular systems that suffered with single-existing deadlocking, gain scheduling, and constant deflection sensor fault are conducted. The results indicate, the fault channel outputs fairly reflect the variations of real faults under severe step-type fault input circumstances, so that the applicability of the fault observer against sensor failures is guaranteed. The proposed sensor fault construction idea is further extended to a loosely coupled inertial measurement units/global positioning system (GPS) illustration with GPS unavailable in its north velocity channel. After reconstructing the priori system state for “State one-step prediction” of Kalman filter, the compensated navigation parameters by state estimator exhibit consistent with the references as expected, the vehicle chassis dynamics-based sensor fault construction method, therefore, may be recognized as an effective measure to a class of integrated navigation systems experiencing some unknown sensor failures.},

In our mine monitoring system built in a northeast province of China, special designed unmanned aerial vehicle is applied to take photos and perceive the environment. We select a series of image-based techniques to process aerial pictures to monitor the slope. The visual features are initially refined by histogram equalization. Then, the rocks and cracks can be detected by different digital image processing operators, like Canny, so as to assess displacements. Advanced semantic segmentation model, U-Net, is also selected to process the problem. Experimental results show that both Canny and U-Net can perceive the edges in pictures effectively, better than other operators. In addition, we model the inspection mission for mine slopes into a traveling salesman problem, then plan the path for unmanned aerial vehicle by swarm intelligence-based optimization.},

Specifically, with regard to the threat assessment issue, a possibility degree function based on grey theory is structured to further improve the grey analytic hierarchy process. It can transform the interval weight of threat factors into scalar-valued weight, with which the accuracy of threat assessment can be improved. Regarding the target assignment problem, combining with interval grey number, an improved hybrid genetic algorithm is developed. The improvements are mainly consisting of adaptive crossover and mutation operators which can help to find an approximate solution within certain time constraints. Meanwhile, the simulated annealing operation is incorporated to avoid local optimum and premature phenomenon. In addition, the selection operation and fitness function are also redesigned to handle the interval numbers. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in completing the multi-objective weapon-target assignment under uncertain environment.},

The robotic manipulator used for optimization is modelled after a realistic six-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. Two cases are observed and these are a single robotic manipulator carrying a weight in a point-to-point trajectory and two robotic manipulators cooperating and moving the same weight along a calculated point-to-point trajectory. The article describes the process used for determining the kinematic properties using Denavit–Hartenberg method and the dynamic equations of the robotic manipulator using Lagrange–Euler and Newton–Euler algorithms. Then, the description of used artificial intelligence optimization algorithms is given – genetic algorithm using random and average recombination, simulated annealing using linear and geometric cooling strategy and differential evolution. The methods are compared and the results show that the genetic algorithm provides best results in regard to torque minimization, with differential evolution also providing comparatively good results and simulated annealing giving the comparatively weakest results while providing smoother torque curves.},

Additionally, the camera calibration error, robot motion error, and invalid calibration motion poses make it difficult to achieve fast and accurate online hand–eye calibration. Therefore, we propose a hand–eye calibration method with motion error compensation and vertical-component correction for 4-R(2-SS) parallel robot by improving the existing eye-to-hand model and solving method. Firstly, the eye-to-hand model of single camera is improved and the robot motion error in the improved model is compensated to reduce the influence of camera calibration error and robot motion error on model accuracy. Secondly, the vertical-component of hand–eye calibration is corrected based on vertical constraint between calibration plate and end effector in parallel robot to calculate the pose and motion error in calibration of 4-R(2-SS) parallel robot accurately. Thirdly, the nontrivial solution constraint of eye-to-hand model is constructed and adopted to remove invalid calibration motion poses and plan calibration motion. Finally, the proposed method was verified by experiments with a fruit sorting system based on 4-R(2-SS) parallel robot. Compared with random motion, the existing model, and solving method, the average time of online calibration based on planned motion decreases by 29.773 s and the average error of calibration based on the improved model and solving method decreases by 151.293. The proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency of hand–eye calibration of 4-R(2-SS) parallel robot effectively and further realize accurate and fast grasping.},

Secondly, the weighting exponent in the objective function is adjusted adaptively. Then local and global spatial constraints are added to the objective function of the fuzzy clustering method, which can reduce the noise and background interference. Finally, the Markov constrained field is calculated according to the initial segmentation result. After that the joint field of fuzzy clustering field and the Markov random field is constructed to obtain the optimized segmentation result. The algorithm is evaluated on the infrared images of electrical equipment, and the experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to noise and complicated background.

This article proposes a fast calibration approach that is different from traditional calibration algorithms. The proposed approach combines two independent calibration processes, which are the calibration of LiDAR and the camera to robot platform, so as to address the relationship between LiDAR sensor and camera sensor. A novel approach to calibrate LiDAR to robot platform is applied to improve accuracy and robustness. A series of indoor experiments are carried out and the results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient. At last, it is applied to our own outdoor security robot platform to detect both positive and negative obstacles in a field environment, in which two Velodyne-HDL-32 LiDARs and a color camera are employed.

Consecutive stereo image pairs are used to train the system while only monocular images are needed for inference. The supervisory signals for the training stage come from various forms of image synthesis. Due to the use of consecutive stereo video, both spatial and temporal photometric errors are used to synthesize the images.

  abstract     = {In this article, a robust long-term object tracking algorithm is proposed. It can tackle the challenges of scale and rotation changes during the long-term object tracking for security robots. Firstly, a robust scale and rotation estimation method is proposed to deal with scale changes and rotation motion of the object. It is based on the Fourier–Mellin transform and the kernelized correlation filter. The object’s scale and rotation can be estimated in the continuous space, and the kernelized correlation filter is used to improve the estimation accuracy and robustness. Then a weighted object searching method based on the histogram and the variance is introduced to handle the problem that trackers may fail in the long-term object tracking (due to semi-occlusion or full occlusion). When the tracked object is lost, the object can be relocated in the whole image using the searching method, so the tracker can be recovered from failures. Moreover, two other kernelized correlation filters are learned to estimate the object’s translation and the confidence of tracking results, respectively. The estimated confidence is more accurate and robust using the dedicatedly designed kernelized correlation filter, which is employed to activate the weighted object searching module, and helps to determine whether the searching windows contain objects. We compare the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on the online object tracking benchmark. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our tracking algorithm.},

Three-dimensional reconstruction based on visual image can be divided into three-dimensional reconstruction based on single photo and video. As an indirect three-dimensional modeling technology, this method is widely used in the fields of film and television production, cultural relics restoration, mechanical manufacturing, and medical health. This article studies and designs a stereo vision system based on two-dimensional image modeling technology. The system can be divided into image processing, camera calibration, stereo matching, three-dimensional point reconstruction, and model reconstruction. In the part of image processing, common image processing methods, feature point extraction algorithm, and edge extraction algorithm are studied. On this basis, interactive local corner extraction algorithm and interactive local edge detection algorithm are proposed. It is found that the Harris algorithm can effectively remove the features of less information and easy to generate clustering phenomenon. At the same time, the method of limit constraints is used to match the feature points extracted from the image. This method has high matching accuracy and short time. The experimental research has achieved good matching results. Using the platform of binocular stereo vision system, each step in the process of three-dimensional reconstruction has achieved high accuracy, thus achieving the three-dimensional reconstruction of the target object. Finally, based on the research of three-dimensional reconstruction of mechanical parts and the designed binocular stereo vision system platform, the experimental results of edge detection, camera calibration, stereo matching, and three-dimensional model reconstruction in the process of three-dimensional reconstruction are obtained, and the full text is summarized, analyzed, and prospected.},

  abstract     = {The spatio-temporal voxel grid is an actively maintained open-source project providing an improved three-dimensional environmental representation that has been garnering increased adoption in large, dynamic, and complex environments. We provide a voxel grid and the Costmap 2-D layer plug-in, Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer, powered by a real-time sparse occupancy grid with constant time access to voxels which does not scale with the environment’s size. We replace ray-casting with a new clearing technique we dub frustum acceleration that does not assume a static environment and in practice, represents moving environments better. Our method operates at nearly 400% less CPU load on average while processing 9 QVGA resolution depth cameras as compared to the voxel layer. This technique also supports sensors such as three-dimensional laser scanners, radars, and additional modern sensors that were previously unsupported in the available ROS Navigation framework that has become staples in the roboticists’ toolbox. These sensors are becoming more widely used in robotics as sensor prices are driven down and mobile compute capabilities improve. The Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer was developed in the open with community feedback over its development life cycle and continues to have additional features and capabilities added by the community. As of February 2019, the Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer is being used on over 600 robots worldwide in warehouses, factories, hospitals, hotels, stores, and libraries. The open-source software can be viewed and installed on its GitHub page at https://github.com/SteveMacenski/spatio_temporal_voxel_layer .},

Nowadays, advanced robotic systems are widely used in various fields. However, the development of artificial intelligence-based robot systems for structural health monitoring of tunnels needs to be further investigated, especially for data modeling and intelligent processing for noises. This research focuses on integrated B-spline approximation with a nonparametric rank method and reveals its advantages of high efficiency and noise resistance for the automatic health monitoring of tunnel structures. Furthermore, the root-mean-square error and time consumption of the rank-based and Huber’s M-estimator methods are compared based on various profiles. The results imply that the rank-based method to model point cloud data has a comparative advantage in the monitoring of tunnel, as well as the large-area structures, which requires high degrees of efficiency and robustness.},

The gathered product data contain a lot of design knowledge, which brings new opportunities to enhance the production efficiency and product competitiveness. Data-driven product design is an effective and popular design method, which can provide sufficient support for designers to make smart decisions. This article focuses on a comprehensive review of the existing research in data-driven product design. Based on the product design process, this article summarizes the data-driven design methods into the following aspects: customer requirement analysis, conceptual design, detailed design, and design knowledge support tools. In the customer requirement analysis stage, through data mining and transformation methods, customer requirements are predicted and then mapped to obtain accurate requirement expressions for aiding designers to explore the design space. In the conceptual design stage, the intelligent algorithms and data warehouse technologies are discussed in detail for function reasoning and scheme decision-making to achieve the iterative mapping from customer space to solution space. In the detailed design stage, data modeling languages and methods are introduced to support the simulation verification of the design process. For the design knowledge support tools, the methods of extracting knowledge from product data are discussed in detail, and the realization of computer-aided conceptual design is assisted through the development of knowledge-oriented design tools. Finally, this article summarizes the key points of data-driven product design research and provides an outlook for future research directions.},

The robot with this framework can continuously learn from multiple or changing environments where it encounters different numbers of obstacles moving in unknown ways at different times. Using both planned trajectories from a real-time motion planner and already executed trajectories as feedback observations, our reinforcement learning agent enables the robot to adapt motion behaviors to environmental changes. The agent contains a Q network connected to a long short-term memory network. The proposed framework is tested in both simulations and real robot experiments over various, dynamically varied task environments. The results show the efficacy of online continuous reinforcement learning for quick adaption to different, unknown, and dynamic environments.},

It was designed to be used in experiments in developmental robotics and has proportions to give a childlike impression while still being decidedly robotic.

The arms are designed to resemble those of a human. Each arm has five degrees of freedom, three in the shoulder, one in the elbow and one in the wrist. The hands have four movable fingers and a stationary thumb. A force distribution mechanism inside the hand connect a single servo to the movable fingers and makes sure the hand closes around an object regardless of its shape. The rigid parts of the hands are 3D printed in PLA and HIPS while the flexible parts, including the joints and the tendons, are made from polyurethane rubber. The control system for Epi is based on neurophysiological data and is implemented using the Ikaros system. Most of the sensory and motor processing is done at 40 Hz to allow smooth movements. The irises of the eyes can change colour and the pupils can dilate and contract. There is also a grid of LEDs that resembles a mouth that can be animated by changing colour and intensity.},

To address such problems, a virtual obstacle method has been developed in the literature. However, a robot may be blocked by virtual obstacles generated during performing the virtual obstacle method if the environments are complex. In this article, an improved virtual obstacle method for local path planning is designed via proposing a new minimum criterion, a new switching condition, and a new exploration force. All the three new contributions allow to overcome the drawbacks of the artificial potential field-based algorithms and the virtual obstacle method. As a consequence, feasible collision-free paths can be found in complex environments, as illustrated by final numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel robust tracking control scheme based on linear extended state observer with estimation error compensation is proposed for the tracking control of the antagonistic variable stiffness actuator based on equivalent nonlinear torsion spring and the serial variable stiffness actuator based on lever mechanism. For the dynamic models of these two classes of variable stiffness actuators, considering the parametric uncertainties, the unknown friction torques acting on the driving units, the unknown external disturbances acting on the output links and the input saturation constraints, an integral chain pseudo-linear system with input saturation constraints and matched lumped disturbances is established by coordinate transformation. Subsequently, the matched lumped disturbances in the pseudo-linear system are extended to the new system states, and we obtain an extended integral chain pseudo-linear system. Then, we design the linear extended state observer to estimate the unknown states of the extended pseudo-linear system. Considering the input saturation constraints in the extended pseudo-linear system and the estimation errors of the linear extended state observer with fixed preset observation gains, the adaptive input saturation compensation laws and the novel estimation error compensators are designed. Finally, a robust tracking controller based on linear extended state observer, sliding mode control, adaptive input saturation compensation laws, and estimating error compensators is designed to achieve simultaneous position and stiffness tracking control of these two classes of variable stiffness actuators. Under the action of the designed controller, the semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the closed-loop system is proved by the stability analysis of the candidate Lyapunov function. The simulation results show the effectiveness, robustness, and adaptability of the designed controller in the tracking control of these two classes of variable stiffness actuators. Furthermore, the simulation comparisons show the effectiveness of the proposed estimation error compensation measures in reducing the tracking errors and improving the disturbance rejection performance of the controller.},

The controller layer communicates with the multiple robots layer by Wi-Fi module. The Internet of Robotic Things system helps finish five tasks: localizing robots, planning paths, avoiding obstacles, moving to waypoint stable, and creating a map.

Based on light detection and ranging sensor data and google cartographer, simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) is also processed in this article. The fuzzy sliding mode tracking control method is proposed for each robot to guarantee the robot stable moves. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and are used to compare with the experiment result. In the experiment, one host computer and two Kobuki mobile robots with light detection and ranging and depth camera sensors are integrated as an Internet of Robotic Things system.

  abstract     = {Through numerical calculations, it could be found that when the blade surface quality reaches a certain level, the surface quality of the blade was continuously improved, and the guarantee effect on its performance would be weakened. Under this circumstance, continuing to improve the surface quality of the blade had no positive effect on the performance of the blade. Studies had shown that when the blade surface equivalent grit roughness K s reaches 4.96 (about R a = 0.8 µm), the blade performance was close to the smooth surface of the blade, and no further processing was required to improve the surface roughness. When the surface equivalent grit K s was greater than 4.96 µm, the surface roughness had a great influence on the blade performance. When K s was larger than 40 µm, the negative effect is significantly increased. For the different characteristics of the blade and different processing conditions, four kinds of robot-based blade surface grinding schemes were proposed, of which the core content was the robot layout. Based on the robot group’s fitting to the spatial surface and the path planning, the experimental verification was carried out.},

In this article, we put forward a novel motion planning technique for a Tetris-inspired reconfigurable floor cleaning robot named “hTetro” that can reconfigure its morphology to any of the seven one-sided Tetris pieces. The proposed motion planning technique adapts polyomino tiling theory to tile a defined space, generates reference coordinates, and produces a navigation path to traverse on the generated tile-set with an objective of maximizing the area coverage. We have summarized all these aspects and concluded with experiments in a simulated environment that benchmarks the proposed technique with conventional approaches. The results show that the proposed motion planning technique achieves significantly higher performance in terms of area recovered than the traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Deep classification tracking aims at classifying the candidate samples into target or background by a classifier generally trained with a binary label. However, the binary label merely distinguishes samples of different classes, while inadvertently ignoring the distinction among the samples belonging to the same class, which weakens the classification and locating ability. To cope with this problem, this article proposes a soft labeling with quasi-Gaussian structure instead of the binary labeling, which distinguishes the samples belonging to different classes and the same class simultaneously. Like as the binary label, the signs of labels for target and background samples are set to be plus and minus respectively to distinguish samples of different classes. Further, to exploit the difference among samples in the same class, the label values of samples in the same class are designed as a monotonically decreasing quasi-Gaussian function about Intersection over Union. Therefore, the corresponding response function is a two-piecewise monotonically increasing quasi-Gaussian combination function about Intersection over Union. Due to such response function, deep classification tracking trained with this proposed soft labeling achieves better classification and location performance. To validate this, the proposed soft labeling is integrated into the pipeline of the deep classification tracker SiamFC. Experimental results on OTB-2015 and VOT benchmark show that our variant achieves significant improvement to the baseline tracker while maintaining real-time tracking speed and acquires comparable accuracy as recent state-of-the-art trackers.},

As an essential step of the method, the resonance-based sparse signal decomposition algorithm is firstly employed to obtain the high-resonance part from the raw gear fault signal. To deal with the difficulty in determining the resonance frequency band, we establish a multi-input signal-output model to describe the signal components acquired from a faulty gear. Based on it, the short-frequency slip fault energy distribution graph is defined to locate the center frequency. Besides, the maximum amplitude in the short-frequency slip fault energy distribution graph can be used as a health indicator for prognosis, which is named as fault-induced resonance energy ratio. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with both simulated signal and test data. The positive results achieved in both experiments show the perfect property of the methodology for gear fault detection with high noise, especially when the fault is incipient. In addition, by comparing the fault-induced resonance energy ratio values of faulty gears with different severity, it is proved to be a reliable health indicator for gear prognostic.},

However, absorption and scattering of light in the water seriously deteriorate the underwater imaging in terms of distance and quality, especially the scattering sharply decreases the underwater image contrast and results in serious blur. This reduces the number of matching feature points between the underwater images to be stitched, while fewer matched points generated make image registration and stitching difficult. To solve the problem, a joint framework is established, which firstly involves a convolutional neural network-like algorithm composed of a symmetric convolution and deconvolution framework for underwater image enhancement. Then, it proposes an improved convolutional neural network-random sample consensus method based on VGGNet-16 framework to generate more correct matching feature points for image registration. The fusion method based on Laplacian pyramid is applied to eliminate artificial stitching traces and correct the position of stitching seam. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can restore the color and detail information of underwater images and generate more effective and sufficient matching feature points for underwater sequence images stitching.},

It has been developing since thousands of years and is increasingly loved by more and more people at home and abroad. Because of the development of the times and the influence of the change of value orientation of Tai Chi and other factors, people’s understanding of many problems of Tai Chi such as theory and method has been biased, which makes the idea of action and skill weakening and action not uniform in the process of inheritance and development of Tai Chi routines. Even the prescribed routines may be practiced and understood differently. To inherit, develop, and disseminate Tai Chi better, these traditional valuable experiences should be made scientific and standardized. With the help of the research method of sports human mechanics and advanced experimental instruments (Xsens MVN system), this article studies and analyzes the human mechanics of the main movements of traditional Yang and Wu Tai Chi, which are the most popular. This provides a scientific experimental basis for the technical research of Tai Chi. The results show that there is no significant difference between Wu-style Tai Chi and Yang-style Tai Chi practitioners in the percentage of body weight in front leg, knee joint, and sole pressure, but there is significant difference in the percentage of body weight in back leg. As a result, the foot pressure gap between Yang-style Tai Chi and Wu-style Tai Chi is smaller, while the foot pressure gap between Wu-style Tai Chi and Wu-style Tai Chi is larger. There were no significant differences in trunk force, front hip force, back hip force, front knee force, and back knee force ( p &gt; 0.05).},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning has been a promising approach in control and robotics since data-driven learning leads to non-necessity of engineering knowledge. However, it usually requires many interactions with environments to train a controller. This is a practical limitation in some real environments, for example, robots where interactions with environments are restricted and time inefficient. Thus, learning is generally conducted with a simulation environment, and after the learning, migration is performed to apply the learned policy to the real environment, but the differences between the simulation environment and the real environment, for example, friction coefficients at joints, changing loads, may cause undesired results on the migration. To solve this problem, most learning approaches concentrate on retraining, system or parameter identification, as well as adaptive policy training. In this article, we propose an approach where an adaptive policy is learned by extracting more information from the data. An environmental encoder, which indirectly reflects the parameters of an environment, is trained by explicitly incorporating model uncertainties into long-term planning and policy learning. This approach can identify the environment differences when migrating the learned policy to a real environment, thus increase the adaptability of the policy. Moreover, its applicability to autonomous learning in control tasks is also verified.},

The parallel factor analysis was used to decompose the wavelet transformed ongoing diagnostic channel–frequency–time signal and each atom is trilinearly decomposed into spatial, spectral, and temporal signature. The time–frequency–space characteristics of the single-source fault signal was extracted from the multi-source dynamic feature recognition of mechanical nonlinear multi-failure mode and the corresponding relationship between the nonlinear variable, multi-fault mode, and multi-source fault features in time, frequency, and space was obtained. In this article, a new method for the multi-fault condition monitoring of slurry pump based on parallel factor analysis and continuous wavelet transform was developed to meet the requirements of automatic monitoring and fault diagnosis of industrial process production lines.

Highly accurate real-time prosthesis control has very important applications in therapeutics, intelligent prosthesis, and other fields. However, the applicability of the current electromyogram signal recognition method is not strong because of multiple factors. These include considering one objective (correctness) only and the inability to consider differences of recognition accuracy between actions, to recognize the number of channels, or to recognize computational complexity. In this article, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a decomposition-based multi-objective differential evolution framework to construct a multi-objective model for electromyogram signals with multiple features and channels. Such channels and features are balanced and selected by using a support vector machine as an electromyogram signal classifier. Results of substantial experiment analyses indicate that the multi-objective electromyogram signal recognition method is superior to the single-objective ant colony algorithm and that the decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms with Angle-based updating and global margin ranking is better than the decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms with angle-based updating strategy in handling multi-objective models for electromyogram signals.},

  abstract     = {The aim of this article is to present a statistical comparison of the electric energy expenditure between two techniques for the generation of gait patterns in biped robots. The first one is to minimize the sum of the squared torques applied to the joints of the robot, and the second one is based on the cart-table model. For the experiments, we measured the energy delivered by the battery of the robot to the servomotors. We applied the two aforementioned methods for three velocities (0.5, 1.0, and 1.3 m/min). Additionally, each combination of method and velocity was performed by the robot 10 times. The energy expenditure for each method was compared by applying the Wilcoxon test. In all comparisons, the value of p was lower than 0.004, indicating that the differences were statistically significant. The optimization approach leads to a reduction in energy expenditure that ranged from 9.16 % to 13.35 %. The conclusion is that all the effort required to implement an approach that requires a complete dynamic model of the robot allows a significant reduction in energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {The path planning for high-speed unmanned surface vehicle raises more complicated requirements to reduce sailing time and save energy. In this article, a new predictive artificial potential field is proposed using time information and predictive potential to plan a smoother path. The principle of artificial potential field with vehicle dynamics and reachability in local minimum is studied. According to global and local path planning, the most state-of-the-art traditional artificial potential field and its drawback are analysed at first. Then we proposed predictive artificial potential field with three modifications: angle limit, velocity adjustment and predictive potential to improve the feasibility and flatness of the generated path. In addition, we compare the performance between traditional artificial potential field and predictive artificial potential field, where predictive artificial potential field successfully restricts the maximum turning angle, cuts short sailing time and intelligently avoids obstacle. From the simulation results, we also verify that predictive artificial potential field can solve concave local minimum problem and enhance the reachability in special scenario. Therefore, the more reasonable path generated by predictive artificial potential field reduces sailing time and helps conserve more energy for unmanned surface vehicle.},

The corresponding stability of the proposed control scheme has also been proved theoretically in terms of Lyapunov method. In addition, simulations and experiments are conducted for trajectory tracking to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is available to solve the uncertainties and external disturbances with self-tuning in real time. Furthermore, the prominent characteristics of the presented control scheme are quick convergence, high accuracy, and high robustness, which can achieve excellent tracking performance as compared with computed torque control scheme and conventional sliding mode control scheme.},

Nevertheless, for rapid changing or badly conditioned piles like stockpiles or landfills, conventional approaches involving massive measurements may not be applicable. To solve these problems, in this work, by utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles equipped with a camera, we propose a collaborative framework to estimate volumes of free-formed piles accurately in short time. Compensating aerial- and ground views enable the reconstruction of piles with steep sides that is hard to be observed by single unmanned aerial vehicle. With the help of red-green-blue image sequences captured by unmanned aerial vehicles, we are able to distinguish piles from the ground in reconstructed point clouds and automatically eliminate concave on the ground while estimating pile volume. In the experiments, we compared our method to state-of-the-art dense reconstruction photogrammetry approaches. The results show that our approach for pile volume estimation has proved its feasibility for industrial use and its availability to free-formed piles on a different scale, providing high-accuracy estimation results in short time.},

In order to realize the coordinate control of the rudder roll stabilization and path following, a robust controller with roll constraints is designed by combining predictive control with disturbance observer. Firstly, the rudder angle operating range is divided in the Serret–Frenet coordination frame, and then linear models corresponding to different equilibrium can be established with heading control and roll dynamics. Secondly, considering external disturbance and unmodeled error as the lumped disturbances, the disturbance observer can be utilized to achieve the real-time feedforward compensation leading to the improved system robustness. Thirdly, the output redefinition method is adopted to transfer the original system into a new minimum phase system. Based on the receding horizon and state prediction strategies of the predictive control, the analytical control law can be obtained, and the linear programming method is used to guarantee the roll constraint for the simplified computational burden. Lastly, the simulations have been carried out to show the good performance of the proposed algorithm with the heading control and roll reduction.},

In this article, the variation law of seawater density changing with depth is considered; based on the theory of rigid body dynamics, the motion model of blended-wing-body underwater glider is established; the energy consumption model of each component module is accounted by analyzing the energy consumption composition in the working process of blended-wing-body underwater glider; and the energy consumption under different navigation depths, different glide ratios, and different buoyancy adjustments regulation is simulated. The results demonstrate that as the glide depth is increased, the total energy consumption increases in a single cycle and decreases per gliding distance, leading to a smaller energy consumption ratio for the attitude adjustment module; on the other hand, as the buoyancy adjustment is increased, more energy is consumed in a single cycle and less energy is consumed per gliding distanced, resulting in a larger energy consumption ratio for the attitude adjustment module. As the glide ratio increases, the total energy consumption in a single cycle first increases and then decreases, while the energy consumption of per gliding distance and the energy consumption ratio of the attitude adjustment module are decreased.},

  abstract     = {An accurate model is important for the engineer to design a robust controller for the autonomous underwater vehicle. There are two factors that make the identification difficult to get accurate parameters of an AUV model in practice. Firstly, the autonomous underwater vehicle model is a coupled six-degrees-of-freedom model, and each state of the kinetic model influences the other five states. Secondly, there are more than 100 hydrodynamic coefficients which have different effects, and some parameters are too small to be identified. This article proposes a simplified six-degrees-of-freedom model that contains the essential parameters and employs the multi-innovation least squares algorithm based on the recursive least squares algorithm to obtain the parameters. The multi-innovation least squares algorithm leverages several past errors to identify the parameters, and the identification results are more accurate than those of the recursive least squares algorithm. It collects the practical data through an experiment and designs a numerical program to identify the model parameters. Meanwhile, it compares the performances of the multi-innovation least squares algorithm with those of the recursive least squares algorithm and the least square method, the results show that the multi-innovation least squares algorithm is the most effective way to identify parameters for the simplified six-degrees-of-freedom model.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel, efficient grasp synthesis method is introduced that can be used for closed-loop robotic grasping. Using only a single monocular camera, the proposed approach can detect contour information from an image in real time and then determine the precise position of an object to be grasped by matching its contour with a given template. This approach is much lighter than the currently prevailing methods, especially vision-based deep-learning techniques, in that it requires no prior training. With the use of the state-of-the-art techniques of edge detection, superpixel segmentation, and shape matching, our visual servoing method does not rely on accurate camera calibration or position control and is able to adapt to dynamic environments. Experiments show that the approach provides high levels of compliance, performance, and robustness under diverse experiment environments.},

The system uses surround-view cameras, other low-cost sensors, and a lane-level road map which suits for mass deployment. A map-matching localizer is proposed to estimate the probabilistic lateral position. It consists of a sub-map extraction module, a perceptual model, and a matching model. A probabilistic lateral road feature is devised as a sub-map without limitations of road structures. The perceptual model is a deep learning network that processes raw images from surround-view cameras to extract a local probabilistic lateral road feature. Unlike conventional deep-learning-based methods, the perceptual model is trained by auto-generated labels from the lane-level map to reduce manual effort. The matching model computes the correlation between the sub-map and the local probabilistic lateral road feature to output the probabilistic lateral estimation. A particle-filter-based framework is developed to fuse the output of map-matching localizer with the measurements from wheel speed sensors and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system provides the localization results with submeter accuracy in different driving conditions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the environmental perception technology for robotic system has attracted a lot of attention from researchers, but only a little of studies on environmental perception technology are focused on the space underground. Meanwhile, in the field of mobile robotic systems, with the development of research on underground emergency hedging and buried targets’ high-resolution fault imaging, more and more attention has also been paid to underground environmental detection and perception. This article proposes a ground-penetrating radar-based underground environmental perception radar (UEPR) for mobile robotic system indoors. The underground environmental perception radar can achieve noncontact and real-time perception, which helps people detect buried targets and get the image of targets more conveniently and precisely. Major contributions of this work are threefold. Firstly, a stepped frequency continuous wave modulation and demodulation scheme is proposed; secondly, a switch device for a six-channel antenna array is designed and contributed; thirdly, based on a linear antenna array and a signal processing platform, the underground environmental perception radar is supposed to achieve three-dimensional imaging in underground space indoors with its low power consumption. For the experiment of three-dimensional imaging on the copper box and underground environment indoors, the process of imaging is successful, although the size of them is a little bigger than the real size. In addition, the comparison experiment shows that the resolution of underground environmental perception radar system is similar with that of sound wave methods, and the working range of underground environmental perception radar system is deeper than the others. It can be concluded that the underground environmental perception radar can detect the copper box underground and perceive something special within 1.5 m depth.},

However, the low absolute positioning accuracy limits their expansion in the area of high-precision manufacturing. Aiming to improve the positioning accuracy, a compensation method for the positioning error is put forward in terms of the optimization of the experimental measurement space and accurate modelling of the positioning error. Firstly, the influence of robot kinematic performance on the measurement accuracy is analysed, and a quantitative index describing the performance is adopted. On this basis and combined with the joints motion characteristics, the optimized measurement space in joint space as well as Cartesian space is obtained respectively, which can provide accurate measurement data to the error model. Then the overall model of the positioning error is constructed based on modified Denavit–Hartenberg method, in which the geometric errors and compliance errors are considered comprehensively, and an error decoupling method between them is carried out based on the error-feature analyses. Experiments on the KUKA KR210 robot are carried out finally. The mean absolute positioning accuracy of the robot increases from 1.179 mm to 0.093 mm, which verifies the effectiveness of the compensation methodology in this article.},

An analysis of the time-varying arm of force in omniwheel revealed that it increased the accuracy of the walking assistance training robot dynamic model. Thus, an adaptive law was designed such that the vibration caused by the time-varying arm of force in omniwheel was eliminated. The mean absolute practical stability in the position and velocity tracking errors was verified based on Young’s inequality and stochastic stability theory.

Specifically, the step distance adjustment and step duration adjustment are set to be optimization objectives, while the change of pressure center is treated as the optimal input to minimize those objectives. With the current system state being used for online re-optimization, a feedback gait generator is formed to realize the strong stability of variable speed and variable step distance walking of the robot. The main contributions of this work are twofold. First, a gait generation mechanism based on flexible model predictive control is proposed, which avoids the problem of nonlinear optimization. Second, a variety of feasible optimization constraints were considered, they can be used on platforms with different computing resources.

  abstract     = {Leg stiffness plays a critical role in legged robots’ speed regulation. However, the analytic solutions to the differential equations of the stance phase do not exist, of course not for the exact analytical solution of stiffness. In view of the challenge in dealing with every circumstance by numerical methods, which have been adopted to tabulate approximate answers, the “harmonic motion model” was used as approximation of the stance phase. However, the wide range leg sweep angles and small fluctuations of the “center of mass” in fast movement were overlooked. In this article, we raise a “triangle motion model” with uniform forward speed, symmetric movement, and straight-line center of mass trajectory. The characters are then shifted to a quadratic equation by Taylor expansion and obtain an approximate analytical solution. Both the numerical simulation and ADAMS-Matlab co-simulation of the control system show the accuracy of the triangle motion model method in predicting leg stiffness even in the ultra-high-speed case, and it is also adaptable to low-speed cases. The study illuminates the relationship between leg stiffness and speed, and the approximation model of the planar spring–mass system may serve as an analytical tool for leg stiffness estimation in high-speed locomotion.},

  abstract     = {Parking automated guided vehicle is more and more widely used for efficient automatic parking and one of the tough challenges for parking automated guided vehicle is the problem of vehicle pose estimation. The traditional algorithms rely on the profile information of vehicle body and sensors are required to be mounted at the top of the vehicle. However, the sensors are always mounted at a lower place because the height of a parking automated guided vehicle is always beyond 0.2mm, where we can only get the vehicle wheel information and limited vehicle body information. In this article, a novel method is given based on the symmetry of wheel point clouds collected by 3-D lidar. Firstly, we combine cell-based method with support vector machine classifier to segment ground point clouds. Secondly, wheel point clouds are segmented from obstacle point clouds and their symmetry are corrected by iterative closest point algorithm. Then, we estimate the vehicle pose by the symmetry plane of wheel point clouds. Finally, we compare our method with registration method that combines sample consensus initial alignment algorithm and iterative closest point algorithm. The experiments have been carried out.},

Due to the model uncertainty and complex environments, the tracking performance of the controller can be significantly decreased.

The simulation results prove that the designed model-free controller ensures that all the states and signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, the system has a faster response speed and smaller steady-state error comparing with the traditional dynamic surface control using the selective compliance assembly robot arm model, and the tracking error converge to a very small scale.

  abstract     = {Free space algorithms are kind of graphics-based methods for path planning. With previously known map information, graphics-based methods have high computational efficiency in providing a feasible path. However, the existing free space algorithms do not guarantee the global optimality because they always search in one connected domain but not all the possible connected domains. To overcome this drawback, this article presents an improved free space algorithm based on map decomposition with multiple connected domains and artificial bee colony algorithm. First, a decomposition algorithm of single-connected concave polygon is introduced based on the principle of concave polygon convex decomposition. Any map without obstacle is taken as single-connected concave polygon (the convex polygon map can be seen as already decomposed and will not be discussed here). Single concave polygon can be decomposed into convex polygons by connecting concave points with their visible vertex. Second, decomposition algorithm for multi-connected concave polygon (any map with obstacles) is designed. It can be converted into single-connected concave polygon by excluding obstacles using virtual links. The map can be decomposed into several convex polygons which form multiple connected domains. Third, artificial bee colony algorithm is used to search the optimal path in all the connected domains so as to avoid falling into the local minimum. Numerical simulations and comparisons with existing free space algorithm and rapidly exploring random tree star algorithm are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that this method is able to find the optimal path with high computational efficiency and accuracy. It has advantages especially for complex maps. Furthermore, parameter sensitivity analysis is provided and the suggested values for parameters are given.},

Moreover, the conventional methods of accurate alignment fail to succeed within an acceptable period of time due to the slow convergence of the heading channel in the mooring conditions. In this work, the heading was adjusted using the velocity bias resulting from the component of the angular velocity of the Earth on the east channel on the strapdown inertial navigation systems analytic platform plane to accelerate convergence in the initial alignment of navigation system. To this end, an extended Kalman filter with control signal feedback was used.

  abstract     = {On-orbit capture is an important technique for the space debris removal, refueling, or malfunction satellite repairing. While due to the uncertainty of the motion parameters of the space noncooperative target, the impact between the capture device and the noncooperative target during the capturing process is inevitable, which may bring strong vibration perturbation to the base satellite, and potentially alter the position and the attitude of the servicing spacecraft, or even cause failure of on-orbit tasks. This article presents a new and alternative method for passive suppression of spacecraft impact and perturbation during noncooperative spacecraft capture. The passive device based on bioinspired X-shape is installed between the satellite and the capture device. In the capture process, nonlinear damping of the passive isolation structure can significantly reduce impact/vibration perturbation. For performance analysis, dynamic equations of the isolation system are established. Based on which, the relationship between structure parameters and isolation performance is systematically analyzed.

The exoskeleton is based on remote center of motion mechanisms in order to avoid mechanical interference with the user’s fingers and is manufactured by three-dimensional printing. The developed exoskeleton is applied in a mobile robot teleoperation by mapping the finger movements in forward and turning commands for the robot. The presence of obstacles detected by the robot is sensed by the user by means of a feedback force. The problem of simultaneously communicating a data acquisition card and the robot hardware by MATLAB ® Simulink® was solved by using an external Wi-Fi module. The result is a lightweight exoskeleton which is able to communicate bidirectionally with a mobile robot by a personal computer for teleoperation tasks. The success of the system implementation is proven by a set of experiments presented in the final part of the article.},

This article presents a novel camera calibration method to improve the accuracy of stereo vision systems for three-dimensional point localization. The proposed camera calibration method uses the least square method to model the error caused by the image digitalization and the lens distortion. To obtain particular three-dimensional point coordinates, the stereo vision systems use the information of two images taken by two different cameras. Then, the system locates the two-dimensional pixel coordinates of the three-dimensional point in both images and coverts them into angles. With the obtained angles, the system finds the three-dimensional point coordinates through a triangulation process. The proposed camera calibration method is applied in the stereo vision systems, and a comparative analysis between the real and calibrated three-dimensional data points is performed to validate the improvements. Moreover, the developed method is compared with three classical calibration methods to analyze their advantages in terms of accuracy with respect to tested methods.},

The vector method is used to analyze the kinematics of the reduction robot. The Jacobian matrix of the reduction robot and the second-order influence coefficient matrix of the acceleration are obtained. The Lagrangian method is adopted to analyze the dynamic of the reduction robot. The muscle contraction force of the femoral shaft fracture is analyzed based on the Hill model to determine the fracture reduction force. According to changing of the reduction force during the fracture reduction operation, a kind of external force estimation method based on force residual analysis is proposed. When there is no external force sensor at the end of the reduction robot, this method can be used to detect the reduction force in real time. According to the displacement, velocity, and output torque of each branch chain, the reduction force during the reduction operation of the reduction robot can be estimated. A simulation system is conducted and the simulation results show that the fracture reduction force can be estimated and accurately tracked in real time, which is of great significance for the safe operation of the fracture reduction robot.},

Traversing such environments is usually solved through vision-based reasoning on footholds and feedback loops—such as ground force control. Uncertain terrains are still traversed slowly to keep inaccuracies in the perceived environment model low. In this article, we present a ground force-control scheme that allows for fast traversal of uneven terrain—including unplanned partial footholds—without using vision-based data. The approach is composed of an early-contact method, direct force control with an adaptive contact model, and a strategy to adapt the center of mass height based on contact force data. The proposed method enables the humanoid robot L ola to walk over a complex uneven terrain with 6 cm variation in ground height at a walking speed of 0.5 m/s. We consider our work a general improvement on the robustness to terrain uncertainties caused by inaccurate or even lacking information on the environment.},

In order to get more precision neural network, and avoid the influence of fruit recognition caused by branches or leaves shadow, apple along with branches and leaves is allowed to train. The results of experiments show that compared with the traditional back-propagation, Elman neural network, and other two recognition algorithms of obscured fruit. the genetic Elman neural network algorithm is the optimal method which successful training rate can reach to 100%, recognition rate of overlapping fruit and obscured fruit can reach to 88.67% and 93.64%, respectively, and the total recognition rate reaches to 94.88%.},

Moreover, numerous studies have mainly focused on planning the global trajectories in the entire field to increase field efficiency, and very few works are related to maneuver generation and vehicle control in headlands. In this study, a feedforward-plus-proportional–integral–derivative controller for a differential drive robot in headland turning was developed. The feedforward-plus-proportional–integral–derivative controller consisted of a feedforward and a feedback loop. The feedforward loop was designed based on the heading errors of a lookahead point on the planning path. The feedback loop was designed based on radial errors to improve the tracking accuracy. Field comparison tests of feedforward, feedback, and feedforward-plus-proportional–integral–derivative controllers were conducted. Experimental results showed that the feedforward-plus-proportional–integral–derivative had better tracking results and took less turning time.},

Second, based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient algorithm, demonstrations are leveraged to overcome the exploration problem and speed up the policy training process.

Due to the unilateral property of cables and the flexible compression spring, the kinematic model cannot define the workspace directly; it should be combined with the statics for possible solution, including the spring lateral buckling model based on the elliptic integral solution. Moreover, a global tension index which is to evaluate the wrench-closure property of the global workspace, combined with an index which is to assess the size of the workspace, is proposed to better compare the effects of different external wrench payloads and different structural parameters on the workspace.

Occupancy grid maps are sufficient for mobile robots to complete point-to-point navigation tasks in 2-D small-scale environments. However, when used in the real domestic scene, grid maps are lack of semantic information for end users to specify navigation tasks conveniently. Semantic grid maps, enhancing the occupancy grid map with the semantics of objects and rooms, endowing the robots with the capacity of robust navigation skills and human-friendly operation modes, are thus proposed to overcome this limitation. In our method, an object semantic grid map is built with low-cost sonar and binocular stereovision sensors by correctly fusing the occupancy grid map and object point clouds. Topological spaces of each object are defined to make robots autonomously select navigation destinations. Based on the domestic common sense of the relationship between rooms and objects, topological segmentation is used to get room semantics. Our method is evaluated in a real homelike environment, and the results show that the generated map is at a satisfactory precision and feasible for a domestic mobile robot to complete navigation tasks commanded in natural language with a high success rate.},

An operating torque detection technology is proposed, which could accurately measure the operating torque of the disconnector without destroying its original shafting. Using this technology, the operating torque curves of the disconnector in normal state and typical mechanical defect simulation states are measured and compared. The results indicate that the operating torque changes with the mechanical state of disconnector, and these changes could be quantified through the proposed detection technology. And the types of mechanical defects can be distinguished according to their different effects on the operating torque curve. Based on this, a practical mechanical defects diagnosis method is summarized to provide reference for maintainers to diagnose the mechanical defects of disconnectors.},

  abstract     = {In today’s Internet age, a lot of data is stored and used, which is very important. In people’s daily life, if these data are sorted, information retrieval technology will be used, and in information retrieval, some information retrieval inaccuracies often appear. Information retrieval model is an important framework and method for fast, complete, and accurate user information retrieval. With the rapid development of information technology, great changes have taken place in people’s production and life. Various information network technologies are widely used in people’s lives. The resulting flow of information shows explosive growth, information retrieval. User requirements are getting higher and higher. How to complete personalized information retrieval in a large amount of mixed information, so that retrieval technology can help us obtain effective retrieval results, has become a realistic problem worth exploring. In this article, the application of probability model based on sensitive similarity measure in information retrieval model is analyzed, and a similarity measure algorithm based on spectral clustering is proposed. By improving the similarity measure, the sensitivity problem of scale parameters is overcome and the retrieval precision is improved. In order to better reflect the superiority of the proposed algorithm, this article compares with ng-jordan-weiss (NJW) and deep sparse subspace clustering (DSSC) algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to NJW and DSSC algorithms for different data sets in different evaluation indicators (Rand and F-measure).},

  abstract     = {Most nonrigid motions use shape-based methods to solve the problem; however, the use of discrete cosine transform trajectory-based methods to solve the nonrigid motion problem is also very prominent. The signal undergoes discrete transformation due to the transform characteristics of the discrete cosine transform. The correlation of the data is well extracted such that a better compression of data is achieved. However, it is important to select the number and sequence of discrete cosine transform trajectory basis appropriately. The error of reconstruction and operational costs will increase for a high value of K (number of trajectory basis). On the other hand, a lower value of K would lead to the exclusion of information components. This will lead to poor accuracy as the structure of the object cannot be fully represented. When the number of trajectory basis is determined, the combination form has a considerable influence on the reconstruction algorithm. This article selects an appropriate number and combination of trajectory basis by analyzing the spectrum of re-projection errors and realizes the automatic selection of trajectory basis. Then, combining with the probability framework of normal distribution of a low-order model matrix, the energy information of the high-frequency part is retained, which not only helps maintain accuracy but also improves reconstruction efficiency. The proposed method can be used to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of sparse data under more precise prior conditions and lower computational costs.},

The idea behind this algorithm is that the movement of a virtual vehicle on a predefined path is controlled by a differential equation whose input is a control deviation representing the distance between a real and a virtual vehicle. The main advantage of the path-following approach is that, based on this approach, the feedback realized is invariant to the path.},

However, it is challenging for a robot to explore an unknown environment with high efficiency and full coverage autonomously. In this article, we propose a novel exploration path planning method based on information entropy. An information entropy map is first constructed, and its boundary features are extracted. Then a Dijkstra-based algorithm is applied to generate candidate exploration paths based on the boundary features. The dead-reckoning algorithm is used to predict the uncertainty of the robot’s pose along each candidate path. The exploration path is selected based on exploration efficiency and/or high coverage. Simulations and experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method’s effectiveness. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved not only higher exploration efficiency but also a larger coverage area.},

It is impossible to find all solutions for the inverse displacement analysis since there are infinite solution possibilities. By planning the pose of distal moving platforms for robot modules, the problem of the inverse displacement analysis of the hyper-redundant robot is transformed into that of a parallel mechanism. The inverse velocity and acceleration computation are then implemented using a method of the numerical differentiation.

In combination with the vibration signal extracted by the robot, we study the influence law of the residual stress of the material through numerical simulation and experimental verification. The detection of residual stress is related to the change in the number of taps of the robot and the increase or decrease in the number of taps of the robot. We used the vibration signal extracted by the robot and analyzed the orthogonal parameters of the high-frequency induction welding process parameters to obtain a set of the most unique process parameters: The tapping angle was 7° and the tapping frequency was 300 Hz. We also set up the robot to extract and analyze the vibration signal using four different hammerheads. The results show that the sub-resonance analysis results as the standard, the deviation of the steel head and the aluminum head hammer is about ±10, the result is more accurate, and the frequency of the nylon and plastic hammer is lower, because it is softer. When the hammer is struck, the contact time of the hammerhead with the workpiece is lengthened, so that a lower frequency can be excited.},

  abstract     = {Automation is a process of handling and transport of products, which allows replacing man’s control by operation of manipulators and robots. It represents a highly complex process, which includes several operations and they are usually performed automatically by particular devices. In this article, a technical design of a universal versatile robotic manipulator for handling with automotive products is presented. The designed device is intended for handling with automotive products with a maximum weight of 25 kg. The technical solution of the manipulator comes from required specifications and operation conditions given by the customer, who will install it as a part of an automatic line. A particularity of the manipulator is the special functionality, which allows handling with objects of both circular and angular shapes. This is ensured by adaptable gripping fingers, which are able to adjust their position by means of a well-considered mechanism. The technical design of the manipulator includes calculation of forces needed for reliable gripping of manipulated objects, choice of a working screw and calculation of the load and carrying out of strength analyses of the main loaded part of the manipulator. Based on results, there is recommended an appropriate material for the manufacture of the device to reach its optimal accuracy of positioning of handled objects during a long-term operation.},

  abstract     = {This article concentrates on the study of finite-time attitude stabilization for a rigid spacecraft with output constraints. The dynamics of the spacecraft are expressed by modified Rodrigues parameters, so that the singularity of covariance matrix owing to quaternion’s redundancy is eliminated. Based on the backstepping technique in combination with adding a power integrator technique, the attitude stabilization control law is constructed. Rigorous mathematical proof shows that the closed-loop system is finite time stable and all the outputs remain bounded by using a barrier Lyapunov function technique. The effectiveness of the proposed finite-time stabilization scheme is verified by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This article describes the development of an unmanned aerial vehicle system that had a remarkable performance in the 6th International Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Innovation Grand Prix, which was held on November 2–4, 2018, in Anji, China. The main mission of the competition was to build a simulated tower using prefabricated components by an unmanned rotorcraft, which could be decomposed into the following four subtasks: (1) navigation and control, (2) recognition and location, (3) grasp and construction, and (4) task planning and scheduling. All the tasks were required to perform autonomously without human intervention. According to the requirement of the mission, the unmanned aerial vehicle system was designed and implemented with high degree of autonomy and reliability, whose hardware was developed on a quadrotor platform by integrating various system components, including sensors, computers, power, and grasp mechanism. Software algorithms were exploited, and executable computer codes were implemented and integrated with the developed unmanned aerial vehicle hardware system. Integration of the two provided onboard intelligence to complete the mission. This article addresses the major components and development process of the unmanned aerial vehicle system and describes its applications to the competition mission.},

  abstract     = {Soft robotic grippers with compliance have great superiority in grabbing objects with irregular shape or fragility compared with traditional rigid grippers. The main limitations of such systems are small grasping force resulted from properties of soft actuators and lacking variable stiffness of soft robotic grippers, which prevent them from a larger wide range of applications. This article proposes a shape-memory alloy (SMA)-based soft gripper with variable stiffness composed of three robotic fingers for grasping compliantly at low stiffness and holding robustly at high stiffness. Each robotic finger mainly consisted of stiff parts and two variable stiffness joints is installed on the base with a specific angle. The paraffin as a variable stiffness material in the joint can be heated or cooled to change the stiffness of the robotic fingers. Results of experiments have shown that a single robotic finger can approximately achieve 18-fold stiffness enhancement. Each finger with two joints can actively achieve multiple postures by both changing the corresponding stiffness of joints and actuating the SMA wire. Based on these principles, the gripper can be applied to grasp objects with different shapes and a large range of weights, and the maximum grasping force of the gripper is increased to about 10 times using the variable stiffness joints. The final experiment is conducted to validate variable stiffness of the proposed soft grippers grasping an object.},
