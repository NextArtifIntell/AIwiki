The generated uncertainty from each thruster is modeled as a Gaussian white noise process, multiplicative in control. An optimal stochastic control law is derived for precision pointing and three-axis stabilization. To derive the optimal control, a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation is formulated, and a power series-based method is employed to approximate the optimal control. The derived nonlinear control minimizes the objective function of the Lagrange problem in an infinite horizon setting. Stability and existence conditions of control are provided. The nonlinear stochastic optimal controller is compared to its deterministic counterpart for a 6U CubeSat model.},

The problem of finding total optimal cooperative rendezvous orbits is formulated and solved as a nonlinear programming problem using analytic expressions for optimal orbit transfer costs. Each spacecraft has propulsive abilities, and optimal rendezvous orbits are found for planar (match semimajor axis and eccentricity) and three-dimensional (match semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination) scenarios. The costs found for this type of rendezvous are lower-bound costs for finite-time full rendezvous where all spacecraft would have matching sets of all six orbit elements. This lower-bound cost, which is realizable for full rendezvous given infinite time and secular perturbations, is shown to be also realizable for finite-time full rendezvous if certain initial conditions can be met. Finally, application of the cooperative rendezvous problem to constellation deployment is briefly discussed.},

The overactuated design that is proposed for the solar sail resulted in a mixed-integer-continuous and nonlinear optimization for control allocation. Trying to solve this complex problem by common numerical and analytical approaches, either the desired torque has been found at the expense of a long and noneligible length of time or they failed to converge at a certain extremum. Thus, addressing the desired torque to the space of possibilities has been accomplished by formulating the attainable moments of forces of each vane by a modified egg-shaped equation in three dimensions. The optimization problem of the control allocation has been solved to minimize the overall changes in vane angles as object function by a hybrid optimization. The accuracy of value matching between the target and the actual torques and the huge improvement in time consumption to achieve optimized control allocation is evaluated in the results.},

  abstract     = {The generation of bounded trajectories complying with operational constraints in the complex dynamic environment surrounding Phobos is not an easy task. The vicinity of Phobos is dominated by the gravity field of Mars; consequently, orbiting on a Keplerian orbit about this moon is not feasible. The quasi-satellite orbit (QSO) is a means to orbit Phobos in the sense of relative motion. In particular, the three-dimensional QSO (3D QSO) has been recently suggested as an approach for better meeting mission objectives, such as global mapping. However, the linear stability of QSOs concluded in the simplified three-body model cannot sufficiently ensure a stability domain for operations. In this context, this paper investigates the strategy for designing bounded orbits with desired stability properties and characteristics for observation. Families of periodic 3D QSOs are first computed in the circular-restricted three-body problem. The sensitivity of the QSOs to the initial epoch and operational errors is analyzed, revealing effective stability levels and region that can guide trajectory and operation design. The stability levels are then validated by a dispersion analysis in the full dynamics. Furthermore, being guided by effective stability, a preliminary attempt to maintain low-altitude and high-inclination QSOs in the full dynamics has proven successful.},

  abstract     = {Saturn’s moon Enceladus is one of the most promising candidates in the solar system for hosting microbial life. Plumes emanating from its south pole are ejecting water directly from the ocean to space. The Enceladus Explorer (EnEx) lander mission concept aims to land near a plume source and deploy a melting probe to sample liquid pockets under the plumes for life. Landing there would be exceptionally challenging due to the rough canyonous topography, polar lighting conditions, a surface covered by superfine snow, and strict planetary protection regulations. In this work the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&amp;C) system and operations for the critical approach phase of such a landing are investigated. An advanced GN&amp;C system is defined, comprising extended Kalman filter simultaneous localization and mapping (EKF-SLAM)–based navigation, fuzzy-reasoning-based hazard detection and avoidance, and convex guidance. To verify the landing feasibility and further refine the concept, the system is investigated using a closed-loop simulation tool we created. The performance of each function is analyzed separately with sensitivity and worst-case analyses. A Monte Carlo simulation encompassing all functions is performed to estimate mission success statistics.},

The ability to adjust the aircraft response characteristics and handling qualities has various purposes, such as pilot training, control system development, and handling quality research. A variable stability control system is designed for a medium-range business jet using incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion. The performance of the in-flight simulator is verified by two experiments, one conducted in a fixed-base flight simulator and one in a Cessna Citation II laboratory aircraft. The fly-by-wire actuation system in the Cessna Citation II is based on its existing autopilot, inheriting the limited performance and safety protections. The simulator experiment shows differences between the experienced handling qualities for a reference model and the designed controller combined with aircraft dynamics. These differences mainly arise due to actuator saturation for specific handling quality settings. The in-flight experiment supports the simulator findings but also reveals how the available control authority around the initial condition is limited due to constraints of the fly-by-wire system.},

  abstract     = {This paper revisits the stationary alignment problem of attitude and heading reference systems (AHRSs). The investigation is initiated from the three-axis attitude determination (TRIAD)–based method, purposely chosen to use nonunitary/nonorthogonal observations of the local gravity and Earth’s magnetic flux density vectors. For the simplifying assumption of body and navigation frames aligned, a comprehensive error analysis is developed, providing additional insight into the problem. Closed-form formulas for the residual normality and orthogonality errors are used to devise innovative pseudo-bias estimation (PBE) algorithms for the - and -axis magnetometer biases, as well as for the -axis accelerometer bias. As a direct consequence of applying the latter, and also figuring as the main contribution of this paper, an improved (more accurate) AHRS stationary alignment approach is obtained, herein called TRIAD-PBE. The error analysis is extended to representative state-of-the-art attitude determination techniques, confirming the relevance of TRIAD-PBE, especially in the presence of hard-iron magnetism. Results from simulated and experimental tests confirm the adequacy of the outlined verifications.},

  abstract     = {Controlling agile and complex air-vehicle maneuvers requires knowledge of the full flight envelope and dominant modes of motion. This paper presents a comprehensive approach for determining the full flight envelope and trim map of minimally actuated flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles that are capable of a broad range of coupled longitudinal–lateral–directional aerobatic maneuvers. By this approach, a representative set of realizable set points and trim conditions can be determined from the flight dynamic model, including asymmetric and unstable maneuvers. Data-driven dynamic mode decomposition is used to identify and analyze the dominant modes of motion both in simulations and physical experiments involving the RoboBee. The dominant eigenplanes and stability characteristics of this flapping-wing robot are successfully validated experimentally for both stable and unstable asymmetric full-envelope maneuvers, including rapidly uncontrolled tumbling.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a runtime assurance (RTA) framework for an unmanned aerospace application. RTA systems hold the promise of protecting feedback systems that contain advanced or experimental elements that cannot be completely tested at design time to their required levels of assurance. This inability of fully trusting such advanced systems is due to their inherent complexity and that current analysis, verification, and validation protocols cannot address such complexity. The necessary structure of RTA frameworks for multilevel interacting feedback systems is investigated. A challenge problem is constructed for a fleet of unmanned aircraft systems performing complex missions. The complete study involves integrating RTA systems for the inner-loop control, outer-loop guidance, vehicle flight management, and runtime mission planning elements. The RTA interactions between these feedback levels are explored in this effort. General required RTA checks are presented and the critical reversionary switching conditions defined. More detailed system design is presented for the outer-loop guidance feedback level.},

A set of observables is discovered to represent the nonlinear attitude dynamics on using an infinite-dimensional linear system. With the assumption of low angular velocities, a finite-dimensional linear system is obtained by removing the high-order terms. An attitude control synthesis method is developed on the basis of the linear optimal control algorithm for the reduced linear system. The proposed controller design method is compared with some classical nonlinear optimal controllers to show its advantages. Also, the leaderless attitude synchronization problem is solved with the help of the reduced linear system and the well-studied linear multiagent system theory. Furthermore, a possible solution to the case with a high angular velocity is provided. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the theory.},

  abstract     = {A full flight-envelope simulation model of the Calspan Variable Stability Learjet-25 was developed from flight data. The model is based on a stitched model architecture, which falls into the class of quasi-linear-parameter-varying models, and was developed using a series of discrete linear point models and trim data. Point models were identified from flight data at five different flight and loading conditions. A scaling method was used and validated to convert all identified point models to a common loading configuration. The quasi-linear aerodynamics from the models were then combined with trim data and the full nonlinear equations of motion to develop the stitched model. Through validation with flight data not used in the model development, the model was shown to accurately represent the aircraft dynamics within the normal flight envelope and be able to estimate the effects of weight and center of gravity variations. The paper provides a brief background of model stitching, lists the steps required to develop a stitched model from flight data, and then demonstrates how the steps are applied to the Learjet.},

This method is incorporated into a Fourier pseudospectral trajectory optimization framework for generating open-loop stable solution, and for improving the damping of a specific mode identified using the information from Floquet eigenvectors. These applications are illustrated on the dynamic soaring solutions of three- and six-degree-of-freedom aircraft models, and numerical results highlighting the effectiveness of the pseudospectral Floquet computation over the traditional time-march approach are also presented.},

A flight-test database generated in the evaluation of fixed-wing PIO mitigation concepts is first used to assess the utility of the proposed approach. Further independent evaluation and validation using a previously unassessed aircraft configuration and evaluation maneuvers are made using data generated from pilot-in-the-loop simulations of the XV-15 at the University of Liverpool’s HELIFLIGHT simulation facility. The results of the assessments found that the new metric was successful at identifying correctly both PIO and non-PIO cases.},

The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on simulated tracking data from the 88 Planet Labs Flock 3 CubeSats deployed on PSLV-C37. Simulation results indicate that the proposed identity management process can effectively establish identities within 3 days after deployment.},

A variety of approaches have been explored to achieve this in an autonomous fashion, assisting with space traffic management. This work presents new statistical analysis of the Kullback–Leibler divergence justifying the use of its expected value in generating sensor schedules. This divergence’s use as an objective measure is extended to simultaneously consider, in an impartial manner, multiple observations of potentially varying quality and type into a common space, namely the information space, by mapping them to an arbitrary reference time. This time mapping is then shown to exhibit improvements in performance not only with respect to the estimate at the reference time, but over the entire tracking interval.},

The results show the presence of deflection side effects to rotation, introduction of precession, and change in angular velocity magnitude, with the existence of a lever arm between the deflection direction and deflection interface location with respect to the body’s center of mass. At times, these rotational side effects can lead to structural instability that might counteract the deflection or completely disaggregate the object.},

  abstract     = {The orbital siphon is a novel concept for propellantless payload transfer from the surface of a rotating body to orbit. In the context of asteroid mining, the orbital siphon represents an efficient solution to deliver mined material from the asteroid surface to an orbiting station for later processing or storage. The key idea is that the centrifugal-induced force exerted on a tether-connected chain of payload masses assembled from the surface of a rotating body can be large enough to pull the lower masses to initialize an orbital siphon effect: new payloads are connected to the chain while upper payloads are removed. In this paper, the dynamics of an orbital siphon anchored to two irregularly shaped near-Earth asteroids is investigated. The siphon is modeled as a closed chain of tether-connected buckets kept taut by two pulleys: one at the asteroid surface and one attached to an orbiting collecting spacecraft. Buckets are filled with asteroid material to be delivered to the collecting spacecraft. It is shown that the irregularities of the gravitational field do not introduce instabilities to the orbital siphon system for the scenarios presented in this paper. Without any braking mechanism required, the average speed of the siphon does not diverge but reaches a constant value at a steady state. Moreover, it is shown that the siphon effect is still generated when the anchor moves on the asteroid surface, allowing the mining location to be moved without interrupting the flow of material to the collecting spacecraft.},

  abstract     = {In most satellite tracking operations, the gravitational field is truncated at a degree and order based on their average effects on the motion of the satellite. Even though the contribution of the higher-degree/order gravitational harmonics toward the propagation of the satellite states may be negligible as seen in isolation from other forces, their correlation with the nongravitational force coefficients can significantly affect the prediction capabilities in the tracking process. The correlation of the gravitational field with the nongravitational forces of atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure (SRP) renders the estimates of their force coefficients nonphysical. This occurs because the magnitude of instantaneous higher-order gravitational field acceleration can be as large as the nongravitational accelerations up to degree and order 140 at 350 km altitude, even though their net effect is averaged out for long-term motion. A direct consequence of this corrupting effect is a degradation in the accuracy of predicted satellite state. Therefore, an arbitrary degree/order of truncation of the gravitational field model based only on orbit propagation is detrimental to orbit determination. It is imperative to select the degree/order depending on the altitude and factors, such as area-to-mass ratio, that affect the nonconservative forces. In this work, correlations between unmodeled gravitational forces and drag/SRP are studied across varying orbital altitudes through processing of synthetic and real data. It is demonstrated that to obtain an accuracy up to 10 m for a three-day prediction arc, a degree/order 90 gravitational field is needed at 350 km and 50 at 850 km.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new parameterization of the relative motion between two satellites orbiting a central body is presented. The parameterization is based on the nodal elements: a set of angles describing the orbit geometry with respect to the relative line of nodes. These are combined with classical orbital elements to yield a nonsingular relative motion description. The exact nonlinear, perturbed dynamic model resulting from the new parameterization is established. The proposed parameter set captures the fundamental Keplerian invariants, while retaining a simple relationship with local orbital coordinates. An angles-only relative navigation filter and a collision avoidance scheme are devised by exploiting these features. The navigation solution is validated on a case study of an asteroid flyby mission. It is shown that a collision can be detected early on in the estimation process, which allows one to issue a timely evasive maneuver.},

  abstract     = {This study presents major developments in relation to problem dimensionality and formulation generality, endowing the Schwarz-inequality-based approach for finite-horizon minimum effort control with an extended degree of applicability. The extension of the Schwarz inequality method is mainly based on considering the static Lagrange multiplier that combines multiple terminal constraint relations as a vector. The minimum effort cost including a positive definite weighting function is then shown to be closely related to an associated Rayleigh quotient of the Lagrange multiplier vector. Investigation on the Rayleigh quotient form results in a simple expression for the optimal Lagrange multiplier vector, and thereby gives the closed-loop optimal control law in a time-varying state feedback form with a feedforward term. The proposed vector-based formalism provides as a direct consequence a unified means of design that encompasses several existing results developed for low-dimensional problems based on scalar-based formalism and also enables potential new developments in optimal trajectory shaping guidance.},

  abstract     = {Formation reconfiguration with impulsive maneuvers has been continuously addressed in recent decades. The studies mostly focused on in-plane formation reconfiguration since the out-of-plane motion is independently controlled by a single burn. Most in-plane reconfiguration studies, meanwhile, rely on tangential maneuvers because of fuel efficiency and controllability of the orbital energy, compared to radial maneuvers. In this paper, the perspective differs that little influence of the radial maneuvers on the orbital energy is considered as a benefit rather than a drawback. By employing radial burns only, an effect of the thrust errors on the semimajor axis control error can be minimized. Both numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis demonstrate the robustness of the proposed radial impulsive burns compared to the conventional tangential impulsive control schemes.},

The actuator design includes a single thruster, fixed in the body frame, and a variable-speed control moment gyroscope (VSCMG) used for thrust vectoring. It is known that the full attitude cannot be controlled using a single VSCMG, but that a single axis is controllable. This paper develops a nonlinear control that is able to vector the thruster at discrete intervals or continuously. The closed-loop stability of the system is proved using Lyapunov stability theory for each control law. These control laws could enable high maneuverability of CubeSats, using either a single chemical (impulsive) or electric thruster (continuous). The controls are demonstrated, in simulation, with an application to a 12U CubeSat rendezvous using a single throttable electric thruster.},

However, the small satellite form factor introduces significant challenges into the trajectory design process via limited thrusting capabilities, power and operational constraints, and fixed deployment conditions. To address these challenges, a strategy employing dynamical systems theory is used to design a trajectory for a low-thrust-enabled small satellite to reach the SE region. This procedure is demonstrated for a small satellite that launches as a secondary payload with a larger spacecraft that is destined for an SE halo orbit. Low-thrust trajectories, delivering the spacecraft from a deployment condition in the Earth vicinity to an science orbit, are produced for both an 180 kg SmallSat and a 6U CubeSat. These solutions demonstrate the value of a dynamical systems approach to trajectory design, while also supporting the potential for small satellite missions to perform targeted heliophysics-based scientific observations well beyond low Earth orbit.},

This analysis shows that the maneuver sequences are optimal for a range of resizing and phasing scenarios. An analysis is also performed on the passive safety of transfer trajectories that result from incomplete maneuver sequences. It is shown that only phasing scenarios that call for an extreme phase angle change result in potentially unsafe transfer trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Helicopters in tactical missions require superior handling and stability in turbulence. This paper proposes a sliding mode control (SMC)-based helicopter trajectory controller for enhanced handling qualities (HQs) with robustness to endogenous (modeling) and exogenous (turbulence) uncertainties. The flight control problem is posed as one of attitude, angular rate, and translational rate command tracking with closed-loop axial responses conforming to predicted level 1 HQs. The required closed-loop behavior is then enforced by a two-loop output-tracking SMC treating interaxis coupling and turbulence as matched, bounded uncertainties. To mitigate the chattering effect of SMC, a continuous control approximation using the boundary-layer concept is applied. The stability and tracking performance of the two-loop controller are analyzed. Furthermore, actuator saturations encountered during aggressive maneuvers are mitigated by reference command adaptation based on pseudo-control hedging. The proposed controller is evaluated against selected HQ temporal response criteria, two mission task elements requiring moderate to aggressive agility, and a shipboard approach in high-intensity turbulence. Simulation results highlight the controller’s trajectory tracking accuracy, adequate axial decoupling, and insensitivity to disturbances.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this research effort is to assess the impact of load alleviation control on the quantitative handling-qualities specifications (also known as predicted handling qualities) of both conventional helicopters and compound rotorcraft in forward flight. First, an overview on how the harmonic decomposition methodology is used toward load alleviation control is presented. Next, flight control laws are developed based on an explicit model-following architecture. Parametric studies are performed to provide insights on how both the feedforward and feedback paths of the model-following control laws can be used to alleviate the rotor loads. The impact of load alleviation on predicted handling qualities is studied. It is shown that, for the standard helicopter configuration considered, load alleviation comes at the cost of a degradation in handling qualities. However, for the compound rotorcraft considered, allocation of the control signal to the redundant control surfaces provides load alleviation without degradation in predicted handling qualities. The flight control laws are subsequently optimized using the Control Designer’s Unified Interface to meet a comprehensive set of stability, handling-qualities, and performance specifications for specific mission task elements while minimizing the unsteady rotor loads.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new approach on the impact angle control guidance problem for the multistage interceptor with nonmaneuvering phases, called coasting phase, and high acceleration buildup during the boosting phase. First, the required coasting time is determined to reach the target within the given time span considering operation time of the kill vehicle. Then, the required flight path angle profiles and corresponding guidance commands during the boosting phase are derived, in order to achieve the desirable impact angle and to minimize guidance errors at the end of the flight. To do so, the position and velocity changes of each phase are analytically calculated, and then the relationship between the time derivative of the flight path angle during the boosting phase and guidance errors accumulated throughout the flight is established. Some practical error compensation algorithms for the proposed guidance strategy are also presented. The significance of this paper lies in that it is the new analytic approach on how to determine flight path profiles of a multistage interceptor to achieve a terminal impact angle constraint considering both booting and coasting. The proposed guidance strategy is evaluated and proven to be effective through a case study with nonlinear simulations.},

The concept of collision cones in three-dimensional space is used to determine the strategy used by the net-carrying UAVs to maneuver or manipulate the net in space in order to capture the intruders. The manipulation of the net involves guiding the net to pursue the intruders and orienting it in space appropriately so as to maximize the effectiveness of capture. The net manipulation strategy is derived from the concept of collision cones defined in a relative velocity framework, and analytical expressions of nonlinear guidance laws are obtained. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of these guidance laws.},

  abstract     = {Optimal orbit determination requires physics-based process noise matrices to be taken into account when performing covariance propagation. For gravity errors of omission (potential field truncation) and commission (uncertainty of potential field coefficients), a first sequential filter algorithm, capable of making use of gravity error covariance approximations was presented by Wright et al. about a decade ago. The consideration of orbit gravity error covariance estimates has proven advantageous for long-term filter stability. However, characteristic deficiencies can be identified in the Wright et al. algorithm, which limit its performance and robustness. In this Paper, we analyze these shortcomings and their origins and show how they can be remedied. The outcome is an improved orbit gravity error covariance algorithm, which produces estimates that can directly be used with orbit determination algorithms capable of incorporating process noise. Numerical validation results, including techniques for a proper validation of errors of omission, are presented. It is shown that the developed improvements are able to correct the shortcomings of the previous algorithm.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a new data-driven method is demonstrated for real-time neutral density estimation via model–data fusion in quasi-physical ionosphere–thermosphere models. The proposed method has two main components: 1) the use of a quasi-physical reduced-order model (ROM) to represent the dynamics of the upper atmosphere, and 2) the calibration of the ROM coefficients using satellite position measurements. The ROM is developed using dynamic mode decomposition with control. Previous work required direct density measurements (accelerometer-derived densities), and the current work extends this approach to satellite position measurements. This work is a new approach to dynamic calibration of the atmosphere. This work proposes combining the orbit determination process with the ROM coefficient calibration through the use of the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SQUKF). The proposed SQUKF allows for new potential data sources to be incorporated into the density calibration process. This is demonstrated with simulated Global Positioning System position measurements with 5 min resolution and 10 m Cartesian position error. The proposed method is demonstrated to be simple, robust, and accurate through simulation scenarios. The proposed method can provide real-time estimates of the state of the upper atmosphere while having inherent forecasting/predictive capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Suitable orbit options around asteroids are limited due to strong perturbations caused by solar radiation pressure (SRP), a target’s irregular gravity field, and third-body acceleration. One potential option for mission operations is a frozen terminator orbit, a near-circular polar orbit that has been extensively studied for the SRP dominant case. This paper addresses modification of the conventional initial condition for the terminator orbit to account for two distinctive features: an irregular gravity field and offset of the orbit center. When orbit size is small, the asteroid’s higher-order gravity field becomes nonnegligible, and this paper specifically focuses on the effects that and have on new frozen orbit conditions. When the orbit is large, a point mass assumption becomes valid, but strong SRP pushes the spacecraft away from the sun, resulting in a geometric offset between orbit and mass centers. The offset causes large short-period variation of orbital elements, and the resulting orbit is not frozen if initial elements are defined simply as the desired mean elements. This paper proposes an approach to define orbital elements around an offset shifted along the sun–asteroid line. Finally, a unified correction valid for a wide range of semimajor axes is discussed.},

Specifically, both set-point stabilization and tracking control are addressed in this work. It is well known that rigid-body attitude control is subject to topological constraints, which often result in discontinuous control to avoid the unwinding phenomenon. In contrast, the hybrid scheme allows the controlled system to be robust in the presence of uncertainties, which would otherwise cause chattering about the point of discontinuous control while also ensuring acceptable closed-loop response characteristics. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed through a Lyapunov analysis and the use of an invariance principle for hybrid systems. Simulation results for a rigid-body model are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid dual-quaternion feedback control schemes.},

The state and control constraints are handled by a novel relaxation mechanism by introducing relaxation factors, and then a landing guidance and control algorithm is developed by combining NMPC on manifolds. Relaxed constraints are convex and contain the target landing site as an interior point, which significantly improves the practicality and performance of the developed landing algorithm.

Provided that the angular velocity remains constant with time, it is shown that the orientation quaternion belongs to a constant plane of rotation as time evolves. Motivated by this fundamental property, the angular velocity’s direction can be determined by estimating the quaternion plane of rotation. Under the small angle assumption on the attitude measurement noise, the plane of rotation is estimated by minimizing a constrained total least-squares cost function, and the proposed algorithm produces a unique optimizing solution through a batch approach (no need for iterations). The angular velocity magnitude is estimated by projecting the measured quaternions onto the estimated plane of rotation, and then computing the least-squares evolution of the quaternion angle in the plane. A Monte Carlo analysis of the proposed algorithm is performed, validating the method and comparing it with a multiplicative extended Kalman Filter, which is a traditional method in the literature.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical algorithm for computing six-degree-of-freedom free-final-time powered descent guidance trajectories. The trajectory generation problem is formulated using a unit dual quaternion representation of the rigid body dynamics and several standard path constraints. Our formulation also includes a special line-of-sight constraint that is enforced only within a specified band of slant ranges relative to the landing site: a novel feature that is especially relevant to terrain and hazard relative navigation. We use the newly introduced state-triggered constraints to formulate these range constraints in a manner that is amenable to real-time implementations. The resulting nonconvex optimal control problem is solved iteratively as a sequence of convex second-order cone programs that locally approximate the nonconvex problem. Each second-order cone program is solved using a customizable interior point method solver. Also introduced are a scaling method and a new heuristic technique that guide the convergence process toward dynamic feasibility. To demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm, two numerical case studies are presented. The first studies the effect of including a slant-range-triggered line-of-sight constraint on the resulting trajectories. The second study performs a Monte Carlo analysis to assess the algorithm’s robustness to initial conditions and real-time performance.},

The chordal terminal velocity component is selected as the independent variable since it is the final required parameter in Lambert’s problem and it can be directly solved in the minimum-fuel free-time impulsive targeting problem. The transfer time for arbitrary conic transfer is written as a function only of the terminal velocity component. The admissible ranges of the new independent variable are analytically derived for different trajectory types. The 180 deg case and the multiple-revolution case are also considered. The analytical derivative of transfer time is provided to improve computational efficiency in numerical iterations. Compared with the existing Lambert methods, the proposed approach is direct from the viewpoint of problem and physically more intuitive, although it is not superior in numerical performance.},

  abstract     = {An important issue in robust adaptive control is the estimation of realistic ranges for the parametric uncertainty to be used in the projection mechanism with the goal of guaranteeing the boundedness of the adaptive parameters in the presence of modeling uncertainty. To facilitate this design it is common practice to assume conservative parameters’ projection bounds and to use high-gain adaptation for reducing tracking errors. However, this approach may not be suitable in practical applications because it might potentially lead to unpredictable transients and peaking phenomena. Therefore, the determination of tighter uncertainty upper bounds is a fundamental problem toward the design of safe adaptive controllers. This study shows that the problem of estimating the parametric uncertainty domain of a linearly parameterized adaptive controller can be advantageously formulated as a linear interval prediction model identification problem. On this basis a practical data-driven method to compute tight upper bounds for the uncertain parameters is proposed through the solution of a convex constrained optimization problem expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed method has been applied to the design of a longitudinal and a lateral directional model reference adaptive control for a fleet of YF-22 research unmanned aerial vehicles based on real flight data.},

In lieu of extensive Monte Carlo simulations for flight control certification, sum-of-squares programming techniques provide an algebraic approach to the problem of nonlinear control synthesis and analysis. However, reliance on polynomial models has hitherto limited applicability to aeronautical control problems. Taking advantage of recently proposed piecewise polynomial models, this paper revisits sum-of-squares techniques for recovery of an aircraft from deep-stall conditions using a realistic yet tractable aerodynamic model. The local stability analysis of classical controllers is presented as well as synthesis of polynomial feedback laws with the objective of enlarging their nonlinear region of attraction. A newly developed synthesis algorithm for infinite-horizon backward reachability facilitates the design of recovery control laws, ensuring stable recovery by design. The paper’s results motivate future research in aeronautical sum-of-squares applications.},

  abstract     = {High-altitude low-opening airdrop is a technique for aerial delivery that has unique operational advantages. The primary decisions that must be made in execution of these missions are the aircraft release heading, package release point, and altitude at which the package transitions from the drogue to the main ballistic parachute. Algorithms have recently been developed to optimize these variables probabilistically to account for uncertainty in winds, package descent rate, and other factors to maximize an expected score function; although, such work optimized the release variables and transition altitude separately. This paper builds on prior work to develop a method to optimize the release point, release heading, and transition altitude in a single, combined framework to achieve a globally optimal solution. The Koopman operator is used to pull back a mission-specific score function through a family of transformations defining the system dynamics with different transition altitudes. The optimal release point, release heading, and transition altitude are selected from a gridded solution space as that which maximizes the expected score. The results show that the combined optimization approach that includes variable transition altitude produces a higher expected score value as compared to cases in which the release variables are optimized by assuming a fixed transition altitude.},

  abstract     = {Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are becoming promising for on-demand air transportation in urban air mobility (UAM). However, successfully bringing such vehicles and airspace operations to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume. Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level- model in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment. Numerical experiment results over several case studies, including the roundabout test problem, show that the proposed computational guidance algorithm has promising performance even with the high-density air traffic case.},

First, a brief review of TCAS and airborne collision avoidance system development is presented. Pros and cons of the existing system and critical gaps for future air traffic management are discussed. Next, a new method and its associated algorithmic development are proposed for multiple-aircraft collision avoidance. The proposed method is based on a collision risk map formulation in future dense airspace. A priority indexing method is used to reduce the complexity of trajectory optimization for real-time decision support. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to find cost-minimized trajectories for each aircraft to avoid collision. Convergence behavior and computationally efficient features of the method are investigated in detail. Several demonstration examples are illustrated to show the benefits of this method. Finally, comparison with the existing method and several major conclusions are drawn, based on the proposed study.},

It provides motivation to design a finite-frequency controller for Euler’s equation to accommodate the high-frequency parts of the outputs. A hybrid passive/finite gain control scheme fused with the generalized Kalman–Yakubovich–Popov lemma is used to generate a controller that is effective for stabilizing the angular velocities of Euler’s equation.

  abstract     = {Interest in autonomous planetary precision landing missions has been increasing in the scientific and engineering community, and is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As an enabling technology in the context of lunar landing, DLR, German Aerospace Center has been developing a terrain absolute navigation system that matches craters detected in image data to globally available lunar crater maps. The proposed Crater Navigation (CNav) system is adaptive, comprising three different crater matching methods that are specifically tailored to different navigation conditions encountered during the vehicle descent, so that it may be used as a stand-alone navigation sensor that can be closely integrated with a lander guidance, navigation, and control system to enable reliable absolute navigation throughout the entire descent phase of a mission. As robustness is a vital aspect to mission success, the CNav system includes verification mechanisms that ensure high dependability of the resulting navigation solution. This robustness is verified separately for all of the three different matching techniques presented in this paper. Closed-loop performance of the matchers is demonstrated as well, both for simulated image data sets, as for navigation camera images acquired during the Chinese Chang’e-3 landing mission. Successful uninterrupted estimation of the entire Chang’e-3 kinematic vehicle state during the powered descent until a final altitude of 350 m above ground, with neither known camera calibration nor inertial measurement unit data available, showcases the potential of the CNav system.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a real-time implementable successive convexification algorithm for a generalized free-final-time six-degree-of-freedom powered descent guidance problem. Building on our previous research, the following contributions are introduced: 1) a free-ignition-time modification that allows the algorithm to determine the optimal engine ignition time, 2) a tractable formulation of nonlinear aerodynamic lift and drag, and 3) a continuous state-triggered constraint formulation that emulates conditionally enforced constraints. In particular, contribution 3 effectively allows constraints to be enabled or disabled by if statements conditioned on the solution variables of the parent continuous optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a novel formulation in the optimal control literature and enables a number of interesting applications in powered descent guidance, such as velocity-triggered angle-of-attack constraints. Our algorithm converts the resulting generalized powered descent guidance problem from a nonconvex free-final-time optimal control problem into a sequence of convex second-order cone programming subproblems. With the aid of virtual control and trust region modifications, these subproblems are solved iteratively until convergence is attained. Simulations demonstrate the real-time capabilities of the proposed algorithm, with a maximum solver runtime of less than 0.7 s over a multitude of problem feature combinations on a 2.2 GHz Intel processor.},

  abstract     = {In recent years there has been a significant body of literature proposing nonlinear attitude control laws for small-scale multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), motivated by the high maneuverability of these platforms. While tracking trajectories characterized by fast and large attitude changes makes the control problem intrinsically nonlinear, most of the works proposing nonlinear designs is concerned with establishing their stabilizing properties, often deduced by referring to simplified dynamic models, but limited attention has been devoted to performance. As a consequence, less satisfactory results than expected are typically achieved in experiments and the controller gains must be adjusted with trial-and-error procedures to obtain good performance. This paper proposes a model-based tuning method that exploits the cascade structure of the attitude dynamics and that needs only single-axis identified linear models of the angular velocity dynamics to be applied. The tuning of the controller gains is carried out on the linearized closed-loop system with structured synthesis that allows one to enforce robustness against model uncertainty in a systematic way and to achieve a desired level of performance in nominal conditions. The approach is validated by tuning the gains of a novel Proportional/Proportional Integral Derivative (P/PID)-like cascade, which has been developed in the framework of geometric control theory. A thorough analytical comparison of the proposed design with a geometric Proportional Integral (PI)-like controller borrowed from the literature is complemented with experiments conducted on a small quadrotor UAV.},

  abstract     = {A system for cooperative transport of a slung load by a team of autonomous rotorcraft is described. The method described here is hierarchical and centralized, with the payload defined as the leader (here denoted as load-leading control): the payload uses knowledge of its current state and its desired trajectory to determine the net force and moment acting upon its center of gravity required to follow the desired trajectory. Using knowledge of the cable attachment geometry, the required cable forces are computed and transmitted to the rotorcraft. The cable force optimization problem is defined and shown to be nonconvex; constraints that make the problem convex are introduced. Cable forces computed using both the convex and nonconvex formulations are compared. Controllers for both payload and rotorcraft trajectory tracking are designed. Hardware implementation that uses small single-board computers carried onboard the payload and rotorcraft is described. Flight demonstrations conducted in an indoor motion capture studio using preplanned trajectories as well as human-in-the-loop control of the payload are described to show trajectory following and rejection of impulse disturbances. An outdoor flight test showing coordinated transport in the presence of light winds is described. All calculations are hosted on the computers carried on the payload and rotorcraft, and the system is shown to be capable of real-time control and path following both for fixed and in-flight changing formations.},

The use of the Modified Simple Adaptive Controller is investigated for the realization of an adaptive shimmy suppression system. The nonlinear governing equations that model the shimmy vibration behavior of an aircraft nose landing gear are first linearized in order to synthesize the adaptive controller, while nonlinear terms are then taken into account as disturbances. The almost strict passivity of the plant is obtained by using a parallel feedforward compensator. The parallel feedforward compensator is designed as the inverse of a stabilizing controller while the Modified Simple Adaptive Controller is tuned by considering the minimization of some dynamic performance parameters as design requirements. The influence of the advancing speed on the controlled plant response is studied by simulating scenarios of aeronautical interests.},

  abstract     = {Improvements in solar cell weight and performance have enabled the development of small solar-powered aircraft that operate at low altitudes. Unlike high-altitude pseudosatellites, these aircraft must contend with significant stochastic variations in wind and solar energy. This paper examines speed scheduling for aircraft equipped with solar panels, but which do not necessarily supply their entire energy budget from solar power. Soaring speed-to-fly theory is extended to incorporate both solar and updraft energy. When used to optimize shadow crossings for solar aircraft, it allows pure solar flight with 20\% greater cloud coverage. The requirement for pure solar flight is relaxed and the use of stored energy onboard allows derivation of a speed to fly with an arrival time constraint, allowing the exploitation of stochastic energy while satisfying a flight plan. The speed schedule is tested in Monte Carlo simulations, and shows the ability to satisfy an arrival time constraint while reducing energy consumption by approximately 2\% and the variance in final energy state by approximately 3\%. The algorithm is also tested in flight on a small unmanned aerial system, satisfying an arrival time condition within 1\% of the nominal flight time.},

How to predict its locomotion and landing area is challenging when considering the complex dynamical environment and rough terrain. In this study, a new concept of hop reachable domain is proposed to evaluate the surface mobility of a hopping rover treated as a point mass. The two key velocities, i.e., the liftoff velocity and the escape velocity, are derived in detail based on surface dynamical equations, respectively. Numerical simulations are performed with their applications to two representative small bodies, i.e., 101955 Bennu and 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The influence of local terrain on the liftoff event is investigated in a parametric way. The single-hopping reachable domain and natural-evolution reachable domain are obtained and compared by presenting their characteristics. Parametric studies on these two kinds of hop reachable domain are carried out by varying initial position and velocity vectors. The influence of the asteroid self-rotation on the locomotion of a rover is also analyzed with numerical simulations.},

A feedback control law is derived for each maneuvering stage, by exploiting Lyapunov-based and model predictive control techniques. The proposed design is able to account for mission-specific performance and safety requirements, while satisfying on–off constraints inherent to the propulsion technology.

However, leveraging this capability in autonomous platforms requires the ability to plan trajectories comprising impulsive contact. This paper addresses this problem through the development of a collision-inclusive approach to optimal trajectory planning for a three-degree-of-freedom free-flying spacecraft. First, experimental data are used to formulate a physically realistic collision model for the spacecraft. It is shown that this model is linear over the expected operational range, enabling a piecewise affine representation of the full hybrid vehicle dynamics. Next, the dynamics model and vehicle constraints are incorporated into a mixed integer program. Experimental comparisons of trajectories with and without collision-avoidance requirements demonstrate the capability of the collision-inclusive strategy to achieve significant performance improvements in realistic scenarios. A simulated case study illustrates the potential for this approach to find damage-mitigating paths in online implementations.},

  abstract     = {Kalman filtering of states including attitudes poses a challenge due to the constraints of the rotation manifold. One of the standard approaches is to consider a deviation attitude, in the form of a reduced three-vector parametrization, to some nominal reference attitude that the Kalman filter tracks. After an update to the statistics of this deviation, a reset step is performed that adjusts the reference attitude. This reset step adjusts the statistics of the deviation, which has commonly been ignored in the literature. This paper presents an algorithm for the case when the deviation is represented as a rotation vector. The adjustment to the mean and covariance after the reset operation is presented, assessed using Monte Carlo sampling, and compared to other approaches used in the literature. The final result may be easily implemented and is computationally inexpensive. Connections and comparisons to the multiplicative extended Kalman filter, the unscented quaternion estimator, and Lie-group Kalman filters are made, with simulations performed on a rigid-body example.},

The optimal torque input may be singular, and an expression for it is derived. Non-singular torque arcs are shown to be intimately related to the boundary conditions that are imposed on the vehicle’s attitude and the presence of minimum thrust arcs at the beginning and end of the descent. Our results can be thought of as a generalization of previous work on three-degree-of-freedom translational powered descent; with new theoretical insights obtained for powered descent problems that consider attitude in the problem formulation.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel extension to the theory of optimal guidance laws represented by the nontraditional class of performance indices: nonquadratic-type signal norm for the input weighted by an arbitrary positive function. Various missile guidance problems are generally formulated into a scalar terminal control problem based on the understanding of the predictor–corrector nature. Then, a new approach to derive the optimal feedback law, minimizing the nonquadratic performance index, is proposed by using the Hölderian inequality. The proposed extension allows a more general family of formulations for the design of closed-form feedback solutions to various guidance problems to be treated in a unified framework. The equivalence between the proposed approach and other design methodologies is investigated. In general, the type of input norm mainly determines the variability of input during the engagement while trading off against the rate of error convergence. The analytic solution derived in this study is verified by comparison with the solution from numerical optimization, and the effect of the exponent in the performance index on the trajectory and command is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns an aerial three-body multiobjective game (MOG) and deals with finding and sorting the control strategies by a novel solution concept. The MOG is a biobjective game, which involves a navigating aircraft that pursues a maneuverable target, in the presence of a threatening bleeding-energy missile. This biobjective game, which is hereby referred to as the main game, is defined as a payoff vector game, which means that the players are undecided about their objective preferences. Using a coalition between the missile and the target, an auxiliary two-sided nonzero-sum differential game is devised, which provides a closed-loop control law for each of the adversarial sides. Each of these control laws compromises between the two objectives of the main game, according to a selected safety-level parameter. By applying various values of the safety-level, each side is provided with a set of possible control strategies that it should select from. A novel rationalizability solution concept is applied on the sets of all possible control strategies of the players, which yields a set of rationalizable strategies (SRS) for each of the involved sides with respect to the main game. Furthermore, the obtained SRSs are analyzed, using a multicriteria-decision-analysis technique, in order to support the decision processes.},

  abstract     = {A symplectic instantaneous optimal control (IOC) method is presented for compression/deployment of structures driven by sliding cable actuators. First, the motion of these active sliding cables is regarded as system kinematic constraints from the view of multibody dynamics, and a more general structural deployment control system can be established by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Mathematically, the system can be depicted as a constrained nonlinear optimal control problem for DAE systems. Then, based on the Lagrange–d’Alembert principle and the discrete variational principle, a symplectic discretization format can be constructed. The original continuous control problem will be approximated into a series of constrained IOC problems at every time slot, and to satisfy the inequality constraints of input saturation, the linear complementarity problem can finally be derived for solving these IOC problems. The proposed method provides a novel control strategy for addressing more general structure deployment control problems with fewer actuators. Structures can be quickly compressed/deployed to the target configuration, and the residual vibration can be minimized at the same time. The effectiveness and universality of the proposed method are further illustrated by numerical simulations of a telescopic tensegrity manipulator and a deployable tensegrity antenna.},

Different from collinear libration points, the triangular libration points are linearly stable surrounded by long- and short-period orbit families in the planar case. First, their dynamical structure is explored by the Lie series method and an analytical approximation of long-period orbits is proposed. Then, massive escaping trajectories from the parking orbits are generated by a chaotic-assisted method on the finite time Lyapunov exponent map. The trajectories from the asteroid’s natural orbit to the Earth–moon system are constructed by modified Lambert transfers. Next, the fuel consumption for all potential near-Earth asteroids is evaluated ergodically in both perihelion and aphelion cases based on their initial condition, which guides the selection of the target. Finally, it is applied to 20 asteroids, and the minimum fuel consumption appears capturing asteroid 2015DU. Furthermore, a postcapture maneuver strategy based on a Poincaré section is proposed using long-period orbits to adjust the parking orbits and to satisfy the mission requirements.},

To improve the effectiveness of the impact, an impact-geometry map is used that visualizes the kinetic impact effectiveness as a form of impact geometry, which is the inner product of the asteroid velocity vector and the spacecraft velocity vector relative to the asteroid velocity. A locally optimal thrust control law is proposed that maximizes the change rate of the impact geometry, and it achieves a monotonic increment in it. The law is combined with a global optimization method, and a trajectory design system is developed for kinetic impactor missions. Trajectory optimizations are numerically demonstrated for fictional asteroid deflection scenarios. The results show that the proposed system achieves a larger deflection distance despite the reduction in the projectile’s impact velocity relative to the asteroid as compared to a previous method. Besides, as the proposed method focuses not on the spacecraft impact velocity but on the impact geometry, the merit to improve the mobility capability on the impact-geometry map by increasing the available thrust at the expense of increasing the fuel consumption is also indicated.},

  abstract     = {Modern techniques to estimate wind from a flight vehicle often combine onboard sensor measurements with mathematical models of the aircraft’s dynamics. Whereas prior studies have investigated the impact of sensor errors on estimate accuracy, this work presents a method to study the impact of a simplified flight dynamic model. The method begins by establishing a simulated “truth”: a nonlinear fixed-wing longitudinal flight dynamic model is simulated attempting straight-and-level flight in turbulent wind. Common simplifications of the flight dynamic model are derived: linearizing about a trim condition and neglecting the angular contribution of the wind velocity. For each simplification, numerical reconstructions of the wind and unsensed states are derived. Because the wind reconstructions use perfect sensor information, the discrepancy between the reconstructed wind (computed from a simplified dynamic model) and the “true” wind (which perturbs the original nonlinear model) is error incurred solely by modeling simplification. The method is demonstrated via an example study in which both open-loop and closed-loop flight simulations are conducted in a Monte Carlo fashion for a Dryden wind field. In this demonstration, neglecting angular wind is shown to cause three times as much error in wind speed estimates as linearization during closed-loop flight. The method can be extended to other aircraft and variables of interest. It is presented as a procedure that practitioners can follow to investigate the impact of flight dynamic modeling accuracy for airborne wind measurement.},

  abstract     = {Flutter is an unstable oscillation caused by the interaction of aerodynamics and structural dynamics. It is current practice to operate aircraft well below their open-loop flutter speed in a stable flight regime. For future aircraft, weight reduction and aerodynamically efficient high-aspect-ratio wing design will reduce structural stiffness, and thus reduce flutter speed. Active control of the flutter phenomena can counter adverse aeroservoelastic effects and allow operation of an aircraft beyond its open-loop flutter speed. This paper presents a systematic robust control design method for active flutter suppression. It extends the standard four-block mixed sensitivity formulation by a means that targets specific dynamic modes and adds damping. This enables a control design to augment the damping of critical flutter modes with minimal impact on the rigid-body autopilots. Finally, the design scheme uses a manageably low number of tunable parameters with a clear physical interpretation. Tuning the controller is hence considerably easier than with standard approaches. The method is demonstrated by designing an active flutter suppression controller for a small, flexible unmanned aircraft; and it is verified in simulation.},

  abstract     = {Proper exploitation of derived angle of attack (AOA) and sideslip angle from low-cost attitude heading reference system sensors found in general aviation aircraft is a candidate solution for improving flight safety. This approach uses equations for AOA and sideslip angle that are solved on board in real-time, using state data and information provided by sensors. These equations are a function of vehicle parameters and stability and control derivatives, in addition to the angular displacement and angular rate sensor outputs. This paper characterizes and evaluates the feasibility of derived AOA and sideslip angle for part 23 use cases of pilot displays, envelope protection, and fly-by-wire flight control systems. Standard AOA and sideslip angle equations and sensor models are implemented in a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom simulation model of the Cessna 172. Piloted simulation inputs are used in a non-real-time Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the effect of modeling uncertainties and sensor noise on derived AOA and sideslip angle. Results presented in the paper show the allowable bounds on aircraft model parametric uncertainties such as stability and control derivatives, in addition to sensor noise levels, that produce usable derived AOA and sideslip angle values.},

  abstract     = {A data-driven impact-time-control guidance (DD-ITCG) method based on proportional navigation guidance (PNG) is presented in this study, in which the assumption of constant velocity adopted in previous reports is not necessary, and it is applicable to cases with significant velocity changes. The motivation of the presented DD-ITCG is that, for a given flight state vector (FSV, including position and velocity) and a given target position, the PNG trajectory from this FSV to this target as well as the corresponding PNG time-to-go (TGO) are determined. Based on this fact, a database including input FSV and output of PNG TGO is built. At a time instant in DD-ITCG, there are two TGO quantities, one is PNG TGO of PNG trajectory, and the other one is the required TGO. Hence there is a TGO error between PNG TGO and required TGO. Then a TGO error rate with opposite sign of TGO error is set to decrease the TGO error to zero. The relation between the TGO error rate and the DD-ITCG commands is analyzed, based on which the DD-ITCG commands are computed by virtue of the database. Case studies of a hypersonic flight vehicle impact time control show the performances of the presented DD-ITCG method, and some observations in these case studies are discussed.},

Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm, named the high-order differential algebra Kalman filter, provides superior robustness and/or mean-square error performance as compared to linear estimators under the condition considered.},

  abstract     = {Short-range halo phasing orbits, which are a type of phasing orbit remaining around the halo orbit, are investigated in the Earth–moon system. The influence of the start and end points on the halo phasing problem is investigated by numerical computation. Under the limitation of the thrust engine, an optimization problem for two-impulse phasing orbits is proposed to achieve the maximum phase change. Numerical computations show that, for the given maximum possible impulsive burn, there exist four types of locally optimal preceding phasing orbits and four types of locally optimal receding phasing orbits. The results of the eight types of optimal phasing orbits are discussed in detail. The “leapfrogging” strategy, composed of several two-impulse phasing arcs, is proposed for phasing missions requiring a large phase difference. Furthermore, halo phasing orbits with continuous thrusts are constructed and investigated. By first using the backstepping method to transform impulsive maneuvers into continuous thrusts and then using the backstepping results as initial guesses, optimal continuous phasing orbits are further constructed.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a practical and efficient analytical framework for the precise modeling of the relative motion in low Earth orbits. Developed to support the design and verification of relative guidance navigation and control algorithms devoted to spacecraft rendezvous for active debris removal applications, only the orbital perturbation due to nonspherically symmetric mass distribution is considered. The relative motion is modeled in mean relative orbital elements, revisiting the available formulations to include the first-order expansion of the effects due to any even zonal harmonics and the second-order expansion of the unperturbed and terms. Mean/osculating orbital element conversions are obtained by merging a second-order Hamiltonian approach applied to the problem with the Kaula linear perturbation method for the remaining terms of the geopotential. The paper describes the main building blocks of the framework as well as their interfaces because the key aspect to achieve precision is to set up a fully consistent environment. The results show the achievable accuracy under realistic operational conditions for possible guidance and navigation applications.},

  abstract     = {A two-stage batch estimation algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear, static parameter estimation problems that appear in aerospace engineering applications is proposed. It is shown how these problems can be recast into a form suitable for the proposed two-stage estimation process. In the first stage, linear least squares is used to obtain a subset of the unknown parameters (set 1) and a residual sampling procedure is used for selecting initial values for the rest of the parameters (set 2). In the second stage, depending on the uniqueness of the local minimum, either only the parameters in the second set need to be re-estimated, or all the parameters will have to be re-estimated simultaneously, by a nonlinear constrained optimization. The estimates from the first stage are used as initial conditions for the second-stage optimizer. It is shown that this approach alleviates the sensitivity to initial conditions and minimizes the likelihood of converging to an incorrect local minimum of the nonlinear cost function. An error bound analysis is presented to show that the first stage can be solved in such a way that the total cost function will be driven to the optimal cost, and the difference has an upper bound. Two tutorial examples are used to show how to implement this estimator and compare its performance to other similar nonlinear estimators. Finally, the estimator is used on a 5-hole Pitot tube calibration problem using flight test data collected from a small unmanned aerial vehicle that cannot be easily solved with single-stage methods.},

Methods of weight selection to ensure strong convexity of the cost, which makes the quadratic programming problem associated with MPC numerically more tractable, are discussed. A continuous-time flexible-blade helicopter dynamic model is discretized, and the resulting model is used to demonstrate this control design method in ship landing and touchdown maneuvers. Inequality constraints, ship-induced turbulence, and parametric uncertainty are gradually included in the design and analysis. Several case studies are used to illustrate the effectiveness of this control method in landings on ships that experience quiescent and nonquiescent motions.},

Wind-velocity measurements are used in the attitude and position control through the use of principled models that estimate the aerodynamic forces and moments. The aerodynamic moment is caused primarily by propeller blade flapping, whereas the aerodynamic force includes the induced drag from the rotors and drag over the body. A feedback-linearization controller prescribes inputs based on the aerodynamic models and quadrotor kinematics, which are developed on the special Euclidean group. The controller also addresses the thrust saturation using a variable-gain algorithm. Simulated and experimental results highlight the benefits of flow feedback and the variable-gain algorithm for the inner- and outer-loop control of attitude and position, respectively.},

More specifically, attitude-constrained zones are properly encoded, and an admissible artificial potential function (APF) is developed under the unit-quaternion representation. The elaborately designed APF ensures a unique minimum without requiring convexity of constrained zones, which yields a less stringent condition from previous approaches. Benefiting from the bounded property of the gradient of the proposed APF, a saturated controller is presented to render the almost uniformly ultimate boundedness of maneuver errors while complying with underlying maneuver constraints. The associated stability analysis of the closed-loop system is ensured by using the primal Lyapunov and the dual Lyapunov techniques. Numerical simulation tests are presented to assess the efficiency and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control scheme.},

The mathematical formulation of optimally tasking a group of sensors using the mutual information as a sensor utility measure is discussed along with the relative merits of maximizing mutual information. The resulting sensor-tasking optimization problem is shown to be combinatorial in nature, for which the computational complexity increases with an increase in the number of objects as well as the number of sensors. Depending upon the number of objects and available sensors, appropriate suboptimal approximations are presented to alleviate the computational complexity of the tasking problem. The submodular property of the mutual information measure is used to provide guarantees on the optimality of different approximations. Numerical simulations involving tracking ground objects with moving unmanned aerial vehicles and tracking resident space objects with ground-based sensors are considered to show the efficacy of the developed methods.},

However, there is no existing design methodology of DSRP-based controllers for lunar satellite formation keeping. Lunar orbits are different from low Earth orbits, because the third-body effects are dominant. This paper develops a DSRP-based formation keeping controller, using mean orbital element feedback, for regulating relative distances between satellites in lunar orbits. It is shown that the most effective way to mitigate the intersatellite drift is to adjust the semimajor axes. This is achieved by modifying the cross-sectional areas of the satellites. The stability of the closed-loop system is proven based on the finite time stability theory. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the new DSRP-based controller is able to arrest the relative distance drift in lunar orbits for several years.},

For robust trajectory design, a new discrete-time linear dynamics model describing the relative equations of motion for powered flight in perturbed elliptical orbits is developed. The linear dynamics model is used to formulate a stochastic trajectory optimization problem that takes into account navigation sensor errors, maneuver execution errors, and trajectory and control dispersion. The objective of the stochastic optimization problem is to minimize the sum of the expected maneuver and the maneuver dispersion subject to a constraint on the final state dispersion. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the stochastic trajectory optimization problem, and a series of examples demonstrate that the stochastic maneuver solution can be significantly better than the solution corresponding deterministic trajectory optimization problem.

This paper presents a strategy to reduce dramatically the hyperbolic excess speed at Saturn by means of deep-space electric propulsion. The interplanetary trajectory includes a gravity assist at Jupiter, combined with low-thrust maneuvers. The thrust arc from Earth to Jupiter lowers the launch energy requirement, whereas an ad hoc steering law applied after the Jupiter flyby reduces the hyperbolic excess speed upon arrival at Saturn. This lowers the orbit insertion impulse to the point where capture is possible even with a gravity assist with Titan. The control-law algorithm, the benefits to the mass budget, and the main technological aspects are presented and discussed. The simple steering law is compared with a trajectory optimizer to evaluate the quality of the results and possibilities for improvement.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the short-arc orbit uncertainty propagation by combining the admissible region with a new arbitrary polynomial chaos (APC) method. With short-arc optical observations, the admissible region in the range and range rate plane can be identified from various physical constraints. The initial uncertainty of the space object can be depicted by samples of the admissible region. The challenge is that such an initial uncertainty distribution is hard to characterize analytically. Hence, the parametric representation, such as the conventional polynomial chaos based on a priori assumption of the distribution, cannot be directly used. The proposed APC does not need complete knowledge or even existence of the probability density function of the uncertainty. It requires only a finite number of moments, which are used to construct the orthogonal polynomial basis functions of APC and generate the stochastic collocation points/weights to determine the APC coefficients. The moments can be easily calculated using sampling data in the admissible region. Furthermore, the multielement APC is used to improve the accuracy and computation efficiency of APC for the long-term propagation. The APC is especially efficient when it is applied in the two-dimensional admissible region because it does not need to propagate a large number of collocation points.},

This research project aims to increase pilot awareness of this protection system through the use of force feedback on the control device, that is, haptics. This paper describes in detail how the haptic feedback works and when it triggers; another paper will discuss the results of an experimental evaluation. With the current haptic design, pilots can get five cues: first, a discrete force cue when approaching the limits; second, an increased spring coefficient for control deflections that bring the aircraft closer to its limits; third, a stick shaker for low velocities; fourth, if a low-velocity condition requires an input, the stick is moved forward to the desired control input; and finally, the stick follows the automatic Airbus “pitch-up” command during an overspeed condition. This novel system is expected to help pilots correctly assess the situation and decide upon the right control action. It will be evaluated in two scenarios close to the flight envelope limits: a windshear and an icing event.},

A significant improvement in performance with active control of command surfaces has been found for an energy-harvesting mode when compared to autostabilization or fixed-stick flight. Moreover, a detailed decomposition of the stochastic wind profile generated from the Kaimal spectrum has shown which frequencies and magnitudes of wind time series have the highest contribution to the energy-transfer process. It is found that wind profiles with higher turbulence intensity potentially provide more energy for transfer to the aircraft. Furthermore, the Paper reveals a biologically inspired sensory system for wind field estimation. It describes the necessary equipment and control algorithms for the exploitation of atmospheric energy. Initial flight tests were performed to determine the average power consumption of the motor for altitude hold tasks and to evaluate the performance of sensors. Moreover, additional flights for autonomous exploitation of several atmospheric phenomena are presented and analyzed.},

An approach to combining the static and dynamic elements is provided that ensures closed-loop stability, yet with the structure of the static compensator preserved. The work is motivated by the need to stabilize quadcopters subject to large disturbances, and excerpts from an extensive simulation campaign are reported. The simulations clearly indicate that the combination of dynamic and static anti-windup compensation provides stability for significantly larger disturbances than either static or dynamic anti-windup compensation alone.},

The aircraft models used in the control design are obtained using a combination of balanced and modal reduction techniques from a high-fidelity nonlinear aeroservoelastic model, and include information about actuator and sensor dynamics as well as the phase loss introduced by the flight control computer. The controller is synthesized by posing and solving a weighted -norm optimization problem with the goal to provide damping for the flutter modes and extend the flight envelope above the open-loop flutter speed. The paper concludes with a thorough analysis and verification of the performance achieved by the closed-loop system, including simulations with the high-fidelity nonlinear model of the actual maneuvers that will be performed by the unmanned demonstrator during future flight tests.},

In its complete form, this process is formulated as a nonlinear constrained stochastic optimal control problem. This problem is among the most complex in control theory, and no practically applicable method to low-thrust trajectory optimization problems has been proposed to date. This paper presents a new algorithm to solve stochastic optimal control problems with nonlinear systems and constraints. The proposed algorithm uses the unscented transform to convert a stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic problem, which is then solved by trajectory optimization methods such as differential dynamic programming. Two numerical examples, one of which applies the proposed method to low-thrust trajectory design, illustrate that it automatically introduces margins that improve robustness. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the robustness and optimality of the solution.},

SCP is a useful tool in obtaining real-time solutions to direct optimal control, but it is unable to adequately model nonlinear dynamics due to the linearization and discretization required. As nonlinear program solvers are not yet functioning in real-time, a tool is needed to bridge the gap between satisfying the nonlinear dynamics and completing execution fast enough to be useful. Two methods are proposed, SCP with nonlinear dynamics correction (SCPn) and modified SCPn (M-SCPn), which mixes SCP and SCPn to reduce runtime and improve algorithmic robustness. Both methods are proven to generate optimal state and control trajectories that satisfy the nonlinear dynamics. Simulations are presented to validate the efficacy of the methods as compared with SCP.},

  abstract     = {Soaring strategies are redefining the flight capabilities of small-class fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper presents an autonomous soaring strategy that exploits updraft energy independent of the classification of an updraft. The strategy employs an artificial lumbered flight algorithm (ALFA) that weighs near-field updraft velocity estimates and mission priorities in real time for navigation through a wind field. This work addresses the question of ALFA’s ability to handle classified and unclassified updrafts. Instead of explicitly considering the classification of the updraft, the ALFA measures updraft data along an aircraft’s flight path, estimates updraft data ahead of the aircraft, generates candidate flight paths ahead of the aircraft for evaluation, and then selects the best candidate flight path based on a reward function. This paper describes the structure of ALFA and the tuning processes used for the updraft estimator and the reward function. Flight results demonstrate the ALFA’s ability to harvest atmospheric energy from classified and unclassified updrafts. The results discuss several produced flight behaviors in more detail, examining the ALFA’s effectiveness when flying among classified updrafts. Finally, this paper concludes that harvesting energy from the atmosphere with real-time local decision making is practically feasible and suggests that autonomous flight design and control strategies for small-class fixed-wing aircraft will likely be driven by harvesting energy from the atmosphere.},

The control synthesis uses the evolution of the slow states, slow actuators, fast states and fast actuators in a total of four different timescales. Multiplicative and additive uncertainties in the evolution of the slow and the fast states are accounted for, as well as multiplicative uncertainties in the slow and fast actuator dynamics. The controller is designed with insights from geometric singular perturbation theory, and it is supported by update laws selected via a composite Lyapunov analysis. The boundedness of the tracking errors, manifold errors and parameter estimation errors is proven; and the magnitudes of the tracking errors, parameter estimation errors, and control signals can be modulated by appropriate choices of gains. The results presented in the paper using a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom simulation show improved velocity control for the multiple-timescale nonlinear controller as compared to a cascaded nonlinear dynamic inversion controller.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents power-optimal guidance for a planar space solar power satellite (SSPS). Power-optimal guidance is the attitude trajectory that maximizes the solar power transmitted by the SSPS. Planarity is important because it couples the orientations of the SSPS’s photovoltaic and antenna surfaces. Hence, the transmitted power depends on the relative geometry between the SSPS, the sun, and the receiving station. The orientation that maximizes power transfer changes as this relative geometry changes. Both single- and dual-sided SSPS architectures are considered. A single-sided SSPS has one photovoltaic surface and one antenna surface. A dual-sided SSPS is a single-sided SSPS with at least one additional photovoltaic or antenna surface. Geometric arguments show that a dual-sided SSPS has superior performance to a single-sided SSPS. Power-optimal guidance is then presented for the special cases of SSPSs in geostationary Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, and low Earth orbit transmitting to an equatorial receiving station at the time of Earth’s vernal equinox. These examples emphasize important solution properties, including the need for large slew maneuvers, and they show that, even though system efficiency decreases as orbit altitude decreases, reduced path losses actually increase the amount of received energy per unit aperture area. This has significant system implications for future space solar power missions.},

Conventional impulsive or continuous-thrust control approaches require high demand for the engine and have limited applicability in practice. In this study, a new hovering formation controlled by two-stage constant thrust is proposed. The mathematical model of the two-stage constant-thrust control problem is first formulated, and a rapid method using sensitivity matrix is presented to solve the problem. Then, based on relative orbital elements, the strategy of hovering formation by two-stage constant control in the two-body case is obtained. To avoid the drift of hovering formation caused by perturbation, an improved strategy is presented to guarantee periodic revisits to the specified relative position. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

To assess the achievable accuracy of an estimate, the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the specific filtering problem is evaluated. An analysis highlights how the most common flight patterns harm observability. Monte Carlo simulation results for a fixed-wing aircraft encountering several thermals showcase the unique ability of the proposed updraft estimator to localize multiple thermals rapidly. The mapping of a transient thermal cell is assessed with respect to an observability measure derived from the estimated Fisher information. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by evaluating real flight data of a glider aircraft circling thermal updrafts.},

Specifically, the proposed approach allows the trajectories of an uncertain dynamical system to follow the trajectories of the expanded reference model. As compared to a well-known approach, it is shown that the expanded reference model trajectories remain predictably close to the trajectories of a given ideal reference model, which captures a desired closed-loop system performance. Furthermore, a command governor method is also developed along with the proposed expanded reference model to achieve asymptotic convergence of the expanded reference model trajectories to those of the ideal reference model such that the desired closed-loop system performance can be captured. To provide additional robustness for possible uncertainties in the actuator bandwidths, an estimation of the actuator bandwidth is incorporated into the proposed architecture. The stability of the current approach is analyzed using linear matrix inequalities and the Lyapunov theory, where a numerical example is also presented to illustrate the efficacy of the current contributions.},

A modified throttling control strategy is proposed to control the attitude of electric sails by modulating individual tether voltage synchronously with the spinning motion of the sails. The effects of four critical physical parameters (tether numbers, tether length, sail spin rate, and mass of remote units) are investigated. The results show that the effect of the relative velocity of the solar wind has a significant effect on the spin rate of the sail in attitude maneuvering, which in turn affects the attitude dynamics and orbit motion of the sail. Numerical results show that the proposed control strategy work successfully stabilizes the spin rate of sail when the new type sail is adopted.},

Keeping a certain orientation of large space debris with respect to the oncoming ion stream in the process of its removal from the orbit can significantly reduce the time for this transport operation. The aim of the work is to develop a control law that stabilizes the space debris in a certain position. A cylindrical spent rocket stage is considered as the space debris. The planar motion of a mechanical system consisting of the active spacecraft and the space debris is considered. The two ways to control the ion flux are considered and compared with each other: by changing the thrust of the ion engine and by turning the ion flow direction. Lyapunov’s theorems on stability and asymptotic stability in the first approximation and Bellman method are used to build the control laws. The results of numerical simulation prove that controlling the ion flow direction is a more efficient way of stabilizing attitude motion in terms of minimizing the time spent.},

  abstract     = {A general methodology for the dynamics of spacecraft with rigid–liquid–flexible body coupling is established by using Kane’s equations, whereby the combined sloshing in multiple tanks and the dynamic stiffening of flexible solar panels are both accommodated. First, the kinematic evolution equation of attitude motion is expressed in terms of quaternions. Second, the liquid sloshing dynamics in the tanks are made by including the constraint-surface model. Third, the stiffening effect of the flexible solar panels is incorporated into the dynamics formulation by adopting the hypothesis of geometrically nonlinear deformation rather than that of Kirchhoff–Love plate. Kane’s method is chosen for its efficiency in deriving the coupled dynamics model of a spacecraft undergoing large overall motion. Simulation examples are given to validate the reliability of this dynamics model in predicting the total slosh force and the total slosh torque under complicated excitations, to manifest the superiority of the methodology based on the geometrically nonlinear deformation over the conventional theory based on the assumption of the Kirchhoff–Love plate, and to analyze the rigid–liquid–flexible coupling effects of the spacecraft during the in-orbit three-axis stabilized maneuver. It is found that there is a violent disturbance to the attitude motion in the form of beat vibration due to the nonlinear coupling effects among the large-amplitude sloshing in multiple tanks, the vibration of geometrically nonlinear deformation of flexible solar panels, and the control system.},

  abstract     = {An iterated recursive filter is formulated for radar trilateration of reentry maneuvers. Using range and range rate measurements from three radars in a regional network, trilateration provides very accurate three-dimensional position and velocity measurements, which improves drag and lift acceleration estimates. A new first-order, nonlinear vector differential equation specifies the rate of change of acceleration (or jerk). Acceleration process noise is determined from dynamic pressure estimates and mean-square area-to-mass covariances, which are derived from probability density functions that statistically characterize a family of expected maneuvers. Trilateration accuracies are demonstrated for demanding reentry maneuvers. Monte Carlo simulations assess accuracy sensitivity to modeling assumptions and to off-nominal reentry trajectories.},

Standard approaches to these filtering problems require explicit specification of the measurement generation process in order to reliably produce updated state estimates. However, nonstandard measurement types, such as those provided by terrain cameras, contain measurement errors that cannot be formally accounted for in the standard approaches, such as missed detections, misidentification of features, and spurious returns. This Paper derives a new measurement likelihood and corresponding update that formally account for these nonstandard error sources, and Monte Carlo analysis indicates that the new update produces a significantly more reliable estimator in the presence of inevitable flaws in the collected data.},

  abstract     = {The notion and the theory of constructing planetary powered descent guidance laws based on fractional polynomials are introduced. Along the way a new perspective to the classical Apollo powered descent guidance designs is gained. As a foundation of this work, a theory is first developed on how to derive an explicit powered descent guidance law by selecting the feedback gains in a unique way in an implicit tracking guidance law. Then by employing a particular profile of the reference thrust acceleration in the tracking law with a special set of gains, a large family of powered descent guidance laws is obtained that offer the flexibility in trajectory shaping and thrust characteristics by two adjustable parameters. An equivalence theory is established to show that each in this family of guidance laws is actually the explicit guidance law from a fractional-polynomial thrust acceleration profile. This insight provides a perfect explanation to the predictable behavior and good targeting performance of these guidance laws. The well-known Apollo lunar descent guidance and E-guidance laws are revealed to be two members of this much broader class of fractional-polynomial powered descent guidance laws.},

  abstract     = {This paper tackles the problem of optimal attitude control using a minimal number of attitude thrusters. Three possible control solutions to this problem are presented: 1) a logic-based controller that is simple to implement, 2) a projective control that aims to optimally replicate an ideal continuous control as closely as possible, and 3) an optimal neural predictive control (NPC) that minimizes the total impulse during a maneuver. The NPC is based on a recurrent neural network using a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous configuration for state propagation in a finite-time horizon optimization. Typically, for continuous systems, a back-propagation algorithm for the receding horizon optimization is used, but this is not applicable to systems with discrete inputs. In this paper the NPC is adapted to boolean input systems by employing a robust genetic algorithm to undertake the receding horizon optimization. An automatic selection of the parameters of the cost function is proposed, which improves the performance of the NPC and reduces the tuning to only one parameter. In addition, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained offline with the optimal control data obtained, thus replacing the CPU-intensive cost function with a significantly less computationally expensive metamodel. The NPC performance is compared with the proposed logic-based and projective control algorithms in simulation of a 12U CubeSat and is shown to be the most efficient in terms of total impulse requirement at equal settling time and the least sensitive to the choice of parameters. The MLP control drastically reduces the online computational cost with performance approaching those of the NPC.},

The confounding effects of feedback and mixing are resolved by interpolation of the frequency responses. The analysis can be run in batch for postflight analysis, or in real time as the aircraft is flying. The effectiveness of the method was verified using simulations of the subscale T-2 generic transport airplane with rate feedback.

However, these vehicles are very difficult to control, because their aerodynamics are hard to model and they are susceptible to wind gusts. This often leads to composite and complex controllers, with different modes for hover, transition, and forward flight. This paper proposes incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion control for the attitude and position control. The result is a single, continuous controller that is able to track the desired acceleration of the vehicle across the flight envelope. The proposed controller is implemented on the Cyclone hybrid unmanned air vehicle. Multiple outdoor experiments are performed, showing that unmodeled forces and moments are effectively compensated by the incremental control structure. Finally, this paper provides a comprehensive procedure for the implementation of the controller on other types of hybrid unmanned air vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The object population in the space around the Earth is subject to increase. With the advancements in sensor capabilities, it can be expected that, at the same time, more of those objects will be detected. Although this allows for significant advances in understanding of the detectable objects and the expansion of object catalogs, it also leads to significant stress on the sensor systems and makes efficient sensor tasking a prime challenge. To solve sensor tasking as an optimization problem of observing objects when a priori information is available, various methods exist. Classical methods rely on the problem being formulated in a convex representation. Computationally intensive methods based on artificial intelligence, such as machine learning, have recently gained a lot of attention and are suitable for problems even when no convex formulation can be found. In this paper, performances of a simple traditional greedy algorithm and the more complex Weapon-Target Assignment algorithm are compared with the performance of two machine learning algorithms: ant colony and distributed Q-learning. Ant colony optimization is a swarm optimization path finding methodology based on probabilistic principles; distributed Q-learning aims to find an optimal policy by maximizing the expected reward received. As an application case the observation of known objects in the geosynchronous region with a ground-based sensor is used, and performance is evaluated in terms of the number of objects successfully tracked, the computational efficiency of running the algorithms, and the difficulty of tuning the algorithms. The ant colony solutions track the most objects, whereas the greedy algorithm is the most efficient; additionally, the ant colony and distributed Q-learning require significant tuning of the algorithms before employment.},

This new approach enables a quantitative analysis on the observability of an individual state variable and unknown parameters of a nonlinear dynamics even when the system is not observable in the traditional sense. The paper develops theoretical properties of partial observability and its computational algorithms. These results are applied and validated on a nonstandard estimation problem of detecting the internal cooperating strategy of a particular adversarial swarm model. Partial observability analysis on the parameters that define the cooperating strategy reveals interesting findings. For example, some parameters are observable even when the swarm is at a steady state that is not observable in traditional sense. It is also shown that observability of the internal cooperating strategy depends on both the swarm trajectory and the time window of the measurement. Motivated by these findings, a variational method of estimation based on the dynamic optimization of a cost function is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed estimation method outperforms Kalman filters. The results in this paper provide useful tools for applications involving adversarial swarms, including defense against swarm attacks and herding of biological swarms.},

  abstract     = {When modeling the gravitational fields around small bodies, the highly irregular shapes of such objects make it difficult to balance accuracy with efficiency. In this paper, a novel and general hybrid model for evaluating the gravity of a small body is proposed with the aim of reducing errors and the computational cost. The hybrid model separates dominant effects and smaller undulations. The dominant effects are represented by the gravity-best-fit ellipsoid, which is generated by solving an optimization problem in the sense of minimizing the contribution of undulations. The undulations are then approximated using the serendipity interpolation technique, which is computationally efficient. Furthermore, a discretization scheme for the region of interest is developed, and this guarantees the evaluation of gravity in the close proximity of a small body. Based on this discretization strategy, a rapid element tracking scheme is developed to improve the efficiency of trajectory propagations. The most remarkable advantage of this tracking strategy is that the runtime for identifying elements remains the same when the region of interest is arbitrarily broadened. Simulations on asteroids and 1620 Geographos show that the hybrid model is highly accurate and around 196 times faster than the conventional polyhedral model.},

First, a new input/output mapping of Hamiltonian representation is constructed, in which feedforward control input and a finite number of adjustable parameters are defined as the input to the system. Then, a modified variational symmetry for the present Hamiltonian system is derived by introducing two operators. Thanks to the modified variational symmetry, the present learning algorithm simultaneously calculates the gradient of a given cost function with respect to an arbitrary number of feedforward inputs and parameters included in the Hamiltonian with at most two gradient experiments without using the plant system model. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to trajectory tracking control of a spacecraft near an asteroid. Here, the feedback gains of a local proportional derivative feedback controller to stabilize the system and feedforward control input to improve tracking performance are simultaneously optimized by learning. The present numerical simulations verify that the cost function decreases to a local minimum, the maximum tracking error significantly decreases, and the obtained optimal feedforward input behaves closely to the analytically calculated input for perfect tracking.},

The loop has a torus shape and a hollow cross-section. It is made of an aluminum substrate coated with a low work function material to stimulate electron emission through thermionic and photoelectric effects. The work presents an electrodynamic model for the experiment and studies the current and voltage profiles developed in the anodic and cathodic segments of the LWT due to the motional electric field. Two modes of operation, with and without switches in the loop to interrupt the electric current, are considered. It is shown that the loop is deorbited by the Lorentz force exerted by the ambient magnetic field on the electric current. An analysis of the attitude dynamics in the presence of the gravity gradient and the Lorentz torques reveals that, for a circular equatorial orbit, the position of the loop with its symmetry axis normal to the orbital plane can be spin-stabilized easily. The required instruments and the scientific information that would be provided by the experiment are discussed.},

In contrast to the historical treatment of SRP as a disturbance at the weak gravity environment, the present paper finds active control of spacecraft attitude promising for orbit control. An optimal control law is developed for the SRP-based orbit control, where a complex reflection model is considered to make the control law applicable to realistic surface reflection models. The optimal control law is demonstrated with numerical simulations on an asteroid landing scenario, which is inspired by the Area-of-Effect Softbots (AoES) concept for small-body exploration supported by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concept (NIAC) program. The simulation results show the robustness of the control algorithms against possible disturbances, including the solar gravity, the small body’s irregular gravity field, and stochastic acceleration that can represent uncertainties in the dynamics modeling.},

  abstract     = {A new collision-avoidance procedure for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of static and moving obstacles is presented. The proposed procedure is based on a new form of local parameterized guidance vector fields, called collision-avoidance vector fields, which produce smooth and intuitive maneuvers around obstacles. These vector fields are generated from a decomposition of UAV kinematics and a proximity-based velocity modulation. The proposed kinematic decomposition encodes both collision avoidance and constant-speed motion for the UAV. As such, the resulting maneuvers follow nominal collision-free paths, which are referred to as streamlines of the collision-avoidance vector fields, with constant speed. Next, in accordance with the computed guidance vector fields, different collision-avoidance controllers that generate collision-free maneuvers are developed. Furthermore, it is shown that any tracking controller with convergence guarantees can be used with the avoidance controllers to track the streamlines of the collision-avoidance vector fields. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and its ability to avoid collisions with static and moving pop-up threats in different practical scenarios.},

Every seasoned flight-test professional is capable of identifying test pilots that are considered to be either high-gain or low-gain pilots. It is considered a given in the testing world that high-gain pilots are better at exposing shortcomings in aircraft handling qualities, including the potential for explosive pilot-induced oscillation. By inference, low-gain pilots are often judged to be just the opposite. Despite this interpretation, the concept of pilot gain is itself not well understood. How do we define, quantify, and (perhaps most importantly) modify pilot gain? Using recent research data, pilot gain can be identified as an element in the pilot–vehicle closed-loop system. It is demonstrated that pilot gain, in closed-loop control, is a misnomer and that more proper terms might be pilot–vehicle bandwidth or crossover frequency.},

By application of a Lie group variational integrator, a compact and singularity-free geometric model that maintains its accuracy even for extremely long-time simulations with aggressive maneuvers is developed. Coupling the integrator to a nonvariational model of the towing airplane is also discussed. By employing a variation-based linearization technique, a geometric linear system that is used to investigate the mode shapes and the coupling between the motion of the cable and the attitude dynamics of the towed body is obtained. A distributed parameter model is developed separately that describes the equilibrium configurations of the circularly towed system, the results from which are used to evaluate those of the geometric numerical integrator. For the case of towing a bisymmetric finned body, it is observed that reducing the flight path radius leads to a limit cycle, due to the interactions between the rolling motion of the body and the pendulum mode of the cable.},

This positioning system relies on the unscented Kalman filter and several open source pulsar timing software libraries to estimate the observatory position in an Earth-fixed coordinate system. Monte Carlo analysis was used to numerically verify the filter implementation. Pulsar time-of-arrival data obtained from L-band measurements were used for the experimental verification. The result of this research indicates that a root-sum-square positioning accuracy of can be achieved after processing 3.5 h of archival data.},

  abstract     = {In the prevailing operations of agile satellites for time delay integration (TDI) imaging tasks, two degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the attitude maneuver are determined by tracking the transient target point, whereas the third DOF is used in the control of the drift angle, which is calculated within the sensor focal plane as a feedback. However, optimal attitude maneuver planning is rarely considered during a TDI imaging mission to improve the efficiency of agile satellites. In this paper, a general attitude maneuver planning for agile satellites in the TDI imaging of an arbitrary target strip is formulated, where the energy consumption is minimized while the TDI imaging quality is guaranteed. Coupled with the attitude dynamics, the highly nonlinear constraints required by the TDI imaging principal make this planning hard to solve. By introducing a parameterized time-mapping technique and a compact approach to the attitude maneuver that ensures zero drift angle, the problem is relieved in both complexity and computational burden. The validity of this approach is verified by various imaging simulations.},

  abstract     = {Uniform exponential stability (UES) is proved for the rigid-body attitude control problem using a proportional-derivative (PD) controller with feedforward terms associated with the desired attitude state. Whereas this so-called “PD+” controller is classical and has been extensively analyzed in the literature for more than two decades, thus far it has only been shown to deliver uniform aysmptotic stability for the resulting closed-loop system. This paper parameterizes the kinematics through the three-dimensional modified Rodrigues parameter, assumes perfect measurement of the full-state, and guarantees a stronger UES result. It should be emphasized that no additional restrictions on the reference trajectory or high-gain feedback assumptions are placed in achieving this stronger stability result for the closed-loop system. The design of a new Lyapunov function is shown to permit UES, which further lends itself to robustness analysis in the possible presence of bounded unknown external disturbance torques. Saliently, this new Lyapunov function naturally extends to the classical Gibbs–Rodrigues parameterization of the attitude kinematics. The controller is also tested in simulation to compare the result with practical performance.},

  abstract     = {The optimal control of nonlinear systems is traditionally obtained by the application of the Pontryagin minimum principle. Despite the success of this methodology in finding the optimal control for complex systems, the resulting open-loop trajectory is guaranteed to be only locally optimal. Furthermore, the computation of open-loop solutions is computationally intensive, which rules out its application in feedback controllers, reducing its robustness against disturbances. In principle, these issues can be addressed by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation (PDE). However, the space complexity of the problem is exponential with respect to the number of dimensions of the system. Moreover, the value function of the HJB equation may be nondifferentiable, which renders traditional PDE solution methods impractical. Therefore, extant methods are suitable only for special problem classes such as those involving affine systems or where the value function is differentiable. To deal with these issues, this work introduces a methodology for the solution of the HJB equation for general nonlinear systems that combines PDE viscosity solutions, quasi–Monte Carlo grids, and kriging regression to implement globally optimal nonlinear feedback controllers for practical applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated with smooth and nondifferentiable problems with finite and infinite horizons.},

Specifically, for a class of linear leader–follower multiagent systems with an undirected communication graph topology, state and output feedback adaptive control design protocols are developed for each follower agent to address malicious attacks on the actuator signals of the follower agents as well as sensor attacks on the state and output neighborhood synchronization error measurements. The proposed adaptive controllers involve an indirect adaptive architecture that estimates and compensates for the malicious attacks while guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness of the state tracking error for each agent in a mean-square sense.},

The first criteria group includes requirements for the parameters of highly augmented aircraft. Four of these criteria for FQ and pilot-induced oscillation predictions were considered, and the same modification principles were proposed for all the criteria. The second criteria group is based on the requirements for the pilot–aircraft system, and some of the criteria developed at the Pilot-Vehicle Laboratory are discussed. The third criteria group developed at the Moscow Aviation Institute is used to calculate the pilot’s ratings group. Some of these criteria for single-loop, multichannel, and multimodal piloting tasks were considered. The relationship between the requirements for flight safety and the FQs demonstrates the necessity to modify these requirements for several aircraft classes.},
