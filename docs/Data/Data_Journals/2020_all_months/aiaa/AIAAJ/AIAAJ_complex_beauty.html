  abstract     = {Maintenance of engineering assets (for example, aircraft, jet engines, and wind turbines) is a profitable business. Unfortunately, building models that estimate remaining useful life for large fleets is daunting due to factors such as duty cycle variation, harsh environments, inadequate maintenance, and mass production problems that cause discrepancies between designed and observed lives. We model cumulative damage through recurrent neural networks. Besides architectures such as long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit, we introduced a novel physics-informed approach. Essentially, we merge physics-informed and data-driven layers. With that, engineers and scientists can use physics-informed layers to model well understood phenomena (for example, fatigue crack growth) and use data-driven layers to model poorly characterized parts (for example, internal loads). A numerical experiment is used to present the main features of the proposed physics-informed recurrent neural network. The problem consists of predicting fatigue crack length for a fleet of aircraft. The models are trained using full input observations (far-field loads) and very limited output observations (crack length data for only a portion of the fleet). The results demonstrate that our proposed physics-informed recurrent neural network can model fatigue crack growth even when the observed distribution of crack length does not match the fleet distribution.},

A self-adaptive step size is presented using a merit function by a sufficient criterion, which is determined by using the results of the advanced mean value and the SMV. The abilities of the SMV are compared with several existing reliability methods through two nonlinear structural/mechanical examples. In particular, a practical aircraft panel example is investigated. Furthermore, the influence of self-adaptive parameters in the SMV is discussed on abilities the proposed SMV method for reliability analysis of aircraft panel example. The results demonstrate that the SMV is a robust algorithm for complex structural/mechanical examples, and it is slightly more efficient than the improved versions of reliability methods, which is significant for the reliability assessment of an aerospace structure.},

  abstract     = {Studying the vibratory behavior of inherently damped laser powder bed fused (LPBF) specimens has led to an improved damping performance assessment via a multifactor correlation model. The damping demonstrated in LPBF (additively manufactured) specimens is an artifact of 1–3\% unfused volume of powder that is capable of suppressing vibration 95\% compared to a fully fused part. The original model associates the damping mechanism to unfused powder motion and a sliding interaction, both, respectively, captured by the interaction between vibratory shear and displacement. In previous studies with only a few specimen configurations, this two-variable one-parameter nonlinear model has demonstrated 85–90\% correlation to empirical damping results. However, the complexity of multiple material data sets, different build cycles, and a multitude of internal geometry configurations reduces this correlation and highlights a necessity for exploring other factors, along with the current factors, without interaction. The following effort uses a regression model to study the effects of vibratory factors on damping performance of Inconel 718 and stainless steel 316L. Selection of a final model employs a backward elimination stepwise regression and Akaike’s information criterion. Final validation of the model compares the predicted damping values to an empirical data set outside of that used to tune the selected model.},

  abstract     = {A plane vibration study of a sandwich thermal protection system insulation panel with a functionally graded core is conducted. The panel is assumed to be under plane-stress conditions and subjected to simply supported boundary conditions. The two-dimensional elasticity formulations are used to derive the equations of motion for each layer. The effects of the in-plane normal stresses as well as the shear stress are taken into consideration for all layers. Material properties of layers may vary through the transverse coordinate resulting in a pair of second-order coupled variable- coefficient governing differential equations. The governing equations are reduced to an uncoupled fourth-order differential equation, which is solved by the complementary functions method (CFM). The novelty of the present study includes the vibration analysis of functionally graded core sandwich beam using plane elasticity and implementation of CFM as the solution procedure. The influences of face sheets and core materials and the grading model on the free vibration behavior are studied. The solutions are compared with results available in the literature and those obtained from finite element software (ANSYS) for a three-layered isotropic panel to display the accuracy and efficiency of the presented method. The mode shapes dominated by vertical and horizontal displacements are also depicted. The method that is applicable for both symmetric and unsymmetric beams is shown to be accurate and efficient in the analysis of sandwich panels with a core graded in the thickness direction.},

Based on a unified treatment of time and space, this method solves the integral form of the governing equations by discretization of the space–time domain. Recent progress in CESE schemes mainly includes the construction of a family of upwind CESE schemes, the extended definitions of conservation elements and solution elements for arbitrary meshes, and a new approach to developing high-order CESE schemes. Selected applications of the CESE method (including high-speed aerodynamics, multifluid flows, detonations, and aeroacoustics) are presented. Features of the CESE method are described.},

  abstract     = {This paper demonstrates the development of purely data-driven, nonintrusive parametric reduced-order models for the emulation of high-dimensional field outputs using randomized linear algebra techniques. Typically, low-dimensional representations are built using the proper orthogonal decomposition combined with interpolation/regression in the latent space via supervised learning. However, even moderately large simulations can lead to data sets on which the cost of computing the proper orthogonal decomposition becomes intractable due to storage and computational complexity of the numerical procedure. In an attempt to reduce the offline cost, the proposed method demonstrates the application of randomized singular value decomposition and sketching-based randomized singular value decomposition to compute the proper orthogonal decomposition basis. The predictive capability of reduced-order models resulting from regular singular value decomposition and randomized/sketching-based algorithms are compared with each other to ensure that the decrease in computational cost does not result in a loss in accuracy. Demonstrations on canonical and practical fluid flow problems show that the reduced-order models constructed using randomized methods are competitive in their predictive accuracy with reduced-order models that employ the conventional deterministic method. Through this new method, it is expected that truly large-scale parametric reduced-order models can be constructed under a significantly limited computational resource budget.},

With the aid of air throttling, the kerosene is ignited by the pilot flame; and the kerosene flame remains stable even after the pilot hydrogen is switched off. The speed of the shock train generated by the throttling air and combustion is about in the expansion section but only about in the cavity region. The stable flame and flame blowout cases can be separated by a curve in a plot of the coexistence time of pilot hydrogen and throttling air versus the air throttling flux ratio. There is a special case lying on this curve for which the flame is unstable and will be blown out before the throttling air is switched off. It is also found that the position of the thermal throat is the same for all the subsonic combustion cases: about 595 mm downstream of the scramjet entrance.},

  abstract     = {Accuracy, robustness, and efficiency are the three major goals of turbulence closure. Generally, eddy-viscosity models (EVMs) with the Boussinesq approximation are numerically stable and efficient. However, the accuracy of EVMs for aerodynamically complex configurations is inadequate. Reynolds-stress models (RSMs) are perceived as the most advanced turbulence models, but their robustness and efficiency could be improved. Here, a hybrid closure is proposed that combines a novel eddy-viscosity equation and six Reynolds-stress equations. The eddy-viscosity equation with natural boundary conditions on the walls is designed to implement a transition from eddy-viscosity mode (one-equation mode) to Reynolds-stress mode (seven-equation mode). The one-equation mode, where the eddy-viscosity equation is solved independently with the Boussinesq approximation and the Bradshaw relation, is used to establish the initial flowfield. After a given number of iterations, the seven-equation mode takes over and continues until convergence. The eddy-viscosity equation acts as a length-scale equation to close the RSM. The benchmark results show that the numerical stability is better than for traditional -based RSMs. Moreover, the stability allows a uniform high-order discretization of the mean-flow and turbulence equations (12 partial differential equations), which can reduce the cost needed to achieve a given level of accuracy. This improves the efficiency.},

However, there is a paucity of studies that focuses on the detailed surface pressure distribution. Therefore, we investigated the interior and exterior of a rigid disk-gap-band-type parachute as the first step, under the assumption that the forebody or suspension lines are absent, and thus the pressure and drag fluctuations are small. Two configurations are considered: one with a continuous gap and a vent orifice, representing a conventional Disk-Gap-Band parachute, and one with a discontinuous gap made up of 8 separate orifices and a vent orifice. By making the gap discontinuous, the interior and exterior pressure fluctuations are reduced. Furthermore, as indicated by the flowfield analysis, the discrete gap reduces the asymmetric pressure distribution interior the parachute, and the interior pressure fluctuation far from the center is suppressed. The result is considered useful for the suppression of unstable deformation such as area oscillation. This is currently a problem in supersonic parachute operation. In addition, we have identified locations on the model surface where the pressure fluctuations contribute to the drag fluctuations of the model.},

This paper presents a robust and computationally efficient engineering method to estimate the load distribution of a propeller operating in arbitrary nonuniform flow that is induced by the airframe and by different flight conditions. The time-resolved loading distribution is computed by determining the local blade section advance ratio and using the sensitivity distribution along the blade, which is a property of the propeller in isolated conditions. The method is applied to four representative validation cases by comparing to full-blade computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and experimental data. For the evaluated cases, it is shown that the changes in the propeller loads due to the nonuniform inflow are predicted with errors ranging from 0.5 up to 12\% compared to the validation data. By extending the quasi-steady approach with a correction to account for unsteady effects, the time-resolved blade loading is also well approximated, without adding computational cost. The proposed method provided a time-resolved solution within several central processing unit seconds, which is seven orders of magnitude faster compared to full-blade CFD computations.},

  abstract     = {This Paper presents a new quasi-steady in-ground effect (IGE) model for small multirotor aerial vehicles such as quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles. The model offers three major advances to the state of the art: 1) predicting the IGE thrust ratio without singularity, 2) relating the strength of the ground effect to the blade geometry (pitch angle, solidity, and radius), and 3) capturing the effect of multirotor configurations. Two IGE coefficients, based on blade element theory, are introduced and then analyzed using the method of images. Additionally, the thrust-loss phenomenon on multirotor IGE is observed and modeled empirically. Experiments are conducted to validate each component of the model, and the results suggest that the model can be used to predict the onset of the IGE for vehicle motion control and planning in the regime where IGE dominates.},

Dispersion analysis was used to separate the wave fronts into the downstream and upstream-traveling components. The upstream propagating component was associated with sound waves, originating from the aircraft’s engine, located downstream of the measurement location, with convective speeds that are consistent with theoretical predictions. The spectra of the acoustic-related component were dominated by the tonal frequency associated with the engine’s fan blade pass frequency. Modal analysis also revealed the streamwise spatially periodic nature of the acoustic component of the wave fronts, further confirming the acoustic nature of these distortions. An analytical model was derived which established the relationship between overall levels of acoustic-related optical distortions and the acoustic pressure fluctuations. The model was used to estimate the acoustic pressure spectra and sound pressure levels at the measurement location.},

  abstract     = {Circulation-controlled wings using the Coanda effect over the high-lift device (i.e., the flap) potentially enhance the wing’s lift coefficient by delaying or avoiding separation of the strongly deflected flow on the flap. However, such a Coanda-jet-equipped flap contributes significantly to the airframe noise. Hence, identifying the sound sources on the flap in the aircraft landing conditions is of paramount importance. In this context, the current paper reports the outcomes of zonal overset–large-eddy-simulation (Overset-LES) computations carried out on such a Coanda-jet-equipped flap of a DLRF16 profile. The results show that the Overset-LES computation quantitatively corrects the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes baseflow. The effect of Coanda jet scales on the noise generation is studied by stochastically reconstructing them. As a validation of the computations performed, the power spectral densities of surface pressure fluctuations show a good agreement with the experimental data. This validation further emphasizes the necessity of considering the Coanda jet scales in the Overset-LES. Furthermore, aeroacoustic source ranking is performed based on far-field overall sound pressure levels. Results show that the curvature noise arising from the flow acceleration over the flap’s curvature is dominant at all angles except between 180 and 280°, where the flap’s trailing-edge noise contribution is higher. The effect of the Coanda jet scales on the far-field noise can be ignored when the complete flap is considered. However, the fluctuating jet scales have the tendency to reduce the noise arising from the curvature in the low-frequency regime of the spectrum when individual sources are accounted for, due to enhanced mixing aided by the smaller turbulent scales. This suggests that ignoring the jet scales will result in overpredicting the curvature noise in the low-frequency regime. Including the Coanda jet scales results in a flow-straightening effect near the flap trailing edge and hence alters the magnitude and directivity pattern of the flap trailing-edge noise. The current investigation reveals an additional, previously not recognized sound source at play, resulting from the strong flow deceleration at the region between the curvature and the flap’s trailing edge.},

The jet is heated and issues for a short-cowl axisymmetric nozzle with a central body at a transonic speed. The first LES method is based on the Compact Accurately Boundary-Adjusting High-Resolution Technique (CABARET) scheme, for which implementation features include asynchronous time stepping at an optimal Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number, a wall model, and a synthetic turbulence inflow boundary condition. The CABARET LES is implemented on Graphics Processing Units. The second LES approach is based on the hybrid Reynolds-average Navier–Stokes (RANS)/implicit LES method that uses a mixture of a high-order Roe and Monotonicity-Preserving reconstruction of the 9th order (MP9 scheme) and a wall distance model of the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation type. The RANS/implicit LES method is run on a Message Passing Interface (MPI) cluster. Two grid generation approaches are considered: the unstructured grid using OpenFOAM utility snappyHexMesh and the conventional structured multiblock body-fitted curvilinear grid. The LES flow solutions are compared with the experiment and also with solutions obtained from the standard axisymmetric RANS method using the turbulence model. For noise predictions, the LES solutions are coupled with the penetrable surface formation of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings method. The results of noise predictions are compared with the experiment, and the effect of different LES grids and acoustic integration surfaces is discussed.},

Cold fluid is injected at the axis of a heated jet to introduce radial nonuniformity and control the spatial development of shear layer. This is a companion investigation of an experimental study that observed a 2 dB reduction in peak narrowband sound pressure for centered injection. This investigation highlights the role of nozzle turbulence in changing the development of the noise-generating fluctuations by performing a separation of scales between boundary-layer turbulence and the coherent shear layer fluctuations. The mean flow is analyzed with an efficient Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach. Different turbulence models are tested and compared with the experiments. The coherent perturbation is analyzed using linear parallel and parabolized stability equations (PSEs). PSEs agree with the experiments with regard to the small but consistent decrease in growth rate of forced modes with injection and identify the weakening of the first circumferential mode as the main contribution. Turbulence models for the base flow have a substantial effect on the perturbation development, and a compressibility correction of the RANS base flow is key to investigate jet-noise reduction strategies.},

Subsequently, the development of instability waves along both streamwise and wall-normal directions was comprehensively investigated by traversing the focus of the FLDI through the hypersonic laminar boundary layer. Power spectral density analysis shows the coexistence of various instability waves up to 1.4 MHz, and the corresponding variation of each instability wave was described. Bicoherence analysis of FLDI measurement identifies different types of nonlinear interaction through a phase-locked mechanism, and the nonlinear evolution along the streamwise and wall-normal directions was elaborated on.},

Wind tunnel experiments were conducted at a fixed 3 deg angle of attack and varying Reynolds number between 2.5 and 4.5 million. Moreover, the FFS influence was investigated under unforced (i.e., smooth leading edge) and forced conditions (i.e., using discrete roughness elements). For each test case infrared thermography was used to determine the transition location and spatial organization of the crossflow vortices. In addition, the change in amplification factor was calculated using linear stability theory. Results reveal the importance of considering multiple parameters when estimating the critical FFS height. The unforced cases indicate that one-parameter correlations (i.e., based on the crossflow vortex core height or boundary-layer displacement thickness) might not be sufficient to universally capture the dynamics of these complex flows. Analysis of the forced cases shows that in addition to local parameters (i.e., step height and vortex core height), the FFS influence on transition depends on the stability characteristics of the incoming instability mode. These findings suggest a complex nonlinear interaction between instabilities and surface irregularities, which highlight the need for multiparameter correlations for accurate transition prediction.},

However, exploring the stochastic design space significantly increases the computational cost. The aim of this paper is to develop a framework for efficient optimization under uncertainty by means of a bilevel surrogate approach and to apply it to the robust design of a retrofitted shock control bump over an airfoil. The framework combines a surrogate-based optimizer with an efficient surrogate-based approach for uncertainty quantification. The optimizer efficiently finds the global optimum of a given quantile of the quantity of interest through the combination of adaptive sampling and a moving trust region. At each iteration of the optimization, the surrogate-based uncertainty quantification uses an active infill criterion to accurately quantify the quantile requiring a reduced number of samples. Two different quantiles of the drag are chosen for the design of the shock control bump: the 95\% to increase the robustness at off-design conditions, and the 50\% for a configuration that is preferred for day–to-day operations. In both cases, the optimum bumps are more robust, compared to the one obtained through classical deterministic optimization.},

The massive separation due to the interaction is controlled by fluidic vortex generators (VGs). Ten VGs are positioned in the center of the test section according to analyses based on physical considerations and literature results. A first kriging-based optimization is used to determine the most appropriate pitch and skew angles of the VGs. The optimum configuration found is then considered, and a second kriging algorithm is used to enhance the control of the corner flow by adding two VGs. The longitudinal and lateral locations and the pitch and skew angles of the two lateral VGs are optimized. The objective of these optimizations is to minimize the total pressure losses through the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction. A configuration improving the objective function by 61\% is found with slightly upstream-blowing jets. To understand this original finding, a comparison of the vorticity patterns generated by downstream- and upstream-blowing jets is therefore carried out.},

The analysis focuses on the characterization of the unsteady pressure signature on the motor wall, with emphasis on the role played by turbulence on the level of pressure oscillations. It is found that the root mean square of the wall-pressure fluctuations obtained by ILES along the motor wall is in excellent agreement with the experimental data, which is contrary to the prediction of axisymmetric simulations. Fourier spectral analysis reveals that, for this grain geometry, the first three longitudinal modes are weakly excited at the motor head end and most of the energy is concentrated in the shear layer detaching from the grain edge, whose development in the motor chamber is characterized by the rollers breakup with subsequent transition to fine-scale turbulence. The spectrum highlights that the coupling between vortex shedding and pressure oscillations is locked on the third acoustic mode, in agreement with previous experimental observations and with the frequency predicted by a simple acoustic feedback loop model.},

Uncorrelated velocity field snapshots were obtained in the wake of a compressor blade in a linear cascade wind tunnel at Reynolds using particle image velocimetry. The snapshots were analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition to identify the most energetic mode pairs representing vortex shedding patterns of different length scales with their own shedding frequency. The phase angles associated with the individual shedding patterns are extracted for each snapshot based on the time coefficients of the mode pairs. By averaging snapshots with the same phase angle for selected mode pairs, we were able to calculate mode- or scale-dependent phase average flowfields. These scale-dependent phase averages visually highlight the multiscale vortex character of the turbulent wake and allow for a quantitative analysis of the size, emerging location, and shedding frequency of the different structures.},

  abstract     = {In this work, three-component planar velocity measurements are analyzed to identify the effects of compressibility on mixing layer turbulence, with a focus on the evolution of large-scale structures, dominant spatial eigenmodes, and entrainment length scales. Velocity measurements obtained via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry for five different dual-stream air planar mixing layers with convective Mach numbers of , 0.38, 0.55, 0.69, and 0.88 are analyzed. Results of two-point correlations reveal that length scales of the streamwise velocity fluctuations increase in both the streamwise and transverse directions, whereas the length scales of the transverse velocity fluctuations decrease in the transverse direction. To further investigate these trends, the spatial organization, shape, and dynamics of large-scale turbulent structures are examined via two-dimensional spatial velocity correlations, proper orthogonal decomposition, and linear stochastic estimation. These quantitative techniques support qualitative findings in the literature that report coherent, round roller structures in incompressible mixing layers becoming flattened and elongated longitudinally with increased compressibility. This evolution is likely due to a dominant pulsing motion present for the higher cases and can be linked to compressibility effects on the entrainment mechanisms. Length scales of entrainment are determined using autocorrelations of normal flow velocity components along instantaneously identified turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces and are found to decrease with increasing . This result can heuristically be interpreted as small-scale nibbling being dominant for higher , whereas larger-scale engulfment contributes more in nearly incompressible mixing layers.},

The characteristics of the ice-induced separation bubble (ISB) and its influence on the aerodynamic performance are studied at low angles of attack (, 3, and 6 deg). These are compared to the naturally developed laminar separation bubble (LSB) on the corresponding clean (that is, noniced) airfoil. As expected, the LSB on the clean airfoil contracts in size and travels toward the leading edge with an increase in AOA. In contrast, the ISB on the iced airfoil grows in size with an increase in AOA, albeit marginally, as the location of the reattachment moves downstream. The characteristics of the boundary-layer separation, transition, and turbulence after reattachment are similar for both the ISB and LSB. Furthermore, it is noted that the streamwise ice accretion increases the lift coefficient at a 0 deg AOA, whereas the drag remains almost unchanged.},

  abstract     = {The flow around a pitching NACA0015 airfoil with an oscillating trailing-edge flap is experimentally investigated to characterize the influence of the flap kinematics on the development of dynamic stall. We specifically focus on the timing of the stall development and critical values of the leading-edge suction parameter as potential stall triggers. In general, static or dynamic trailing-edge flap motions strongly affect the entire lift response but preserve the characteristic evolution of the leading-edge suction parameter. The influence of the flap on the critical values of the leading-edge suction parameter and their timing is more subtle. Variations in the magnitude of the leading-edge suction are related to the instantaneous geometric effective angle of attack. A thin-airfoil theory-based model that linearly superimposes the effect of the flap on the response for a fixed flap in its neutral position correctly predicts the maximum values of the leading-edge suction parameter. The timing at which these maxima are reached corresponds to the stall delay and is dominated by the prestall temporal evolution of the effective angle of attack. Our results suggest that dynamic stall development is governed by characteristic stall delays rather than critical values of the maximum leading-edge suction parameter.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic stall often occurs under conditions of simultaneous unsteady pitching and surging (e.g., rotorcraft and wind turbines), but many models employ a dimensionless time base that implicitly assumes that surging is superimposed, in a quasi-steady manner, on dynamic pitching. An unsteady wind tunnel was used to examine this assumption, where a technique was developed to quantify the unsteady effects of surging on a pitching NACA 0018 airfoil. The technique involved performing multiple harmonic pitching experiments under nominally steady freestream conditions that bracketed a corresponding 50\% surging amplitude . By interpolating these data, unsteady-pitching/quasi-steady-surging data sets were constructed and compared with de facto synchronous pitch and surging experiments, thereby isolating the unsteady effects of surging on a pitching airfoil. Both large and small poststall maximum angles of attack ( and ) were considered at multiple pitch-surge phase differences. During deep dynamic stall , with large-scale separation, surging was seen to have a secondary effect on the unsteady aerodynamics. However, at small poststall maximum angles of attack , either light or deep dynamic stall behavior was observed depending upon the pitch-surge phase difference. This was attributed to Reynolds number history effects, exemplified by boundary-layer transition, and thus it can be referred to as “transitional” dynamic stall.},

This study, performed in water tow tanks, compares the response of a flat plate wing to transverse vertical gusts with a top-hat and a sine-squared velocity profile at Reynolds numbers of 20,000–30,000. Experiments are performed for a wide range of gust ratios (0.5–1.5) and angles of attack (0–20 deg). Force measurements for a sine-squared gust show a smoother increase in lift and a lower peak compared with a top-hat gust for the same gust ratio. Linear models are found to work reasonably well predicting the force response for the sine-squared gust, whereas the top-hat gust exhibits significant nonlinear effects at the largest gust ratios. This nonlinear behavior is linked to high levels of circulation shed from the wing edges and the development of nonplanar wakes. Nevertheless, the gust momentum inflow on the wing is directly linked to many characteristics of the lift response, independently of gust velocity profile. In addition, the lift response for the two gusts is found to increase with angle of attack until the wing inclination is large enough to produce a separated wake before gust entry.},

Ethylene-fuelled experiments developed scram-mode combustion under lean fuelling, whereas increased fuelling anchored combustion to the fuel injector wake. Further fuelling increases to stoichiometric levels developed dual-mode combustion. Exhaust OH PLIF indicated ethylene scram-mode combustion developed combustion products primarily in the wall-adjacent regions, whereas asymmetric flowfields were noted for the dual-mode. The addition of methane inhibited reactions, with no scram-mode combustion observed at even fuel-rich conditions. Higher fuelling rates developed dual-mode combustion with comparable pressure rises to the ethylene-fuelled dual-mode cases.

In high-speed imaging of the self-luminescence within the combustor, rotating luminous regions were observed at mass flow rates above . Measured pressure distributions suggest that burned gas reached sonic velocity at the combustion chamber outlet. This paper proposes the structure of internal flow in the RDE and confirms that calculated pressure distribution based on the structure was close to the experimental distribution. This study also estimated the RDE’s thrust by pressure and momentum exchange and confirmed it by experimental measurement. Moreover, the theoretical thrust calculated under the assumption that exhaust is a sonic flow agreed with the load cell thrusts, suggesting that RDE combustion is perfectly completed inside the chamber. Specific impulses are 80–90\% of specific impulses for ideal correct expanded flow for all mass flow rates, and its value was close to that of an annular RDE. In addition, RDE performance will increase by about 20\% if the RDE is equipped with a divergent nozzle and the gas is correctly expanded to back pressure.},

  abstract     = {The phenomenon of onset time after ignition in atmospheric and backpressurized rotating detonation combustors is dealt with in the current Paper. By altering the airflow and fuel flow rates, plenum supply pressures, and the backpressure, the rotating-detonation-combustor/plenum coupling is modeled as a black-box system by training a single-input/single-output (combustor pressure dynamics and plenum oscillations, respectively) autoregressive output and exogeneous input model with 0.2 s of experimental data and validating it with the next 0.15 s of measured values. The simulated data are seen to match the experimentally observed pressure oscillations to a reasonable degree within a 95\% confidence interval in magnitude and also capture the main detonation frequencies accurately across multiple operating modes. The air plenum is found to be a lower-order system that can be predicted well using three poles and two zeros, whereas preliminary analysis carried out here suggests that the fuel plenum is of a much higher order requiring at least 80 poles and 30 zeros. The onset time for the studied backpressurized operation is found to be dictated by the settling time of the air plenum obtained from its impulse response, whereas such a congruence does not exist for atmospheric rotating detonation combustors. For the latter, the onset time seems to be correlated to decreasing fuel supply pressures. Frequency response plots of the air and fuel plenum when subjected to the detonation propagation in the combustor shows the air plenum to behave like a bandpass filter allowing the detonation frequency to pass through with the highest amplitude. The fuel-plenum/combustor coupling, on the other hand, is seen to behave like a comb filter, alternatively damping and strengthening certain phases, for the single test modeled. This is attributed to the fuel plenum behaving like a reverberation chamber that always retains the memory of the initial detonation impulse.},

Practical designs involve the discrete injection of fuel and air, which then partially mix to produce the reactive mixture that is processed by a continuously moving detonation wave within the detonation chamber. One of the fundamental challenges in the successful operation of rotating detonation engines is the design of a robust fuel-oxidizer injection system. To minimize pressure losses while ensuring efficient mixing that promotes stable detonation, the injection has to satisfy many different constraints. In this work, the impact of discrete injection on wave propagation is studied in an effort to understand the impact of fuel stratification on detonation stability. To this end, the structure of the detonation wave within a linearized rotating detonation engine with fully premixed hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen injection at various equivalence ratios is analyzed. The direct numerical simulation of the linearized model detonation engine is compared with experimental results, and wave behavior is correlated to the wave structure and flow turbulence. The flow properties and chemical composition of the gases across the detonation wave are studied to examine the characteristics of the reaction zone.},

The predetonator was found to play an important role in the stability of detonation propagation. It could bring about injection instability that interacts with the RDWs. Therefore, this interaction, as well as the detonation strength, affects the propagation mode of RDWs. If the predetonator resonated longitudinally, it largely impacts the RDW propagation mode.

The increase of combustor pressure makes the angle of upstream oblique shock wave decrease, indicating that the influence of detonation on air inflow strengthens. The angle of downstream oblique shock wave is mainly influenced by the contraction geometry of nozzle in the contraction ratio range of 2–10. The heights of CRDWs scatter around  mm ,  mm (, single wave), and  mm (, two waves), respectively.

Some scholars have also called this concept the continuously rotating detonation engine or rotating detonation engine. The advantages and application potential of the CDE have been widely recognized and verified with research focused in three directions: continuous detonation rocket engines, continuous detonation ramjet engines, and continuous detonation turbojet engines. This paper reviews recent progress (primarily in the last five years) of CDE from the perspective of engineering applications. Research on continuous detonation rocket engines has gone from concept exploration to mechanism research, and it is moving toward engineering applications. Large-scale prototype testing may be the next step, especially with experiments based on liquid methane and liquid oxygen that need further development. The continuous detonation ramjet engine is still in the conceptual design and principle exploration stages. To adapt to broader inflow conditions and working Mach numbers, the combination of different working modes of a CDE may be of further interest. The continuous detonation turbojet engine is still in the scheme demonstration stage. Significant research work is needed in terms of experimental, numerical, and theoretical analyses, especially toward finding individual phenomena, mechanism exploration, and multicomponent coupling test. The performance of continuous detonation with solid fuels will also benefit from additional investigations and verifications.},

  abstract     = {A parametrically driven structural model based on Mindlin–Reissner plate theory is developed to capture the three-dimensional deflections of a compliance-based morphing trailing edge device with severe structural discontinuities. The model is used to study the Fish Bone Active Camber (FishBAC) device, which is represented as a discontinuous plate structure that captures the step changes in stiffness created by the concept’s geometrical configuration. Courant’s penalty method is implemented in the form of artificial penalty springs to account for stiffness discontinuities. A numerical validation is performed using finite element analysis, followed by experimental validation under actuation loads. This analytical model represents a robust, efficient, mesh-independent, and parameter-driven solution to modeling discontinuous plate structures. These traits make it useful for ongoing fluid–structure interaction analysis and optimization of the FishBAC concept and also for application to other complex composite structures.},

  abstract     = {Honeycomb sandwich panels are used in aerospace structures for their high stiffness-to-mass ratio. Reducing structural mass is critical in aircraft and spacecraft development due to its direct impact on payload capacity and operational costs. Typically, hexagonal honeycombs manufactured by cold expansion of periodically bonded strips of metal or foils of other materials are used for sandwich construction. With rapid development in additive manufacturing, other core shapes with higher specific stiffness can now be considered as an alternative. The authors of this paper had previously evaluated triangular cores to have higher or comparable specific moduli as compared with other two-dimensional core shapes. Further, the panels constructed using triangular cores had higher stiffness than traditional hexagonal core panels. To consider practical use of the triangular cores, elastic-plastic structural analysis is performed to evaluate the strength and failure of sandwich panel construction. Load bearing capacity of triangular core panels under three-point bending, in-plane compressive loading, and transverse shear loading is evaluated using finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. The comparison made between triangular core and hexagonal core sandwich panels having the same cell size and relative density showed that triangular cores outperform hexagonal cores for applications where in-plane loading is dominant, whereas, in terms of transverse shear and out-of-plane loading, triangular core panels tend to fail at lower loads and lower deflections.},

  abstract     = {The harmonic balance method is nowadays widely applied for numerically solving problems that are known to possess time-periodic solutions. Key reasons for its success are its wide range of applicability, relative ease of implementation, and computational efficiency compared to time-accurate approaches. The computational efficiency of the harmonic balance method is partly derived from the fact that it searches directly for a periodic solution instead of integrating the governing equations in time until a periodic solution is reached. Convergence acceleration techniques such as multigrid, implicit residual smoothing, and local time stepping may also be used to improve the efficiency of the harmonic balance method. This paper considers another option for accelerating convergence, namely, a novel time-level preconditioner that can be applied to the harmonic balance residual locally in each computational cell. The benefit of employing this preconditioner is analyzed both from a theoretical perspective, by performing a rigorous stability analysis based on the linearized Euler equations, and from a numerical perspective, by applying it to two test cases.},

  abstract     = {A coupled immersed boundary method and unsteady actuator surface model (IBM–ASM) is developed and implemented into a finite-volume-based incompressible Navier–Stokes solver within OpenFOAM for efficient full rotorcraft simulations. Given a geometry definition, a simple Cartesian mesh generated through a fully automated process can be used for an immersed boundary method (IBM) since it is a non-body-conformal mesh approach that incorporates geometrical complexities using momentum forcing to enforce its boundary condition onto the flowfield. Detached-eddy simulation is employed for the turbulence modeling, and an appropriate wall function is defined and implemented as needed for efficient high-Reynolds-number computations. Also, it is demonstrated that a total-variation-diminishing reconstruction must be used to produce physically reasonable results. Finally, an actuator surface model is integrated with the IBM solver, concluding the overall IBM–ASM methodology to address rotorcraft problems. Detailed verification and validation of the IBM solver are demonstrated for a low-Reynolds-number cylinder, a turbulent flat plate, and a high-Reynolds-number cylinder. Lastly, the IBM–ASM solver is validated against experimental measurements for the flow around a simplified airframe developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology. Unsteady rotor-wake/fuselage interactions in a forward flight condition are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results are competitive with existing best methods using a fraction of the setup and computational effort of the body-conforming method.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops a new approach for analysis of subgrid closures for turbulent combustion as modeled using direct quadrature (finite-rate chemistry) techniques. The approach, termed multiresolution analysis through mesh-sequenced realizations (MRA-MSR), conducts simultaneous, constrained large-eddy simulations on a set of hierarchically coarsened meshes. The availability of underlying fine-mesh (subgrid) data corresponding to coarse-mesh locations allows a clearer assessment of the effects of unresolved fluctuations on apparent reactivity. A key to MRA-MSR is the correlation of eddy structures at coarser mesh levels, which is facilitated by the transfer of filtered fine-mesh velocity information. A seven-mesh MRA-MSR hierarchy using three resolution levels is applied to one of the Sydney bluff-body stabilized methane–hydrogen flames. Analysis of the simultaneously evolved data at different resolution levels reveals several interesting trends. First, at high Damköhler numbers, there is clear evidence of attenuation of apparent reactivity due to the effects of unresolved fluctuations. Secondly, single-point, single-time filtered density functions of a normalized subgrid Damköhler number show a characteristic beta probability density function (PDF) form and display evidence of scale similarity. Interrogation of the MRA-MSR database also shows that the recently-proposed least-squares minimization (LSM) turbulence–chemistry interaction model can account for the observed diminishment in reactivity at high Damköhler numbers but cannot reduce scatter significantly. A new form of the LSM model, which makes use of the normalized subgrid Damköhler number beta PDF distribution, performs slightly better than the original model, illustrating the potential of MRA-MSR both in assessing existing closure concepts and in developing new ones.},

It is found that the total pressure ratio of RDE is far less than that across the propagating detonation wave.

  abstract     = {Sustained flight at hypersonic speeds presents an enduring challenge to vehicle design and control. An extreme aerothermal environment acting on geometrically thin, multifunctional structures can result in the significant structural response of key aerodynamic surfaces. Specifically, the oscillations of a compression corner shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction, which models a control surface deflection, can couple with the lowest natural frequencies of a proximal compliant surface, leading to a range of undesirable outcomes from reduced service life to structural failure. The present work investigates these phenomena through time-accurate high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations of a laminar two-dimensional flow at over a 35 deg compression ramp featuring an embedded compliant panel. Surface pressure, skin friction, and heat transfer associated with the corner shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction are directly compared between rigid and compliant configurations. The upstream separation zone is observed to synchronize with the compliant-panel deflection. A reduction in surface heat flux is observed for a majority of compliant cases relative to the rigid case, whereas entirely new flow features are observed in response to large-scale panel deflections. A modification is proposed to the local piston-theory aerodynamic model to improve the accuracy of surface pressure predictions.},

In addition, an improved evaluation method is proposed to provide a better measurement of volume performance for large-slenderness-ratio waveriders than the conventional method, which can also guide the design of volume-improved waveriders. The volume-improved waveriders and conventional cone-derived waveriders with slenderness ratios of more than nine are designed under the condition of a cruising altitude of 40 km and a Mach number of 12. After investigating their volume and aerodynamic performance, it can be found that the volume-improved waverider can achieve about a 48\% volume increment, a 91\% effective volume increment, and a four times larger volume growth rate compared to the conventional waverider. Furthermore, the lift-to-drag ratio of the volume-improved waverider is higher than that of the conventional waverider in the inviscid case, whereas it is smaller under the viscous condition. The gap in the viscous lift-to-drag ratio between the two waveriders reduces with the increasing attack of angle and is less than 8\% at the design condition.},

The design’s target condition is Mach 5.0–7.0 with angles of attack and sideslip within 6°. The FADS system relates air data and pressures from surface-mounted pressure ports on the forebody of the vehicle to generate lookup tables that are used to estimate the angle of attack, freestream Mach number, static pressure, and dynamic pressure. These data are also used to generate an angle-of-sideslip estimate from triples algorithm, which has been well-established for a blunt-nosed body. The estimation algorithm used by the designed FADS system is validated through numerical simulation, which was also used to generate lookup tables and wind tunnel experiments.

Well-quantified distortions in the form of streamwise vortices are embedded into the boundary layer using single sub-boundary-layer vortex generators (VGs). At four device heights downstream from the VG trailing edge, the boundary layer exhibits a peak deficit in the streamwise velocity from the undistorted boundary layer of 60\%. At 15 device heights, the boundary layer was energized to a peak surplus of 25\% in the streamwise velocity. These two VG streamwise placements (four and 15 device heights) were employed to emphasize the impact of direct vortex interactions and boundary-layer energization on separation vortex control. It was found that having an energized boundary-layer incident on the fin-on-cylinder SBLI made very little change to the separation vortex size and the associated pressure distribution. However, placing the vortex generator much closer significantly mitigated the separation vortex size, and several azimuthal placement locations showed an elimination of the separation vortex. Cross-sectional velocity and vorticity fields showed a strong reduction in spanwise velocity and streamwise vorticity above the separation vortex in the successful configurations.},

  abstract     = {Thermal residual stresses can have a substantial impact on the bond-line fatigue of wind-turbine blades and the initiation of tunneling cracks in the adhesive layer early in their operational life. Thermal residual stresses develop during the manufacture of the blade as a consequence of the temperature difference between the curing conditions and the operating environmental conditions. Polymers are used as adhesive or matrix material for fiber-reinforced materials. Their physical properties (for example, the coefficient of thermal expansion, Young’s modulus, and the tensile strength) depend on the curing process (that is, the degree of cure and the temperature). Moreover, the ambient temperature for the blade during its operational life underlies a statistical distribution, which is site specific. Traditionally, the design evaluation is conducted with material properties obtained at a room temperature of 23°C under fully cured conditions. Taking into account the variability of temperature at a specific site (for example, from to 25°C) will increase the fidelity of the design evaluation. This research investigates the impact of thermal residual stress on the fatigue stress exposure along the trailing-edge bond line during operational blade life. A simplified approach using temperature-independent material properties for different temperature sites at northern, central, and southern European wind farm sites is compared to an advanced approach using temperature-dependent and degree-of-cure-dependent properties. It was found that the advanced approach yields a more critical design.},

The surrogate-based matrix terms are then used in the method to determine flow conditions at flutter onset. To demonstrate the multifidelity process, a widely used pitching and plunging airfoil case is considered. Verification of the approach is done by comparing with results from a mode-based time-domain aeroelastic solver, as well as data from the literature. The approach draws inspiration from Timme et al., but focuses more on widely used industry tools (namely, the method, panel-based aerodynamics, and time-domain computational fluid dynamics). The benefit of using multiple aerodynamic fidelities, rather than high-fidelity kriging models, is also quantified by examining a flutter speed error metric as the number of high-fidelity samples is varied.},

From the results, it can be seen that both the SPL and the effective mass density can be controlled by the active feedback system. As the frequency region of the negative density increases obviously, it emerges two negative regions with the changing of the displacement feedback control action and leads to the changing of the SPL. Besides the Mach number of the external mean flow, other influences on the SPL are also discussed, such as the structural damping, lattice constants, excitation position, elevation angle, and azimuth angle.

  abstract     = {Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is commonly performed using surrogates to approximate the response due to deterministic and stochastic design variables, as well as random parameters, but is ultimately limited by the number of dimensions that can be accurately represented. In this paper, a new surrogate-centric RBDO formulation is developed to alleviate the computational expense of excessive random parameters. Nondeterministic kriging nonstationary variation estimation is used to characterize normally distributed random parameters and numerical noise rather than increasing the surrogate’s dimensionality. Simultaneously, surrogate-based uncertainty propagation is performed considering the nonnormally distributed or high nonlinear random parameters, and stochastic design variables. In this study, propagated uncertainties and the uncertainty captured by the kriging variation are recombined through the convolution of the two probability density functions. It was found that conglomerations of normally distributed random parameters allow this method to reduce the number of approximated spaces while maintaining accuracy compared to existing surrogate approaches. This paper contains a detailed description of the proposed methodology; foundational four-, five-, and six-dimensional RBDO examples with comparisons to previous methods from the literature; and the RBDO of a 10-dimensional nonlinear thermoelastic hat-stiffened panel under a frequency and stress constraint.},

  abstract     = {Global optimization of aerodynamic shapes usually requires a large number of expensive computational fluid dynamics simulations because of the high dimensionality of the design space. One approach to combat this problem is to reduce the design space dimension by obtaining a new representation. This requires a parametric function that compactly and sufficiently describes useful variation in shapes. This paper proposes a deep generative model, Bézier-GAN, to parameterize aerodynamic designs by learning from shape variations in an existing database. The resulted new parameterization can accelerate design optimization convergence by improving the representation compactness while maintaining sufficient representation capacity. The airfoil design is used as an example to demonstrate the idea and analyze Bézier-GAN’s representation capacity and compactness. Results show that Bézier-GAN both 1) learns smooth and realistic shape representations for a wide range of airfoils and 2) empirically accelerates optimization convergence by at least two times compared with state-of-the-art parameterization methods.},

  abstract     = {Natural laminar-flow wings are one of the most promising technologies for reducing fuel burn and emissions for commercial aviation. However, there is a lack of tools for performing shape optimization of wings based on computational fluid dynamics considering laminar-to-turbulent transition. To address this need, we develop a discrete adjoint-based optimization framework where transition is modeled. The core of this framework is a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver that is coupled with a simplified method to predict Tollmien–Schlichting and laminar separation-induced transition that consists of a laminar boundary-layer code and a database method for flow stability analysis. The transition prediction is integrated with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model through a smoothed intermittency function, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization. A coupled-adjoint approach that uses transpose Jacobian-vector products derived via automatic differentiation computes the transition prediction derivatives. Lift-constrained drag minimizations of airfoils for a single-point design and a multipoint design problem are performed. The results show that the optimizer successfully reduces the drag coefficient by increasing the extent of laminar flow. The multipoint optimization formulation produces an airfoil with a significant amount of laminar flow that is maintained at several flight conditions. The proposed methods make it possible to perform aerodynamic shape optimization considering laminar-to-turbulent transition in airfoil optimization.},

  abstract     = {When modeling wind turbine wake recovery, the location of wake breakdown plays a crucial role. The breakdown is caused by a rapid deformation of the helical near-wake vortex structure that is triggered by the pairing of successive blade tip vortices. In this paper, the capability of a cost-efficient lifting-line free vortex wake code to accurately predict the wake breakdown location and its underlying mechanisms is demonstrated and validated against simulation results of a large-eddy simulation solver and additional data from the literature. Furthermore, this work investigates a technique to accelerate the breakdown of wind turbine wakes. The onset of wake breakdown is caused by perturbations that travel along the helical structure of the wake and grow via mutual-induction interaction between neighboring vortex filaments. To accelerate wake breakdown, the blade tip vortices are perturbed at different frequencies via trailing-edge flaps located in the outboard region of the rotor blades. Through the evaluation of the perturbation growth rates and the analysis of velocity fields, it is shown that for a multi-megawatt wind turbine operating in a turbulent wind field, the wake breakdown position can be significantly affected by a moderate flap actuation amplitude if excited at an appropriate frequency.},

Experiments also revealed apparent improvements to propeller acoustic emissions. Propeller performance and noise signatures, evaluated against a reference propeller, are presented from experiments involving different propeller configurations modified with various combinations of tubercle geometry. Specific tubercle configurations exhibit improvements in efficiency up to 6\% as well as redistributed directional and high-frequency broadband noise characteristics.},

  abstract     = {We numerically investigate the propulsion performance of a skeleton-reinforced caudal fin with both active and passive control mechanisms. In our fluid–structure interaction model, the embedded rays are depicted as nonlinear beams while the flow is simulated using a Navier–Stokes solver. Kinematically, the fin is activated by a sway motion at the basal ends of the rays and distributed time-varying forces along each ray individually. The dynamics of the fin is closely associated with the exact distribution of phase lags (between the sway motion and external forces) among the rays. We find that the fin’s performance can be significantly enhanced by active control when the mean phase lag is less than 90 deg. Among different deformation patterns, the cupping deformation ( mode) produces the best propulsion performance and the W-shape deformations ( mode) have a similar (yet less pronounced) effect. Asymmetric deformations such as the heterocercal mode ( mode) and undulation mode ( mode) are able to generate vertical forces. Compared with the mode, the mode creates less thrust force, but it significantly reduces the transverse force, making it more suitable in cases when there is no other mechanism to balance this transverse force (for example, during the braking maneuver).},

  abstract     = {A NACA 0018 airfoil in freestream velocity is oscillated in longitudinal, transverse, and angle-of-attack directions with respect to the freestream velocity, known as surge, plunge, and pitch. The lift-based equivalence method introduces phase shifts between these three motions to construct in-phase sinusoidal components for maximum lift, waveform construction. Lift cancellation is also determined with the exact negative pitch and plunge motion amplitudes found from the equivalence method to achieve out-of-phase wave destruction. Lift cancellation occurs when a combination of these motions is sought to obtain a constant lift magnitude throughout the oscillation cycle. To achieve both equivalence and cancellation of lift, a prescribed pure pitch amplitude through the Theodorsen theory equates the corresponding equivalent plunge amplitude and pitch–plunge phase shift. These Theodorsen, linear superposition findings of pitch–plunge are leveraged toward the Greenberg theory to determine a closed-form, surge–pitch–plunge solution through the addition of a surge–plunge phase shift and optimal surge amplitude for lift cancellation. The lift cancellation surge–pitch–plunge amplitudes define the equivalence amplitude investigated here and theoretically limit the experiment to combinations of the first lift harmonic of the Greenberg theory. The analytical results are then compared with experimental lift force measurements and dye visualization. The normalized lift differences due to unsteady wake and boundary-layer behavior are examined to explore the extents of the Greenberg theory for these cases of lift-based equivalence and cancellation.},

The streamwise separation distance between the foils was fixed at one chord length. The performance of the downstream foil was significantly worsened (up to 80\% in efficiency) by the tandem effects. The Strouhal number, Reynolds number, and pitching amplitude had substantial impact on the performance of the downstream foil. For the upstream foil, however, the performance improved by up to 147\% in efficiency at all ranges of Reynolds number, Strouhal number, and pitching amplitude. The scaling of the individual foil performance metric and the system collective performance metric were investigated for tandem foils. The scaling developed for isolated foils does hold for tandem foils in the in-line configuration with modified empirical coefficients that depend on reduced frequency and Reynolds number in a range of and . However, the leading foil behavior at lower is more scattered compared to higher , which suggests more significant wake interactions that influence the scaling and performance of the leading foil.},

The quasi-periodic flow in the wake causes excitation of the separated flow in the poststall conditions. The increase in the time-averaged lift force is associated with the flow separation, leading-edge vortex formation, and subsequent reattachment in a process similar to the dynamic stall of oscillating wings. The lift enhancement is maximum for an optimal offset distance from the wake centerline. At the optimal location, potential flow oscillations, rather than the direct impingement of large vortices in the wake, provide the excitation. The smaller amplitude flow oscillations lead to a large separation bubble in the time-averaged sense in the poststall regime. The delayed flow separation in the wake has a similar mechanism and frequency to those of the active flow control methods for separation. The degree of the lift enhancement is remarkable, given that the wake at a Reynolds number of 50,000 is expected to be highly three-dimensional.},

The method is applied first to find the lowest few (six in most examples) frequencies of isotropic cantilever plates of different skew angles and thickness-to-side length ratios. Subsequently, natural frequencies of laminated composite plates for various skew angles, thickness-to-side ratios, numbers of layers, and stacking sequences are compared with those obtained from converged solutions using either shell or brick elements in ABAQUS. It is demonstrated that the TSNDT/Ritz method provides highly accurate frequencies. Three-dimensional mode shapes are presented for a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of skew quadrilateral laminates.},

  abstract     = {The stress and strain tensors in maneuvering aircraft are affected not only by the aerodynamic and propulsive forces but also by the body translational and angular velocities and high rate temperature distributions. The structural design of flexible aircraft requires the elastic fields to be evaluated at high accuracy. For this, new models that couple the aeroelasticity equations with the heat and translational and rotational equations of flight dynamics are essential. In this paper, the governing equations are derived by describing the motion of a thermoelastic body in an undeformed body frame by means of the variational principle applied to four invariants: the kinetic energy, the gravitational potential energy, the thermoelastic potential, and the dissipation function. Particular cases of longitudinal and lateral flight dynamics of a thermoelastic body including longitudinal flight of a thermoelastic beam are considered. Also, a discrete system for the translational and rotational velocities, the structural modes, and nodal temperature is derived. These equations may advance control design of hypersonic platforms, flexible aircraft, and missiles.},

A step-by-step methodology is provided for gyroscopic stabilization of such unstable potential systems that guarantees their exponential stability through the simultaneous use of positive and negative velocity feedback. Dissipative damping and positive velocity feedback are shown to constructively cooperate to bring about such stability. In contrast to the well-known Kelvin–Tait–Chetaev paradigm, which states that gyroscopically stabilized unstable potential systems are always made unstable in the presence of the slightest dissipation of energy, the paper points to a new paradigm, which states that the proper simultaneous dissipation and infusion of energy into generic gyroscopically stabilized unstable potential systems guarantees their exponential stability. What is meant by “generic” is explicitly stated, and such generic systems are shown to include most real-life -degree-of-freedom unstable potential systems.},

  abstract     = {Overset meshes have a unique advantage in handling moving boundary problems as remeshing is often unnecessary. Recently, overset Cartesian and strand meshes were used successfully to compute complex flow over rotorcraft. Although it is quite straightforward to deploy a high-order finite difference method on the Cartesian mesh, the near-body solver for the strand mesh is often limited to second-order accuracy. In the present study, a high-order flux reconstruction solver, hpMusic, is developed on both the near-body and background grids, and it is extended to handle moving boundary problems. Accuracy studies are carried out, and the designed order of accuracy is obtained for both inviscid and viscous flows. The method is then tested for a benchmark dynamic airfoil problem from the 4th International Workshop on High-Order CFD Methods. Mesh and order-convergent results are obtained and compared with those from other groups. Finally flow over a hovering rotor is simulated to compare with experimental data. In this case, the present high-order solver is capable of generating and propagating tip vortices with high resolution. Good agreement is achieved with experimental data in tip vortex core size, location, and the swirl velocity at third-order accuracy.},

Multiple types of length scales are considered, both purely geometric length scales (including the cube root of the cell volume and the maximum cell dimension) and length scales that depend on both the grid and the flow. The assessment focuses on how the LES prediction changes for increasingly anisotropic grids in forced isotropic turbulence and channel flow at high Reynolds number. Although some length scales perform better than others, the main conclusion is that no single length scale produces LES results that are completely independent of the grid anisotropy. Because every model and length scale tested produces accurate results on at least one grid and inaccurate results on at least one other grid, the study shows clearly the need to assess LES models on multiple grids with multiple different anisotropy ratios.},

Pressure and global heat release fluctuation measurements carried out alongside these optical diagnostics revealed pronounced double peaks in both combustion noise and global heat release fluctuation spectra at global equivalence ratios of . Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of the chemiluminescence and OH-PLIF images revealed that the first peak in the noise spectra to be caused by flame oscillations over nearly the entire flame region, whereas the secondary peak was attributed to periodically generated vortical flame structures near the downstream side of the flame boundary.

A neodymium spherical permanent magnet, suspended by string and enclosed within a 65-mm-diameter spherical forebody, was used to generate the magnetic field. An accelerometer was attached to the rear of the magnet to measure streamwise motion, allowing the Lorentz force on the magnet to be deduced according to Newton’s second law. The stagnation point magnetic flux density was varied by changing the internal streamwise location of the magnet within the forebody. Experimental results demonstrate a linear increase in MHD drag with magnetic field strength, which is in agreement with previous results from arcjet facilities. However, the MHD drag force was much lower in these experiments, even after accounting for shock density ratio and viscosity differences. This discrepancy could be due to the different freestream state generated by the two types of facilities.},

The experiments were conducted as an essential precursor for scramjet drag reduction studies using a direct-connect scramjet combustor. The experiments were carried out at the University of Queensland T4 shock tunnel using a 33.2-mm-diam and 500-mm-long circular duct at flow stagnation enthalpies of 3.2 and . The experimental work was supported with two-dimensional and three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Comparisons between numerical and experimental results show initial rise in heat transfer at the first shock-wave boundary-layer interaction, followed by an unsteady laminar region interspersed with possible turbulent spots. Heat transfer measurements along the wall that show sustained transition to turbulence did not occur within the full length of the duct. Transition to turbulence within the circular duct is significantly delayed when compared with estimations based on flat-plate results. These results indicate that there is value in revisiting the assumption of a fully turbulent boundary layer for previous semi-direct-connect scramjet combustion experiments that have used transition length correlations derived from flat-plate experiments within the same facility. The findings from this investigation have implications for conclusions drawn from experimental investigations of boundary-layer-combustion-induced drag reduction in circular ducts.},

The geometry and flow conditions are selected to match relevant trajectory locations from the ascent phase of the HIFiRE-1 flight experiment, namely, a 7 deg half-angle cone with 2.5 mm nose radius, freestream Mach numbers in the range of 3.8–5.5, and freestream unit Reynolds numbers in the range of . Earlier research had shown that the onset of transition during the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation 1 (HIFiRE-1) flight experiment correlated with an amplification factor of for the planar Mack modes. However, to incorporate the -factor correlations into a CFD code, we investigate surrogate models for disturbance amplification that avoids the direct computation of stability characteristics. The results demonstrate that the application of the commonly used approach, which is based on a database of stability characteristics for locally similar profiles, leads to large, unacceptable errors in the predictions of amplification factors. We propose and demonstrate an alternate approach that employs the stability computations for a canonical set of blunt cone configurations to train a convolutional neural network model that is shown to provide substantially improved transition predictions. The excellent performance of the neural network model is also confirmed for cone configurations with nose radius and half-angle values outside of those used to build the database. Finally, the convolutional neural network model is found to outperform the linear stability calculations for underresolved basic states.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the consistency of an experimental dataset, i.e., whether the stated experimental conditions are consistent with the measurements provided. In case the dataset is inconsistent, our framework allows one to hypothesize and test sources of inconsistencies. This is crucial in model validation efforts. The framework relies on Bayesian inference to estimate experimental settings deemed uncertain, from measurements deemed accurate. The quality of the inferred variables is gauged by its ability to reproduce held-out experimental measurements. The correctness of the framework is tested on three double-cone experiments conducted in the Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center’s Large Energy National Shock Tunnel-I (LENS-I), which have also been numerically simulated successfully. Thereafter, the framework is used to investigate two double-cone experiments (executed in the LENS-XX), which have encountered difficulties when used in model validation exercises. An inconsistency is detected with one of the LENS-XX experiments. In addition, two causes are hypothesized for our inability to simulate LEXS-XX experiments accurately and are tested using our framework. It is found that there is no single cause that explains all the discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data, but different causes explain different discrepancies, to larger or smaller extent. This paper proposes that uncertainty quantification methods be used more widely to understand experiments and characterize facilities, and three different methods are cited to do so, the third of which is presented in this paper.},

A number of attempts by computational fluid dynamics modelers to reproduce the published results were unsuccessful in predicting the peak vibrational temperature, the downstream slope, or both. Our recent analysis has shown that some of the assumptions used in spectra-to-temperature conversions, such as the two-temperature approximation, are violated in the early region of the shock, and a more detailed analysis and direct comparison of UV absorption, and not temperatures, is necessary. This work presents such an analysis where a gas number density, translational temperature, and distribution of rotational and vibrational level populations, obtained using a kinetic gas dynamic approach, are converted into UV in-band absorption for each temporal or spatial location in the shock using a detailed spectroscopic model. The computed UV absorption is then directly compared with the raw measured time-dependent UV absorption curves at several wavelengths. Such a comparison is shown to have more validity than the previous ones.},

A sharp, unswept fin at a 15 deg angle of attack in Mach 2 flow generates a 45 deg oblique shock that interacts with the boundary layer on the tunnel floor. This type of SBLI has been extensively studied in quasi-two-dimensional representations, but no work up to this point has been done to capture true 3-D measurements. This work represents the first 3-D velocity field measurements in supersonic flow using plenoptic PIV, as well as the first 3-D velocity measurements of a fin-generated SBLI. Flow features including the -shock structure and slip region expected from this SBLI were able to be resolved, and the 3-D imaging allowed for better visualization of the overall flow topology. Plenoptic PIV enabled the visualization of features not considered in previous literature, particularly the 3-D curvature of the inviscid shock and effects from an expansion region emanating from the fin tip due to the finite fin height. Plenoptic PIV results are compared with inviscid shock theory and stereoscopic PIV for validation purposes.},

The current study presents experimental data on the response of cavity dynamics to the introduction of various store configurations mounted at different locations within the cavity. A rectangular cavity was subjected to Mach 2 flow at Reynolds numbers ranging from 4 to 16 million. Measurements were carried out inside the cavity and on the flow-facing surface of the store to capture the cavity acoustics and unsteady loading on the store. Results show that, with an increase in the Reynolds number, the magnitude of pressure fluctuations increases, whereas the frequency of dominant tones remains the same. In general, the presence of a store results in suppression in broadband noise, with amplification/suppression of different Rossiter modes. The location of the store with respect to the cavity shear layer plays an important role in the cavity acoustics. There is a strong correlation between the acoustic signatures measured at various locations in the cavity and on the store surface, indicating the global resonance.},

  abstract     = {A rectangular cavity with Mach 1.5 freestream was subjected to a large temporal variation in leading-edge blowing in order to experimentally investigate the effect on aerodynamic and aeroacoustic oscillation. Unsteady pressure data were obtained via pressure-sensitive paint and discrete pressure transducers. Comparison of baseline (without blowing) and continuous blowing conditions affirmed that leading-edge blowing greatly mitigates surface pressure fluctuations. Transient shutoff experiments showed that sharp increases in surface pressure fluctuations were well-related to the pressure response of the wake region downstream of the leading-edge slots. Moreover, a delay in the amplitude rise of mode 1 compared with mode 2 was found to be statistically significant. The reverse operation of transient blowing turn-on produced a nearly instantaneous decrease in pressure fluctuations, with modal amplitudes damping out over a short period of time. For both cases, variabilities from run to run existed and are likely linked to the condition of the cavity flow at the instance of impulsive flow control operation.},

  abstract     = {Counter-rotating open rotors (CRORs) have the potential to reduce environmental emissions thanks to their high propulsive efficiency. However, there are a number of concerns surrounding their acoustic emissions. This contribution presents a novel multiconfiguration CROR that offers considerable noise reductions. In particular, locking either the fore or aft rotor during takeoff is considered, with the running rotor providing the required thrust. During cruise, both rotors are operated to retain the high efficiency of the CROR. A coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational aeroacoustics analysis has shown the potential of this multiconfiguration concept to offer substantial noise reductions when compared to a baseline CROR. During a simulated constant-altitude flyover at takeoff conditions, reductions of 3.5 and 7.9 dBA have been demonstrated when either the fore or aft row is locked, respectively. Using the effective perceived noise level metric, this result corresponded to 7 and 12 Effective Perceived Noise Level (in Decibels), respectively, for the same flyover.},

Validation of the individual rotor is presented in both hovering and forward-flight configurations at low, moderate, and high Reynolds numbers.

When used in conjunction with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model with rotation/curvature correction, the new relations improve the CFD Reynolds normal stress predictions, as compared with the experiment. This improvement leads to better predictions of separated corner flow behavior across a wide range of angles of attack that were measured, somewhat beyond the original QCR effect. The model’s performance in a square duct, driven by turbulence-induced vortices, is slightly improved. The QCR remains fairly simple to program and compatible with other eddy-viscosity models.},

A transformation from relative to absolute reference frame captures the power transfer from pressure and skin-friction forces on aircraft surfaces to mechanisms in the flowfield. A unique flow-feature extraction procedure isolates these mechanisms into different regions including the jet-plume substructures as well as shocks and shear layers located externally to the jet. Featured is a novel shear-layer identification metric that captures both laminar and turbulent regions. The resulting energy balance is rearranged into a force decomposition formulation with contributions attributed to shocks, jets, lift-induced vortices, and the remaining wake. Boundary-layer ingestion is used to demonstrate the method where a potential for energy recovery factor is introduced and defines the amount of energy available at the trailing edge of an unpowered body. Computational fluid dynamics results of a fuselage suggest 10\% of its drag power is available for reuse. Computational fluid dynamics studies of a boundary-layer ingesting propulsor show local minima in power consumption at a given thrust split for particular combinations of fan pressure ratio and amount of boundary layer ingested. A noteworthy finding reveals significant contributions of volumetric pressure work, a term often neglected in previous work.},

The inclusion of electric components leads to a significant necessity for thermal management. A novel method is examined in this study, in which the heat to be dissipated from an aircraft can be transferred to the boundary layer formed on the wing surfaces of the aircraft and gain some performance benefits on the aerodynamic side. Two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics tools in the framework of design of experiment methods are used to analyze the plausibility of placing a heat exchanger on the wing surfaces from an aerodynamic perspective. The Reynolds number, angle of attack, heat exchanger location, and magnitude of heat flux are considered as the factors; and response surfaces are constructed to identify their effects on the aerodynamics of the surface-heated wing. The simulation results are also used to interpret the significant tendencies indicated by the response surfaces. At the lowest values of the heat flux, the angle of attack, and the Reynolds number, surface heating at the best locations produced a 2.5\% increase in the lift coefficient and a 1.6\% reduction in the drag coefficient.},

  abstract     = {The flow physics governing the shock-buffet phenomenon on swept wings remain disputed without an unequivocal description. Herein is a contribution to the ongoing discussion that addresses the inherent dynamics near the onset of unsteadiness, complementing experimental data of a large aircraft wing geometry with scale-resolving simulation. Specifically, delayed detached-eddy simulations are performed to reproduce the experiments with a Reynolds number of and a Mach number of 0.801, and they are analyzed using modal methods. Motivated by the recognized difficulty in simulating separating and reattaching shallow shear layers employing such techniques, the impact of two subgrid length-scale definitions are scrutinized. The simulations, using both the standard definition of maximum local spacing and a more recent vorticity-sensitive variant, are validated against experimental data from conventional steady and unsteady instrumentation and dynamic pressure-sensitive paint. Remarkable agreement is found between experiment and simulation when using the vorticity-sensitive definition, whereby dominant modal features extracted from surface pressures show striking similarity in describing localized pockets of shear-layer pulsation synchronized with an outboard-propagating shock oscillation. Identified modes from simulation cover broadband content centered at a Strouhal number of approximately 0.27, which is within the experimental frequency range characteristic for swept-wing shock buffet. Modes capturing an inboard-running lower-frequency shock unsteadiness centered at a Strouhal number of approximately 0.07 are exclusive to wind-tunnel conditions. Nevertheless, modal analysis succeeds in extracting key characteristics from such practical unsteady-flow datasets. It is anticipated that the current findings with help clarify these edge-of-the-envelope flow phenomena and ultimately inform shock-buffet delay and control strategies.},

It first explores the rich physics associated with these interactions, which show strong flowfield nonlinearities arising from the complex shock–boundary-layer interactions using CFD. In the transonic regime, most linear reduced-order models (ROMs) fail to reconstruct the unsteady global parameters such as the lift, moment, and drag coefficients and the unsteady distributive flow variables such as velocity, pressure, and skin friction coefficients on the airfoil or in the entire computational domain due to the nonlinear shock–gust interaction. As it is well known that a deep-learning framework creates several hypersurfaces to generate a nonlinear functional relationship between the gust or structural input and the unsteady flow variables, an algorithm is proposed to overcome the limitations of linear ROMs. This algorithm consists of two integral steps, namely, a dimensionality reduction where the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method based linear data compression approach is applied and the reduced state is trained using the LSTM based Recurrent Neural Network for the reconstruction of unsteady flow variables. The present work shows its potential for predicting transonic airfoil gust response and the aileron-buzz problem demonstrating several orders of computational benefit as compared to high-fidelity CFD.},

Several acceleration amplitudes and acceleration durations are maneuvered using a modified canonical kinematic equation at reduced pitch rates from 0.196 to 0.763. Comparisons between computational and theoretical data reveal that the formation of the starting vortex is determined by the acceleration amplitude scaled by the square of the convective time. The corresponding starting force coefficient that scales with the dimensionless acceleration amplitude is proportional to the acceleration angle , which decreases with increasing reduced pitch rate. The starting vortex, once formed at the trailing edge, is shed at the end of the acceleration period. The quasi-steady theory that includes only pitch motion as the strength of the dipolar sheet for apparent-mass flow can also yield an acceptable approximation to capture the apparent-mass force coefficient spike in acceleration.},

A globally oscillating flow whirls around the airfoil in the clockwise direction and stores energy in the triad of vortices. When the oscillating flow loses momentum and comes to an equilibrium, the energy stored in the triad of vortices reaches a threshold. Thus, the triad of vortices reverses the direction of rotation of the oscillating flow, gives it a pulse of energy to whirl in the anticlockwise direction, and starts a new disequilibrium. When the oscillating flow rotates in the clockwise direction (in the streamwise direction on the suction surface of the airfoil), it adds momentum to the boundary layer and helps it to remain attached, and vice versa. Consequently, the instantaneous flowfield switches between an attached phase and a separated phase in a periodic manner with some disturbed cycles.},

  abstract     = {Surrogate-based optimization has been used in aerodynamic shape optimization, but it has been limited due to the curse of dimensionality. Although a large number of variables are required for the shape parameterization, many of the shapes that the parameterization can produce are abnormal and do not add meaningful information to a surrogate model. To improve the efficiency of surrogate-based optimization, recent machine learning techniques are applied in this study to reduce the abnormality of both initial and infill samples. This paper proposes a new sampling method for airfoils and wings, which is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. This network is trained to learn the underlying features among the existing airfoils and is able to generate sample airfoils that are notably more realistic than those generated by other sampling methods. In addition, a discriminative model is developed based on convolutional neural networks. This model detects the geometric abnormality of airfoils or wing sections quickly without using expensive computational fluid dynamic models. These machine learning models are embedded in a surrogate-based aerodynamic optimization framework and perform aerodynamic shape optimization for airfoils and wings. The results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional methods, our proposed models can double the optimization efficiency.},

  abstract     = {A novel approach to reduce the peak lift and pitching moment on a plunging airfoil is investigated through force, moment, and velocity measurements. This approach, unlike previous investigations of delayed flow separation and leading-edge vortex suppression, uses forced separation through deployment of a minitab near the leading edge. The device can be activated for short time intervals during a gust encounter or unsteady maneuver at the expense of short-duration drag increase. Depending on the frequency and the amplitude of the wing motion and the mean angle of attack, roll-up of vorticity and the formation of a vortex can be delayed or even prevented. This change in the vortex dynamics provides effective lift and moment alleviation for post-stall angles of attack and for low reduced frequencies. In contrast, at low angles of attack, the separated shear layer may roll up for the manipulated flow, resulting in vortex shedding, and lift and nosedown pitching moment increase. These two distinct flow regimes cause decreased or increased lift force, with the most effective frequencies scaling with the reduced frequency. In contrast, the borderline between the two regions scales with the Strouhal number based on amplitude and, in particular, with the minimum effective angle of attack during the cycle. The transient response was studied by investigating impulsively started plunging oscillations. During the first cycle, lift reduction is achieved for all frequencies within the range tested.},

  abstract     = {The spectral proper orthogonal decomposition method, which extracts spatially and temporally coherent modes in stationary flowfields, is used in the current paper to analyze high-speed broadband chemiluminescence and shadowgraph videos taken the internal and external flowfields, respectively, of multiple pulsejet engine geometries. By comparing the modes of highest energies across geometric variations of tailpipe length as well as the presence or absence of a nozzle flare at the exit, we showcase features of notable, but hidden, combustion and fluid dynamic interest that help sustain the cyclic and unsteady operation. Two different vortical systems develop internally. The primary is a strong toroidal vortex caused by rapid reed valves’ closure at the headwall. The second is a shedding vortex, which is seen to tear itself apart from the primary vortex due to the inertia of the incoming fresh reactants. Based on the engine geometry, one of the two is shown to be a considerably stronger dynamic flow feature. In the exhaust, the presence of a diverging nozzle flare causes two distinct starting vortices. When the exhaust is just a straight tube, only one starting vortex is formed. We link this to the fluidic piston effect accompanying the Helmholtz resonance in these devices. Point-source pressure sensors are used to complement the information attained from the video analyses.},

The approach is incorporated into a computer code that provides an efficient means to assess the damage resistance of unidirectional composite laminates with a range of layup configurations and impact scenarios. It is envisioned that the developed approach will aid in early design and analysis of composite structures where sizing and layup decisions must be made, and evaluating the feasibility of a large number of laminate configurations using numerical approaches such as finite element analysis is prohibitively expensive in practice. Therefore, the goal of the modeling approach is to predict the impact damage size given the laminate configuration and impact scenario. The tool is designed to run quickly (less than 2 min) to allow a large number of design cases to be investigated. The results presented demonstrate that the model is capable of efficiently predicting low-velocity impact damage size, shape, and location within an acceptable accuracy suitable for preliminary design and analysis of composite structures.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes an automated approach to deform an analysis mesh applied to a computer-aided design (CAD) model in response to a change in the shape of the CAD model. The process has been used to overcome a key issue that occurs during the shape optimization process. It is an advance over existing techniques because it works even when the boundary topology of the CAD model changes during the shape change, which other approaches cannot generally accommodate. To achieve the deformation, an analysis topology representation is created for each model, such that there is a one-to-one mapping between the analysis topology representing the models before and after the shape change. Strategies are presented to parameterize the superset entities in the analysis topology that have no global mathematical definition. The surface mesh is deformed in a way that allows the underlying surface/edge parameterizations to change, and it is shown how the domain mesh can be updated based on the surface mesh deformation. If the models before and after shape change have the same genus, then a small dimensional change in the shape of the model will result in meshes with the same topology, even if the topology of the underlying CAD representation has changed. This is highly desirable when evaluating sensitivities to a design change during an optimization.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the dynamics of a pitching and heaving aeroelastic wing undergoing large-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations influenced by a vortical wake from an upstream rectangular cylinder bluff body. The results show that under certain conditions, the limit cycle is annihilated. The conditions in which annihilation occurs are dependent on the limit-cycle frequency, bluff-body shedding frequency, and the magnitude of the mass coupling in the system. The low mass coupling configuration shows that vortical disturbances on the wing cause minor amplitude modulation until the shedding frequency is within a critical distance of the third harmonic of the limit-cycle oscillation frequency. Within this band, the amplitude modulations grow such that the pitch amplitude varies by up to 10 deg. When the mass coupling is increased and when the shedding frequency is within a critical distance of the third harmonic, the limit cycle is annihilated and the system returns to equilibrium. The annihilation phenomenon is caused by the addition of strong aerodynamic coupling between the vortex wake and the wing, influencing the limit-cycle kinematics such that the limit-cycle returns to the equilibrium position. The paper discusses both the kinematic and aerodynamic behaviors of wake-influenced aeroelastic limit-cycle annihilation.},

The general positional perturbatory forces that bring about instability in the perturbed potential system are shown to include, as special cases, circulatory forces that do and that do not commute with the potential matrix. The condition on commutativity of matrices is quite stringent, and its removal has a significant effect on generalizing the conditions that lead to instability. The paper expands the generalized Merkin instability result to include more general, noncirculatory positional perturbations, and it eliminates restrictions imposed on the perturbations by commutation requirements. The structure of infinitesimal as well as finite perturbatory matrices that guarantee instability is obtained. Practical implications of the mathematical results to natural and engineered systems are given. It is pointed out that potential systems with two “nearly” equal frequencies of vibration are, in general, susceptible to instability, created by “small” perturbatory forces, where the terms nearly and small are quantified.},

The significance of aerothermal heating is evident in the nonlinear panel response: enhanced static deformations and frequency shifting are consistent with a temperature differential between the panel and its support structure, which induces compressive thermal strain and flexural softening. Time-domain and modal vibratory behavior are correlated to the SWBLI environment, and shear-layer reattachment near antinodes of certain mode shapes is identified as a source of enhanced panel excitation.

  abstract     = {Within a scramjet, the location of the shock train will change as the backpressure changes. When the shock train leading edge moves out from the entrance of the isolator, the engine usually goes into unstart. A precise shock train leading edge detection technique is indispensable for controlling the shock train within the isolator. In this Paper, a reconstruction-flowfield-based shock train leading edge detection method is proposed. A flowfield reconstruction model based on a convolutional neural network provides instantaneous flowfield structure, and then image processing is carried out on these flowfield images to obtain the shock train leading edge. A supersonic direct-connect wind tunnel was used to collect all the data, which were then postprocessed to train the convolutional neural network model. The trained model successfully reconstructed the flowfield structure based on the measured wall pressure, and the reconstruction effects under different pressure transducer arrangements were compared. The flowfield reconstruction model provides a richer information source for shock train leading edge detection, and the detection accuracy can be greatly improved. The proposed method was compared with the pressure ratio method and the pressure increase method, and the detection performance under different pressure transducer arrangements was examined.},

Streamwise and spanwise wall heat flux are compared to the experimental data that were obtained at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and the California Institute of Technology. In previous studies, there were concerns that portions of the flowfield were rarefied; however, after an in-depth analysis, we find the flowfield to be firmly in the continuum regime. Comparisons of heat flux at an instant of time in the simulations show good agreement with the experiments. However, averaged heat flux over a long period of time relative to the experimental test time are underpredicted and develop low-frequency periodic motion. To better understand the unsteadiness and three-dimensionality of the flowfield, we analyze the mass flux through a spanwise plane, and we perform sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition for the wall heat flux and midplane pressure. Finally, we analyze the effect of vibrational nonequilibrium on the flowfield. It is found that the flowfield dynamics vary with increasing enthalpy and Reynolds number. Furthermore, the flowfield is found to be three dimensional, unsteady, and asymmetric for all cases.},

  abstract     = {The boundary-layer receptivity of the second mode to a slow acoustic wave is investigated using direct numerical simulation for a Mach 6 flow over a blunt cone with the nose radius of 5.08 mm. The mean flow behind the shock can be divided into three layers: outer layer, entropy layer, and boundary layer. With the forcing of an acoustic wave, the excited disturbances at downstream locations close to the nose include the fast mode in the boundary layer and the disturbances in the entropy layer and outer layer. Direct numerical simulations show that the disturbance in the entropy layer actually plays a key role in exciting the second mode. The whole process of receptivity is found to follow a three-stage route. In the first stage, the fast mode is excited in the boundary layer. Although it has a dominant amplitude initially, it experiences a significant decay. In the second stage, it is overtaken by the disturbance in the entropy layer. In the third stage, the latter enters the boundary layer and excites the second mode near the lower branch, which is due to a different mechanism of synchronism.},

The influences of nose radius, angle of attack, and freestream density on the local nonequilibrium characteristics and body surface aerodynamics are investigated in detail. The numerical results show that both the nose radius and the angle of attack present significant influences on the local nonequilibrium effects. Furthermore, it is found that the inaccuracy of the NSF equations for predicting aerodynamics mainly results in the error of the axial force.

The setup is designed to be independent of gravity level and is tested succesfully both in normal gravity and in microgravity using drop tower experiments. The device is calibrated by a systematic study determining the size and frequency of bubble formation as a function of pressure and flow conditions. Results turn out to be virtually independent of gravity. Different regimes of operations are identified and described, and basic properties of the behavior of the bubbles inside the nucleation cavity are discussed. The slug flow downstream the crossflow is characterized and shows some differences depending on gravity. Finally, we illustrate the use of a controlled regular slug flow generated by our device by using it as an input of a serpentine heat exchanger. This emphasizes an important virtue of our method for practical applications, namely, the ability to separate the process of bubble formation from the actual heat exchange by phase transformation in the region of interest.},

  abstract     = {Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) are characterized by extremely high temperatures and pressures, with operating frequencies on the order of several kilohertz. This creates an environment that is challenging to implement research diagnostics. The two most common diagnostics implemented in RDEs operating at speeds capable of defining the detonation wave are dynamic pressure transducers and ion probes. In the case of dynamic pressure transducers, hardware cost and excessive temperatures often dictate remotely coupled transducers, such as a semi-infinite tube pressure configuration in order to improve survivability. Ion probes, on the other hand, are much more robust and can be installed directly within the combustion annulus. However, the information obtained by ion probes in RDEs has been largely qualitative, with their primary use being wave tracking for speed and directionality. This paper presents methodology for determining quantitative ion concentrations from raw ion probe current–voltage data, using known geometry and appropriate electrostatic probe theory. Data are presented from a combustion-driven shock tube, demonstrating applicability of various probe theories and providing comparisons with values determined from a Zeldovich–Neumann–Döring simulation using the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. Results are considered from the perspective of future implementation of a flush-mounted device within the combustion annulus of an RDE.},

The translational–vibrational energy exchange is evaluated using the Landau–Teller rate model. The full-field simulations reproduce the Drop test for Simplified Evaluation of Non-symmetrically Distributed sonic boom (D-SEND) #1, by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The computational results show that weak shock waves at a moderate relaxation time are dispersed, and the rise time occurs. A wave structure in one relaxing mode is classified according to the relaxation time. The effects of two relaxing modes are comparable to those obtained from a superposition of each mode. For a stratified atmosphere, the effects of vibrational relaxation at each altitude are similar to those for uniform atmospheres at the same altitudes. However, a wave structure does not monotonically change toward the ground, unlike the case of uniform atmosphere. Such a complex transition mechanism of wave structure in real atmospheric environments is clarified.},

In addition, the work reports on the parallel efficiency of the solver, which has been optimized through a multiconstraint domain decomposition algorithm available within the Metis 5.0 library. The reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of the approach are assessed by computing three test cases: the two-dimensional, laminar, chaotic flow around a square at ; and the implicit large-eddy simulation of the flow past a circular cylinder at and past a square cylinder at .

Here, the interoperability of several separately developed unstructured grid adaptation tools is verified using analytic functions and the Code Comparison Principle. Three analytic functions with different smoothness properties are adapted to show the impact of smoothness on implementation differences. A scalar advection-diffusion problem with an analytic solution that models a boundary layer is adapted to test individual grid adaptation components. While optimal asymptotic error convergence rates are achieved with many grid adaptation tool combinations for the scalar problems, the scalar problems also illustrate known differences in grid adaptation component implementations and a previously unknown interaction between components. Laminar flow over a delta wing is verified with multiple, independent grid adaptation procedures to show consistent convergence to fine-grid forces and pitching moment.

  abstract     = {Compressive sensing (CS) based fan noise mode detection methods have been developed recently by taking advantage of the fact that the fan noise sound field is usually dominated by a limited set of modes. It has been shown that the CS based methods require remarkably few measurements and can improve mode detection capability. However, the mode sparsity would be easily destroyed either due to strong noise interference or attenuation of spinning modes. In this Paper, a nonconvex CS method based on minimization algorithm is proposed for fan noise azimuthal mode detection. A series of numerical simulations shows that the new based CS method is more robust to measurement noise and can enhance the mode sparsity under background noise interference. In the case in which the background noise level is unknown, the new based CS method with level correction can successfully reconstruct the mode spectrum by using an underestimated noise level. Compared to the previous convex based CS method, the new based nonconvex CS method reduces the number of sensors and requires weaker constraints for sensor array, which is beneficial for optimal array design in practical tests. In addition, the new method can decrease the reconstruction error and improve the dynamic range. An experimental system is implemented to validate the new method. It is demonstrated that the new method can enhance the mode sparsity and improve the dynamic range by about 10 dB.},

This paper seeks to reduce the order of this model by identifying a reduced set of modes that best fit the output. A model selection algorithm from statistics and machine learning known as least angle regression (LARS) is adopted. LARS is modified to be complex-valued, and LARS is used to select DMD modes. The resulting algorithm is referred to as least angle regression for dynamic mode decomposition (LARS4DMD). Sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition (DMDSP), a popular mode-selection algorithm, serves as a benchmark for comparison. LARS4DMD has the advantage that the sparsity parameter required for DMDSP is not needed. Numerical results from a Poiseuille flow test problem show that LARS4DMD yields reduced-order models that have comparable performance to DMDSP. Use of the LARS4DMD algorithm on particle image velocimetry data of a rotating fin confirms this conclusion on experimental data. Results further suggest that LARS4DMD may be slightly more robust to noise in the experimental data.},

This paper specifically addresses the fusion of 1) noisy and in-complete fields from wind-tunnel measurements and 2) deterministic but biased fields from numerical simulations. These two data sources are fused in order to estimate the true field that best matches measured quantities that serve as the ground truth. For example, two sources of pressure fields about an aircraft are fused based on measured forces and moments from a wind-tunnel experiment. A fundamental challenge in this problem is that the true field is unknown and cannot be estimated with 100\% certainty. A Bayesian framework is employed to infer the true fields conditioned on measured quantities of interest; essentially a statistical correction to the data is performed. The fused data may then be used to construct more accurate surrogate models suitable for early stages of aerospace design. An extension of the proper orthogonal decomposition with constraints is also introduced to solve the same problem. Both methods are demonstrated on fusing the pressure distributions for flow past the RAE2822 airfoil and the Common Research Model wing at transonic conditions. Comparison of both methods reveals that the Bayesian method is more robust when data are scarce and capable of also accounting for uncertainties in the data. Furthermore, given adequate data, the proper-orthogonal-decomposition-based and Bayesian approaches lead to surprisingly similar results.},

Sinusoidal excitation had a relatively significant influence on the convectively unstable JICF at larger values, especially when the USL was locked-in to the forcing frequency, causing the jet cross section to become more symmetric and causing molecular mixing, quantified in both centerplane and cross-sectional planes, to improve. For a globally unstable JICF, only sinusoidal forcing corresponding to clear lock-in conditions, close to the fundamental shear-layer frequency and/or at very high amplitudes, affected jet structure, with somewhat moderate improvements in molecular mixing. Typically, excitation conditions creating enhanced jet penetration and spread did not correlate directly with improved molecular mixing; there was a stronger correlation of improved mixing with creation of a more symmetric jet cross section, in some cases with a counter-rotating vortex pair structure.},

  abstract     = {An investigation is carried out to evaluate how an external uniform stream affects turbulent-jet coherent structures. The presence of this uniform stream outside the jet represents the effect of forward flight on the velocity field. Coherent structures are modelled as wave packets, and the flight effect is studied using the parabolized stability equations (PSEs). Measurements of mean base flows and axial velocity fluctuations on the jet centerline at assumed flight conditions are described. The velocity fields were supplied to a PSE model to retrieve the wave packet signatures of axial velocity fluctuations. Overall results are in good agreement with experimental measurements. There is an observed increase in wave packet wavelengths and phase velocities (with respect to the nozzle) as flight velocity increases. Also, axial amplification rates are determined and show stabilization in the near-nozzle region, which is confirmed by experimental power spectral densities on the jet centerline. This tendency holds as the freestream velocity increases.},

  abstract     = {Ice formation on a wing poses a threat to aircraft safety because it changes the effective shape of the wing and considerably deteriorates the aerodynamic performance. The performance prediction of an iced airfoil requires an accurate turbulence model. In this Paper, a three-equation turbulence model for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation is developed to determine the stall behavior of iced airfoils. The model is implemented using a linear eddy viscosity transition model as a baseline and is modified to appropriately simulate complex flow phenomena such as laminar separation, shear layer transition, and turbulent reattachment. The model also takes the nonequilibrium characteristics of turbulence into account. Different airfoils, including clean airfoils and three types of iced airfoils (horn ice, streamwise ice, and spanwise-ridge ice), are numerically tested. The results indicate that the present model demonstrates engineering accuracy in terms of the stall behavior prediction and can be adapted in a wide range of ice shapes. The relative errors of the predicted maximum lift coefficients of the iced airfoils are about 5\% of the experimental values.},

The ice accretions cause massive flow separation above the slat, which results in a surface pressure plateau on the slat and further unloads the downstream wing elements. The above mentioned two ice shapes lead to lift decreases of 10.66 and 16.45\% and drag increases of 44.58 and 59.42\%, respectively. Ice-induced vortices first roll up due to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability above the slat with ice accretions, and the subsequent vortex pairing halves their characteristic motion frequency. The developed vortices, composed of multiscale structures, dominate the slat upper surface and are convected through the main element to aggravate the flow separation over the flap. Moreover, extremely strong acoustic resonance occurs in the iced slat cove, and its tonal frequencies are consistent with theoretical model predictions. These intense tones are believed to result from the elevated pressure fluctuations along the cavity free shear layer, which are in turn related to the propagation of the ice-induced pressure fluctuations from above the slat because their most dominant frequencies identified by proper orthogonal decomposition are nearly equal to the resonant frequencies.},

It is all the more true for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs), for which the six rigid-body motions of the floating platform can induce blade–wake interactions. Therefore conventional numerical approaches for wind turbine applications, such as Blade Element Momentum Theory, may be questionable for an accurate prediction of floating wind turbine aerodynamic loads. Consequently, the current paper investigates the aerodynamic behavior of an FOWT subjected to several idealized prescribed motions, representative of a wave movement, based on computational fluid dynamics simulations.

The LSC consists of two control loops. The inner loop employs a linear quadratic regulator capable of stabilizing the aircraft while controlling the shape of the half-wings independently from each other by artificially stiffening the structure. Structural dynamics can potentially be used in the design of the inner-loop regulator. The outer-loop design is based on rigid-body outputs. The outer loops for tracking velocity, heading, sideslip angle, and altitude are designed using nonsmooth optimization techniques. Numerical results show that structural feedback in the inner loop yields better regulation performance and reduced structural deformations. The autopilot is capable of attaining the commanded reference with low control energy while meeting the maneuver requirements and regulating the elastic deformations of the wing.},

Two blowing ratios (BRs), namely and 0.6, were implemented. In the case of , vortex shedding was significantly attenuated, and the frequencies of the most prominent peaks in the spectra of velocity fluctuations were considerably different along the span. Moreover, the subharmonic mode was found to be stronger behind the non-plasma-forming region compared to the plasma-forming region during forcing with . It also resulted in less drag compared to the unforced case. In the case of , the unsteadiness and the velocity defect in the wake increased compared to the unforced case.

It is found that the backward (toward downstream) traveling waves, inspired from aquatic swimmers, are more effective than forward traveling and standing wave actuations. The results of simulations show that a backward traveling wave with a reduced frequency (, where is frequency; , chord length; and , free flow velocity), a nondimensional wavelength (, where is dimensional wavelength), and a nondimensional amplitude (, where is dimensional amplitude) can suppress stall. In contrast, the flow over the airfoil with either standing or forward traveling wave actuations separates from the leading edge similar to the baseline. Consequently, the backward traveling wave creates the highest lift-to-drag ratio. For traveling waves at a higher amplitude , however, the shear layer becomes unstable from the actuation point and creates periodic coherent structures.

Experiments were carried out in the University of Maryland water towing facility to identify parameters in the modified GK model and to evaluate its ability to represent gust encounters of varying gust strengths. Using this gust-encounter model, an observer-based feedback controller for pitch actuation is constructed to regulate the coefficient of lift of a wing during a transverse gust encounter. Closed-loop control simulations provided pitching kinematics that mitigated the transient force response. Gust encounter experiments were performed using the control signal from simulation as an open-loop control signal during an encounter with a known gust. The lift force time histories of the gust encounter experiments with control show effective mitigation of the peak lift force. The wing experienced transient forces that merit further investigation, including an initial transient peak and a later undershoot that may be due to uncertainty in the start of the gust region.},

Linear analysis becomes inaccurate due to the flow separation at such conditions, thus requiring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, the computational expense associated with CFD simulations renders them impractical for analyzing a large number of gust responses. Kriging interpolation is a computationally efficient alternative. In this study, it facilitated the analysis of 2584 one-minus-cosine gust cases with varying mean angles of attack, gust-induced angles of attack, and gust lengths, performed outside the CFD environment, with the help of just 36 CFD simulations. The accuracy of the kriging-based aeroelastic gust analyses was indicated by the extensive validations presented here, and its limitations are also discussed. The results show that, at high angles of attack leading to incipient stall conditions, nonlinear gust responses are relatively lower than their counterparts obtained via linear analysis. However, this drop in the relative response changes drastically with gust length, and this behavior is significantly enhanced with an increase in the angle of attack. This indicates the importance of extensive high-fidelity gust analysis at high angles of attack for structural design applications.},

Despite being advantageous for design optimization, we have found that panel methods can predict nonphysical results for unconventional geometries. This paper presents robust methods to solve optimization problems using panel methods that are not susceptible to numerical errors. Important factors are highlighted with regard to choice in boundary conditions, induced drag calculation, wake modeling, and regularization. Two parameterization methods are introduced where wing geometry is defined locally by airfoils at discrete spanwise positions and regularized by filtering along the span. Such methods of defining the geometry locally enlarge the design space and allow the optimizer to converge to reliable designs. Results also suggest the following: 1) enforcing a Dirichlet boundary condition rather than a Neumann formulation provides significant cost savings in gradient calculations, 2) far-field force calculations should be adopted for optimization problems as numerical errors in surface pressure integration have a strong influence on the gradients, and 3) the additional design freedom of a B-spline parameterization can be disadvantageous as the low fidelity of the inviscid model cannot correctly capture aerodynamic properties of irregular airfoil geometries.},

  abstract     = {Local shape control methods, such as B-spline surfaces, are well-conditioned such that they allow high-fidelity design optimization; however, this comes at the cost of degraded optimization convergence rate as control fidelity is refined due to the resulting exponential increase in the size of the design space. Moreover, optimizations in higher-fidelity design spaces become ill-posed due to high-frequency shape components being insufficiently bounded; this can lead to nonsmooth and oscillatory geometries that are invalid in both physicality (shape) and discretization (mesh). This issue is addressed here by developing a geometrically meaningful constraint to reduce the effective degrees of freedom and improve the design space, thereby improving optimization convergence rate and final result. A new approach to shape control is presented using coordinate control to recover shape-relevant displacements and surface gradient constraints to ensure smooth and valid iterates. The new formulation transforms constraints directly onto design variables, and these bound the out-of-plane variations to ensure smooth shapes as well as the in-plane variations for mesh validity. Shape gradient constraints approximating a continuity condition are derived and demonstrated on a challenging test case: inviscid transonic drag minimization of a symmetric NACA0012 airfoil. Significantly, the regularized shape problem is shown to have an optimization convergence rate independent of both shape control fidelity and numerical mesh resolution, while still making use of increased control fidelity to achieve improved results. Consequently, a value of 1.6 drag counts is achieved on the test case, the lowest value achieved by any method.},

Examination of the instantaneous three-component velocity fields showed regions of flow where the streamwise velocity was momentarily driven all the way back to the step face. After the flow reaches the step, it is then directed along the step face in the spanwise direction, resulting in large regions of wall-normal vorticity . These large regions of vorticity are opposed by smaller regions of counter-rotating flow offset in the spanwise direction and were responsible for the spanwise variation of the reattattachment. The low-pass filtered streamwise velocity fields just above the lower wall showed significant spanwise oscillations with a mean wavelength of the streamwise low-pass filtered reattachment position of , consistent with previous studies at different Reynolds and Mach numbers. As the step geometry is homogeneous in the spanwise direction, this shows that this behavior is not the result of wall or edge effects, which is a conclusion that cannot easily be drawn from experimental studies with limited step-height-to-width ratios.},

The transition locations measured at nearly all test conditions with correlate well with a computed factor of , demonstrating the first successful stability-based transition criterion related to step excrescences. An explanation for this successful correlation is that the net destabilization due to the BFS is the dominant contributor to the resulting shift in the transition onset location. The effect of any additional receptivity near the BFS does not play an important role in determining the movement of the transition front.},

The problem presented in this paper is that the test values of pressure resistance are far from the theoretical values of spherical balls, which are made up of plain-weave fabrics. In this paper, the uniaxial tension in structural layers has been tested to certify the validity of the finite element analysis (FEA) models. A boundary condition that is suitable for airship envelope simulation analysis is also proposed here. Using the secondary development function of Abaqus, an FEA model of three-dimensional plain-weave fabric is then established to simulate the envelope inflation experiments. Finally, the stress behavior of the microstructure of plain-weave fabric is summarized, and several conclusions are obtained.},

Therefore, reduced-scale structures are often preferred for investigating buckling behavior. However, designing reduced-scale structures that are representative of the full-scale structure can be difficult. An analytical scaling methodology for compression-loaded sandwich composite cylindrical shells based on the nondimensionalization of the buckling equations is presented herein. The methodology was used to develop scaled configurations that show similar buckling responses to the full-scale baseline configuration. Finite element analysis results showed that both a baseline and a scaled configuration buckled similarly, when the nondimensional stiffness, defined as the ratio between the nondimensional load and nondimensional displacement, was matched between the different scale models. Limitations of the methodology are discussed and are believed to be a result of neglecting the flexural anisotropy and the transverse shear compliance. A preliminary material failure assessment for the different scales is also considered.},

Also determined are the locations of failure points and stress components significantly contributing to the failure, as well as the effects of uncertainties in values of material parameters on the failure load. The shell’s quasi-static and infinitesimal deformations are analyzed with a third-order shear and normal deformable plate/shell theory, in-plane stresses are found by using the plate theory deformations and transverse stresses using a one-step stress recovery scheme. The Tsai–Wu failure criteria, and honeybees inspired nest-site selection optimization algorithm are employed. Effects of uncertainties in material parameters are quantified by the Latin hypercube method and a statistical software, JMP. The predicted failure load and the failure point location agree well with their experimental values. It is observed that the first failure occurs in a core (facesheet) due to the transverse shear stress (in-plane transverse axial stress) exceeding its critical value. The methodology can be used to design the minimum weight optimal doubly curved multicore sandwich shells.},

The parametric equivalent stiffener model of the structure is derived by the smearing method, and the global and local buckling loads are calculated for the different grid configurations. The artificial bee colony algorithm was used as an optimizer to address the discrete design variable space, including a grid-unit size, height, and thickness of stiffeners that could be specified by designers or manufacturing requirements. Two test examples validated the effectiveness of the approach. The results suggested that both optimal and suboptimal solutions can be considered effectively as design options in the preliminary stage of design for such types of structures.},

Uncertainties are introduced on both the heat conduction and the structural response problems. In the latter, it is in particular shown that the purely structural terms of the ROM governing equations and those associated with the structural–thermal coupling should be randomized jointly. Moreover, this can be done through the construction of a large matrix that includes all of these terms and is shown to be symmetric and positive definite. Several challenges in applying this approach are identified and resolved. Finally, the applicability of the methodology is demonstrated on the response of a simple panel subjected to an oscillating heating flux as an example of strongly coupled thermal–structural problems.},

Results suggest that critical variables are the microphone sensitivity and positioning. Different microphone arrays are considered to reduce uncertainty levels. Also, it is observed that, in general, the Kumaresan–Tufts algorithm achieves better accuracy than the original Prony’s method.

This method is applied to minimize the compliance and tip displacement of a tapered and swept wing box subjected to aerodynamic loads. The wing box is modeled using 1.47 million isoparametric hexahedral elements, whereas the skin (which is nondesignable) is modeled using shell elements.

  abstract     = {Turbomachinery blisks have very low damping and, for this reason, they require devices such as ring dampers to mitigate excessive vibrations. Ring dampers rely on the relative motion between a ringlike component and the blisk to dissipate energy by means of friction. Damper effectiveness is typically low due to the absence of relative motion between the damper and the blisk. Tuned mass dampers can mitigate the low relative motion and can be particularly effective when the forcing is narrowband. Tuned mass dampers transfer vibration energy from the host structure to the damper, where this energy can be dissipated by friction. These two features are particularly useful when the host structure has very low damping and when there are stringent constraints on the position of the damper, as is the case for turbomachinery blisks. In this paper, a tuned vibration damper concept is explored. A cantilever beam is used to represent a blisk blade. The vibration reduction provided by the use of a tuned mass damper with contacts is studied both computationally and experimentally. Numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the model and to gain insight into the energy dissipation phenomena and the working principles of such dampers.},

This work exploits the stress mode shapes (SMSs) in local finite element (FE) refinement for the purpose of accurate dynamic stress estimation. Toward structural FE modeling, identification of critical locations via predominant SMSs is theoretically demonstrated. To pursue more accurate dynamic stress, a strategy for local FE refinement is proposed by using the information from stress modal analysis. The strategy involves a two-step procedure. First, modal participation factors (MPFs) are used to extract the predominant modes. Second, retained SMSs are evaluated for the local remeshing. Numerical simulations of a representative thin plate with geometric details were conducted. The SMSs were investigated in detail. Together with MPFs, SMSs can help to localize the dangerous stresses and then refine the local meshes to accurately calculate stress responses. By taking full advantage of numerically obtained SMSs, local structural FE modeling can be applied in a straightforward way with high efficiency. Results indicate that SMSs can reveal the underlying mechanism that governs the overall dynamic stress response.},

All layers of the sandwich cylinder are formulated based on the first-order shear deformation theory. Considering the von Karman strain displacement relations, the nonlinear equations of motion are derived through Hamilton’s principle. By separating the displacement components into previbration and vibration states and substituting in the obtained nonlinear equations of motion, the previbration equilibrium equations and vibration equations of motion are obtained. The acquired equations are solved by applying the generalized differential quadrature method. The method is validated by comparing the obtained results with those available in the literature. The effects of temperature, length-to-radius ratio, and radius-to-thickness ratio on the fundamental loss factor of sandwich cylindrical shells are examined at different boundary conditions. Also, variation of the fundamental loss factor of the sandwich shell with variation in the thickness of the constraining and core layers is investigated. The results show superior effect of the mode shape switching phenomenon on the fundamental mode loss factor variation. Temperature rise results in significant reduction of loss factor values. Depending on boundary conditions, the length ratios at which mode shape switching occurs may remain constant or change with increasing the temperature.

  abstract     = {This Paper addresses a two-step computational approach to building a robust modeling environment for the titanium–aluminum alloy, Ti-7Al, a candidate aerospace material owing to superior mechanical performance under high stresses. To be used in aerospace applications, the large deformation behavior of the alloy should be investigated with a high-fidelity crystal plasticity model. However, there is no universal agreement on the crystal plasticity parameters, and previous efforts are only based on deterministic techniques. Therefore, our goal is to build a crystal plasticity model for Ti-7Al, which is validated for the global (component-scale) and local (grain-level) features by considering the experimental uncertainty. In the first step, the lower and upper bounds of the crystal plasticity parameters are determined with an inverse problem that is solved to match the computations with the experimental stress-strain data. The second step validates the local features by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between the simulated and experimental microstructural textures. The optimization is performed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN-)based surrogate model that is trained within the lower and upper limits of the parameters obtained in the first step. The outcomes of the two-step approach demonstrate significant improvement over the previous deterministic solutions.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear reduced-order models are being investigated for use as digital twins for advanced aircraft and spacecraft. In concept, the digital twin would be tuned to accurately describe the behavior of the vehicle, and then it would be updated as the vehicle is modified or ages. Unfortunately, the linear model correlation and validation techniques that are commonly used in the aerospace industry are not valid for nonlinear models, so a new set of tools is needed. This work presents an algorithm to update geometrically nonlinear reduced-order models using nonlinear normal modes as a correlation metric. The nonlinear normal modes serve as a strong metric to correlate the numerical models because they can be extracted from experiments, and they describe the dynamics of the nonlinear system over a range of amplitudes and are independent of the loading applied to the system. This paper presents a novel method of computing analytical gradients of nonlinear normal mode solutions with respect to system parameters using the multiharmonic balance method. The procedure is first tested using numerical simulations and then applied to tune the reduced-order model of a curved beam based on nominal blueprints and idealized boundary conditions to match a nonlinear normal mode that has been measured experimentally from a three-dimensional printed test specimen.},

  abstract     = {A focused laser can cause optical breakdown of a gas, forming a plasma kernel that expands rapidly and, under certain conditions, ejects hot gas along the laser axis to distances several times the kernel size. Whether this ejection occurs and its intensity and direction depend on the breakdown parameters and can affect subsequent flame growth in combustible mixtures. One approach to alter, and potentially control, the character of this ejection is a dual-pulse configuration. Detailed simulations are used to study the post-breakdown hydrodynamics in an inert gas, which reproduce key experimental observations. In the first configuration analyzed, a weak pulse disrupts vorticity generation by a stronger pulse, suppressing the ejection that would have been produced by the stronger one alone. In a second configuration, we show that adjusting temporal and spatial separation can access a broader range of phenomenologies in which the ejections can be suppressed, enhanced, or even reversed.},

High-speed high-resolution schlieren images visualize the shock dynamics downstream of the nozzle. The flow dynamics during one full PDC cycle is examined via high-speed particle image velocimetry. A well-suited solid tracer particle for supersonic reactive flow is determined in a preliminary study to minimize the PIV measurement error. The investigated operating conditions of the PDC differ in fill fraction, which is the percentage of the tube filled with a reactive mixture. With increasing fill fraction, the flow features grow in size and strength as the propagation velocity of the leading shock increases. The blowdown process of the PDC is characterized by several exhaust and suction phases. An increase in the fill fraction results in a stronger first exhaust phase, whereas the subsequent suction and exhaust phases remain almost unaffected.},

Based on these formulations, three methods are proposed that use linear interpolation (lerp) or an artificial neural network (ANN) for their flamelet tables: form1-ann, form2-lerp, and form2-ann. First, it will be shown that the accuracy of the ANN in the proposed form1-ann and form2-ann methods is sufficient for numerical simulations. Then, to evaluate the form2-lerp and form2-ann methods and show that they can greatly improve the computational performance of the conventional method, numerical simulations will be conducted for the scramjet test-engine combustor of the German Aerospace Center, DLR. The calculation time of the form2-lerp method is reduced by about 0.878 times, and the memory usage is increased by about 2.97 times compared with the values for the conventional method.

  abstract     = {To expand the selection of preassigned shock surfaces, a new inverse design method called the local-turning osculating cones method has been proposed for waverider design. The new method discretizes the three-dimensional preassigned shock surface into a multitude of stream surfaces, which are composed of multiple local osculating planes. The flowfield within each stream surface is computed on the same fictional meridian plane based on a new schematic of method of characteristics. In this way, the constraint of obligating the streamline initiating from the discrete leading edge point to flow within the same osculating plane is removed. Two types of shock waves with distinct three-dimensional characteristics are specified as input to demonstrate the validity of the new proposed method. At the same time, two typical waveriders, which are not easily generated by the past waverider design methods, are derived and validated by the inviscid computational fluid dynamics simulation (Euler code). The results indicate that waveriders based on the new method can successfully reproduce the preassigned shock waves and the original flowfields with errors less than 2\%. Thus, the local-turning osculating cones method offers a far-improved capability to design waveriders, and it is favorable for hypersonic airframe propulsion integration.},

The experiments were conducted in the T4 shock tunnel using a scramjet model. Experimental data were obtained by focusing a laser beam into the combustor and exciting the OH radical. A detailed numerical model that simulates all radiative and collisional processes of relevance with the appropriate system of differential equations was developed for the analysis of the influence of energy transfer processes on the fluorescence signal. The population distributions achieved with numerical modeling of the LIF process validated the approach proposed to deduce temperatures. By evaluating the scramjet LIF spectra with a full spectral fit, a temperature distribution across the combustor width was obtained.

This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made. Although the LES is not run at the exact same conditions as the aircraft and does not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field, differences between noise production mechanisms observed in the LES may describe some of the spatiospectral lobe phenomena observed in the measurements of the F-35.},

The objective is to identify and quantify precisely the noise reduction achieved by reducing the blade span. The Batchelor vortex model is primarily considered as it accounts for the axial velocity deficit observed in the core of realistic tip vortices. Separated simulations were also carried out for a Lamb–Oseen vortex and a purely axial velocity deficit to highlight and quantify the influence of the vortex velocity components on the interaction as well as to balance design optimizations performed relying on methods not able to model viscous effects. The analysis of the blade aerodynamic and acoustic responses shows that the magnitude of the thrust fluctuation and radiated noise are always higher for a Batchelor vortex than for a Lamb–Oseen vortex when the vortex core impinges below the blade tip. For both vortex models, the thrust fluctuation and radiated noise reach their peak for an interaction close to the blade tip. They decrease slowly as the vortex impingement moves inward the blade and decrease strongly as the vortex passes above the tip. Finally, the noise directivity pattern is dipolar for the interaction close to or above the blade tip and becomes more and more quadrupolar as the radius of the interaction moves toward the blade root.},

  abstract     = {Traditional acoustic liners used in damping sound in aircraft applications consist of a porous face sheet, honeycomb core, and solid backing. Experiments have observed that, under conditions of high tonal sound levels, there occurs a dramatic increase in the viscous drag in the turbulent boundary layers over these surfaces. The mechanism for this increase in drag is the topic of interest. This involves experiments on a series of acoustic liners with fabricated porous sheets having a range of hole diameters, spacing, and patterns. The hole spacing spanned a range of viscous spanwise length scales from . The boundary-layer measurements include mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, velocity spectra, and turbulence burst, ejection, and sweep statistics based on the variable interval time-averaging and -quadrant methods. Coupled with this are direct drag measurements of the acoustic liners. The results show a dramatic increase in drag at frequencies near acoustic resonance and at high sound levels. This is presumed to be driven by net zero mass jets emanating from the porous sheets. For the experimental data available, the largest increase in drag is observed for the smaller spanwise distance between perforations, which is comparable to the typical spanwise wavelength of wall streak structures in turbulent boundary layers. The increase in drag is correlated with an increase in the turbulence wall layer burst and ejection events.},

  abstract     = {A novel actuator concept is evaluated in a series of active flow control experiments on a resonant high-speed cavity flow. The actuator generates pulsed supersonic microjets by using the resonance of an impinging microjet source, and with smart materials incorporated into its design, the actuator’s resonant frequency can be actively controlled. The actuator was designed such that its resonant frequency would lie within the range of predicted cavity resonance. Results from Mach 1.5 flow over a cavity of length are presented, and the actuator’s performance is evaluated across three modes of operation: pulsed, active pulsed, and steady. In the active pulsed mode, the smart materials are used to actively vary the actuator’s resonant frequency, enabling frequency modulation of the actuator’s output. When the actuator operates in both pulsed modes, the amplitude of the dominant peak in the cavity’s unsteady pressure spectra is reduced by as much as 7 dB. However, steady microjet injection yields more effective control. The dominant peak is substantially attenuated (by 25 dB) in this mode of operation. The effectiveness of the steady mode is attributed to higher momentum flux that can be attained in contrast to the pulsed modes of operation.},

  abstract     = {The dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD) plasma actuator is a popular technology for active flow control; however, the influence of the heat generated by the actuator on its performance is seldom mentioned. In this work, an experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the interaction between spontaneous heat generation and the performance of an alternating-current DBD (AC-DBD) plasma actuator. The characteristics of the AC-DBD plasma actuator are examined temporally in quiescent air, including the profile of the induced flow, capacitance properties, power consumption, plasma light emission, and surface temperature. The particle image velocimetry shows that the velocity profile of the induced flow increases temporally, indicating enhanced momentum injection by the AC-DBD plasma actuator. The capacitance, power consumption, plasma brightness, and surface temperature increase with the operation time analogously to exponential curves , and the values of these properties are proportional to 3.5 power of the applied voltage. The dielectric surface is categorized into three typical streamwise regions according to the heat generation characteristics: the plasma region, the insulated electrode region, and the far-field region. The dominant heat generation occurs in the plasma region due to the plasma discharge. The temperature increase of the local dielectric and the gas–plasma mixture enlarges the actuator capacitance, benefits the local induced electric field, and results in longer mean free paths of particles and stronger discharges accordingly. Thus, the spontaneous heat generation affects the induced ionic wind, and the performance of the AC-DBD plasma actuator is time dependent during the early period of the operation.},

The airfoil model was placed at the end of a rotating arm and moved at four velocities (30, 40, 50, and ). Three different regions of the shoulder were tested. Droplet deformation and trajectories are presented. Droplets evolve as a conjunction of two half-oblate spheroids that tilt as the model approaches. The tilting is larger in the higher regions of the shoulder. The trajectory model derived for droplet in the stagnation line of a moving airfoil has been formally derived for the shoulder region and applied to the experimental data, showing very good agreement being the mean discrepancy less than 4\% for the trajectory and 10\% for the deformation.},

An experimental campaign has been performed comprising two round, unheated air flows: a central jet at Mach number equal to 0.6 surrounded by a slower flight flow. Constant-temperature hot-wire anemometry was used to measure both the axial and radial velocity fluctuations within the turbulent jet flowfield. A Mach 0.6 jet was discharged into the flight flow, which ranged from zero up to Mach 0.3. The data show that the degree to which the jet stretches with increasing flight velocity can be discerned with the knowledge of the decay of the mean velocity field downstream of the end of the jet’s potential core. This stretching factor can then be used to predict the changes in the static jet turbulence statistics for the in-flight case. Additionally, in the region of high-turbulence kinetic energy, the two-point statistics can be estimated using information about the single-point statistics and the local mean velocity. Empirical models for the in-flight jet’s shear stresses, cross-correlations, and power spectral density functions are presented and compared with those derived for the static jet case.},

This expression leads to analytical expressions for the sensitivity coefficients of the anemometer output to velocity, density, pressure, and total-temperature fluctuations. The previously claimed equality of the velocity and density sensitivity coefficients in compressible subsonic flows is strongly contradicted by the present analysis and experimental data, which show that, under certain subsonic conditions, the velocity sensitivity decreases dramatically and even vanishes, whereas the density sensitivity retains relatively large values. Finally, a practical expression for the error in the velocity variance estimated from the hot-wire voltage fluctuations by neglecting pressure and total-temperature fluctuations has been derived. When evaluated for the present sensors, the error bound is found to become large, especially for Mach numbers near 0.8.},

First, an integrated expression is given to describe wall pressure fluctuations in different situations, and a conventional phase array technique is employed to identify the wave numbers of the wall pressure fluctuations and noise. Then, the pressure fluctuations are separated from the noise by a modified subsection approaching method. To improve the resolution of the low-frequency noise, an accelerated focusing method is developed and used in this paper. A variable spacing array design is proposed to improve the calculation accuracy of the broadband pressure fluctuation separation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to fix the error range of the noise wave numbers in which the pressure fluctuation and noise calculation converges to the actual value.

In the current study, a unified form of law of the wall is proposed for the mean streamwise velocity in the turbulent boundary layer with zero pressure gradient. From the physical perspective, the improved form of the law is capable of reflecting the actual weight variations between the molecular viscosity and the turbulence-eddy viscosity in the viscous, transition, and logarithmic sublayers. In the viscous sublayer, a variety of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, including 19 groups, are used to examine the proposed law. In the transition and logarithmic sublayers, 19 groups of canonical DNS velocity profiles and 14 groups of reliable experimental data are used to confirm the applicability and accuracy of the present formula under a wider ranges of Reynolds numbers. The local and maximum relative errors are given and analyzed in detail. The results show that the improved form of the law is sufficiently accurate to represent the mean streamwise velocities in the viscous, transition, and logarithmic sublayers.

  abstract     = {Turbulent flow is ubiquitous in nature and also has wide industrial applications. The direct observation of turbulent flow can help us to gain the fundamental insights of its physics. However, the experimental measurement of complete velocity fields in real time with high spatial and temporal resolutions is difficult due to the limitations of sensors and sensing techniques, such as sensor accessibility and sampling rate. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to reduce the number of sensors and amount of data collection to monitor temperature distributions with a very high compression ratio. In this Paper, the PBCS mechanism for monitoring turbulent flow is formulated. By recovering the boundary conditions in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations from some limited velocity measurements, the complete velocity field is reconstructed from the model. The application of PBCS to the steady-state turbulent flow is demonstrated and validated with experimental data of direct measurements.},

The elastic axis is fixed at . The airspeed is varied over a range of Reynolds numbers extending from to . For experiments in 2DOFs, the stiffness in pitch is kept constant, whereas the heave stiffness is changed to cover a range of frequency ratios, . Except for cases with frequency ratios close to one, the introduction of the DOF in heave does not significantly affect the LCO dynamics. It is determined that the stall flutter observed is fundamentally a 1DOF problem in pitch, whereby the pitch motion drives the heave motion.

These objectives were achieved through a combination of time-resolved particle image velocimetry and spectral analysis using empirical mode decomposition. Using spectral analysis, the velocity fluctuations near the leading edge were observed to be in an amplified state during the initial ejection of vortical structures. During this amplified phase, the most dominant velocity fluctuation modes were associated with displacement-thickness-based Strouhal numbers between and . The variation in the frequency of the dominant fluctuation modes was also analyzed as a function of the angle of attack.

  abstract     = {To achieve high-precision shape control of antenna reflectors in the presence of model errors, an adaptive shape control method based on the feedback error learning algorithm is proposed. First, the finite element model of a planar hexagonal reflector with 30 piezoelectric actuators is established, by which the influence coefficient matrix is derived. Second, the feedback error learning method is developed, and it can iteratively modify the inverse model of the reflector system through online learning, thus avoiding the effect of model errors on shape control precision. An adaptive step size adjustment strategy for the method is proposed to improve the convergence precision and speed. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed method is intensively studied in comparison with the traditional influence coefficient matrix method by numerical simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a fairly high precision for all kinds of model errors, whereas the model errors will greatly reduce the precision of the influence coefficient matrix method. The adaptive step size adjustment strategy can greatly improve the convergence precision and speed. Finally, experimental results further verified the above conclusions, which prove the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method for the high-precision shape control.},

  abstract     = {Spacecraft with large arrays sometimes have deployed sizes that are much larger than the launch volumes; in this case, deployable arrays are used. Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Because of their higher aerodynamic efficiency and lighter structural weight, thin composite wings with large aspect ratios are increasingly being used for civil transport aircraft wing design. However, the increased flexibility can induce several performance issues, such as high deflections, reduced control authority, coupled flight dynamics, and, possibly, a reduction in the flutter speed. Therefore, including control surface and control law design at the conceptual design stage is becoming increasingly important. This paper presents a novel approach for integrating a control objective into an aircraft design optimization at the conceptual design stage by proposing the use of the eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian to enhance the controllability of an aircraft. The individual eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian quantify the energy required to move along the corresponding eigenvector, which is observed to be dominated by one state-space variable. A higher eigenvalue implies lower energy requirements for controlling that eigenvector, thus the corresponding state-space variable. This approach does not rely on a control law design but on modifying the open-loop system such that it is easier to control. The approach is applied to conduct multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) of a composite flying-wing test aircraft. A previously developed MDAO framework is used to design the internal structural layout, using curvilinear spars and ribs (SpaRibs) and straight spars and ribs. It is found that the optimal control designs have up to 8\% higher flutter speed with a 3.7\% weight penalty. Moreover, the frequencies of the vibration mode shapes are higher for the optimal control designs. The active flutter suppression controllers are designed after the MDAO process, and it is found that the optimal control designs have significantly higher gain and phase margins. As a result, the optimal control designs yield higher robust closed-loop flutter speed as compared with the weight-minimized design.},

Carbon nanotubes are reinforced into the matrix phase through uniform or functionally graded distributions. The material properties of the constituents are assumed to be temperature dependent, and the effective properties of the nanocomposite are estimated by an extended rule of mixture. Two temperature conditions and various situations of mechanical loads are considered. Basic equations are established within the framework of the classical shell theory taking into account the geometrical nonlinearity and surrounding medium-shell interaction. Multiterm solutions of deflection and stress function are assumed to satisfy simply supported boundary conditions, and the Galerkin method is applied to obtain nonlinear load-deflection relations from which buckling loads and postbuckling paths are determined. Numerical examples are carried out, interesting discussions are given, and beneficial and deteriorative effects of various factors are analyzed.},

Unlike the previous methods of predicting one- and two-dimensional structures displacements using simplified conditions, this paper presents a set of technical schemes and operational procedures for measuring strains in any direction on complex three-dimensional structure to reconstruct three-dimensional displacement field. First, a general strain–displacement transformation equation is derived and proposed for a complex three-dimensional structure in any direction. Second, an extended order method and a point selection strategy are proposed in order to make better use of measurement information and improve accuracy. We construct an optimization model and determine the optimal number of measurement points and modal order by using high-performance simulated annealing (HP-SA) algorithm. Next, we build an experimental system and select a specific complex three-dimensional structure to verify our work. Finally, we validate and discuss the theory proposed in this Paper with experimental data, and verify the reconstruction accuracy. After eliminating the factors of the system error, the relative error can be controlled in an ideal range of 2–5\%.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the derivation and application of the modal rotations method (MRM), a novel framework for the computation of large deformations of complex wing-like structures using a modal approach. The method targets static analyses of slender structures, accounting for large-deformation nonlinearity. The input for the analysis is linear modal finite-element-based data. However, the MRM uses modal rotation data, rather than deformation modes. The modal rotations are used for the solution of the nonlinear kinematic problem along with an iterative load-correction procedure that accounts for the geometric stiffening. The method is suitable for cases where the generation of an equivalent beam model is impossible or requires considerable effort, such as structures of multiple different sections, structures having abrupt geometrical changes, and lattice structures. The MRM is verified with three test cases. The first is a simple geometry, a one-dimensional symmetric beam loaded in one plane. The second and third test cases are three-dimensional built-up structures aimed to challenge the method with abrupt geometric changes, orthotropic material coupling, and nontrivial geometries. All test cases yield accurate results compared with nonlinear finite element analyses. Parametric studies present the dependency of the results on different computational parameters and the load magnitude.},

Morphing trailing edge devices are promising candidates for reducing loads in variable wind conditions and turbulent flows as well as capable of changing the shape rapidly. The application of multistable laminates allows large deformations with modest actuation demand, without the need for a continuous supply of energy. They can undergo snap-through with the help of Macro Fiber Composites actuator patches. A rectangular multistable plate is designed with the optimal location of actuators, aiming at two-way snap-through without the loss of bistability. A multi-objective derivative-free optimization scheme is used to minimize the snap-through voltages and maximize the out-of-plane displacements. The designed multistable plates with actuators are embedded at a suitable location of the morphing trailing edge flap. As the multistable plates snap, the flap deflects to a new position. The mechanism of the new morphing concept is simulated and analyzed with finite element tools.},

This paper’s objective is twofold: first, to investigate if a quasi-LPV model does accurately replicate the physical behavior of a large-caliber spin-stabilized projectile in free flight; second, to verify if the available embedded sensors data could be used to determine nonidentifiability of uncertain model parameters. To investigate these prospects, a permutation-based global sensitivity analysis is employed. The proposed study has highlighted the nonidentifiable parameters of the model, during either the whole flight or some periods of it.

However, insufficient samples are frequently encountered especially in composite materials. Four characterization methods for sparsely sampled quantities (SSQs) were discussed in the current study, including extreme value (EV) interval, tolerance interval (TI), optimized kernel density estimation (KDE), and the Dempster–Shafer (D-S) theory. Two different problems, a Sandia challenge function and a constitutive model for C/SiC composites, are considered for method evaluations. Performances of different methods are evaluated regarding reliabilities and errors in the output quantity derived with the uncertainty propagation. A manufactured solution method is employed. Results show that the TI, KDE, and D-S methods converge to the true distribution with increasing samples, whereas the EV method tends to expand the uncertainties. Under small samples , the TI method exhibits the highest reliability, and the KDE method exhibits the smallest error. Under extremely small samples the D-S method offers a balance between reliability and error. The TI method can apply well in the constitutive model for the characterization of material uncertainties, where failure is of high consequence and conservatism is emphasized. The obtained results are general and can be employed in the future material characterization with experimental data.},

Notably, most current studies are limited to monodisperse suspensions with only one particle size. In this study, the rich aluminum particle–air detonation with two particle size distributions (namely, the monodisperse and the polydisperse with log-normal particle size distribution) is numerically studied by using the Eulerian–Lagrangian method along with a new hybrid aluminum combustion model. Significant discrepancies of the one-dimensional detonation front structures are observed between the monodisperse detonation and the polydisperse counterpart. And, the physical mechanisms of these discrepancies have been revealed by decoupling the gas–particles interactions with the one-dimensional flow theory. It is mainly caused by the different timings of the particle phase transition processes and the consequently different heat transfer characteristics, which are the effects of multiple timescales and length scales in the polydisperse detonation. Furthermore, owing to the wider reaction zones of polydisperse detonations than that of the monodisperse counterpart, discrepancies of two-dimensional detonation cell sizes are observed as well. This study reveals the great importance of considering particle size distribution in heterogeneous detonation simulations.},

The eigenfrequencies of the first longitudinal mode, the second longitudinal mode, and the first azimuthal mode are examined. The results show that the radial modal coupling is crucial to the prediction of the stability. It is also found that the absorption of the perforated liners is directly determined by the integrated effect of the local fluctuating pressure differences across the perforated plates. The integrated effect is influenced by both the position and length of the perforated liners. Effective control is achieved when the liners are placed at the pressure antinode of the combustion chamber, whereas ineffective control is achieved when they are placed at the pressure node of the combustion chamber. Also compared is the effectiveness of the outer and inner liners, and it is found that it is essential to consider the coupled system of the two liners when checking the overall control effects.},

The shock structure and supersonic jet were observed to be dominated by low-frequency fluctuations (500–1500 Hz).

  abstract     = {Interaction of a shock wave with turbulence can generate large thermodynamic fluctuations in a flow. This can lead to enhanced mixing, peak heat transfer, and high sound level. The canonical interaction of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with a nominally normal shock wave acts as a model problem to investigate physics and develop predictive models. The case of purely vortical turbulence upstream of the shock is arguably the most fundamental case, and it is the focus of the current work. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) data and linear interaction analysis (LIA) are used to develop a predictive model for the thermodynamic field. Specifically, transport-equation-based models are proposed for the variances in temperature, pressure, density, and entropy. The jump in the thermodynamic variances is modeled in terms of the mean compression at the shock, and the closure coefficients are obtained via Kovásznay mode decomposition. By comparison, the downstream decay is modeled in a phenomenological way in terms of acoustic transient near the shock and a far-field decay due to viscous dissipation. The model predictions are found to match well with available DNS data for a range of shock strengths. In addition, the closed-form solution of the model equations gives the scaling of the thermodynamic fluctuations with mean flow Mach number.},

The flow is assessed using an array of fast-response pressure transducers in conjunction with a high-repetition rate particle image velocimetry system. Development of the mean flow structures early in each interaction is observed to be consistent with the free interaction concept. Unsteady wall-pressure energy content at frequencies above those associated with the characteristic low-frequency shock motion also shows significant similarities in the vicinity of the shock foot. Results confirm that this low-frequency peak is not associated with a narrow-band forcing mechanism from either upstream or downstream, but rather a characteristic frequency that varies with interaction strength, which describes the flow’s dynamic response. These findings support various models published in the literature that have sought to explain the source of low-frequency unsteady shock motion.},

(“Application of Wall Models to Discontinuous Galerkin LES,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 29, No. 8, 2017, Paper 085111) under the FR framework. In addition, the influence of the mesh growth ratio in the wall-normal direction and the mesh resolutions in the wall-parallel directions are investigated, as well as the size of the first element in the wall-normal direction. In the present wall model, the wall shear stress is computed according to the wall tangential velocity at the interface between the first and second cells from the wall. The stress is then used to update the solution unknowns. Various strategies are evaluated using a turbulent channel flow at a high Reynolds number. A comparison between a wall-modeled LES and implicit LES (ILES) without a wall model on a coarse mesh shows that the wall-modeled approach produces better results than the ILES. The wall model is then evaluated with the two-dimensional periodic hill problem to assess its capability of capturing flow separation and reattachment. The equilibrium wall model fails to capture turbulent flow separation and reattachment, indicating the need for nonequilibrium wall models for such problems.},

Comparisons are made between the results of impedance eductions with uniform flow and the Ingard–Myers boundary condition, with the one-dimensional (1D) linearized Euler equations and with the two-dimensional (2D) linearized Euler equations, that is, in the cross section. Both numerical synthetic data and experimental data are used for the eduction of two sample liners, with bulk Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 0.3, and at frequencies ranging from 400 to 3000 Hz.

  abstract     = {Counter-rotating open rotors (CRORs) are known to have advantageous propulsive efficiency properties but, at the same time, many noise emission issues related to this technology still need to be investigated. The noise they generate consists of tonal and broadband components, of which the tonal components often appear in narrow frequency bands with large amplitudes. During beamforming investigations, this often makes sorting them out from among other noise sources in the same frequency bin rather straightforward. On the other hand, the broadband noise sources can be characterized as having small amplitudes: in general, they are not the dominant noise sources in many frequency bins; but, overall, a significant noise component that needs to be investigated. The literature has provided a single microphone signal preprocessing method for removing the tonal components, hence isolating the broadband noise of a CROR: the signal of which has been shown to be appropriate for the investigation of broadband spectra. In this paper, this preprocessing method is further developed into a beamforming method that can be used in order to localize the broadband noise sources of CRORs. The resulting beamforming maps have been compared to the results of earlier broadband noise CROR studies, showing the validity of the new method and the advantages of using it as compared to methods used in other investigations.},

A numerical solution, based on a Galerkin projection and an efficient method for the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem, is compared with analytical approximations for low and high frequencies. A collection of results is presented and discussed. Modal wave numbers are traced in the complex plane for varying impedance, showing the usual regular modes and surface waves. A study of a vanishing boundary layer (the Ingard limit) showed that, in contrast to the smoothly converging acoustic modes and downstream running acoustic surface wave, the convergence of the other surface waves is numerically more difficult. Effects of (transverse) turning points and exponential decay are discussed. Especially the occurrence of modes insensitive to the wall impedance is pointed out. Cut-on wave numbers of hard-wall modes are presented as a function of frequency. A strongly nonuniform mean flow gives rise to considerable differences between the modal behavior for low and for high frequencies.},

The snapshot application of the POD resulted in modes consistent with previous studies on cavity flows under similar conditions. The time-resolved nature of velocity datasets also allowed for the application of the classical POD in both space and time which, for a stationary flow, is solved in the frequency domain. Eigenvalue spectra and convergence plots revealed that these POD modes are organized by capturing the maximum energy associated with dominant frequencies. The extracted eigenvectors revealed a strong dependency on frequency, with the most dominant modes corresponding to frequencies associated with Rossiter modes known to dominate open cavities. Mach number comparisons from the classical POD application reveal that their modes efficiently capture energy of dominant frequencies associated with the flow dynamics, regardless of the freestream conditions. Using a similarity parameter between spatial unitary basis functions, it was shown that the modes at different Mach numbers were quantitatively similar at the same Strouhal and POD mode numbers.},

A variety of streamwise pressure distributions were imposed by changing the position and the angle of attack of a NACA 0012 airfoil installed above the plate. The effect of the upstream flow history on the wall pressure spectra in the presence of the streamwise varying pressure gradient was studied. Spectral attenuation due to the spatial averaging associated with a finite sensor size was corrected via the Corcos correction. The results show that the Corcos correction to the measured Kulite spectra leads to an overprediction of the spectral intensity at medium frequencies and an underprediction at high frequencies. Hence, a new correction is proposed based on the measured spectral attenuation. Finally, the measurements also indicate that even slight imperfections in sensor mounting and relatively weak upstream flow disturbances can have a significant influence on the measured spectra of the wall pressure fluctuations.},

The DNS is supported by naphthalene shear-stress visualization of matched experiments at the Klebanoff–Saric Wind Tunnel at Texas A&amp;M University.

Experimental correlations provide a bounding expression for the change in the critical -factor for transition onset, which provides a predictive means to account for surface steps. An investigation is conducted to assess the applicability of this approach for more general step arrangements. The approach is applied to capturing the superposition of a forward-facing and a backward-facing step in the form of a rectangular protrusion or a wide gap. Results show that a rectangular protrusion is well modeled by a linear combination of steps. However, a wide gap is best represented by a backward-facing step, without regard for the following forward-facing step. The sensitivity to streamwise step position is also investigated. Results show that the method is effective at capturing step effects for step positions in the neighborhood of the instability neutral point, and extending downstream close to the smooth-surface transition location. The effects of steps placed well upstream of the instability neutral point are overpredicted by the step model, likely the result of nonparallel effects on the upstream decay or as a result of the underlying receptivity occurring in the neighborhood of the neutral point.},

  abstract     = {This Paper examines the performance of a rotor-blown-wing in hover and forward flight conditions. Flow solutions were generated using Helios, with a delayed detached eddy simulation model. The configuration is based on one set of rotors/wing of a quadrotor biplane tail-sitter aircraft. Simulations were conducted to assess the effect of varying angle of attack, rotor revolutions per minute with rotor speed, and rotor diameter. Two configurations were examined, the rotor-blown-wing baseline with two 60.96 cm diameter rotors and the configuration with four 30.48 cm diameter rotors. The smaller rotors were analyzed at the revolutions per minute corresponding to producing half the thrust of the rotor-blown-wing baseline rotor. The presence of the wing in hover resulted in the rotor-blown-wing baseline rotor operating at 1.9\% lower power loading than the same rotor in isolation. In comparison, the configuration reduced power loading by 13.6\% compared to the isolated rotor. In forward flight (airplane mode), an increasing angle of attack was shown to increase thrust produced on the downstroke side of the rotor. Furthermore, the presence of the wing increases the thrust produced on the bottom half of the disk. Both the blown wings increase the ratio from 3.2 for the isolated wing to 3.6 and 4.3 for the rotor-blown-wing baseline and configurations, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Lifting-line theory has formed the basis of wing-design understanding for nearly a century. This theory has previously been used to develop a class of optimal lift distributions that minimize induced drag for finite wings under specific structural and aerodynamic constraints. This class of lift distributions was first introduced by Prandtl in 1933 and includes the elliptic lift distribution and the bell-shaped lift distribution, among others, as special cases. Here, it is shown that, for all lift distributions in this class except the elliptic lift distribution, an antisymmetric twist distribution can be added to the wing to control the adverse yawing moment during roll. The requisite amount of this additional twist distribution depends on the prescribed yawing-moment sign and magnitude, and it can be used to produce zero adverse yaw or even proverse yaw during roll. Of course, employing this methodology to control the roll–yaw coupling produces additional induced drag relative to the case without roll–yaw coupling control. This induced-drag penalty is studied in detail and shows that a symmetric lift distribution within this class can be selected to minimize induced drag for a desired roll–yaw coupling. Roll initiation and steady rolling rate are both considered. Results can be applied to the design of morphing aircraft to minimize the use of a vertical control surface for yaw control.},

  abstract     = {An analytical and computational investigation of the effect of control surface freeplay on aeroelastic behavior, including random gust response and limit cycle oscillations (LCO), is presented. An efficient method to compute the total gust+LCO response is developed using random input describing functions (RIDF), in a manner analogous to harmonic input describing functions for LCO calculation. Results are obtained for an airfoil with trailing edge flap freeplay and linear potential flow aerodynamics at various gust strengths, freeplay sizes, and flow velocities. Both stable and unstable responses are detected. It is found that LCO coexists with gust response for weak gust/large freeplay combinations, and it is quenched for sufficiently strong gust/small freeplay. Time marching results are provided to validate the RIDF method and confirm the findings. The present work appears to be the first use of RIDF in aeroelasticity although it is well known to nonlinear control systems analysts. Notably the RIDF method in its present form is also applicable when steady flow aerodynamic nonlinearities are included.},

In all cases, flow disruptions induced by the various gust encounters are analyzed alongside the corresponding aerodynamic load perturbations. Equivalent inviscid simulations supplement the present flow analyses. Boundary-layer disruption exhibits increased complexity at higher angles of attack characterized by a more coherent leading edge vortex (LEV) and a secondary boundary-layer disruption further downstream. By these features begin to resemble dynamic stall. Both flow laminarization upstream of the induced LEV and lower boundary-layer breakup are less pronounced as angle of attack increases. Interaction with a large gust, at the lowest angle of attack, produced a response similar to that observed in the higher encounters, that is, more coherent LEV and secondary boundary-layer disruptions downstream.},

A test case with attached flow conditions is chosen to study the blade tip vortex aerodynamics on a four-bladed rotor. The resulting azimuth-dependent vortex system of the rotor is analyzed. In addition to velocity fields acquired by a particle image velocimetry system, the current investigation also uses a background-oriented schlieren setup to capture the density gradients caused by the blade tip vortices. These optical measurement techniques enable the reconstruction of the azimuth-dependent vortex system for vortex ages up to 70 deg. The pitch variation, and thus the change in lift, is found to be the main influence on the characteristics of the tip vortex system. The topology of the vortex, the interconnected shear layer, and the position of the vortex with respect to the blade tip appear to be highly pitch dependent. An analysis of the blade tip vortices is carried out, focusing on the swirl velocity, core radius, and circulation distribution. The results are compared to previous investigations at the same test facility and a numerical simulation.},

The experimental results of stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements performed at different positions downstream of the delta wing display the streamwise development of the vortex. Details of the postprocessing of the measurement data and a quantification of the uncertainties are presented. The evaluation of the mean axial and tangential velocity components and Reynolds stresses provides insights to the vortex characteristics and their development in the streamwise direction. In addition, results of numerical simulations with the DLR TAU-code applying the Menter-Shear Stress Transport (SST) eddy viscosity model and the Speziale-Sarkar-Gatski/Launder-Reece-Rodi (SSG/LRR)- Reynolds stress model show the ability of the turbulence models to capture the vortex development. The experimental results indicate a preservation of the vortex strength and structure downstream of the delta wing. The Menter-SST model does not predict this preservation; rather it computes a rapid decay of vortex strength and an increase in vortex size. In contrast, the results of the SSG/LRR- model are in good agreement with the experiments concerning the mean flow development. However, both turbulence models underpredict the turbulence in the vortex core.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic stall on wind turbine blades often leads to severe fatigue that tends to decrease the lifespan of the blades. To mitigate cyclic loading on the blades, trailing edge flaps (TEFs) may be used to control the energy captured by the blades. In this study the influence of a TEF on a pitching S833 cambered airfoil is investigated at a Reynolds number of 170,000 and reduced frequencies of and 0.1. The lift and moment hysteresis cycles are presented for mean pitch angles of 0 and 10° to represent stall onset and deep stall. The flap, hinged at 0.8 chord, is pitching with different phase lags to study the influence of flap motion. Coefficient-of-pressure contour plots presented here clearly indicate the leading-edge vortex (LEV) formation and convection. It is concluded that even though the TEF was not capable of controlling the formation of the LEV, it was, however, capable of reducing the LEV magnitude and, more important, a reduction in cyclic loading. It is recommended to dynamically pitch the flap out of phase with the airfoil motion to reduce the min/max of the lift and moment cycles and reduce negative damping that can lead to stall flutter.},

A comparative analysis of near-wall flow development captured with planar, two-component PIV and surface temperature characteristics is used to establish a methodology for surface temperature-based diagnostics of laminar separation bubbles. For convection-dominated surface cooling, streamwise gradients of surface temperature are shown to mark mean separation and transition, occurring at the maximum and minimum values, respectively. The location of mean reattachment aligns with the location of minimum surface temperature. The obtained estimates are shown to agree well with those from PIV measurements. Transient surface cooling is also considered to estimate the local convective heat transfer coefficient, supporting the results obtained based on quasi-steady temperature measurements.},

This paper shows that, when suitably designing the wing planform, LEVs can also exist on high-aspect-ratio (high-AR) wings. In this study, a quasi-three-dimensional flow model is presented for solving the stationary LEV phenomenon over a high-AR swept back wing, with sweep increasing toward the wingtip. Our model captures the three-dimensional phenomenon by satisfying conservation of mass and vorticity within the LEV, and using a combination of strip theory and the lifting-line theory. Our model predictions are compared with flow visualization data on a parabolic swept back wing. Results confirm that suitable sweep wing geometry can fix an LEV steadily over the upper wing surface, resulting in significant lift enhancement of up to 70\%.},

The novel method is based on a systematic study of 40 airfoils applying over 600 numerical simulations and considering natural transition. The influence of the airfoil thickness-to-chord ratio, camber, and freestream Reynolds number on both friction and pressure drag is analyzed in detail. Natural transition significantly affects drag characteristics and leads to distinct drag minima for different Reynolds numbers and thickness-to-chord ratios. The results of the systematic study are used to develop empirical correlations that can accurately predict an airfoil drag at low-lift conditions. The new approach estimates a transition location based on airfoil thickness-to-chord ratio, camber, and Reynolds number. It uses the transition location in a mixed laminar–turbulent skin-friction calculation, and corrects the skin-friction coefficient for separation effects. Pressure drag is estimated separately based on correlations of thickness-to-chord ratio, camber, and Reynolds number. The novel method shows excellent accuracy when compared with wind-tunnel measurements of multiple airfoils. It is easily integrable into existing aircraft design environments and is highly beneficial in the conceptual design stage.},

A computationally efficient stochastic model is constructed combining the semi-analytical Rayleigh–Ritz approach with the Karhunen–Loève discretization of the two-dimensional random field representing the fiber volume. In addition, polynomial chaos expansions are used as stochastic metamodels of the output random variables characterizing the onset of aeroelastic instability and the mass of the laminate. Such a metamodeling approach enables to alleviate the computational cost involved in the estimation of the statistics of the output variables of interest based on Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the study encompasses both subsonic and supersonic flow conditions, for which two appropriate aerodynamic models are used. The numerical results provide effective uncertainty quantification in a variety of simulation scenarios, which are found to be useful for the incorporation of uncertainty quantification in the design of aircraft and spacecraft structures when uncertainties induced by the manufacturing process must be dealt with.},

  abstract     = {Unstable buckling leads to the failure of thin-walled cylinders under axial compression. Because of the manufacturing and loading imperfections, a significant variation was observed between experimental and theoretical buckling load. The current design criteria use a knockdown factor to estimate the buckling load of thin-walled structures. However, the design criteria employed a very conservative knockdown factor, because it is difficult to be accurately predicted. To improve the certainty of the knockdown factor, in this paper, a physics-informed artificial neural network (PANN) was employed to predict the thin-walled cylinder buckling load using experimental data collected by Seide. PANN has the potential to improve prediction and enforce some physical laws. A beam problem was presented to demonstrate the PANN capability. Then, the cylinder buckling analysis was carried out with PANN. An inequality constraint was applied to force the neural-network-predicted buckling load to be equal or smaller than the corresponding experimental data. The result shows that PANN can reach excellent prediction accuracy and is able to predict the buckling load equal to or smaller than the corresponding experimental buckling load. Additionally, both ANN and PANN are able to take the unique influential parameters as inputs and do not have presumed expression and thus have the potential to yield a less conservative prediction than the statistical equation.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring adequate flutter margins is a critical step in aircraft design. However, in the presence of nonlinear effects, subcritical limit-cycle oscillations can arise even before flutter occurs. When nonlinear effects are anticipated, postflutter analyses have to be integrated into aircraft design in addition to flutter computations for preventing this undesirable subcritical behavior. Therefore, there is a need for computationally fast postflutter analysis methods suitable for design applications. This paper investigates a data-driven method to forecast the bifurcation behavior of a geometrically nonlinear wing, demonstrating its suitability to analyze realistic nonlinear aeroelastic systems. The method efficiently forecasts postflutter responses using only a few system transient computations in the preflutter regime. First, the accuracy of forecasted bifurcation diagrams is verified against time-marching results. Next, wing design parameters are varied to investigate their impact on postflutter responses and show the method suitability to parametric studies.},

  abstract     = {There are two types of aeroelastic instabilities: divergence and flutter. Flutter is an oscillatory loss of stability, whereas transition to divergence occurs at zero frequency; that is, it is a static instability. A general divergence mechanism described in textbooks consists of a decrease of one of the natural frequencies down to zero due to negative aerodynamic stiffness, coalescence with its paired frequency, and (after the coalescence) transformation to one damped and one growing frequency. Most examples of this mechanism use quasi-steady aerodynamics that, at first sight, is suitable for divergence analyses because of its static nature. In this study, it is shown that, when using unsteady aerodynamics (Theodorsen theory), the analytical structure of eigenfrequencies essentially changes; namely, no frequency coalescence occurs but “structural” eigenfrequencies become damped. The divergence mode is not a continuation of a natural mode, but it separates from a continuous spectrum that exists in the aeroelastic system due to the wake behind the wing when unsteady aerodynamics is used but is absent in the quasi-steady case.},

Optimizations considering aerodynamic, stealth, and aerodynamic/stealth performance of a blended-wing–body aircraft with a gradient-based optimizer are conducted. Stealth optimization results indicate that a small leading-edge radius and curvature on the forepart are beneficial to RCS reduction. Aerodynamic performance of aerodynamic optimized model and aero/stealth optimization result are comparable, but stealth performance of aero/stealth optimized result is inferior to stealth optimization. Conflictions between small leading edge and drag reduction are not very prominent based on the current study, whereas curvature is harmful to aerodynamic performance.},

  abstract     = {Mistuning can break the cyclic symmetry of an ideally tuned blisk and cause its forced response to increase drastically. In the absence of cyclic symmetry, the finite element method (FEM) requires a vast amount of computational costs for predicting the dynamic characteristics of mistuned systems. To greatly reduce the computational costs of FEM, various reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed. However, most existing ROMs are only effective for small mistuning or large mistuning situations. To resolve more complicated mistuning problems, this paper proposes two new approaches for blisks with both small mistuning and large mistuning. The first method extends the idea of the subset of nominal modes (SNM), in which modes of a largely mistuned system with small mistuning can be represented in terms of a subset of the pseudo-nominal system modes (SPNM). Because SPNM has to use system-level modes and calculation, the second method, called remaining damaged interface decomposition (HRDID), is further proposed, which is based on the basic principle of SPNM. It requires only sector-level modes and calculation. Furthermore, SPNM, HRDID, and FEM are used separately to calculate both the natural frequencies and mode shapes of mistuned academic blisks. The results of SPNM and HRDID are compared separately with those calculated by FEM to verify their accuracy. Finally, statistical analysis is performed to investigate the effect of random mistuning on a pseudo-nominal system.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a physics-based data-driven method to learn predictive reduced-order models (ROMs) from high-fidelity simulations and illustrates it in the challenging context of a single-injector combustion process. The method combines the perspectives of model reduction and machine learning. Model reduction brings in the physics of the problem, constraining the ROM predictions to lie on a subspace defined by the governing equations. This is achieved by defining the ROM in proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) coordinates, which embed the rich physics information contained in solution snapshots of a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics model. The machine learning perspective brings the flexibility to use transformed physical variables to define the POD basis. This is in contrast to traditional model reduction approaches that are constrained to use the physical variables of the high-fidelity code. Combining the two perspectives, the approach identifies a set of transformed physical variables that expose quadratic structure in the combustion governing equations and learns a quadratic ROM from transformed snapshot data. This learning does not require access to the high-fidelity model implementation. Numerical experiments show that the ROM accurately predicts temperature, pressure, velocity, species concentrations, and the limit-cycle amplitude, with speedups of more than five orders of magnitude over high-fidelity models. Our ROM simulation is shown to be predictive 200\% past the training interval. ROM-predicted pressure traces accurately match the phase of the pressure signal and yield good approximations of the limit-cycle amplitude.},

  abstract     = {The effects of inert diluents in the fuel mixture of a model swirl stabilized gas turbine combustor, under thermoacoustically unstable limit cycle operation, were studied experimentally. The measurements included particle image velocimetry (PIV), high-speed CH* chemiluminescent imaging, and dynamic pressure signals. The paper focuses on the dynamic phenomenon of the period doubling bifurcation, which came about when the equivalence ratio of undiluted flames was enriched from 0.55 to 0.60 under constant Reynolds number . The bifurcation featured an emergence of an aerodynamically related timescale in addition to the fundamental timescale that was induced from an unstable acoustic eigenmode. The aerodynamic timescale is introduced by azimuthal convection of a high-heat-release-rate region and is linked in the literature with a precessing motion of the recirculation zone. It was found that on increasing the diluent molar fraction up to 50\%, the amplitude and the frequency of the limit cycle fundamental acoustic mode decreased. A mechanism to interpret this suppression is that increasing the diluent molar fraction of the fuel makes the flame more susceptible to quenching because the extinction strain rate of the mixture is decreased. The paper argues that the existence of inert diluents in the fuel can significantly alter the dynamic state of the combustor, because the anchoring locations of the flame greatly depend on the composition-sensitive extinction strain rate of the mixture.},

Two types of structures are prominent in the data. The first type arises in the jet’s shear layer and is linked to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, which is an important mechanism of sound generation in nonreacting jets. These structures produce sound through deformation of the flame front in the shear layer. They contain most of the acoustic energy and are dominant at Strouhal numbers (defined based on the jet’s diameter and the inlet mean velocity) less than unity. The second type of structures is found near the jet centerline, where large fluctuations of the flame surface are observed. The structures are linked to small nonlinear flame dynamics and to the Orr mechanism. They travel at a speed close to the inlet mean velocity and are important at higher Strouhal numbers. Regardless of their energy content, both types of structures have important contributions to the broadband nature of combustion noise.},

Because the flow physics is complex, a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) analysis is also desirable when performing optimization. A computationally efficient means of handling many-parameter optimization with expensive cost functions is to use gradient-based searches informed by an adjoint flow solution. In this work, a discrete adjoint method for high-speed flows is documented. It is implemented in the open-source compressible-flow solver Eilmer. One difficulty with extending a hypersonic flow solver to include an adjoint solver is the differentiation of complex, nonlinear (and sometimes nondifferentiable) algorithms. Here, it is shown that difficulty can be overcome using flow Jacobians constructed with finite differences based on complex variables. The coupled flow and adjoint solvers are packaged together with a gradient-based optimizer. The flow and adjoint solvers are verified and validated for high-speed RANS analysis. The discrete adjoint method for optimization is demonstrated using the NASA P2 hypersonic inlet as a test case. The results show that the optimization method can remove an undesirable shock present in the original geometry, while achieving the desired compression ratio and improving overall performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {Extensive wind-tunnel tests were performed on a Y-shaped diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI). All tests were conducted at a free stream Mach number of , the design Mach number for this inlet, and at both zero degrees angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS). The experiments were performed at various inlet operating conditions comprising supercritical, critical, and subcritical conditions that covered almost all ranges of the engine operating for this DSI. The results showed that the DSI had relatively acceptable performance characteristics when operating at its design condition. A symmetric supersonic flow pattern was observed at both supercritical and critical operating conditions of the present Y-shaped DSI. However, both symmetric and asymmetric supersonic flow patterns were observed during the subcritical operating conditions of the present inlet. At low subcritical operating conditions, the supersonic flow pattern remained symmetric, similar to that of the critical operating condition case. As the inlet experienced higher subcritical operating conditions, the supersonic flow structures became suddenly asymmetric and a new flow pattern was noticed. This flow pattern was seen to be highly unstable; and significant asymmetric shock wave oscillations, boundary-layer thickening, and shock-/boundary-layer interaction were observed for these situations. To the authors’ knowledge, this novel phenomenon of asymmetric flow behavior in a perfectly manufactured symmetric Y-shaped DSI encountering symmetric flow (0 deg AOA and AOS) has not been noticed by previous researchers and, if so, the results have not been published yet.},

  abstract     = {It is well-known that the Boltzmann collision term can be simplified by Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) and Fokker–Planck (FP) models. These two kinetic models satisfy the conservation laws; however, their predictions of the Prandtl number are inconsistent with that derived from the Boltzmann equation. A variety of modifications, such as Shakhov BGK (S-BGK), Ellipsoidal Statistical BGK (ES-BGK), Cubic Fokker–Planck (Cubic-FP), and Ellipsoidal Statistical Fokker–Planck (ES-FP), models have been proposed and they can provide correct Prandtl number. However, in the transition regime, the validity of simplified kinetic models is still controversial. In this work, the performance of four kinetic models is investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical comparison of the high-order moments beyond shear stress and heat flux. The simulations of the shock waves show that the results of these modified kinetic models deviate from the Boltzmann equation as Mach number increases. On the whole, the S-BGK model, which gives the most approximated relaxation coefficients for the production terms of high-order moments, provides the best predictions in the transition regime. For the ES-FP and Cubic-FP models, besides the incorrect relaxation coefficients, their deviations at large Mach numbers are further caused by inconstant Prandtl number and overestimated nonlinear terms, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the cross validation of two aerodynamic shape optimization methodologies in order to validate, characterize, and compare the two methodologies. Both methodologies use gradient-based optimization based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations driven by the discrete adjoint method. The first methodology uses a B-spline surface representation of the geometry coupled with free-form deformation and axial curve-based geometric control, as well an efficient linear elasticity-based mesh deformation method. The second methodology uses class-shape transforms for airfoil geometry control and either in-CAD or out-of-CAD surface modeling. Two benchmark geometries are used for comparison: a wing-body configuration representative of a large transport aircraft, and a wing-body configuration with aft-mounted nacelles typical of a small business jet. Both single-point and multipoint optimizations are performed. Cross validation is conducted such that flow evaluations are performed on the geometries produced by the two methodologies using a single flow solver and consistent meshes. It is found that both methodologies provide similar geometries and performance improvements. The primary differences that exist are a result of the distinct geometry parameterization and control methods that, in some cases, allow for more localized geometric control. The degree of agreement is indicative of the maturity that has been achieved by modern state-of-the-art aerodynamic shape optimization methodologies.},

  abstract     = {In aircraft design, spatial integration limits aerodynamic and structural performance. While the outer mold line shape determines aircraft aerodynamic characteristics, aircraft systems and passengers or payloads must fit inside. Emerging categories of aircraft, such as electric aircraft, are likely to experience new and critical spatial integration challenges. Existing aerodynamic shape optimization tools use a narrowly defined set of geometric constraints. However, no known aerodynamic optimization framework can handle spatial integration constraints derived directly from three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. A general geometric constraint formulation based on triangulated 3-D geometry is proposed. The constraint consists of two metrics: the length of the intersection curve(s) between any two objects, and the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser function aggregated minimum distance. The proposed implementation of the intersection and distance computations is fast and analytically differentiable with respect to geometric design variables, making it suitable for efficient gradient-based optimization. The constraint formulation is validated using three Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based aerodynamic shape optimization problems: a 2-D fairing design problem, a 3-D fairing design problem, and the design of an aeroshell to surround a human avatar. It is shown that this approach is robust and efficient, enabling the aerodynamic optimization of bodies containing objects with arbitrary shapes.},

  abstract     = {This study provides the first in-depth analysis of the formation, strength, and convection of cycloidal rotor tip vortices. The measurements of blade force and tip vortex using particle image velocimetry were conducted for different blade aspect ratios and pitch kinematics at a chord-based Reynolds number of 18,000. Particle image velocimetry was employed to investigate vortex development at increasing vortex ages and the early development for varying azimuthal locations. The instantaneous blade force measurements on the cycloidal rotor showed a decrease in nondimensional lift with decreasing blade aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of the blade did not affect the shape of the vortex convection trajectory. However, the rate of downward convection increased with increasing aspect ratio due to the higher thrust produced. The tip vortices showed self-similarity in the velocity and the circulation profiles. The measurements indicate that the vortex core experiences a logarithmic growth and the swirl velocity experiences a logarithmic decay due to viscous diffusion. The tip-vortex strength varied cyclically with blade azimuthal location due to the cyclic variation of blade pitch angle and the dynamic virtual camber effects. This periodic variation in the tip-vortex strength leads to a periodic variation in the induced flow velocity on the blade.},

Simulated results show that GFs increase the total pressure rise of the fan; the higher the GF height, the more notable the lifting capacity. The working point of the highest efficiency moves toward the large flow rate. GF0.5-100 extends the high-efficiency scope and increases efficiency by an average of 2.09\%; and GF2-50R raises efficiency by an average of 1.12\%. After implementing a GF, the dynamics in the impeller distinctly. Compared with the original fan, a secondary tip leakage vortex generated at the blade tip aggravates the leakage loss; a pair of shedding vortices generated in the downstream of the trailing edge promotes the pressure difference between the suction and pressure surfaces. The prediction with the large-eddy simulation method indicates that GFs heighten the aerodynamic noise of the fan, and GF0.5-100 and GF2-50R increase the sound pressure level by 12 and 13 dB, respectively. Although the GF0.5-100 and GF2-50R are preferred choices for such axial fans, some necessary measures should be taken to reduce the acoustic noise in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {A mode-merging design method (MMDM) for bulk liners with porous materials is proposed to maximize transmission losses in flow ducts. The eigenequation and its partial derivative equation governing the coupled acoustic fields in the duct and backchamber are derived, from which the merging double eigenvalue is obtained at a target frequency for a single incident circumferential mode. The crucial liner parameters (namely. the chamber depth and the flow resistivity of the porous material) can be optimized simultaneously. A finite element propagation model is employed to evaluate the MMDM-based design for a finite-length liner, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method for selected typical design cases. It is found that mode merging can be realized for a nonlocally reacting liner, with or without a perforated plate, mainly for protecting the porous material inside its chamber. The MMDM, under the assumption of an infinite-length liner, can give an almost globally optimal design for a finite-length liner when the length exceeds five times the duct diameter. It is expected that the proposed MMDM can be useful in the preliminary designs for actual bulk liners due to its rapidness and accuracy.},

The dynamic pressure on the surface of the slat is sampled and compared with the experimental data by other researchers, and a good agreement is obtained. The far-field noise spectra, computed with the permeable Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings integration method, also agree well with the experimental data. The tone noise source is studied by analyzing the correlation between the dynamic pressure on the slat cove surface and the near-field noise. It is found that the tone noise is strongly correlated with the dynamic pressure close to the reattachment point on the slat cove surface.},

The dominant frequency and sound pressure level reduced when the porosity decreased from 0.79 to 0.49. When the screen was placed between the two cylinders, the noise was reduced by weakening the vortex shedding and its strike on the rear cylinder.

A supersonic inviscid bleed choking model is further established by using the inflow Mach number and the pressure ratio when the expansion wave is parallel to the entrance. For a depthless hole at Mach 2.0 and with a pressure ratio of 0.5, the difference of flow coefficient predicted by the present model to that of computational fluid dynamics is 1.4\% under nonchoking conditions. Under choking conditions with a pressure ratio of 0.1, the difference is 3.1\%. Furthermore, the influence of the boundary layer on the bleed mass-flow rate is transformed into the influence of the displacement thickness on the effective size of the bleed hole. Based on that, the viscous bleed rate model is established, which shows a maximum error of 7.7\% for a depthless bleed hole over laminar flow at Mach 4.0 and Reynolds number .

The suction control is activated by a fast-acting solenoid valve while an unsteady unstarting flow evolves in the model scramjet. A nonreacting jet is injected into the model combustor to mimic the flow choking of unstarting scramjets. The choked flow then initiates an unstart shock wave that reaches the inlet and induces a downstream flow transition from supersonic to subsonic. The temporal evolution of the unstart process has been visualized by high-speed schlieren imaging. The flow visualization shows a strong dependency of the unstarting flow on the local flow conditions, such as static/stagnation pressure gradients and boundary-layer thickness. The suction of 2–3\% of the intake mass flow rate delays or pauses the inlet unstart process, and it reduces the restarting process hysteresis. The unstart process is either effectively ceased or marginally delayed, depending on the suction timing with respect to the unstart process.},

A grid-convergence study is also performed to verify the fidelity of LES results. Ultimately, qualitative and quantitative comparisons of mean and instantaneous jet fields are conducted. It is demonstrated that the vortex excitation has enhanced the mixing of the injection nitrogen with the environment by a considerably increased mixing level and a faster mixing process in the middle jet. The vortex excitation modulates the buildup process of shocks and vortex structures, resulting in an intensified shock/shear-layer interaction and an accelerated turbulence transition process, which combine to improve mixing efficiency.

  abstract     = {The quasi-time-resolved flowfields of spatially oscillating jets emitted by fluidic oscillators at various installation angles, velocity ratios, and oscillation frequencies are examined experimentally. The velocity fields are acquired plane by plane using a stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system. Dominant streamwise vortices are identified and found to prevail downstream. The flowfield at a given velocity ratio is independent of the oscillation frequency because velocity ratio and Strouhal number are proportional. For small Strouhal numbers, the flowfield behaves similar to that of a vortex generating jet. For higher Strouhal numbers, the crossflow experiences a steady, wide-spread jet. When the skew angle decreases, one of the former two dominating vortices diminishes until at a skew angle of 45 deg one vortex dominates the flowfield. At a skew angle of 0 deg (i.e., the plane spanned by the oscillating jet is parallel to the crossflow), the jet penetration is comparable to that of a steady jet, and a pair of co-existing, counter-rotating vortices is identified. When changing the inclination angle, the flow features in the far field reduce to two dominant streamwise vortices whose spanwise effect increases when the inclination angle decreases. Additionally, the Strouhal number effects are shifted toward higher Strouhal numbers.},

The axis-switching phenomenon and breakup are simulated and characterized under the effect of disturbances imposed at the nozzle exit. The simulations are based on the volume of fluid approach and an adaptive meshing. A range of orifice aspect ratios from 1 to 4 at the Rayleigh breakup regime is considered. The evolution of the jet cross section and axis switching under the influence of disturbances is compared with that of nonperturbed elliptical jets. It is found that the axis-switching repetition and breakup length exponentially decrease with the initial amplitude of disturbances. For a fixed amplitude, the optimum wavenumber responsible for minimum breakup length is observed to be dependent on ellipticity of the orifice. Moreover, it is found that the form of final breakup leads to elimination of the satellite droplets at the optimum wavenumbers, while the droplet size decreases and becomes more uniform.},

The flowfield is studied using particle image velocimetry and schlieren visualization. The induced flowfield is very different from the single starting vortex generated by turning on a continuous steady-state actuation of the DBD actuator. A train of periodic vortices is formed by the periodic burst-mode actuation, with each burst cycle generating one vortex that travels along and away from the wall. The effects of the burst frequency and duty-cycle ratio on the vortex motion and structure are studied, and similarity laws are discovered. The velocity at which the vortex moves is shown to be independent of the duty-cycle ratio of the actuation. The velocity component along the wall, however, is found to increase with the burst frequency. A time-averaged wall jet velocity based on the actuation time during each burst cycle is identified and found to be independent of the burst frequency but increase with the duty-cycle ratio of the actuation. Self-similar patterns of the vortex flowfield are demonstrated for a short time duration after the vortex is formed within each burst cycle.},

A limiting factor is their variation in switching time, which often precludes their use. The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate the closed-loop control of a recently developed novel piezo-fluidic valve that reduces response time uncertainty at the expense of operating bandwidth. Use is made of the fact that a fluidic jet responds to a piezo tone by deflecting away from its steady-state position. A control signal used to vary this deflection is amplitude modulated onto the piezo tone. Using only a pressure measurement from one of the device output channels, an output-based linear quadratic Gaussian regulator was designed to follow a desired reference deflection, achieving control of a .

In this work, and for the first time, their superior induced drag properties are verified in compressible and transonic regimes. The aerodynamic forces are obtained by analyzing computational fluid dynamics data, and the drag is subdivided in induced, viscous, and wave contributions. This decomposition is provided by a recently introduced aerodynamic force breakdown technique based on the vortex-force theory and allows an unambiguous definition of the lift-induced drag. The methodology is applicable to incompressible, compressible, and transonic flows.

To this aim, flapping wings have been designed and fabricated for which the supporting stiffeners tense the Mylar membrane to which they are bonded. The sound produced by these wings at different flapping frequencies has been recorded in an anechoic chamber simultaneously to the upward thrust they create. Comparing their characteristics and performance with those of flapping wings of conventional design suggests that tensing the wing’s membrane can increase the thrust while decreasing the typical rustling noise of the flapping wings.},

  abstract     = {Small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly popular in civil and military use. However, their ability to fly in adverse weather and turbulent flows is hindered by their low-Reynolds-number wings. It is shown that turbulence produces a significant pitching flow, as observed by the wing, which raises the possibility of intermittent dynamic stall comparable to a pitching airfoil situation. Two airfoils (one symmetrical and the other cambered) were tested in the wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers relevant to small UAVs: between 50,000 and 200,000. Two turbulence intensities of 5 and 15\% were compared to sinusoidal pitching of the airfoils at equivalent amplitudes and three frequencies. It is shown that an increase in either the pitch amplitude or the onset turbulence intensity produces comparable changes in the time-averaged lift coefficient, and both experience forms of dynamic stall. The transient behavior is, however, significantly different; and the airfoil form has greater influence on the response to pitching motion than to turbulent flow.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic stall is exploited to produce positive torque on a large-chord/radius-ratio vertical-axis wind turbine. An elementary kinematic analysis shows that the blades experience large variations in angle of attack that produce deep dynamic stall, combined with large relative dynamic pressure variations, that are phase shifted by approximately 90 deg. The phase shift allows dynamic lift-overshoot effects associated with the formation of a dynamic stall vortex to drive the turbine when the relative dynamic pressure is high, whereas lift stall associated with shedding of the vortex occurs when the relative dynamic pressure is low. Blades also experience variable virtual camber (or “virtual morphing”) effects and favorable chordwise pressure gradients, where the former produces a virtual leading-edge droop that reduces the leading-edge angle of attack. Open jet wind-tunnel tests of a two-bladed model turbine revealed maximum power coefficients of 16\% that were almost independent of . Flow visualization confirmed that dynamic stall, with the associated dynamic stall vortex, is the mechanism that drives the turbine to maximum power. Until reliable design tools are developed, either empiricism combined with dimensional analysis or high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics are proposed for optimization and analysis.},

  abstract     = {The coupled equations of motion of an unrestrained flexible body when derived using multibody dynamics or mean axes formulation consist of three mass coupling integrals, namely, the first-order and second-order inertia effects as well as the second-order momentum-coupling vectors. The computation of these coupling integrals requires access to a finite element formulation [source code that uses shape functions to generate the finite element method (FEM) model], which is often unavailable. This work, using modal superposition, presents a mathematical formulation that allows computation of these integrals for a given finite element model (FEM model) of an unrestrained deformable vehicle nonintrusively: that is, without access to the actual finite element source code. It shows that the required integrals can be computed if one can access the consistent mass matrix of the vehicle from the FEM model. The formulation has been verified with an example of an unrestrained crossbeam model using Rayleigh–Ritz and the finite element method for computing the coupling integrals. In the Rayleigh–Ritz method, the coupling integrals are computed using the integral equations; in the FEM, they are computed using the consistent mass matrix. The use of a consistent mass matrix to compute the integrals agrees well with those obtained using volumetric integration in the Rayleigh–Ritz method. Finally, these integrals were calculated for two flexible unmanned-aerial–vehicle-type aircraft: mAEWing1 and mAEWing2. The results help in determination of the significance of these terms in flight dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Tensegrities have found many technologically important applications in architecture, aerospace, biological engineering, and soft robotics. Loss of members in tensegrity structures may have an important effect on their nonlinear behaviors. In this paper, the effect of the rupture of cables on two periodic tensegrity grids (with and without clustered cables) is investigated by using the corotational approach. A tangent stiffness matrix is derived for a clustered cable running through pulleys. The rupture of cables is modeled by considering the elastoplastic deformation. The proposed finite element formulation is validated by a simple example and then applied into the analysis of complex tensegrity grids. The propagation of slack and the rupture of cables are discussed in detail. The results of the numerical simulation show that clustered cables play important roles in sharing external loads such that the clustered tensegrity grid has a uniform deformation in comparison with the classical one. On the other hand, interestingly, a global deformation resilience induced by local mechanism modes is observed for the classical tensegrity grid. The finding may be valuable for designs of tensegrity-based metamaterials and energy harvesting devices. The work provides an efficient and numerical way of nonlinear analysis of both classical and clustered tensegrities.},

  abstract     = {The effect of stochastic variation in material and geometric properties on structural performance is important for robust design. Knowledge of such effects can be acquired by applying variation patterns to a structure using random fields through a Monte Carlo analysis. The output is postprocessed to show the correlation pattern between the stochastic variation of a structural property and a chosen mechanical response measure. The resulting patterns are used to identify areas most susceptible to variations, as well as areas that have the most potential to increase structural performance by varying the material parameter or geometry. By using these maps of local sensitivity to variations with respect to the structural response, it is possible to redistribute material properties or geometry to promote certain behavior. This is demonstrated on a flat plate and curved panel by varying either the Young’s modulus or the thickness of the structure to increase the linear buckling load. In both of these variations the average property is set to remain the same as the original structure. Applying the redistribution increased the linear buckling load by up to 29\%.},

  abstract     = {Investigated and revealed are new insights into the individual, decoupled effects of induced camber and spanwise bending on the lift, drag, and endurance for an optimum flexibility membrane-and-frame wing at Reynolds number 80,000. While previous studies into thin, flexible-wing designs for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles have been shown to improve aerodynamic performance and delay the onset of stall, the individual contributions of localized induced camber and spanwise bending on the performance improvement have not been sufficiently examined. Furthermore, since the locally induced camber and spanwise bending generally occur simultaneously, their decoupled effects are not well understood. This Paper first introduces a wing frame optimization approach using a rapid fluid/structure interaction model to identify a wing flexibility design that maximizes aerodynamic endurance. A higher-fidelity, large-eddy simulation is then used for validation of the optimized wing flexibility and to help explain both the coupled and uncoupled effects of the induced camber and spanwise bending that contribute to maximum performance. The formation of several locally induced cambers at specific planform regions is found to create greater endurance (minimum power required) through favorable lift generation, in addition to reduced drag at relatively high angles of attack. Spanwise bending, however, is observed to be a noncontributing byproduct of the increased thin-wing flexibility. Detailed pressure distributions and instantaneous flow structure visualizations from large-eddy simulation provide new insights into the individual contributions of induced camber and spanwise bending while also justifying the optimum wing design.},

  abstract     = {The increasing reliance of aerospace structures on numerical analyses encourages the development of accurate, yet computationally efficient, models. Finite element (FE) beam models have, in particular, become widely used approximations during preliminary design stages and to investigate novel concepts, for example, aeroelastic tailoring. Over the last 50 years, developments in hp-FE methods based on elements of variable size (h) and polynomial degree (p) have helped reduce the computational cost of numerical analyses. Concurrently, many structures, including aircraft wings and wind turbine blades, have gradually increased in length, slenderness, and complexity. As a result, modern blades and wings regularly operate beyond the range of linear deformation, requiring nonlinear analyses for which hp-FE methods are often not readily applicable. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to derive a corotational FE formulation for enriched three-, four-, and five-noded beam elements, suitable for nonlinear hp-FE refinement. To this end, the mathematical formulation is derived to incorporate enriched elements within the corotational FE beam framework. The proposed formulation is then validated against multiple nonlinear benchmark problems and an experimental case study.},

The proposed method employs two technical processes: the consolidation of multiple low-fidelity models and the refined adaptation of the consolidated model. Along with the resulting prediction model, the proposed method also provides model dominance information that can be used to understand the characteristic response of the high-fidelity model regarding essential behavior described by the low-fidelity models. Nondeterministic kriging is employed for variable-fidelity modeling under uncertainty. The performance and characteristics of the proposed method are demonstrated and discussed with multiple fundamental mathematical examples and a thermally coupled aircraft structural design problem.

Model predictions often exhibit discrepancy with respect to experimental observations, due to assumptions and approximations in the model. Bayesian approaches for estimating discrepancy in single models have been studied in the past. This paper approaches the problem of discrepancy prediction in coupled multiple models (especially multidisciplinary models) using Bayesian state estimation methods. The proposed state-estimation-based approach is found to have significant advantages over the previously studied Kennedy–O’Hagan method, in the estimation of discrepancies of hidden states, and in the identification of the sources of these discrepancies, namely, model form errors. The proposed approach is illustrated for a four-discipline problem related to aerothermoelastic response prediction of a hypersonic aircraft panel.},

  abstract     = {A methodology for nonintrusive projection-based nonlinear model reduction originally presented by Renganathan et al. (“Koopman-Based Approach to Nonintrusive Projection-Based Reduced-Order Modeling with Black-Box High-Fidelity Models,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 56, No. 10, 2018, pp. 4087–4111) is further extended toward parametric systems with a focus on application to aerospace design. Specifically, the method is extended to address static systems with parametric geometry (that deforms the mesh) in addition to parametric freestream boundary conditions. The main idea is to first perform a transformation on the governing equations such that it is lifted to a higher-dimensional but linear underdetermined system. This enables one to extract the system matrices easily as compared to that of the original nonlinear system. The underdetermined system is closed with a set of model-dependent nonlinear constraints upon which the model reduction is finally performed. The methodology is validated on the subsonic and transonic inviscid flows past the NACA0012 and the RAE2822 airfoils with parametrized shapes. The utility of the approach is further demonstrated by applying it to two common problems in aerospace design, namely, derivative-free global optimization and parametric uncertainty quantification with Monte Carlo sampling. Overall, the methodology is shown to achieve accuracy up to 5\% and computational speedup of two to three orders of magnitude relative to the full order model. Comparison against another nonintrusive model reduction method revealed that the proposed approach is more robust, accurate, and retains the consistency between the state variables.},

It is obtained from a transform of the underlying discrete-time equations, and it requires no additional geometrical or kinematic assumptions for the lifting surfaces. Parametric reduced-order modeling is demonstrated through interpolation over 1) projection matrices, 2) state-space realizations, and 3) transfer functions, which trade accuracy, robustness, and cost. Methods are finally exemplified in the dynamic stability of a T-tail configuration with varying incidence. Numerical studies show that a very small number of balanced realizations is sufficient to accurately capture the unconventional aeroelastic response of this system, which includes in-plane kinematics and steady loads, over a wide range of operation conditions.},

A two-dimensional planar inlet featuring a double-compression ramp with 10 and 22° inclination to the freestream direction and a rectangular-cross-section duct is tested. A solenoid is used to raise a barrier into the flow and initiate buzz at high throttling ratios. Static pressure is measured at a data sample rate of 10 kHz, and schlieren images are collected at an image frame rate of 30 kHz. Oscillations in the flow not linked to buzz are present at both zero and full throttle, and they cause a high-amplitude pressure peak at very high frequency (higher than 3 kHz). At full throttle, buzz is spotted, in the contemporary presence of shear layers being ingested by the intake (Ferri criterion) and of separated flow lying on the second compression ramp (Dailey criterion). Both features are analyzed by means of the standard deviation of the frames captured. The kind of buzz hereby observed activates high-amplitude pressure oscillations at both low frequencies and high frequencies. The unstarted flowfield is largely subsonic inside the intake and allows for the use of the linear acoustic theory. Indeed, one of the peaks recorded matches the quarter-wave resonator frequency (1411 Hz) of the inlet, suggesting that the barrier acts as a solid wall and that the inlet model behaves as a duct with a closed end.},

An inlet-fueled scramjet engine was designed with a symmetrical intake to reproduce the correct flow structures. This was tested with an inflow condition of Mach 7, using a Mach-10 flow enthalpy of to reproduce the combustion conditions in a flight vehicle operating at Mach 10. The turbulent flame was directly observed in the flow using planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH radicals. These results have been complemented by large-eddy simulations of the experimental conditions, showing that the combustion process in scramjets is multimode, where neither premixed nor non-premixed combustion dominates, and both substantially contribute to heat release. These modes are present simultaneously inside the engine. For both modes, combustion is confirmed to happen over multiple combustion regimes. This work provides new insight into the supersonic turbulent combustion process and enhances our understanding of combustion in scramjet engines.},

Three configurations are comparatively studied to investigate the effects of confinement and heat release on the mixing: a nonreacting case without confinement, a nonreacting case with confinement, and a reacting case with confinement. First, the mixing region area is quantified and its development is characterized. Subsequently, the deformation and rotation of fluid are analyzed to illustrate the impacts of shocks and combustion on the mixing region development. The transport of vorticity is further discussed to explore the driving mechanism of mixing in different cases. The results show that the impingement of oblique shocks on the mixing region reduces its area due to compression but enhances the subsequent mixing by promoting vorticity via the dilatation and baroclinic torque effects. This leads to a wavelike pattern for the development of the mixing region. Heat release expands the mixing region and decreases vorticity in the upstream, where high heat-release rates are observed. Downstream, combustion products mix with air, and only weak heat release takes place. In that region, the baroclinic torque effect becomes dominant and results in higher vorticity as compared to the nonreacting case.},

In this paper, based on the theoretical modeling method, a specific analogy of their effects on nonequilibrium stagnation flow is proposed. Therefore, the physical models and mathematical techniques employed in our previous studies on the chemical nonequilibrium flows can be extended to study the vibrational nonequilibrium effects that are dominant in the relatively lower-temperature flows. This analogy study introduces several nonequilibrium flow criteria and a formula that can be used to assess the vibrational nonequilibrium effects on stagnation point heat transfer to wall surfaces with an incomplete accommodation of the vibrational energy. The direct simulation Monte Carlo method is employed to validate the analytical results. This study could enrich the understanding of the nonequilibrium flow physics and similarity of the real gas flows.},

  abstract     = {A compact slip flow model is proposed for isothermal, incompressible gas flows in long microchannels of rectangular (square), trapezoidal (triangular), and double-trapezoidal (rhombic) cross sections in the slip flow regime. The model is based on superposition of the dimensionless mean continuum velocity and the dimensionless average slip velocity. The characteristic length used in the Poiseuille and Knudsen numbers is the hydraulic diameter. A novel slip flow parameter is introduced to account for the relationship between the average slip velocity and the average wall shear stress. The novel slip flow parameter lies in the range 0.5–0.6 for equilateral triangular microducts to very narrow rectangular microchannels when the characteristic length is the hydraulic diameter. The agreement between the proposed compact slip flow model and extensive numerical data is within 1\% for a wide range of microchannel shapes and aspect ratios.},

  abstract     = {The waverider has an extensive application prospect in the design of hypersonic vehicles due to its excellent aerodynamic efficiency. However, it is known that the original cone-derived waverider is longitudinally unstable. To solve the problem, a design method for hypersonic quasi-waverider configuration is first proposed and then a genetic algorithm optimization framework is constructed to obtain optimum quasi-waveriders with different constraints. During the optimization, the aerodynamic performance is evaluated by an efficient aerodynamic model that considers the impacts of strong viscous interaction effects. Results from numerical simulations show that, for the optimum quasi-waveriders without constraints, good shock wave attachment along the leading edge is achieved, and the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is even higher than that of the original waverider. Optimized quasi-waveriders are also generated based on the constraints of volumetric efficiency and stability. The first increases and then decreases with the increase in volumetric efficiency. In addition, an interesting phenomenon is found that the is reduced almost linearly with the increase in the degree of stability at each design condition. Furthermore, a linear relationship is also constructed between the variation of with respect to degree of stability and the viscous interaction parameter .},

  abstract     = {Shock-induced flow separation in an overexpanded supersonic planar nozzle is investigated numerically by means of three-dimensional wall-modeled large-eddy simulations (LES). The objective of this study is to identify the origin of the low-frequency shock oscillations (LFO) and the associated side-loads generation in planar nozzles. The computational results are compared with the experimental data for validation. The promise of the near-wall LES modeling approach, adopted in this study, is supported by its satisfactory performance in correctly predicting the shock-induced flow separation and offering a major advantage of being 30–40 times faster than the wall-resolved LES counterpart, allowing thereby the capture of very–low-frequency shock oscillations with much better statistics convergence. The simulations bring clear evidence of the existence of broadband and energetically significant LFO in the vicinity of the separated shock, whose forward and backward movements are mainly driven by changes in the downstream flow conditions. The complex interactions between the backflow, the separation bubbles, and the large-scale turbulent structures developing in the shear-layer region strongly influence the shock unsteadiness, which in turn drives the LFO. A scenario of the LFO, confirming conclusions from earlier studies, is described in this work.},

This study investigates oblique shock–boundary-layer interactions on a steady flexible panel in a Mach 2.0 flow. Experiments were performed in the Imperial College supersonic wind tunnel, where shock generators were used to produce an oblique shock followed by a corner expansion. A parametric study was conducted, exploring different shock impingement positions and shock–expansion distances. The steady aerostructural response is studied using schlieren photography, static pressure distributions, photogrammetry measurements, and surface oil flow visualization. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed to assess the effects of the flexible panel on downstream total pressure recovery. These were validated against experimental wall pressure distributions and measurements from a Pitot rake. Results show reductions in both separation length (of up to 40\%) and stagnation pressure losses (of up to 10\%) if the flexible plate is used. These improvements occur for a range of shock positions spanning approximately 50\% of the panel length and for all the shock–expansion distances considered. A model that captures the flow physics responsible for these trends is proposed. The results highlight the potential of flexible panels for practical oblique shock control.},

Transition on the model was characterized using infrared thermography and Kulite pressure transducers in the Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University. The flow controllers were assessed by their impact on the transition location and wave number of the largest-amplitude hot streaks. The transition location was accelerated by critical forcing (actuator wave number equals wave number of naturally largest-amplitude waves) and delayed by subcritical forcing (actuator wave number larger than natural waves). The disturbance wave number input of the plasma actuators was observed downstream on the model for many of the plasma-on runs, demonstrating that the plasma actuators introduced discrete forcing into the flow. The precise locations of the hot streaks arising from stationary crossflow vortices varied for different nosetips, presumably due to differences in their microscale roughness.},

A laminar jet is tangentially injected beneath a turbulent boundary layer at a freestream Mach number . Two cooling film injection Mach numbers are considered, at a total temperature ratio and at a total temperature ratio . For the low injection Mach number, the shock is generated by a flow deflection of ; for the high injection Mach number, the flow deflection angle is . For both injection Mach numbers, two shock impingement positions are investigated. For comparison, literature data with comparable shock parameters and isoenergetic injection are considered. The current results show that the flow structure of the shock/cooling-film interaction is highly sensitive to the injection temperature. The increased blowing rate at a lower injection temperature, that is, increased streamwise mass flux in the cooling film, drastically stabilizes the flow. This prevents mean separation and leads to reduced turbulent mixing downstream of the shock interaction region. In consequence, the turbulent heat transport toward the wall decreases, which implies a higher cooling effectiveness when the injection temperature decreases. The findings also show that flow cases with different injection temperatures but similar near-wall mass flux yield separation bubbles with similar streamwise extent.},

Wind tunnel experiments are performed to validate the method with Mach 1.8 and 2.0 flows over a length-to-depth 6 cavity. Six dynamic pressure transducers are used to characterize the cavity oscillation. A remarkable suppression of pressure fluctuation is realized in the controlled cavity flow. The overall sound pressure level can be reduced by larger than 10 dB in both configurations. The most remarkable reduction in pressure fluctuation occurs near the cavity trailing edge, wherein flow-induced oscillation is strongest. Almost no cavity tones are observed near the cavity trailing edge under control. Further, the control method is proven effective and stable over time. The feedback loop is interrupted in the controlled cavity flow with a weak impact of shear vortices on the cavity aft wall. The control method may be a practical and potential candidate for use in engineering applications because it does not need additional gas supply in the control system.},

The microjet parameters varied during this study were the location, orientation, and blowing ratio of the jets. Measurements include velocity and vorticity fields obtained using planar and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The baseline flow is separated over a third of the flap at a deflection angle of 20°, and over the entire flap at a deflection angle of 30°. Microjet control is able to completely re-attach the flow at both flap deflection angles and significantly reduce the airfoil drag. The mechanism for control effectiveness is the re-energizing of the boundary layer through the development of counter-rotating vortex pairs.},

Forcing configurations are varied by differently combining the number of actuated jets working in an opposing blowing–suction configuration. Instantaneous wall shear stress and streamwise velocity fluctuations evidence drag reductions as well as turbulence attenuation up to 20\%. The forcing effects are persistent up to at least a 150 half-channel height downstream of the injection section. Particle image velocimetry investigations in planes perpendicular to the channel axis highlight the presence of a large-scale streamwise vortical structure covering the whole height of the channel. This structure is thought to be responsible for the significant drag reduction, which is similar to the typical behavior evidenced in the case of colliding jets. The nondimensional forcing frequency of the synthetic jets producing the maximum drag reduction and turbulence attenuation is 0.0074 for the investigated Reynolds number . A statistical analysis of the near-wall structures demonstrates that the control mechanism acts in a way to reduce them in the forced configuration. It is conclude that the effect of the forcing is such that the near-wall structures merge and become less prone to inducing new structures, thus effectively reducing their number, and consequently the near-wall turbulence activity.},

Its damping behavior is shown to be favorably frequency selective; that is, application to a test case with spurious acoustics shows that, indeed, the acoustic relaxation term is able to remove these undesired oscillations while leaving the hydrodynamics untouched. Subsequently, the acoustic relaxation term is applied as a forcing to couple an acoustic signal into a computational aeroacoustics (CAA) simulation. The transfer function shows a desirable behavior. The acoustic relaxation term is able to damp or excite acoustic waves; in that way, it potentially enables the excitement of prescribed acoustics in the linearized equations, such as a linearized Euler or acoustic perturbation or, as is done in this paper, the Navier–Stokes equations.},

The noise is especially disturbing because it contains strong tonal contributions due to the regular vortex shedding at the cylinder. If the cylinders are not two-dimensional, but finite and wall-mounted at one end and free at the other, additional flow phenomena occur at both the tip and the wall junction, which can lead to additional noise contributions. One method to reduce the aerodynamic noise from such cylinders is to cover them with a flow-permeable, porous material. The present paper describes an experimental study on the effect of porous covers on the reduction of noise generated by wall-mounted, finite, circular cylinders. Thereby, special focus was put on the identification of both the optimum position and the optimum extent of the porous cover regarding a maximum noise reduction. The experiments included both measurements of the far field noise as well as flow measurements in the wake of the cylinders. They were conducted in an aeroacoustic open jet wind tunnel at subsonic flow speeds. It was found that a placement of porous material at the wall end is more efficient in reducing Kármán vortex shedding noise than a placement of porous material at the free end.},

It is shown that the computation time for modes tracking using this approach can be reduced by more than 65\% while achieving almost the same estimate of the flutter speed as when using a fixed step size. The study also addresses a few unique and important phenomena in parameter variation such as modes jumping in the LCO curve that occur frequently using this adaptive step size algorithm. Furthermore, a combination of the modes tracking results to provide an estimate for the restart point for the CM solver to overcome the occurrence of possible extraneous solutions or divergence is proposed. The results of flutter analysis for linear structural system and nonlinear LCO analysis are validated against the results from experiments and the classical Theodorsen theory. The effect of viscous damping on the occurrence of detrimental LCO phenomena is also discussed and compared with the corresponding nondamping cases.},

  abstract     = {In modern aircraft design the accurate prediction of dynamic control surface deflections is crucial for the evaluation and application of new load alleviation techniques. Time-marching approaches, such as the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, do provide a complete modeling of the aerodynamic flowfield; however, they are extremely time-consuming and still too expensive for design applications. In this paper a model is presented, which enables the fast and accurate prediction of aerodynamic responses for arbitrary control surface deflections. The model hereby reflects the time signal of the control surface deflection as a superposition of frequency components and computes the dynamic response behavior of the control surface using the linear frequency domain. The frequency responses are precomputed in a surrogate model for a wide parameter space of Mach number, Reynolds number, angle of attack and flap chord ratio, so that a frequency response for a new flight condition can be computed by mere interpolation. After building the surrogate model, the method achieves reduction in computational time of up to six orders of magnitude in comparison to time-marching simulations, while still covering the viscous and unsteady aerodynamic effects in the flow.},

  abstract     = {Multipoint aerodynamic design optimization involves no more than tens of flight conditions, which cannot thoroughly represent the actual demand. A comprehensive evaluation of the performance may consider hundreds or even thousands of flight conditions, and this leads to a massively multipoint optimization problem. Existing optimization methods are inefficient in such cases. This paper presents a surrogate-assisted gradient-based optimization architecture that efficiently solves massively multipoint design problems. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, surrogate models are constructed only in the low-dimensional space spanned by flow condition variables. With the aerodynamic functions and gradients computed by surrogate models, efficient gradient-based optimization is performed to find the optimal design. To ensure convergence, an adaptive sampling criterion is proposed to refine the surrogate models. In a transonic aircraft wing design case, the results show that the optimal design found by the proposed method with 342 missions yields a fuel burn reduction by a factor of two as compared to a regular multipoint optimal design. This work highlights the demand and provides an efficient way to conduct massively multipoint optimization in aircraft design.},

To improve the damping effect and ensure the safety of wind-tunnel tests, a controller based on neural networks that is able to suppress multimodal vibration is detailed and established. A hardware platform composed of various instruments is developed, and related testing software is built to evaluate the damper as well as the control algorithm. Finally, broadband excitation and transonic wind-tunnel tests are carried out to verify the capability of the whole damping system. Experimental results indicate that the amplitude of vibration is dramatically reduced and the test angles of attack are enlarged, which show the superiority of the damper and the control algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Kinematic aspects of flow separation in external aerodynamics are investigated in the Lagrangian frame. Specifically, the initial motion of upwelling fluid material from the wall is related to the long-term attracting manifolds in the flowfield. Although the short-time kinematics are governed by the formation of a material spike upstream of the zero-skin-friction point and ejection of particles in the direction of the asymptotic separation line, the trajectories of the fluid tracers are guided by attracting ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponents once they leave the vicinity of the wall. The wall signature of this initial fluid upwelling event, which is the so-called spiking point (Serra, M., Vetel, J., and Haller, G., “Exact Theory of Material Spike Formation in Flow Separation,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 845, June 2018, pp. 51–92), is computed from the curvature of advected material lines and, for the first time, from high-order numerical derivatives of the wall-normal velocity obtained from direct numerical simulations of a circular cylinder and a cambered NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil. As the spline-based boundary parametrization of the airfoil profile induces oscillations, the principle spiking point can be recovered robustly through appropriate filtering. The short-term kinematics correlate strongly with the scaling lengths in the boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more common as electronic systems decrease in size and weight. These aircraft fly below a Reynolds number of 250,000, where, in clean flow, the wing boundary layer undergoes laminar-to-turbulent transition for a significant portion of the wing chord. However, many UAVs fly at low altitude, where significant levels of turbulence are encountered due to terrain roughness. The present study was carried out to understand how this turbulent flow changes the performance of the UAV wing—in particular, how this influence may vary with the camber of the airfoil form. Two airfoils, a NACA0012 and a NACA4412, were tested in relatively clean and highly turbulent flows in a wind tunnel. Testing was conducted at Reynolds numbers of 50,000–200,000, with turbulence intensities from 1.3 to 15\%. Under increasing turbulence intensities, in contrast to prior flat plate research, the maximum lift coefficient was seen to decrease by up to 30\% for the cambered airfoil, compared with a 5\% rise for the symmetrical form. The influence of the Reynolds number on both airfoils decreased as the turbulence intensity increased, whereas camber maintained a point of difference.},

A wide range of angles of attack [; 32°] is investigated for 3 values of the Reynolds number across the transitional range. Unusual polar curves are observed with sharp variations of lift with the angle of attack. At low incidence, the lift coefficient increases faster than . Moreover, very different behaviors occur for Reynolds numbers lower or higher than . For small or negative angles of attack, the lift coefficient is negative (downward lift) at small Reynolds numbers, but positive (upward lift) at higher Reynolds numbers. The velocity field is investigated with particle image velocimetry. Variations of lift are related to changes in the topology of the flowfield around the section. These results help to better understand the flow around a high-camber thin section and provide a detailed benchmark database in a simple geometry for model validations. As strong Reynolds number effects are evidenced, this database would be particularly useful to assess the performance of transition models.},

Below 5000, the agreement with experiment for skin friction is strongly improved, and the differences, which reach 15\% for the original Spalart–Allmaras model, are now of the order of the experimental uncertainty. The alteration of the logarithmic law is negligible. Ultimately at very high Reynolds number, the new model shifts the curve of versus the streamwise Reynolds number to the left by units of .

The mixture of kernel functions is cast as a weighted-sum model in which the weights are treated as extra hyperparameters to yield a higher optimum likelihood. The CKL framework aims to improve the accuracy of the GP and relieves the difficulty of kernel selection. In this paper, the combination of five kernel functions are studied, namely, Gaussian, Matérn-3/2, Matérn-5/2, exponential, and cubic, with each kernel sharing the same length scale. Numerical studies were performed on a set of engineering problems to assess the approximation capability of GP-CKL. The results show that, in general, GP-CKL yields a lower approximation error and higher robustness as compared to GP models with single kernel and model selection methods. Numerical experiments show that it is worth using the GP-CKL method for achieving higher accuracy with extra burdens on the number of hyperparameters and a longer training time. Besides, experiments were also performed with variable length scales for each kernel and each variable. However, this variant of CKL is not suggested because it is prone to overfitting and is significantly more expensive than the other GP variants.},

Based on the energy equivalence principle and the classical Timoshenko beam theory, this study establishes a new equivalent dynamic model for the space antenna truss with initial stress by the static condensation method. Compared with previous truss structures of the triangular prism reported in equivalent modeling, the space antenna truss has a more complicated configuration and more members. Meanwhile, this truss structure is in a self-stress state and the connection of the adjacent members is a rigid-jointed. The equivalent anisotropic Timoshenko beam model of the complex space antenna truss with a rigid joints is proposed for the spatial repeating element composed of the beam and cable members in the initial stress state and the joints. According to the kinematic assumptions, displacement expressions of the spatial repeating element are derived using the Taylor series expansion at the center of the spatial repeating element. Then, the stiffness and mass matrices of the equivalent beam model are obtained. The natural vibration characteristics of the equivalent beam model are proved to be in good agreement with those of the original space antenna truss, which indicates that the equivalent beam model has a satisfactory accuracy. As a result, the equivalent dynamic model may serve for the vibration control of the space antenna truss.},

The sensitivity of the rib mass to the applied loads is evaluated using the Lagrange multipliers of the optimized rib design. To enhance the numerical efficiency of the two-level optimization, the changes of the loads on the ribs are subjected to a reduction by principal component analysis (PCA). In both the wing-level and rib-level optimization problems, the level-set strategy for the optimization of composite structures, previously introduced by the authors, is employed. This method permits an advantageous use of coarse and fine finite element models employing a standard commercial finite element code. The proposed method is applied to the design of a composite horizontal tail plane. The accuracy of and the computational time savings by the proposed PCA-based reduction scheme are quantified.},

  abstract     = {We delineate effects of 1) face-to-core stiffness ratio (FCSR) and mass density ratio (FCDR) in square laminates and sandwich plates and 2) the fiber and transverse direction elastic modulus ratio in cross-ply laminates on the first 12 distinct frequencies found by analytically solving the three-dimensional linear elasticity theory equations and using an equivalent single-layer third-order shear and normal deformation plate theory (TSNDT). Whereas the elasticity equations for simply supported plates are solved by using Srivinas and Rao’s approach, the TSNDT equations are numerically solved by using weighted Jacobi polynomials and the Ritz method. We note that previous studies have generally compared only the fundamental frequency. For square laminates with a side-length/plate-thickness ratio of 100 (10), the maximum error in the TSNDT predicted first 12 frequencies is less than 0.4\% (7\%). For a FCSR less than 20, the maximum difference in predictions from the two approaches for the first six distinct frequencies is 5.4\%. However, the FCDR has little effect on the difference between frequencies from the two methods. The frequencies and mode shapes presented herein should help us better understand the dynamic behavior of laminated and sandwich plates and provide benchmark results for others to assess their theories.},

  abstract     = {Nonsymmetric laminates are commonly precluded from composite design due to perceptions of reduced performance arising from in- and out-of-plane coupling. This coupling introduces warpage during cure—leading to raised stresses, together with diminished buckling and load carrying capacity. However, these reduced performance characteristics are rarely quantified and included in the design process; instead the symmetric-only paradigm remains pervasive at the cost of a significantly reduced design space. Warpage is largely driven by mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion between sublaminates located above and below the midplane and can be predicted by the classical laminate theory. Acknowledging that all symmetric laminates in multipart structures have build stresses from assembly, it is proposed that subsets of nonsymmetric laminates that translate to similar raised stress levels be considered for design. Challenging this symmetric-only design paradigm would permit greater design freedom and offer new routes to elastically tailor composite structures. Further analysis of structural performance is assessed in terms of reduced loading and buckling capacity.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic response of thin-walled structures is driven by mass and stiffness distribution. As such, variable-stiffness (VS) composites offer opportunities to tune structural dynamic responses. To this extent, efficient analysis tools become increasingly important for structural analysis and design purposes. In this work, an efficient and versatile Ritz method for free vibrations and linear transient analysis of VS doubly curved shell structures is presented. VS shell structures are modeled as an assembly of shell-like domains. The shell kinematics is based on the first-order shear deformation theory, and no further assumption is made on the shallowness or on the thinness of the structure. The description of the shell is provided by a rational Bézier surface representation, and general surface geometries can be represented. Legendre polynomials are employed to approximate the displacement field, and penalty techniques are used to enforce displacement continuity and kinematical boundary conditions. Classical Rayleigh damping is considered, and solutions are obtained through the Newmark integration. The resulting model allows a wide range of configurations and load cases for multicomponent, VS composite structures to be solved, providing the same levels of accuracy as finite element analysis, yet with a reduced number of variables and simpler data preparation.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a multifidelity method that can produce accurate estimates of the flutter boundary at a reduced cost by combining information from low- and high-fidelity aeroelastic models. Estimating the flutter boundary in the presence of nonlinear aerodynamic phenomena is challenging because high-fidelity aeroelastic models are expensive to evaluate, and flutter analysis requires many model evaluations. On the other hand, relatively inexpensive approximate aeroelastic models (low-fidelity models) exist and are routinely applied to reduce the cost of estimating flutter, albeit with lower accuracy. The multifidelity method introduced here uses an active learning algorithm to leverage information from low-fidelity models. A multifidelity statistical surrogate is used to fit damping coefficient estimates computed with different aeroelastic models. This surrogate is used to estimate the uncertainty in the prediction of the flutter boundary, which drives the selection of new evaluations. The effectiveness of the multifidelity method is demonstrated by estimating the aeroelastic flutter boundary of a typical section model at a cost 85\% lower when compared with the bisection method. Four aeroelastic models are considered in this example: three models (including the high-fidelity model) use a computational fluid dynamics solver based on the Euler equations, whereas one model uses a two-dimensional doublet-lattice method.},

  abstract     = {Owing to an increased interest in damage identification and structural health monitoring during dynamic testing, sensor placement optimization has been a challenging research subject over the past decades. As the most influential method developed thus far, the effective independence (EI) method for sensor placement is discussed extensively in the present paper. Specifically, it was observed that, in the computation of the EI index, the sum of each retained row in the eigenvalue contribution matrix is a constant during each iteration. To reveal the significance of this property, a matrix transformation was employed, the form of which is similar to the orthogonal-triangular (QR) decomposition of the EI method previously proposed by the authors. In this regard, the physical significance of the re-orthogonalization of the modes through QR decomposition based on the computation of the EI method can be clearly seen from a new perspective. In view of this, a new sensor placement method, which is referred to as the remodeling innovation (RI) method, is proposed in this paper. The RI method avoids the existing problems in a conventional EI method in that, during each iterative calculation, the row with the least norm is removed without taking into account the effects of the structural mass redistribution. Furthermore, the RI method achieves better sensor placement in terms of the different evaluation criteria applied. Finally, to demonstrate the above observations, the proposed RI method was applied to the Hangzhou Nanshan Bridge.},

A hybrid extended Kalman filter (HEKF) is proposed for engine performance anomaly detection and sensor fault accommodation from previous studies. Five groups of sensor measurement are divided along gas path related to five local filters, and the local estimated results are fused in the main filter. The reception state matrix is introduced to HEKF to deal with packet dropout, and nonlinear calculation is separated from a local filter to reduce computational burden in the field. Besides, fault diagnosis and isolation strategy of sensor subsets is developed and combined to HEKF by state consistency strategy of distributed network. The contribution of this study is to provide the novel HEKF algorithm to achieve real-time state estimation for sensor-fault-tolerant monitoring of aircraft engine with packet dropout in the distributed structure.

For efficient reliability analysis of structure in presence of hybrid random and evidence uncertainties (RA-HRE), a single-layer sampling method (SLSM) is proposed. First, two equivalent expectation formulas are derived for the belief and the plausibility measures in RA-HRE. According to these formulas, the belief and the plausibility measures can be directly estimated by only one group of samples of the random variables and focal elements of the evidence variables that are generated at the same level. Second, for greatly reducing the computational cost in RA-HRE by SLSM, the SLSM-based bi-objective adaptive kriging (SLSM-BAK) is subsequently developed to simultaneously estimate the belief and the plausibility measures. Aiming at the two objectives in RA-HRE, that is, accurately estimating the belief and the plausibility measures, a new compound learning function is developed in SLSM-BAK. Based on the compound learning function, the kriging model is adaptively updated to accurately and efficiently recognize the sign of the maximum and minimum performance functions for each random sample over the corresponding sampled focal element. This training process continues until both the estimation precision of the belief and the plausibility measures satisfy the preset requirements.},

A ammonium perchlorate particle is set in a premixed hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene binder and investigated using a two-dimensional model with finite-rate chemistry and detailed transport properties. The results from the detailed model are compared to two-dimensional and three-dimensional burning-rate codes with reduced chemistry. The gas-phase combustion chemistry is modeled using a reduced four-step mechanism developed from a detailed microscale model of ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene combustion. Simple configurations of a single ammonium perchlorate particle and sandwich propellants at varying pressures are compared to determine leading-order effects of two-dimensional and three-dimensional approaches. The reduced chemistry models are then applied to real-world propellants for which a random packing algorithm is used to construct the ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene propellant in a periodic cube for a given size distribution of spherical ammonium perchlorate particles and mass ratio of the oxidizer and binder. The decomposition of the ammonium perchlorate and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene on the surface is determined at discrete locations and is used to determine the average burning rate over a period of time. This approach combines a more detailed description of the gas-phase combustion processes, the condensed-phase morphology, and physics in a time-dependent simulation in hopes of developing a more predictive model of solid propellant combustion.},

Both implicit- and explicit-filtering approaches are used for the LES, providing insight into the role of modeling parameters in both approaches. Uniformly distributed ranges are provided to the seven modeling parameters, and various levels of Smolyak sparse grid parameter sets are simulated via LES to statistical convergence. From these sparse grid LES realizations, a surrogate model of mean flow quantities (temperature, velocity, etc.) is computed for calculation of parameter space statistics. This study shows that the explicit-filtering simulations exhibit a magnified sensitivity to modeling parameters relative to the implicit-filtering simulations. These increased sensitivities manifest most prominently in the temperature field, with certain parameter sets quenching the flame in explicit-filtering simulations but not in the implicit-filtering simulations. Lastly, it is found that three of the seven modeling parameters (namely, the dynamically thickened flame efficiency function exponent , turbulent Prantdl number , and eddy-viscosity coefficient ) dominate the solution for both implicit- and explicit-filtering approaches.},

In this environment, high levels of aerodynamic heating are encountered such that incorporation of chemical and vibrational nonequilibrium effects can become critical. The impact of thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) on the supersonic mode in particular has not been thoroughly and systematically investigated. This work uses thermochemical nonequilibrium (TCNE) direct numerical simulation (DNS) and TCNE linear stability theory (LST) to obtain a more complete investigation of the supersonic mode using both nonequilibrium and frozen gas models. The simulation is Mach 5 flow over a 1-mm-nose-radius axisymmetric cone 1 m in length, representative of experimental conditions in ground test facilities. Both LST and DNS results indicate that TNE effects are destabilizing compared with frozen flow and can lead to an -factor difference of approximately at the end of the cone. LST results also indicate that TNE effects are stabilizing to the second and supersonic modes in comparison with thermal equilibrium. The supersonic mode appeared to be slightly more affected by TNE than the second mode. Collectively, the findings in this work suggest that even in ground test facilities where TCNE effects are relatively small compared with free flight, incorporating nonequilibrium models in both the mean flow and stability solvers can have a practical effect on hypersonic boundary-layer transition prediction analyses.},

The presence of vortical structures enhances heat transfer from the surfaces and together with relieving effects breaks the symmetry down in the flowfield.

High-speed schlieren operating at 20 kHz are used as the flow diagnostics. The flow structures in the compression ramp SWBLIs (including the shock wave, interaction region, and induced turbulent region over the ramp surface) are discussed. Their variations under increasing ramp angles and Reynolds numbers are further examined. The low-frequency shock-wave oscillations are also studied through tracking the shock-wave motion. A larger ramp angle increases the spectral intensity of the shock wave’s low-frequency unsteadiness, whereas increasing the Reynolds number results in a lower peak frequency for the separation and reattachment shock waves.},

  abstract     = {Reflected shock tunnels have been widely used for ground testing of hypersonic airbreathing engines. These facilities are able to replicate the total enthalpy and pressures experienced along hypersonic flight trajectories. Designing the relevant operating conditions is complex, and extensive guidance about operation condition design in reflected shock tunnels is scarce. To facilitate the operation of a reflected shock tunnel, it may be advantageous to develop a database of attainable conditions and the operation parameters required to achieve them. For this, a model to calculate global thermodynamic states and shock speeds also accounting for piston location and tube length (quasi-0D-model) is proposed. This model uses the NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications code to solve real gas and high-temperature effects. A number of conditions are calculated to produce maps of operating conditions. As test cases, the reflected shock tunnel under development at Tokai University, and T4 at the University of Queensland are used. Maps obtained sweeping rupture pressure or compression ratio, and initial test gas pressure for different driver compositions are presented. This methodology can be adapted to similar facilities. Moreover, observation of the presented maps provides a quick reference of the influence of each parameter when modifying existing conditions or fine-tuning tunnel operation.},

Measurements of axial thrust are acquired alongside surveys of the near-field acoustics at eight observer positions above and below the tip path plane of the upper rotor. The variables of interest are the index angle and stacking distance between the upper and lower rotors, as well as rotor speed. Standard metrics like thrust coefficient, sound pressure spectrum level, and the sound pressure level of the various blade harmonics and subharmonics are studied. Human ear effects are also considered using the A-weighting standard, which is shown to have a profound influence on the perceived noise levels. The analysis demonstrates how rotor thrust and sound pressure levels are more dependent on rotor index angle than stacking distance. However, the index angle where the peak thrust coefficient resides is more sensitive to stacking distance at low rotation speeds than it is at high rotation speeds. Various rotor speed and index angle combinations of the stacked rotor are also shown to produce the same rotor thrust, all the while resulting in uniquely different sound levels of the various rotor harmonics.},

The reduced mechanism is then applied to three-dimensional LES, which provides a more detailed representation of the structure of the solid rocket motor exhaust plume compared with previous studies based on one-dimensional box models or three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The present chemical model does not include alumina particles, whose effects at the plume scale are still uncertain, yet the simulation offers a prediction of the chlorine species distribution, which is known to produce strong interactions with stratospheric ozone, eventually leading to ozone depletion.},

As the computational power increases and computational techniques mature, LES-based calculations are becoming more realistic by including complicated nozzle shapes and by increasing the Reynolds numbers to approach flight conditions. The LES is now being used for evaluation and the understanding of noise mechanisms from heated or unheated, subsonic or supersonic, and single or multiple jets (for example, twin jets). Also, impinging jets, jet blast deflector surfaces, installation effects, and noise reduction strategies (for example, fluidic injection, plasma actuators, chevrons, and beveled nozzles) are currently being studied and evaluated.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a two-dimensional integral boundary-layer method developed in a recent work is applied to ice-accretion computations. The method has already been validated in terms of boundary-layer dynamic effects in another paper. It is here validated for its ability to capture ice shapes, once the method is included in an icing suite. To be more specific, the results in using the new boundary-layer method are compared to experimental ice shapes and simulated ones with the widely used simplified integral method. The validation is carried out at an aggregated level because icing databases generally provide access to final ice shapes only. However, because the simplified integral method is used in many icing numerical tools, this comparison makes it possible to investigate the benefits of introducing the new method for calculating the boundary layer. The main outcome of the new method is an improvement of the prediction of the boundary-layer prediction under a smooth-wall assumption, which in turn improves ice-shape prediction. It is shown that, overall, the ice shapes are indeed either better predicted with the new method than with the baseline approach, or equally predicted with both methods. In addition, because the heat transfer coefficient tends to be underestimated by simplified integral methods, the new approach tends to predict lower horn angles than the baseline approach. Finally, the consequences of these results on current and future developments of ice-accretion solvers are discussed. In particular, the new method is better suited to a three-dimensional extension than the simplified integral method.},

The vortices that develop past this model are described numerically and experimentally. For such configurations, the presence of a power-plant installation under the wing initiates a complex and unsteady vortical flowfield at the nacelle/pylon/wing junctions, responsible for a drop in aircraft performances. To gain insight into the underlying physics, the geometry is simplified into a symmetric two-dimensional extruded wing equipped with a symmetric, hemispheric-ended cylinder. The study was conducted at a Reynolds number of 200,000, based on the wing chord and on the freestream velocity. Two angle of attack angle configurations are investigated on the basis of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations, oil-flow visualizations, and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The vortex dynamics thus produced is described in terms of vortex core position, intensity, and size. The analysis of the velocity flowfields obtained from the wind-tunnel measurements and the numerical computations highlights the influence of the longitudinal vortex initiated at the pylon/wing junction on the separation process of the boundary layer near the upper-wing leading edge.},

Three typical pitching-up maneuvering actions are tested to validate the capability of our NVF solver, including pitching up with a closed-loop attitude controller and an acceleration controller.

Method verification is required to provide the confidence for routine use in production analysis. The current work aims at verification of anisotropic mesh adaptation for Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations over the ONERA M6 wing. The present verification study is performed using four different flow solvers, three different implementations of the metric field, and three mesh mechanics packages. Two of the flow solvers use stabilized finite element discretizations (FUN3D-SFE and general geometry Navier–Stokes), one uses finite volume discretization (FUN3D-FV), and the last one uses mixed finite volume and finite element discretizations (Wolf). The mesh adaptation is based on an error estimator that aims to control the quadratic error term in the linear interpolation of the Mach number. Two sets of adaptations were performed; the first one controls the interpolation error in the norm, and the second one controls the interpolation error in the norm. Convergence studies were performed on the forces and the pitching moment using all four solvers, and the results are compared with previously verified convergence studies on fixed (nonadapted) meshes. Both the forces and pitching moment on adapted meshes are found to be converging to the fine-mesh values faster than those on fixed meshes. In addition to forces and moments, the convergence of surface pressure and skin-friction coefficients at various measurement locations on the wing are also presented. Adapted-mesh surface pressure distributions agree with the fine fixed mesh pressure distributions. Adapted-mesh skin-friction distributions contain high-frequency noise with mean values approaching the fixed mesh pressure skin-friction distributions.},

The new approach uses anisotropic wavelet-based mesh refinement, and its effectiveness is demonstrated for flow simulations with two different turbulence models, namely, the Spalart–Allmaras and models for a variety of two- and three-dimensional flow configurations with arbitrary geometries, different speed regimes, and various boundary conditions. Supersonic plane channel flow, a weakly compressible channel flow with periodic hill constrictions, a subsonic zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary-layer flow, the separated flow over NASA wall-mounted hump, the Bachalo–Johnson flow (axisymmetric transonic bump flow), and a flow past a circular cylinder at a subcritical Reynolds number are tested as benchmark flows. The effectiveness and efficiency of the new wavelet-based approach are demonstrated by comparing the results of the WA-URANS simulations with literature data. This comprehensive validation of the WA-URANS approach encourages its application to practical problems of industrial interest, and demonstrates the feasibility of extending this approach to wavelet-based wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (LES) and hybrid URANS/LES. Finally, the current study serves as a baseline for the development of a unified hierarchical framework for eddy-resolving turbulence modeling, capable of performing computations of different fidelity, ranging from adaptive direct numerical simulations to adaptive URANS computations.},

To be compatible with computational fluid dynamics solvers, the underlying transition criterion is computed using three additional transport-type partial differential equations. A fourth equation is used in order to define laminar and turbulent regions inside the flowfield. The model was implemented in the finite-volume solver TAU of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It could be shown that a widely used transition transport model seems to exceed its range of validity for particular cases at high and low Reynolds numbers (for low turbulence intensities) depending on the pressure distribution. For the proposed model it is shown that for these cases transition onset can be predicted with the desired accuracy. To demonstrate this, computations of several 2D airfoils were performed, which show very good agreement with experimental data. Additionally, the applicability for industrially relevant weakly compressible 3D configurations and a compressible 3D wing–body configuration was shown achieving good agreement with experiments.},

  abstract     = {This Paper presents a three-dimensional higher-order-accurate finite volume algorithm for the solution of steady-state compressible flow problems. Higher-order accuracy is achieved by constructing a piecewise continuous representation of the average solution values using the -exact reconstruction scheme. The pseudo-transient continuation method is employed to reduce the solution of the discretized system of nonlinear equations into the solution of a series of linear systems, which are subsequently solved using the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. This Paper considers several preconditioning methods in conjunction with different matrix reordering algorithms and shows that the proposed preconditioner based on inner GMRES iterations can enhance the convergence speed and reduce the memory cost of the solver. Moreover, when starting from a lower-order solution as the initial condition, this Paper shows that ramping up the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number accelerates the convergence rate. Finally, this Paper verifies the developed finite volume algorithm by solving a set of test problems, in which optimal solution convergence with mesh refinement is attained.},

  abstract     = {The unsteady preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions (UPCBCs) based on the artificial compressibility (AC) method are formulated and applied at artificial boundaries for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of incompressible flows. The compatibility equations including the unsteady terms are mathematically derived in the generalized curvilinear coordinates and then incorporated as boundary conditions (BCs) in a high-order accurate incompressible flow solver. The spatial derivative terms of the system of equations are discretized using the fourth-order compact finite difference (FD) scheme, consistent with the high-order accuracy required for the DNS. The time integration is carried out using an implicit dual time-stepping method, and the robustness and performance of the numerical algorithm are enhanced by applying the preconditioning technique and calculating the automated AC parameter based on the local flow conditions. At first, the steady viscous incompressible flow for a two-dimensional plane jet is computed to assess the accuracy and performance of the solution method by applying the UPCBCs in comparison with the simplified BCs. Then, the simulation of the unsteady incompressible viscous flow around a two-dimensional NACA0012 airfoil at the Reynolds number 800 and the angle of attack 20° is performed, and it is indicated that the computational cost of the solution is considerably decreased by implementing the UPCBCs at the artificial far-field boundary compared with the simplified BCs, which is remarkably valuable for the DNSs. Finally, the computation of the transition to unsteady for the incompressible flow around a three-dimensional NACA0012 wing at the same conditions of the two-dimensional case is successfully performed, and the results obtained are compared with those of previous studies that exhibit good agreement. Indications are that the present solution method by applying the UPCBCs at the artificial far-field boundary can be effectively used for the DNSs of the incompressible flows.},

The model is representative of an existing heavy-lift helicopter fuselage. The flowfield in correspondence of the loading ramp is investigated along both the longitudinal and transversal directions either at fixed incidence angle , 0°, and 4.5° or monotonically varying it in the range between . Two cases, that is, either without control or under the periodic excitation induced by PJs, have been considered. A statistical analysis of the case without control reveals the presence of a massive separation in the inspected region characterized by crosswise eddies, predominant at positive incidences, and streamwise vortices. Even though the separation mainly occurs slightly downstream the upsweep shape of the rear fuselage, two preferred reattachment regions are recognized either along the ramp or the boom tail for and 0°. When the incidence angle is increased, the separation points move upstream, and the reattachment points are predominantly located at the ramp end. The effectiveness of the control is achieved through a momentum addition of at a reduced frequency for the range of the investigated incidence angles. Benefits in aerodynamic performances result in a drag reduction from 5 to 24\% for the incidence angle sweep. Under the periodic excitation, the separation is completely suppressed and the streamwise vortices move closer to the tail boom of the model. The vortical pattern preserves its symmetric spatial organization with respect to the longitudinal direction. A modal analysis using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) indicates the dominance of periodic crosswise vortical structures evolving along the ramp of the fuselage in phase with the control input. A phase-average reconstruction, based on the POD analysis, highlights that these vortices travel along the ramp and then dissipate by the time they reach the tail boom of the helicopter fuselage.},

  abstract     = {The transient response of a massively separated flow over an airfoil to rapid flap actuation is presented. A NACA 0006 airfoil is oriented at a fixed incidence of 20 deg for a Reynolds number of . The experiments are performed in a water tunnel with a wing spanning the width of the test section to produce a nominally two-dimensional flowfield. The airfoil is bisected about the midchord position, resulting in a 50\%-chord trailing-edge flap. The flap is rapidly deflected in a smoothed-ramp profile over a range of deflection speeds and amplitudes. The flap maneuver is completed in a fraction of a single convective time. Focus is given to a deflection amplitude of 2 deg to minimize geometric deviation from the nondeflected configuration. The desired response to such a flap motion is the evocation of vortical transients conducive to lift enhancement. Through this study, two distinct transient responses are observed that are directionally dependent on flap actuation. In motions resulting in an increase in airfoil camber, the lift is increased instantaneously to modest values before relaxation to a separated steady state. In effect, this mode expedites convergence to the steady-state value of the final airfoil configuration and is devoid of the “antilift” spike associated with the discrete actuation of conventional fluidic actuators. In motions resulting in a decrease in airfoil camber, the lift profile is characterized by an initial reduction before a surge in lift, culminating in a global peak and followed by relaxation. Both deflection modes prove disruptive to the leading-edge shear-layer dynamics through trailing-edge actuation and are cause for rollup of a leading-edge vortex. Ridges of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field are used to determine that the net decrease in camber motion induces significant entrainment near the trailing edge, leading to a smaller recirculation region and reattachment of the flow above the suction surface trailing-edge region. The net increase in camber motion does not generate this entrainment, and therefore yields a significantly larger recirculation region.},

The sensor system (including the thin film and wire) is highly adherent and durable after the aforementioned tests, as well as the temperature cycling/shocking tests afterward, indicating that such thin-film sensors embedded on the vane surface are not only capable of detecting high temperatures but also able to stand for the tough working conditions in a propulsion environment of high vibration, violent shocking, and abrupt temperature stressing. These thin-film sensors are less than thick, and thereby more accurate as compared to a traditional wired thermocouple on the surface temperature measurements of turbine blades, serving the general engineering purpose for aeroengine research and development, as well as health monitoring.},

The airfoil with PSP applied is parameterized by using a novel parameterization method based on radial basis function interpolation. As a characteristic of wing aerodynamic performance, is determined by surface pressure distribution, which can be affected by uncertainties of PSP binder thickness. A kriging response surface method has been used to develop a surrogate model to represent the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution of the flow around the airfoil with PSP. This enables the use of Monte Carlo simulations to obtain stochastic output, including the probability of the occurrence of significantly inaccurate output values affected by the inputs subjecting to Gaussian distributions. An error margin and associated probability for its occurrence are recommended to account for uncertainties for the aerodynamic force occurring in the PSP measurement.},

Based on the strain model, the control forces of LaSMP patches on hemispherical shells are introduced. The FEM method is used to obtain natural frequencies of the free hemispherical shell by solid modeling in ANSYS and proved by comparing numerical results with analytical and experimental results. Using the modal expansion method, the LaSMP vibration control of hemispheres is investigated, and independent modal responses are presented and evaluated. The results indicate that LaSMP patch can control vibrations of hemispherical shells by reducing vibration amplitudes. And the control effect is better for low modal vibration, as the LaSMP-induced strain is relatively smaller.

  abstract     = {A common probabilistic approach to perform uncertainty allocation is to assign acceptable variability in the sources of uncertainty, such that prespecified probabilities of meeting performance constraints are satisfied. However, the computational cost of obtaining the associated tradeoffs increases significantly when more sources of uncertainty and more outputs are considered. Consequently, visualizing and exploring the decision (trade) space becomes increasingly difficult, which, in turn, makes the decision-making process cumbersome for practicing designers. To address this problem, proposed is a parameterization of the input probability distribution functions, to account for several statistical moments. This, combined with efficient uncertainty propagation and inverse computation techniques, results in a computational system that performs order(s) of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art optimization technique. The approach is demonstrated by means of an illustrative example and a representative aircraft thermal system integration example.},

  abstract     = {In the present work, detonation stabilization in the supersonic flow is numerically investigated in the straight channel with suction boundaries. The two-dimensional reactive Navier–Stokes equations, together with a one-step reaction model, are solved using a second-order-accurate finite volume method solver based on the Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement framework. The results show that, compared with one jet initiation, detonation initiation can be achieved in a shorter distance using two hot jets subject to the equal total width of the jets. When the suction slots are turned on, the overdriven detonation undergoes a gradual attenuation along with the weakening of the transverse waves, hence leading to dynamic detonation stabilization in the supersonic flow. When the suction slots are closer to the detonation front, the forward propagation of the detonation in the supersonic flow can be more effectively prohibited, implying that the suction slots should be distributed as close as possible to the detonation front in order to realize the maximal suction effect using the minimal suction slots.},

Five different flame propagation modes—1) steady propagation mode (SPM), 2) jerky flame mode (JFM), 3) oscillating flame mode (OFM), 4) oscillating flame transition to detonation (OFTD), and 5) jerky flame transition to detonation (JFTD)—are observed experimentally with the increase of equivalent ratio. The results show that the oscillation characteristics strongly depend on the tube diameter and mixture composition. The results show that the smaller the diameter of the tube, the more regular and smaller the flame oscillation cycles and amplitude, and the greater the influence of the heat loss on flame propagation. Under the same tube diameter, the ratio of the heat loss to total chemical heat release rate in the five flame modes is . The coupling between the wall heat loss, wall friction, and the flame boundary layers contributes significantly to the observed different flame modes and the transition from deflagration to detonation. In addition, the mechanism of oscillating flame propagation is revealed for the first time by numerical simulations.},

However, even state-of-the-art steady solvers suffer from convergence slowdown or failure when applied to challenging off-design conditions. This severely limits the reliable nonlinear and linearized turbomachinery aerodynamic analysis over a wide operating range. To alleviate the convergence difficulties, a nonlinear flow solver using the Newton–Krylov method is developed. This is the first time the Newton–Krylov algorithm is used for achieving robust analysis of turbomachinery aerodynamics in the open literature. The proposed solution algorithm features 1) the exact Jacobian matrix forming, 2) straightforward parallelization, and 3) a reliable globalization strategy; and it aims to achieve fast machine-zero convergence. The solver accuracy is validated using four test cases: an airfoil, a linear turbine cascade, a centrifugal compressor, and an axial compressor. Machine-zero convergence is achieved for all cases over a wide range of operating conditions without manual intervention. The method shows great potential for enabling an automated and reliable whole-map turbomachinery aerodynamic analysis, and it paves the way for a robust and efficient linearized aerodynamic analysis, such as adjoint, time-linearized, and eigenvalue analyses.},

  abstract     = {The adjoint method is an efficient approach for computing derivatives that allow gradient-based optimization to handle systems parameterized with a large number of design variables. Despite this advantage, implementing the adjoint method for a partial-differential-equation-based primal solver is a time-consuming task. To lower the barrier for adjoint implementations, an object-oriented framework (DAFoam) is proposed to rapidly implement the discrete adjoint method for any steady-state OpenFOAM primal solver by adding or modifying only a few hundred lines of source code. In this paper, the DAFoam framework is introduced and the proposed object-oriented adjoint development process is illustrated. Using this strategy, the adjoint method is implemented for eight primal solvers, five turbulence models, and one radiation model in OpenFOAM. Excellent adjoint speed and scalability, with up to 10 million cells and 1536 CPU cores, and an average error in the adjoint derivatives of less than 0.1\% are achieved. Finally, the implemented adjoint solvers and models are integrated into a gradient-based optimization framework, and four distinct design optimizations (multipoint aerodynamic optimization of a low-speed unmanned-aerial-vehicle wing, aerodynamic optimization of a transonic aircraft configuration, aerothermal optimization of a turbine internal cooling passage, and aerostructural optimization of a compressor rotor) are shown. DAFoam is available under an open-source license and is a powerful tool for the high-fidelity multidisciplinary design optimization of engineering systems, such as aircraft, ground vehicles, marine vessels, and turbomachinery.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an efficient approach for modeling aperiodic flows in an assembly due to geometry distortions. First, a relation is established in physical space between grid displacement and flow perturbation based on linear theory. This relation is then extended to an assembly of components and projected to the Fourier space. A relation is thus constructed between grid displacement and flow perturbation in the frequency domain. Finally, the nonlinear coupling of the passage-averaged mean flow and the flow variations in the assembly is introduced. The capability of the proposed method is demonstrated on the outlet guide vanes of a gas turbine engine with harmonic geometry distortions. Good agreement between the proposed method and the whole assembly computation is observed for the predicted flow perturbations in the assembly. This paper also demonstrates that the harmonic flow perturbation due to each harmonic geometry distortion can be used as a set of basis solutions to generate flowfields related to new combinations of geometry distortions. This has the potential to significantly reduce the computational cost when onerous tasks are expected for iterative design processes of assemblies with geometry distortions.},

A compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver resolves the near field around a vortex generator (a rectangular NACA0012 wing geometry), including its boundary layer. An incompressible large-eddy simulation (LES) solver is used to model the atmosphere around the vortex generator, with its wake footprint in the LES domain being of primary interest. Two validation cases are presented. First, the method is partially validated with data from a wind-tunnel experiment. The second case is a vertical gust-wind simulation, which is compared to an already validated pure RANS approach for calculating the global aerodynamic coefficients given analytically defined atmospheric disturbances. The hybrid method proves to be powerful in cases where large-scale transient atmospheric effects and their interaction with flying aircraft are to be studied.},

The two-dimensional two-component velocity fields were acquired in the central plane of the test nozzle and along the 45° inclined impingement surface by using a planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The flow characteristics of supersonic impinging jets, such as mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy, were computed from the acquired PIV velocity vector fields, and the statistical profiles were compared to study the effects of the impingement surface and on the flow characteristics. The obtained statistical results have shown the presence of shock cells near the nozzle outlet, oblique plate shocks near the impingement, and tail shocks along the inclined surface. In addition, spatial two-point cross-correlations of turbulent velocity were computed using the PIV velocity vectors to study the sizes, shapes, and orientation of turbulent flow structures in the impinging jets.

For that, one isothermal jet at Mach 2 and four others at static temperatures equal to two or four times that of the ambient medium are simulated at either the same exit velocity or Mach number as the isothermal jet. For all temporally developing jets, steepened acoustic waves are emitted in the near field, leading to significant values of the pressure skewness and kurtosis factors. Using conditional averages, their formation is directly linked to the supersonic motion of large-scale structures at a convection speed whose ratio with the jet velocity is shown to decrease with temperature. At a higher temperature, this leads to the generation of less skewed acoustic waves for a constant jet velocity. For a constant Mach number, however, this decrease is compensated by the rise of the jet speed, leading to steeper acoustic waves at a higher temperature. Therefore, the modification of the steepened aspect of near-field acoustic waves appears to be related to the change in the convection speed in both cases.},

  abstract     = {For a transverse gaseous jet in supersonic crossflows, the empirical formula implies that the jet penetration height will monotonically increase with the injection Mach number under a certain crossflow condition. However, due to the high backpressure outside the jet orifice, the penetration height will not go to infinity with further increasing the injection Mach number. In this paper, theoretical derivations and numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of injection Mach number on the jet penetration characteristics of a supersonic jet in an 2.95 crossflow. By proposing an approximation that the backpressure outside the orifice is equal to the pressure of the air inflow passing a normal shock, it is predicted that the jet penetration height reaches its maximum at the Mach number when no shock appears in the Laval nozzle under this backpressure. Furthermore, the distribution characteristics of injectant, the shock structures, and near-wall wake region features were obtained and analyzed. The simulation results show that changing the injection Mach number would significantly influence the structures of shocks and the near-wall wake features, which impacts the spatial distribution of injectant. Similar to the jet penetration height, there also exists a turning point in the variation trend of most structures, rather than monotonously changing with the injection Mach number. For the given condition, the quantitative analysis indicates that the penetration height approximately reaches its peak at injection Mach number , which is consistent with the theoretical assumptions.},

Unsteady pressure measurements inside the cavity revealed six tones, among which the third tone was dominant. The uniqueness of the flow features both outside as well as inside the cavity was studied for one vortex shedding cycle. Analyses using different techniques divulged that the occurrence of the first and second tones was due to wave propagation and vortex shedding, respectively. On the other hand, frequency that corresponds to one time period was correlated to the third tone. Further investigations unveiled that the entrainment of freestream between shear-layer vortices generated type 5 acoustic waves, which were responsible for the production of other cavity tones. The wavelet analyses indicated that the frequencies were amplitude modulated in time, and the wavelet spectra of the second and third tones contain high-energy events along with sporadic distribution of low-energy events without mode switching phenomenon.},

Using four simulations, spanning , the effects of compressibility are examined for constant Reynolds number. The interplay between the laminar separation bubble (LSB), separation within the turbulent boundary layer, and compressibility effects is elucidated. It is shown that increased compressibility results in earlier dynamic-stall onset related to bursting of the leading-edge LSB. Because of this earlier stall onset, which occurs at the leading edge, the role of the turbulent boundary-layer separation in dynamic stall is diminished. It is hypothesized that fundamental changes in the transition mechanism within the LSB, due to compressibility, are the cause of earlier leading-edge breakdown. At a region of supersonic flow develops above the leading-edge LSB. A unique system of compression and expansion structures is observed and documented. It is shown that this system couples with the inherent unsteadiness of the LSB, resulting in a brief period of high-amplitude coherent flow oscillations, before the development of the dynamic-stall vortex (DSV). At this condition, an elliptical shape of the DSV is observed due to the presence of supersonic flow above and below the developing vortex.},

  abstract     = {This work introduces a fluidic oscillator design that allows control over the sweep and inclination angles, independent of the supply flow rate. These capabilities are made possible by injecting fluid from four control ports located in the vicinity of the throat of a feedback-type fluidic oscillator, thus avoiding the addition of any moving mechanical parts. Hot-wire measurements, water flow visualizations, and numerical analyses were used to characterize the fluidic oscillator. The sweep and inclination angles were calculated numerically and extracted from the flow visualizations. Numerical analyses indicated that the sweep angle can be varied from 17 to 70 deg, and the inclination angle can be varied up to 20 deg based on the amount of control flow applied for the considered control port geometries. The oscillation frequencies were observed to decrease with increased control flow rate by up to 5\% for the variable sweep angle design and up to 7.7\% for the variable inclination angle design. Also, the increase in the inclination angle was accompanied by a decrease in sweep angle, and the amount of this decrease was depended on the amount of the control flow applied.},

By setting different rotation speeds, shaft angles, and freestream velocities according to realistic operation conditions, an investigation of a full-scale isolated rotor in a low-speed anechoic wind tunnel is conducted. When the freestream velocity increases and the shaft angle decreases, the thrust, power, moments, and sound pressure level (SPL) of the rotor increase by maintaining the same rotation speed. Through appropriate normalization methods, the loading coefficients and SPL collapse to one surface with respect to the advance ratio and shaft angle, and third-order polynomials are applied to fit nondimensional data.

This paper builds on previous work to improve estimates of element prediction uncertainties where the model has improved, or new validation data are available. These element-level uncertainties are propagated via a Monte Carlo method to the system level for predictions at each of the three certification points. Although the quantitative uncertainty values contained here are specific to the hybrid wing–body configuration presented, the underlying process is the same regardless of configuration. Comparisons with previous work show a reduction of 1.1 EPNdB in the 95\% coverage interval of the cumulative noise level. The largest impediment for continued uncertainty reduction is the need for validation experiments and improved modeling of fan source noise, propulsion airframe aeroacoustic effects, and the Krueger flap source noise, which comprise the bulk of the uncertainty in the cumulative certification noise level.},

  abstract     = {Engine noise reduction using acoustic liner panels is an established technology in the design of bypass turbofan engines. Using acoustic impedance modeling techniques in aeroacoustic simulations, quick assessment of different liner configurations can be made. To minimize the engine noise in the best possible way, optimal liner configurations are ideally determined by employing numerical optimization methods. In general, to exhaust the full potential of the lining technology, it is desired to use a large number of design parameters in the optimization process. In the present work, a multilevel optimization framework is presented for the design of acoustic liner panels, which can efficiently handle large design vectors. The multilevel method combines a global search strategy with a local gradient-based optimization method. The discrete adjoint solver, which is used to evaluate the liner sensitivities required in the local search, has been developed using algorithmic differentiation techniques. This approach allows consistent treatment of boundary conditions in the adjoint part, thereby increasing the robustness and accuracy of the adjoint solver. In this way, the discrete adjoint solver fully incorporates the features of the underlying aeroacoustic solver, such as the impedance modeling and nonreflecting boundary conditions. The feasibility and the efficiency of the multilevel optimization strategy are demonstrated by finding the optimal liner parameters in a turbofan engine bypass duct configuration.},

The main inputs to the method are near-field pressure measurements of the isolated jet, recorded within the flight-stream flow using a microphone with a nose cone. The predicted jet–surface interaction noise is then compared with measured far-field installed jet noise spectra over polar angles from 70 to 130 deg on the unshielded side of the jet. The results show that the model is capable of accurately reproducing both the amplitude and spectral shape of the jet–surface interaction noise up to a flight-stream Mach number of 0.2.},

  abstract     = {Airfoils operating in a turbulent flow are an efficient source of noise radiation by scattering vorticity into sound at the leading edge. Much work has been undertaken demonstrating the effectiveness by which serrations, or undulations, introduced onto the leading edge can substantially reduce broadband leading-edge interaction noise. However, most of this work is focused on sinusoidal leading-edge serration profiles. In this paper, a family of serration profiles is proposed that is capable of providing significantly greater noise reductions than single-wavelength serrations at optimal conditions. This new family of profiles will be shown to reduce interaction noise through a fundamentally different noise reduction mechanism than conventional single-wavelength profiles. Unlike single-wavelength profiles, which produce a single compact dominant source region per serration wavelength, these new profiles are designed to produce two or more dominant compact sources per serration wavelength of roughly the same source strength that are separated in the streamwise direction. Because these sources are arranged to be closer together than the turbulence length scale, they are highly coherent and, at certain frequencies, radiate exactly 180 deg out of phase, leading to very high levels of noise reduction in the far field. The experimental noise reduction spectra are first compared against an analytic model obtained as a solution of the acoustic wave equation using the Wiener–Hopf technique. This approach focuses solely on solving for an acoustic field, and not for any secondary vorticity induced by the edge. As such, this comparison, which shows disagreement, proves that secondary vorticity is a dominant mechanism for these new profiles. A simple supplementary analytical model has therefore been developed to explain this noise reduction mechanism for these new profiles, based on interference between sources distributed along the leading edge. Good qualitative agreement is obtained with the experimental results.},

Fan and turbine tone spectral broadening is known colloquially as “haystacking”. Recently a new analytical model has been derived to predict weak spectral broadening of a tone radiated through a circular jet. A key part of the modeling is the choice of the two-point turbulent velocity cross-correlation function, which is used to provide a statistical description of the turbulence in the shear layer. A new cross-correlation function for an axisymmetric turbulent shear layer formed by a circular jet, based on the theory for homogeneous axisymmetric turbulence, has been developed. Validation results of weak-scattering calculated using this correlation function show better agreement with measurements when compared with the results calculated using a correlation function based on the theory for homogeneous isotropic turbulence.},

In wind-tunnel or flight experiments with discrete roughness elements, the fluctuations most likely arise from the interaction of the elements with background turbulence or base-flow fluctuations. If plasma actuators are applied instead, they directly enhance—unintended by discharge randomness—the low-frequency fluctuation level of the flow, degrading the control effectiveness that is based on inducing steady control vortices. To elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the promoted transition due to low-frequency fluctuations, the present work focused on localized volume forcing, modeling two actuator configurations, that is, plasma virtual roughness elements and streamwise vortex generators. The noise is introduced by modulating the steady volume force using a broadband low-frequency signal. Even when the steady control mode clearly dominates over low-frequency traveling disturbances, transition can still be significantly accelerated by the known secondarily amplified type III modes. Compared with the much localized active or passive roughness elements investigated in previous crossflow experiments, elongated vortex generators spreading over a larger streamwise distance diminish the receptivity of misaligned traveling modes and thus offer a better control performance.},

Through the spatiotemporal analysis, the onset of absolute instability is systematically analyzed in parametric space for uniform and nonuniform density cases. Five unstable azimuthal wavenumbers (, ) studied show that, although mode first becomes absolutely unstable, it is the mode associated with the precessing vortex core that turns out to be more unstable for high swirl numbers and reduced shear layer thickness. The imposition of density field, representative of reacting flows, suppresses the absolute instability mode by shifting its onset to higher backflow velocities. Further, to investigate the cause of instabilities, a total disturbance energy equation is obtained with various energy feeding/depleting terms. Although the axial shear is the dominant production term, the alignment of pressure redistribution and density variation terms provides the necessary stabilization to weaken the absolute instabilities.},

In this study, a resolvent analysis is performed on both laminar and turbulent flows over a rectangular cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of at a freestream Mach number of in a spanwise periodic setting.

The features of response and forcing modes from the turbulent cavity flow are similar to the spatial structures from the laminar analysis. It is further found that the large amplification of energy in the flow response is associated with the high frequency for turbulent flow, whereas the flow is more responsive to the low-frequency excitation in the laminar case.

  abstract     = {A linear nonmodal mechanism for transient amplification of perturbation energy is known to trigger subcritical transition to turbulence in many shear flows. Feedback control strategies for minimizing this transient energy growth can be formulated as convex optimization problems based on linear matrix inequalities. Unfortunately, solving the requisite linear matrix inequality problem can be computationally prohibitive within the context of high-dimensional fluid flows. This paper investigates the utility of control-oriented reduced-order models to facilitate the design of feedback flow control strategies that minimize the maximum transient energy growth. An output projection onto proper orthogonal decomposition modes is used to faithfully capture the system energy. Subsequently, a balanced truncation is performed to reduce the state dimension, while preserving the system’s input-output properties. The model reduction and control approaches are studied within the context of a linearized channel flow with blowing and suction actuation at the walls. Controller synthesis for this linearized channel flow system becomes tractable through the use of the proposed control-oriented reduced-order models.

  abstract     = {The damage behavior of a helicopter rotor blade made of carbon fiber polymer composite has been numerically investigated using a synergistic damage mechanics (SDM) model. Laminates of the quasi-isotropic stacking sequence have been considered in this study. The simulations were performed, corresponding to a hovering condition and for a range of the angles of attack and rotational speeds of the blade. The aerodynamic and centrifugal loads due to different angles of attack and rotational speeds have been computed by using fluid dynamics simulations. A structural analysis was then performed using the aerodynamic loads. Using the SDM model, the matrix crack density and crack multiplication were evaluated to predict the damage initiation site and maximum crack density occurring in the plies of the laminate under the operational conditions. It was observed that maximum crack appeared in the blade at extreme operational conditions; among the different plies, a ply was cracked by the maximum amount. A crack density of around was predicted in the ply at an operational condition with a 500 rpm blade rotation and an 18 deg angle of attack of the blade. The present study demonstrates application of the progressive damage modeling in designing a composite helicopter blade by considering its performance parameters.},

  abstract     = {Micro air vehicles are used for both civil and military applications, like rescue or surveillance. The aerodynamic performance of the rotor is known to be lower than for classical large rotors, due to increased drag at low Reynolds numbers. However, the rotor performance can be improved by taking advantage of the flow unsteadiness and considering unsteady rotor kinematics, like a periodic variation of the rotor pitch. To study such behaviors, it is necessary to develop numerical methods adapted to these fluid–structure interaction phenomena, which are the main objectives of this paper. The method relies on the implementation of fluid–structure interaction capabilities in a lattice–Boltzmann flow solver, which is implemented in a monolithic fashion using generalized coordinates. The validation is first conducted on a vortex-induced vibration test case. Then, numerical simulations are performed for a rotor test case 1) with a forced motion and 2) by coupling the flow with the equation of the dynamics. Some semianalytical models are derived and validated against the numerical simulations to predict the effects of pitching, flapping, and surging on the thrust. The results show that flapping and surging significantly increase the rotor thrust, but at the price of a penalty on the power consumption.},

The elastic modulus and density are varied throughout the thickness of the coating material with both a polynomial and an exponential function, whereas a classical lamination theory is applied to determine the effective elastic modulus and density. To model the gradually changing mechanical properties in a truthful way, the coating is represented by 25 layers of material, whereas each layer itself is homogeneous and isotropic. To obtain a numerical solution, the Timoshenko finite element model beam theory (which also takes first-order shear deformation effects into account) is used. For this purpose, a finite element code is written in MATLAB and the natural frequencies of the beam are found. A detailed parametric study is conducted to show the influences of the core thickness to beam height ratio , the beam span to height ratio , the exponential function and power law index , and multiple boundary conditions on the natural beam frequencies. It was observed that the studied parameters had a significant effect on the natural frequencies.},

The corrected beam theory is simpler than the classical one because it leads to a single frequency series in the vibrating analysis, without loss of the effect of shear deformation and rotary inertia. In this paper, a further modification is proposed based on Elishakoff’s correction such that the resulting single frequency series fits quite well with the first branch of the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory up to a relatively high frequency (i.e., the cutoff frequency of Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beams). Most strikingly, the present modification is found to be suitable not only for homogeneous and uniform beams but also for a wide class of beam structures with axial inhomogeneity and/or variable cross section. An inhomogeneous and nonuniform beam with two sharp ends is analytically studied in detail using several different engineering beam models, which fully verifies the necessity and high accuracy of the present modification, particularly for beam structures composed of materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.},

The symmetrical dynamic system possesses a set of biorthonormal right modes so that the two-sided normalization method is engaged. In contrast, in an asymmetrical dynamic system, the two-sided normalization technique is not effective. In our presentation, the results are derived in terms of a complex mode so that the uniqueness of the complex mode and its sensitivities are kept. The algorithms make the calculations more precise and easier to perform.

  abstract     = {This study starts with defining generalized displacements. Together with the assumptions and shear-stress-free conditions, the in-plane displacements of a functionally graded (FG) plate are first mathematically assumed, and then orthogonally decomposed into three terms with the aid of a neutral surface. The generalized stresses are accordingly defined, and the constitutive relations are derived for an FG plate after the generalized strains are measured. The principles of virtual work (PVW) are eventually expressed for FG plate problems. Compared with the previous work in this field, due to the use of frame-indifferent generalized displacements, the in-plane displacements are physically interpreted as tension part, bending part, and high-order bending part. Because of the use of frame-indifferent generalized stresses and generalized strains, mutual couplings of tension, bending, and higher-order bending are removed in the constitutive relations. More important, the lower-order theory of an FG plate is mathematically correlated with the higher-order theory from the viewpoint of PVW. With these fundamentals, finite element formulations are derived and two kinds of plate elements are constructed. Typical examples show that the elements can yield satisfactory deflection and rotation, whereas the high-order element can also capture the boundary effect of shear force at the clamped edge.},

The methods currently known in the literature for finding the buckling loads of plates are mainly numerical. Although some plates with specific boundary conditions have analytical solutions, a comprehensive analytical method providing analytical solutions that fit all possible combinations of boundary conditions is lacking. The solution method in this study is based on the development of a static solution for a plate. The physical meaning of buckling is the loss of stiffness, and it is found as the value of the in-plane loading intensity at which a zero force on the plate surface will generate infinite displacement. The solution is obtained in series form, and the coefficients are solved to match the edge conditions. The solution presented for this plate will fit different boundary conditions of the deflection, slope, shear force, and bending moment along the common edges of neighboring plates. Using this new method, exact buckling loads and the buckling modes of many new cases of classical boundary conditions are found (cases involving clamped, simply supported, guided, and free boundaries). Results are given for several stiffness ratios in both directions of the plate, as well as for unidirectional and several cases of bidirectional loading.},

The approach fuses multifidelity data from disparate information sources available to designers, such as disciplinary simulations, experiments, and operational data from previously deployed systems. The multifidelity data fusion is achieved using a fidelity-weighted combination of Gaussian process surrogate models. This weighting takes into account both the quality of the Gaussian process approximation and the designer’s confidence in the underlying information source being approximated. The resulting multifidelity surrogate provides a rapid analysis capability, which in turn enables the high number of evaluations needed to conduct multidisciplinary trade studies and to propagate uncertainty to the overall system level. The methodology is broadly applicable across engineering design problems where multiple information sources are available to support design decisions. In this paper, the approach is demonstrated on the stability and control analysis of a Blended-Wing-Body aircraft’s center-of-gravity limits, considering the longitudinal criteria of fly-to-stall, stall recovery, nose-wheel steering, and nose-wheel liftoff. The results show that low-fidelity models are enhanced by the presence of higher-fidelity data in key areas of the design space. The presence of even sparse high-fidelity data is key to reducing the variance in the overall analysis, thereby improving the quality of the predictions needed to inform early stage design decisions.},

The use of low-fidelity modeling is also not appropriate, because it leads to significant error in calibration. A multifidelity approach is pursued, where a limited number of high-fidelity runs are used to improve a low-fidelity-based surrogate model, resulting in stronger physics-informed priors for calibration with experimental data. Two optimization approaches are studied: the first selects high-fidelity model runs that maximize the information gain in the modeling stage within the multifidelity approach, and the second selects the number and location of the sensors in the experimental setup to maximize the information gain from the experiments. The proposed methodologies are illustrated for a curved panel subjected to acoustic and nonuniform thermal loading. Two models of different fidelity are employed to calibrate the damping and model errors. The optimization methodology considers two complicating factors: 1) the damping behavior is input-dependent, and 2) the sensor uncertainty is affected by temperature.},

  abstract     = {The traditional osculating cones’ (OCs’) waverider design method is widely used in hypersonic waverider airframe design. However, it becomes ineffective when the shock strength in each osculating plane varies and the azimuthal pressure gradients appear to be important. To solve this problem, a method called the multiple osculating cones’ (multiple-OCs’) waverider design method has been developed for ruled shock surfaces. The new method discretizes the ruled shock surface into elements that can be derived from multiple locally conical flows. Multiple locally conical flows indicate that neighboring osculating planes have different shock generators. This feature not only provides a practical way to represent the azimuthal pressure gradients but also extends the variety of waverider designs. Waverider test cases at and are performed by the osculating cones with variable shock angles’ (OC-VSAs’) method and the multiple-OCs’ method, respectively. It has been shown that the multiple-OCs’ method is applicable to more generalized shock surfaces. The comparison results reveal that the waverider derived by the multiple-OCs’ method has a better agreement with the computational fluid dynamics solution than the OC-VSAs’ method. Moreover, the new method ensures a more homogeneous inlet captured flowfield on the bottom side of the waverider, which is favorable for hypersonic airframe propulsion integration.},

The wall temperature distribution is calculated by using the thermal impulse and step responses of porous media, increasing the calculation speed significantly. A heat flux balance is considered for a one-dimensional porous material. The code is validated with experimental data of plasma wind tunnel tests and the SHEFEX II flight experiment. The transient heating of a flat plate model in a steady-state flow condition in the Arc-heated wind tunnel 2 (L2 K) plasma wind tunnel is assessed for both uncooled and transpiration-cooled cases. The SHEFEX II flight simulation accounts for transient external flow conditions and is used to assess the downstream coolant film effect after the injection point. The trends of experimental temperature measurements are replicated well by the simulations. The predicted and measured temperatures are in good agreement and within a margin of 10\% with maximum deviations of 40 K.},

The performance of transpiration cooling is assessed by calculating the overall required coolant mass for different steady-state and transient flight scenarios. Spatially and temporally optimized mass injection is presented for various flight conditions. The majority of the injection is required on the spherical nose segment of the blunted cone.

Experiments were conducted in a free-piston compression-heated Ludwieg tube that provided a Mach 5.8 flow at a freestream Reynolds number of . A shock generator deflected the flow by 10°, resulting in an oblique shock impinging on a flat plate. The shock triggered transition in the boundary layer and the formation of Görtler-like vortices downstream of reattachment. Heat flux and pressure distributions on the plate were measured globally using infrared thermography and pressure-sensitive paint. Oil film visualization was employed to evaluate the boundary-layer reattachment. Numerical results consist of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and fully laminar steady-state three-dimensional simulations. Shock-induced transition is considered to be the cause of the overshoot in peak pressure and peak heating of approximately 15\%, in agreement with previous studies. Görtler instability, triggered by the concave nature of the bubble at separation, is identified as the main mechanism leading to boundary-layer transition, resulting in heat-flux variations of less than 30\%. By comparing numerical results against thermographic values it is possible to delineate the extent of transition. Within this region, the disturbance amplification factor was estimated to be approximately between 6 and 10, in reasonable agreement with other relevant numerical and experimental data.},

A combined attitude control system using both aerodynamic control surfaces and reaction control thrusters has been applied to some of the latest military flight vehicles. This paper aims to shed some light on the interaction between a control surface and a downstream control jet, which has rarely been studied. A model consisting of a flat plate, a fin, and a transverse jet is tested using various experimental techniques at Mach 5 to investigate the complex interaction between the fin and the downstream jet. Schlieren and planar laser scattering are used to study the pattern of shock wave interactions and structures in the boundary layer, and pressure-sensitive paint is used to examine the pressure distribution on the flat plate. The results show that the state of the approaching boundary layer, the structure of the jet-induced bow shock, and the pressure distribution around the nozzle are sensitive to the position of the jet relative to the fin. The pressure around the nozzle exit is substantially increased in all three cases tested, and the highest peak pressure occurs when the jet is located after the fin-induced reattachment shock. However, by integrating the surface pressure, the highest side force on the flat plate is noticed to occur when the jet nozzle is located between the fin-induced separation shock and reattachment shock.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents aeroacoustic investigations on a full-scale ultrahigh-bypass-ratio engine with inflow distortion at transonic conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are first realized to compute the shocks in the vicinity of the fan. These shocks are then radiated in the near field thanks to computational aeroacoustics (CAA) simulations. The chaining between CFD and CAA simulations is done by injecting the shocks in terms of usual conservative variables using a nonreflecting boundary condition. The CAA solver is based on the nonlinearized Euler equations, which allows definition of the CFD/CAA interface close to the fan where the propagation of shocks is highly nonlinear. Both shock generation and propagation mechanisms are investigated, and the effects of inflow distortion are highlighted by comparison with a baseline case without distortion. The flow distortion is shown to be responsible for a modification of shock amplitudes along the circumferential direction. Thus, azimuthal modes appear in addition to the rotor-locked mode present without distortion. A particular feature of the studied configuration is the presence of a supersonic flow region in the bottom part of the nacelle. This supersonic pocket blocks the shocks in the lower half of the nacelle and modifies the angle at which they leave the nacelle in its upper half. Consequently, the far-field radiation (obtained using Kirchhoff’s integral method) is mainly oriented skyward and toward the side of descending blades. Acoustic power estimates are provided to quantify these effects.},

However, the classical Roe scheme suffers from disastrous problems, such as shock instability for hypersonic flows. The entropy fix and the rotated Riemann solver are common methods used to cure the shock instability. However, these methods may introduce a large and unnecessary numerical dissipation. To cure the shock instability with a minimally increasing numerical dissipation, this study investigates the mechanisms of entropy fix and rotated Roe scheme and combines their complementary advantages. Thus, this paper proposes the Roe-ER scheme, which uses the rotated method to identify where the entropy fix is necessary. Therefore, the possible large dissipation of the rotated Roe scheme is replaced by the relatively small value of entropy fix, and areas that adopt the entropy fix are limited in regions where the shock instability may occur. Numerical cases validate the Roe-ER scheme, which is shock stable, features a low additional numerical dissipation, and can use high-order reconstruction to further reduce areas that activate the entropy fix.},

The shock strength was small enough that the incoming boundary layer remained unseparated, allowing for direct investigation of the influence of 3-D relief on the SBLI. Complementary experimental and computational investigations were made to obtain a detailed understanding of the mean flow. The surface streaklines exhibited an inward tilt toward the fin root when compared to a planar configuration. Furthermore, the overall compression across the SBLI was always smaller than the planar configuration, and the compression magnitude monotonically decreased with downstream distance. Investigations of the offbody shock structure revealed an outboard curvature of the shock stem as it approached the cylinder surface and an associated decreased shock strength near the cylinder surface. The modified shock’s effects on the resulting overall compression became noticeable where the inviscid shock stem displayed weakening just above the boundary layer.},

  abstract     = {The development of next-generation high-maneuverability aircraft requires new technologies for controlling asymmetric separated vortices at high angles of attack. Plasma flow control is an emerging type of active flow control technology that can be used to control asymmetric vortices over slender bodies by means of pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators. However, some problems worthy of further study remain unsolved. For example, the stimulation strength is inadequate, the region of discharge is small, and the control mechanism is unclear. This paper proposes a double-side sliding pulsed discharge (DSPD) plasma actuator that combines a sinusoidal alternating current (AC) pulsed plasma actuator with two high-voltage direct current (DC) components. This actuator can generate two groups of unsymmetrical large-scale coherent vortex structures to balance the vorticity of the asymmetric vortices over the slender forebody of an aircraft and increase the distance between the cores of the asymmetric vortices, weakening the interaction between the vortices and hindering the emergence of the asymmetric phenomenon. Focusing on the key scientific issue of DSPD plasma actuation, the discharge morphologies and electrical properties under different DC conditions are studied, and the unsteady vortex structures induced by the DSPD plasma actuator under a static atmosphere are revealed through high-speed schlieren system and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The flow control ability of the DSPD plasma actuator is verified through wind tunnel experiments, and the main rules governing its influence on the external flowfield are determined. It is speculated that this actuator will further improve the aerodynamic flow control of slender aircraft.},

To find this similarity parameter, the effects of the Reynolds number (309–1238) and pore size (0.07–0.20) on the vortex rings/porous wall interaction are investigated by laser-induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. By dimensional analysis and quantitative investigation of PIV data, a similarity parameter is proposed to effectively characterize the losses in jet dynamical parameters, such as momentum flux, kinetic energy, and vortex ring circulation, due to impingement onto a porous wall. Physically, reflects the relative importance of the forces due to the momentum relative to the viscous forces, and the drag forces associated with the porous wall geometry. Finally, the results of the flow visualization validate that the near-wall flow structure during the interaction is qualitatively similar at the closest matching .},

  abstract     = {The wall-modeled large-eddy simulation branch of the widely used improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES) method is supposed to resolve the problems of log-layer mismatch and underprediction of skin friction, as claimed by the authors of the IDDES (Shur, M. L., Spalart, P. R., Strelets, M. K., and Travin, A. K., &quot;A Hybrid RANS-LES Model with Delayed DES and Wall-Modeled LES Capabilities,&quot; International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, Vol. 29, 2008, pp. 1638–1649). But, some researchers did meet these problems when using the IDDES. Aiming at finding out the reason and seeking a remedy, an analysis of the IDDES is carried out that focuses on the relation between the wall-parallel grid size and the length scale of the energetic turbulent structures at the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)/large-eddy simulation (LES) interface, and it reveals that the flaw of the IDDES arises from the fact that, in the IDDES approach, the energetic, large-scale, and stress-carrying turbulent structures in the vicinity of the RANS/LES interface are essentially impossible to well resolve by the LES mode. On the basis of the analysis, a modification to the IDDES is proposed by moving the RANS/LES interface further away from the wall so that, at the RANS/LES interface, the wall-parallel grid size is sufficient to resolve the turbulent structures. The modification is simple in form but has clear physical meaning. Through a series of sensitivity tests, it can be concluded that the modified IDDES does resolve the problems of log-layer mismatch and underprediction of skin friction, and it is applicable to low-, moderate-, and high-Reynolds-number flat plate boundary-layer flows without exception.},

The distributed surface roughness is reproduced with an immersed boundary technique, and the freestream turbulence is artificially generated by a superposition of eigenmodes of the Orr–Sommerfeld and Squire equations. Both an undisturbed laminar inflow and a disturbed inflow with freestream turbulence are studied. In either case a parametric study on the effects of the roughness size and density is carried out. The simulations reveal that the presence of roughness induces streaks in the laminar flow. When the freestream is turbulent, both roughness height and density show an impact on the onset of transition. The superposition of surface roughness and freestream turbulence causes amplified streaks. As a result, the streak instability occurs earlier within the boundary layer. The results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement to both experimental and numerical studies available in the literature.},

High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics loose-coupling simulations were performed for air-load prediction using the high-fidelity rotorcraft aeromechanics simulation software Helios, and impulsive loading noise was simulated using the acoustic prediction software PSU-WOPWOP at eight microphones positioned below the lower rotor plane. No significant discrepancy in air-load and acoustic predictions was found between the three turbulence modeling cases [Spalart–Allmaras (SA)–Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, SA–detached-eddy simulation, and SA–delayed-detached-eddy simulation] with . It was found that the case showed a good convergence of impulsive loading noise at most microphones in terms of the wake-grid resolution. Isolated rotor simulations were also carried out to quantify the relative importance of the two impulsive loading-noise sources of a lift-offset coaxial rotor: self-blade–vortex interaction (BVI) and blade-crossover events. Contours of induced inflow ratio on the rotor disks revealed higher induced velocity for the lift-offset coaxial rotor than the isolated rotors. The higher induced flow ratio reduced the distribution of sectional normal force, strength of self-BVIs, and BVI noise of the lift-offset coaxial rotor. Even with the reduced BVI noise, the lift-offset coaxial rotor showed a dramatically higher impulsive sound-pressure level than the isolated rotors, especially at high speed, as a consequence of mainly blade-crossover events.},

This is in addition to the well-known nonlinear effects within the holes of the perforated lining facing sheet. This paper presents a mathematical investigation into the effects of weak nonlinearity on the acoustics within a thin parallel mean flow boundary layer in flow over an acoustic lining in a cylindrical duct. (This is the first investigation of nonlinear acoustics in a boundary-layer flow over a nonrigid surface, to our knowledge.) In certain cases, a surprisingly large acoustic streaming effect is found that escapes the mean flow boundary layer and pervades well out into the interior of the duct.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation fan designs featuring large bypass ratios have the potential to reduce rotor–stator interaction noise of fans. However, these designs pose new challenges and long-held beliefs regarding the acoustic benefit of such concepts that need to be evaluated. At off-design operating points, the increase in nozzle area serves to maintain the stall margin by reducing the fan loading. To an extent, this may lower the contribution of wake turbulence to fan broadband noise. Therefore, investigating the relative contribution of other noise sources becomes relevant. In this paper, the authors examine the contribution of wake and ingested turbulence to fan broadband noise levels at approach for the ASPIRE fan, which is a next-generation fan concept. To enable the investigation of background turbulence, a Reynolds stress turbulence model is used. The computational fluid dynamics solution then provides inputs for a two-dimensional cyclostationary synthetic turbulence method. The noise predictions are improved by performing simulations at three spanwise positions and by introducing a correction technique to account for the three-dimensional interstage flow. For the investigated case, it is shown that broadband noise generated at the stator is as high as for conventional concepts. Furthermore, both wake and background turbulence contribute significantly to the overall fan broadband noise.},

  abstract     = {In many areas of data science, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn complex, nonlinear relationships between sets of variables. In this paper, this network architecture is applied to several different tasks relating to high-speed turbulent flows. In the first section, linear stochastic estimation (LSE) as proposed by Adrian (“On the Role of Conditional Averages in Turbulence Theory,” Symposium on Turbulence in Liquids, 1977; and “Conditional Eddies in Isotropic Turbulence,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 22, No. 11, 1979, pp. 2065–2070) is reformulated as a machine learning problem, and the two methods are compared. Both a DNN and a LSE model are trained to estimate fluctuating pressure at a subset of locations in the near field of a Mach 0.6 jet, given the pressure measured at other locations. It is shown that DNNs exhibit a slight performance benefit over traditional LSE models on average. The second part of this paper focuses on the utilization of an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the directional overall sound pressure level (OASPL) in the far field of a supersonic multistream jet. A database was created, describing the near-field and far-field conditions of a complex nonaxisymmetric jet flow, with Mach numbers ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. The problem was posed as a form of multivariate nonlinear regression, and an ANN was used to create a model. A feature space consisting of plausible predictors of the far-field directional OASPL was defined, based on previous fundamental studies and jet noise scaling laws. On average, the ANN was able to predict the directional far-field OASPL within 0.75 dB, surpassing original goals. In addition to these topics, some limitations and possible extensions of the methods described herein are discussed.},

The focus is to understand the trade space between cost and accuracy, where different forms of the POD technique are concerned. Of particular importance is the upfront expense of employing “classical” or snapshot forms of the POD technique in both scalar and vector forms using either time-suppressed data (conventional POD) or kernels constructed from cross-spectral densities of the fluctuating velocity. The latter approach is referred to as harmonic POD so as not to exclude harmonic transforms in space. The flow over a simple frigate ship is an ideal testbed, given that it is unsteady, three-dimensional, and inhomogeneous in all spatial directions, as well as stationary in time. The spatial modes from all three techniques are shown to correspond to unique timescales, thereby demonstrating how the preservation of the temporal behavior associated with a particular spatial scale is not unique to the harmonic-POD approach.},

Specifically, the proposed framework integrates projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) that are developed using bases generated on truncated domain simulations. The ROM training is performed on truncated domains, and thus does not require full-order model solutions on the full rocket geometry, thus demonstrating the potential to greatly reduce training costs. Geometry-specific training is replaced by the response generated by perturbing the characteristics at the boundary of the truncated domain. This training method is shown to enhance the predictive capabilities and robustness of the resulting ROMs, including at conditions outside the training range. Numerical tests are conducted on a quasi-one-dimensional model of a single-element rocket combustor, and the present framework is compared to traditional ROM development approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper extends the resolvent formalism for wall turbulence to account for the effect of streamwise-constant riblets. Under the resolvent formulation, the Navier–Stokes equations are interpreted as a forcing-response system: the nonlinear convective term is interpreted as a feedback forcing on the remaining linear terms, which generates a velocity and pressure response. A gain-based decomposition of the linear forcing-response transfer function—the resolvent operator—yields highly amplified velocity and pressure modes, which can be considered key building blocks of the turbulent flow field. Previous work has shown that these high-gain modes provide substantial insight into turbulence statistics, structure, and control of smooth-walled flows. To introduce the effect of riblets within this framework, a linear spatially varying body force is added to the governing equations. In other words, volume penalization is used to approximate the surface features. Predictions for spanwise-periodic and streamwise-constant riblets show that specific high-gain modes identified from the modified governing equations reproduce observations made in prior direct numerical simulations with limited computation. The deterioration in performance with increasing riblet size is predicted well and so is the emergence of spanwise rollers resembling Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices. This new modeling framework is also used to pursue limited riblet shape optimization.},

Resolvent analysis also guides where measurements of the mean and fluctuating quantities are needed for efficient reconstruction of a simple example case study: flow around a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of . For this flow, resolvent analysis reveals that the leading singular value, most amplified modes, and the mean profile for scale with the shedding frequency and length of the recirculation bubble. A relationship between these two parameters reinforces the notion that a wave maker, for which the length scales with the recirculation bubble, determines the frequency and region where an instability mechanism is active.

  abstract     = {Dynamic mode decomposition has emerged as a leading technique to identify spatiotemporal coherent structures from high-dimensional data, benefiting from a strong connection to nonlinear dynamical systems via the Koopman operator. In this work, two recent innovations that extend dynamic mode decomposition to systems with actuation and systems with heavily subsampled measurements are integrated and unified. When combined, these methods yield a novel framework for compressive system identification. It is possible to identify a low-order model from limited input–output data and reconstruct the associated full-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to the state of the reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data are available, it is possible to dramatically accelerate downstream computations by first compressing the data. This unified framework is demonstrated on two model systems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of measurements (e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.), compression ratios, and different choices of actuation (e.g., localized, broadband, etc.). In the first example, this architecture is explored on a test system with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state dimension. The second example consists of a real-world engineering application given by the fluid flow past a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This example provides a challenging and realistic test case for the proposed method, and results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well characterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data.},

  abstract     = {In the present paper, a surrogate-based methodology is developed and applied to the design of a control surface placed on an artillery projectile. An artificial neural network is used to estimate the aerodynamic contribution of the control device from numerical simulations. These estimations are coupled to a flight mechanics code to evaluate the trajectories of controlled projectiles. From these six-/seven-degree-of-freedom computations, the trajectories modifications are modeled using kriging. A correction device should minimize the distance to a ellipse (with as the projectile standard deviation of the projectile dispersion) around the mean impact point while ensuring problem-specific constraint fulfillment. The kriging databases are sequentially enriched with the impact point position of the projectile configurations maximizing the expected improvement criterion until a convergence state, assessed by leave-one-out cross validation, is reached. Computational-fluid-dynamics-based evaluations of the optimum configuration coefficients provide a refinement of the neural network databases in the relevant area of the design space. A course correction corresponding to a decrease of two standard deviations in the lateral direction and an increase of two standard deviations in range is achieved, respectively, by reducing the pitching moment of the projectile and increasing its lift-to-drag ratio.},

  abstract     = {The unsteady flow past a reverse delta wing is simulated numerically to characterize the structure of the vortical flow and associated unsteady phenomena, and quantify the impact of such structures on the aerodynamic performance. The most cost-effective grid-size/time-step combination is selected by performing a coupled sensitivity analysis. This numerical approach is successfully validated against well-established results for a delta wing. It is established that the flow past a reverse delta wing is always unsteady even at small angles of attack. The shear layer separating at the leading edge of the reverse delta wing rolls up into spanwise vortical structures that, as they are convected downstream, pair, realign, and reorganize, generating suction that contributes substantially to the lift produced by a reverse delta wing. The tip vortices confine the vortical structures to the leeward side and contribute to a less extent to lift. Power spectral density analysis shows that the unsteadiness of the lift coefficient is related to vortex shedding and reorganization of the vortical structures. Finally, it is confirmed that the lift-to-drag ratio of a delta wing and a reverse delta wing is, surprisingly, about the same.},

The aim of this simulation is twofold: the first objective is to perform a detailed flow analysis and identify the physical flow mechanisms responsible for noise generation; the second objective is to provide an important numerical database that may be used to assess more affordable numerical approaches based, for instance, on hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation (LES) methods. The assessment of the present LES relies on an extensive database, which was collected during a campaign performed in the ONERA F2 wind tunnel in the framework of LEISA2: a joint ONERA/DLR, German Aerospace Center project. The results of the present LES show an overall agreement with the measurements that is generally within the experimental uncertainty, especially in the slat and flap coves. Differences between the LES and the experiments are present on the flap suction side, where the flow is observed to be very sensitive to slight modifications of the numerical or experimental conditions. The simulation confirms that a large-scale coupled self-sustained oscillations mechanism is present between the slat and flap cavities. Some insight about the transition process on the main wing suction side is also discussed in the paper.},

  abstract     = {Covert feathers, a group of feathers on the upper surface of bird wings, are one of birds’ features that aid them in flight at high angles of attack, making them more maneuverable. In a previous study, the authors found that a rudimentary emulation of this feature (termed a self-adaptive flap) enhances the poststall lift characteristics of low-aspect-ratio flat-plate wings at . This enhancement, however, was found to vary with the different chordwise locations of the flap and across different planforms. In a continued effort to understand this further, two-dimensional particle image velocimetry investigation was carried out in the midspan plane of the low-aspect-ratio wings. For the varying-span elliptical wings, the results reveal that the flap/shear layer interaction promotes reattachment of the separated shear layer via increased entrainment. This reattachment location varies for the different chordwise location of the flap, resulting in a different extent of the separation bubble and bubble-induced camber, which in turn is responsible for different poststall lift enhancement. On the other hand, for the rectangular wing, the flap promotes large-scale vortex formation. The formation and shedding cycle of large-scale vortices has a significant impact on the mean-body forces because of which the time-averaged poststall lift is enhanced.},

Numerical techniques are regularly used to supplement testing and to predict hydrodynamic ram damage in structures. This study was used to evaluate the viability of using a coarse mesh cohesive zone modeling technique to model a bonded joint in concert with LS-DYNA arbitrary Lagrangian–Euler fluid structure interaction algorithm to ascertain the joint resistance to hydrodynamic ram pressures generated in a RamGun. The ballistic testing approach was used to determine the failure pressure range for a joint that was used to calibrate the numerical model. The calibrated coarse mesh was able to predict joint failure in line with the test pressure values and also captured failure modes for various coupons of varying skin thicknesses. This will serve as a baseline for modeling and assessing joint failure in larger structures like fuel tanks and storage containers subjected to hydrodynamic ram.},

The proposed technique, called “min-max load approach,” is able to dynamically capture the local stress ratio during the progression of delamination. The possibility to know the local stress ratio is relevant in all the situations where its value is different from the applied load ratio and cannot be determined a priori. The methodology analyzes in a single finite element analysis two identical models with two different constant loads, the minimum and the maximum load of the fatigue cycle. The two models interact with each other, exchanging information to calculate the crack growth rate. At first, the approach has been validated in simulations of mode I and mixed-mode propagation using double cantilever beam and mixed-mode bending tests. Then, to prove the effectiveness of the developed methodology, a modified version of the mixed-mode bending test has been analyzed. Mode I and mode II components of the load are decoupled and applied independently, resulting in a local stress ratio different from the applied load ratio. The results obtained from the simulations, compared with the analytical model obtained using the corrected beam theory, show that the proposed approach is able to predict the local stress ratio and thereby to correctly evaluate the crack growth rate during the propagation of the damage.},

To fill this gap, low-Reynolds-number experiments were conducted on the flow-induced flutter of a suspended elastic membrane. This configuration has well-defined boundary conditions and exhibits a variety of flutter regimes, thereby making it a suitable case for validation. Silicon sheets of three different thicknesses are used as the material for the suspended membrane, and the other key variables in the study are the flow speed and the yaw angle of the membrane. The deflection and flutter motion of each membrane is measured using a high-speed imaging system. A variety of flutter regimes are observed for the parameters studied here, including nominally two-dimensional flutter as well as highly three-dimensional motion for nonzero yaw angles. Qualitative as well as quantitative features of the flutter are cataloged in order to provide a comprehensive dataset for validation.},

  abstract     = {This study aims to develop a linear nonintrusive reduced-order model (NIROM) for facilitating combined fast parametric analysis and reconstruction of unsteady aerodynamic flow variables by using a novel signal interpolation approach, which is combined with a subspace-identification-based method. The NIROM is then applied to airfoil flutter and gust interaction problems where the assumption of linearized dynamics gives reasonably accurate estimates. In the traditional subspace-identification method, the training datasets of force coefficient signals corresponding to each flow parameter (like the Mach number and angle of attack) are required to generate the linear time-invariant system. The generation of the training signal for each flow parameter is the most computationally expensive process in any parametric reduced-order model (ROM). In the present work, the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) combined with the radial basis function (RBF) method is used for the interpolation of training signals at a specific flow parameter to reduce the overall computational cost. The conventional nonintrusive approaches are generally constrained by the number of output channels, and hence not suitable for the reconstruction of unsteady surface force distribution or flowfield variables. A few suitable sensor locations using the DEIM are selected as output channels of the subspace-identification method to realize the full datasets of surface force distribution over the airfoil. Finally, a suitable algorithmic structure is proposed to achieve unsteady distributive flow-variable reconstruction and parametric variation simultaneously. The current signal interpolation-based NIROM is applied to a wing section with two- and four-degree-of-freedom structural motions.},

First, the motion equations of two aeroelastic models including time-delay signals are derived, and the response sensitivity analysis with respect to the system parameters is conducted. Then, parameter identification is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem, and the enhanced response sensitivity approach is developed to get the solution.

In contrast to conventional fixed- or free-mode component mode synthesis (CMS) techniques, blades are reduced in a mixed-boundary fashion. Accordingly, blade component normal modes with a more realistic mixed boundary condition (fixed at blade-disk interface and free at shroud contacts) are incorporated into the reduction basis. Afterward a modal synthesis based on loaded interface modeshapes of the disk is performed to reduce the disk component and the previously retained blade-disk interface degrees of freedom (DOFs). This results in a compact reduced order model (ROM) in which retained physical DOFs contain only shroud contact nodes. During the reduction steps, sector-level frequency mistuning is efficiently introduced into the ROM. In addition, the reduction basis is invariant of the mistuning pattern, which makes the ROM suitable for statistical characterization of nonlinear response levels. The final ROM is computed using one single sector only and with minimal computational effort. Numerical simulations revealed an improved accuracy of the ROM based on the mixed-boundary model in predicting the nonlinear forced response levels of a mistuned bladed disk with shroud friction contacts.},

The proposed formulation can directly offer reaction forces, which are essential information to modeling linkages of mechanical components. In particular, in the interpolated multipoint constraints, the proposed formulation is more numerically stable than the conventional master–slave formulation that has invertible issues with respect to choice of the constraint nodes. The other aim of the work is to condense the original equations of motion into degrees of freedom at certain nodes only, named as condensation nodes, for better computational and modeling efficiencies. In the proposed Lagrange multiplier based formulation, accuracy of the reduced model can be improved by dynamic correction. The performance of the proposed method is theoretically evaluated by comparing the master–slave elimination, which is the most widely used approach of the multipoint constraints, and it is demonstrated through numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This paper answers the question raised in the title of this paper and shows that it is not true for systems in which the damping matrix is indefinite. It introduces a new paradigm in the theory of linear stability that gyroscopically stabilized unstable potential systems can be made stable, and even exponentially stable, by the addition of linear damping. Conceptually, the paper also points to a practical methodology for adding damping to such gyroscopically stabilized potential systems to render them exponentially stable. The methodology involves the simultaneous use of both dissipative damping or negative velocity feedback, and positive velocity feedback. The methodology is illustrated in detail on two-degree-of-freedom gyroscopically stabilized potential systems. In-depth stability analysis of such systems is provided. It is shown that they can always be made exponentially stable by using an uncountably infinite number of appropriate indefinite damping matrices. A connected region is proved to exist in the space of indefinite damping matrices for which such damped gyroscopically stabilized systems are guaranteed to be exponentially stable, and this region of exponential stability is analytically delineated. Numerical studies are provided to corroborate the analytical results.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents the development of an aeroelastic analysis formulation for the dynamic response of a flexible wing. The geometrically nonlinear structure is represented by a reduced-order model that accounts for the large-deformation effects on the inertia and stiffness terms. It is based on a system identification of a built-up finite element model and does not rely on a geometric nonlinear beam-based model as most of the state-of-the-art nonlinear aeroelastic frameworks do. The complexity of the wing structural layout is captured in the built-up finite element model as in traditional industry applications. To preserve a small number of states to represent the structural dynamics of the system, a modal approach is used in a nonlinear sense. Moreover, this approach is easily linked to computational fluid dynamics. For this study, the structural reduced-order model framework is integrated within the aeroelastic framework of the code CFL3D. Using this integrated solution, the aeroelastic response of a high-aspect-ratio wing is investigated.},

To show the effect of the fractional derivative on nonlocality, the frequency spectra of the plates with different boundary conditions and symmetry modes are carried out for the different orders of the fractional derivative and different values of the length scale parameter . The vibration analysis is obtained by the Ritz energy method, whereas Chebyshev polynomials are used as admissible functions. The results of the frequency spectrum demonstrate that the nonlocal effect decreases and the results get closer to the values of the classical frequencies as the order of the fractional derivative approaches the classical derivative .},

  abstract     = {A study is conducted to evaluate four derivative estimation methods when solving a large sparse nonlinear programming problem that arises from the approximation of an optimal control problem using a direct collocation method. In particular, the Taylor series-based finite difference, bicomplex-step, and hyper-dual derivative estimation methods are evaluated and compared alongside a well-known automatic differentiation method. The performance of each derivative estimation method is assessed based on the number of iterations, the computation time per iteration, and the total computation time required to solve the nonlinear programming problem. The efficiency of each of the four derivative estimation methods is compared by solving three benchmark optimal control problems. It is found that, although central finite differencing is typically more efficient per iteration than either the hyper-dual or the bicomplex-step method, the latter two methods have significantly lower overall computation times due to the fact that fewer iterations are required by the nonlinear programming problem when compared with central finite differencing. Furthermore, although the bicomplex-step and hyper-dual methods are similar in performance, the hyper-dual method is significantly easier to implement. Moreover, the automatic differentiation method is found to be substantially less computationally efficient than any of the three Taylor series-based methods. The results of this study show that the hyper-dual method offers several benefits over the other three methods: both in terms of computational efficiency and ease of implementation.},

  abstract     = {A new surrogate modeling approach is developed that augments the loads from an analysis over an undeformed surface in order to account for the effects of static surface deformations in high-speed flows. The approach relies on pointwise data-driven surrogates to approximate the nonlinear flow mechanics and theoretical expressions to identify the surrogate input parameters. The pointwise nature of the model enables efficient construction with minimal assumptions on the surface deformation. The accuracy of the modeling strategy is evaluated relative to steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes analyses for prescribed deformations and quasi-static aerothermoelastic response prediction. Basic fluid loads models and conventional kriging interpolation models, where deformation is parameterized using global characteristic shapes, are also considered. The new surrogate approach yields normalized root mean square errors of less than 5\% relative to steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes predictions of pressure and heat flux over prescribed deformations. Results for aerothermoelastic simulations highlight that the approach outperforms all other models in terms of predicting the thermo-structural response and fluid loads. In regard to computational requirements, the new approach affords a 93\% reduction in the offline costs compared with conventional kriging models and is several orders of magnitude faster than Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations for online predictions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel gas-kinetic harmonic balance method (HBM) is developed for unsteady flows with oscillating motions. Particularly, the emphasis here is on supersonic and hypersonic flows. Because of the presence of an additional source term in the harmonic balance equations, usually very small time steps are needed for explicit algorithms, and some factorization-based implicit algorithms may fail to converge in the case of higher frequencies. To achieve better convergence performance and robustness, a Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov method is adopted. By constructing a simplified preconditioning matrix, the lower–upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel scheme is employed as a preconditioner, so that the computational cost and memory requirement can be reduced. Considering that conventional spatial discretization schemes may encounter numerical difficulties and low robustness in high-Mach-number flows, a more general gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is extended for the harmonic balance equations. As the HBM solves a mathematically steady problem, the present GKS focuses on evaluation of the time-independent fluxes at each cell interface and each subtime level. The gas-kinetic HBM is applied to a supersonic oscillating flat plate cascade and an oscillating panel in hypersonic flow. By comparison with other methods, the advantages of the developed method are demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {The double swept waverider is a classic example of the planform-customized osculating-cone waveriders, delivering satisfactory performances over a wide range of velocities. The nonlinear increase in the lift of double swept waveriders at high angles of attack is of vital interest. In this paper, the aerodynamic performance of the double swept waverider is calculated and compared with single swept waveriders. The results suggest that the nonlinear increase in the lift of the double swept waverider is stronger than that of the equal-planform-area single swept waverider, and it increases with the Mach number. Some scholars have proposed the “vortex lift” to explain the nonlinear increase in lift, but it is controversial because the main lift of the waverider comes from the lower rather than the upper surface. This paper proposes that this nonlinear increase is related to the attachment of the shock wave influenced by the leading-edge sweep angle. The shock wave is more inclined to attach under the lower surface at a smaller sweep angle than a larger one as the angle of attack increases. When the shock wave attaches, the increase in pressure via the angle of attack is nonlinear, leading to a nonlinear increase in lift. When the shock wave detaches, the increase in lift is approximately linear.},

The developed model revealed that the emission intensity of the second positive band system of nitrogen molecules varies linearly with the gas density, which was firmly supported by spectroscopic observations characterizing the glow spectra. A laminar separated boundary layer was visually distinguishable via variations in the emission color reflected on a uniform positive column, along which traverse measurements were performed using miniature spectrometers. The experimental spectra agreed fairly well with synthetic ones calculated by substituting gas temperature distribution determined from computational fluid dynamics. In contrast, the temperature was not found to be a crucial factor determining the emission color distribution. The color was instead found to vary with the ratio of the emission intensity of the first positive band system to that of the second one. The principle of the variation in emission color implies that the mechanism explaining the variation will be more complex than what is assumed in existing models.},

A methodology is developed to calculate the energy accommodation coefficient using a rovibrational state-to-state chemical mechanism for a nitrogen mixture coupled with a generalized form of the catalytic recombination coefficient. The flow around a spherical body is simulated in hypersonic conditions, allowing study of the amount of energy deposited on the surface and stored in the recombining molecules. Internal energy quenching into translational energy is found, which is a phenomenon also observed experimentally, keeping the total energy transferred to the surface overall constant.

Dedicated experiments have been conducted using a reentry simulation facility and varying the mass-averaged enthalpy in the range between 5 and . In particular, three different gas mixtures have been considered (using nitrogen as a hot feeding gas and adding cold oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane, respectively). The enthalpy ratios calculated by the FSFM, which were found to depend on the gas mixture, have been compared with the values determined using two alternate techniques, namely, 1) the heating rate method and 2) the calorimetric probe method.

The present generalized principle indicates that the skin friction and the heat flux resulting from a steady viscous flow over a slender body could also be approximately analogous to the counterparts in an equivalent unsteady flow in one less space dimension. The key point is that the hypersonic velocity component perpendicular to the reduced unsteady flow plane should be retained and its evolution with time be properly treated to produce strong shear and dissipation effects. The generalized principle is specifically implemented by using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to study the fundamental boundary-layer flow models and a practical complex viscous-interaction flow over a typical vehicle model. The results of the pressure, skin friction, and heat flux from the steady flows and the corresponding reduced unsteady flows are compared and analyzed. This study points out an inherent similarity between the hypersonic steady flow and the dimension-reduced unsteady flow, and also shows a potential application value in the engineering practice.},

The flow structures are clarified numerically for each stage, according to whether the sinking is slow or fast compared to the horizontal wave speed, and the force-evolution behavior is displayed and related to the flow structures. It was found that a residual force exists during the motionless stage for fast sinking, due to the historical effect of wave evolution. In addition, although the nonlinear weighted Duhamel method predicts the force well for the first and second stages, it performs less well than a linear force method for the third stage, showing that a force method based on the forward step-motion model should be revised in the future.},

The resulting small relative variations of velocity and thermodynamic properties across the reaction region are described by linearized Euler equations written in characteristic form, supplemented by the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions across the leading shock. The simplified formulation is used to analyze the interaction of the oblique detonation with a weak vortex sheet, for an Arrhenius irreversible reaction with an activation energy large compared with the postshock thermal enthalpy. The analysis reveals that, as , the product of the activation energy and the heat release divided by the square of the postshock thermal enthalpy, increases through values of order unity, decaying spatial oscillations, found for small values, are replaced by persistent nonlinear oscillations of finite amplitude for larger values. Beyond a critical value of the growth of the oscillation amplitude leads to the development of a singularity at the shock, an explosion, consistent with the formation of a triple point.

The spontaneous longitudinal-mode instability is observed for the 10- and 19-injector geometries with a combustion-chamber diameter of 28 cm. The triggered tangential and longitudinal instability modes are obtained for the 19-injector geometry with a combustion-chamber diameter of 43 cm by pulsing the injector mass flux.

The streamwise vorticity created by the instability impacts the heat release in a manner that supports the instability. A preliminary study of injector-size scaling effects is performed by comparison of the 10- and 19-injector combustors.},

  abstract     = {Airborne noise with a dominant low-frequency content has detrimental effects in many applications, but it is as yet beyond the scope of conventional acoustic noise mitigation techniques using liners, foams, or claddings owing to mass and volume considerations. An alternative approach using liner configurations retaining realistic mass and volume constraints and having innovative 3D folded core geometries is investigated to ascertain its low-frequency noise absorption performance. The relative performance of various candidate 3D folded core designs is compared using a metric termed the low-frequency performance (LFP) metric, which is derived from Zwikker-Kosten Transmission Line (ZKTL) theory–based numerical studies. An LFP-based software tool is developed to optimize packing of 3D folded cavities. Experimental verification of absorption coefficient spectra conducted using additively manufactured test articles in normal incidence acoustic impedance tubes yielded good correlation with simulations, verifying the feasibility of this approach. For an optimized design, more than 100 Hz of continuous bandwidth with an absorption coefficient greater than 0.6 is shown to be possible in the 250–400 Hz range with a liner 38.1 mm (1.5 in.) thick. With current additive and hybrid manufacturing techniques attaining critical commercial maturity, 3D folded cavity liners could provide a promising practical solution to mitigate low-frequency airborne noise, especially in aerospace applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a novel approach for mesh generation for materials that have distinct spatial components with a smooth boundary between them. Experimental data are used in pixel/voxel format to label elements in a generic finite element (FE) mesh of a representative volume element. The basis of this approach is a novel Potts energy formulation to allow integer optimization on the dual of the FE mesh. The Potts energy can be decomposed into two terms: the field energy/data cost and the interaction energy/smoothing cost. The field term is used to represent the likelihood of a grain label on an element based on the experimental voxel data. The interaction term encodes a prior on this labeling; in particular, it is used for smoothening the phase boundary. Energy minimization of this system leads to a multiway cut problem, which is solved using graph cuts. A multilabel energy minimization problem is formulated using a Potts form. This methodology allows capturing smooth boundaries in materials with nonequiaxed morphologies. Applications to polycrystalline microstructures and woven composites are presented. The extension to nonequiaxed morphologies is presented using the Riemannian distance measure. This procedure allows re-usability of an FE mesh by adaptively assigning pixel/voxel information to elements while preserving important features like the phase boundary surface length/area.},

Over the past few years, they have shown promise in enabling implicit large-eddy simulations within the vicinity of complex geometrical configurations. However, the cost of such simulations remains prohibitive. In this paper, the impact of number representation on the efficiency and efficacy of these methods is considered. Theoretical performance models are derived and assessed. Specifically, four test cases are considered: 1) the viscous Taylor–Green vortex, 2) flow over a circular cylinder, 3) flow through a T106c low-pressure turbine cascade, and 4) flow around a NACA 0021 in deep stall. It is found that the use of single (in lieu of double) precision arithmetic does not have a significant impact on accuracy. The performance of the resulting simulations was found to improve between 1.4 and 2.9 times.},

In the RANS context, the two-layer turbulence model displays superior near-wall behavior compared with other closures of similar order. Our goal is to adapt these near-wall closure advantages to PANS-SRS model. In the outer region of the PANS two-layer closure, a PANS turbulence model is employed. In the inner layer, an unresolved kinetic energy equation is solved. The eddy viscosity and dissipation are specified using algebraic equations based on known scaling relationships. The proposed model is evaluated in a turbulent channel flow of friction Reynolds numbers in the range of .

  abstract     = {Strongly swirling flow is widely encountered in engineering applications. However, accurate prediction of the flow is still challenging for turbulence modeling. The present study reports the assessment and validation of a newly developed self-adaptive turbulence modeling, denoted as very-large-eddy simulation (VLES), for the prediction of turbulent strongly swirling flow through a suddenly expanding circular pipe at Reynolds number of and , and the corresponding swirl numbers are 1.16 and 1.23, which are both very strongly swirling flow. The VLES method is a unified simulation approach enabling a seamless evolution from Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) to LES and finally approaching direct numerical simulation (DNS) depending on the numerical resolution. In the present work, a new proposed VLES turbulence closure model, namely, VLES BSL , and other two models, denoted as VLES and VLES , are applied for the strong swirling flow simulation. Two meshes containing about 0.9 million and 5.1 million cells are applied, with different mesh resolutions. The simulation results are compared with available experimental data and RANS results. It is observed that the present VLES models accurately predict the time-averaged and root-mean-square (rms) velocities compared with the measurements on both of the two meshes. The significant features of the present strongly swirling flow, including vortex breakdown and the vortex core precession, large recirculation region, and shear-layer instability, are well captured by the present VLES models. Furthermore, the anisotropy of the Reynolds stresses of the strongly swirling flow is also well predicted. Satisfactory predictions can be obtained using low grid resolution with the VLES models, which confirm the validity and accuracy of the VLES modeling for strongly swirling turbulent flow.},

  abstract     = {Turbulent planar mixing layers of varying compressibility levels have been studied experimentally via flow visualization techniques, pressure measurements, and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The experiments were conducted for five different convective Mach numbers (, 0.38, 0.55, 0.69, and 0.88). For each case, inflow conditions were thoroughly documented with planar particle image velocimetry. Results indicate that the incoming boundary layers are thin (less than or equal to 9\% of channel height) and fully developed. Schlieren and Mie scattering images show that for increased levels of compressibility the large-scale turbulent structures are less organized, and the Brown–Roshko rollers that are dominant in the incompressible case are not found. Three-component velocity measurements made on the spanwise-central plane via stereo particle image velocimetry confirm the reduction in the normalized growth rate with increasing that has been agreed upon widely. Turbulence statistics results show that the peak (normalized) streamwise normal kinematic Reynolds stress remains constant, while the spanwise normal, transverse normal, and primary shear kinematic Reynolds stress peak values all decrease with increasing . In addition, knowledge of all three normal stress components allows for the calculation of the full Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, a novel result for compressible mixing layer experiments. Each anisotropy component remains constant across the shear layer center. As compressibility in the mixing layer increases, the streamwise normal stress anisotropy increases, transverse and spanwise normal stress anisotropies decrease, and the shear stress anisotropy remains constant. Conversely, the Reynolds stress correlation coefficient remains constant across all cases at approximately 0.47.},

Transonic wind tunnel experiments are used to support our study. The relation between the discrete hole velocity in wind tunnel tests and the continuous surface velocity used in the simulation is established. With the calibrated relation, the method, consisting of a boundary-layer code and linear stability theory framework, has successfully predicted the transition location at various conditions, within 4\% chord error compared with the experimental results. Additionally, the simulation profile drag by the integration of momentum loss method matches the results of the experimental wake rake, and the difference is within 1.85 counts. The simulation results show that the microsized wall suctioning reduces the amplitude of cross-flow velocity and lowers the inflection point in the boundary layer, hence suppressing the cross-flow vortices. Hence, the laminar-to-turbulent transition is pushed aft significantly. Meanwhile, the experimental and simulation results show that the wall blowing degrades the HLFC benefit, and it needs to be avoided in applications. This paper concludes that the method can be applied in the hybrid laminar flow control transition prediction with the given perforated panel properties.},

The duration of the sweeping effect was approximately in the subcritical mode and in the buzz mode. Furthermore, repetitive deposition of laser pulse energies was observed to moderate instabilities in both modes, and it increased the pressure recovery by as much as 8\%; also, the occurrence of buzz was delayed, thereby widening the stable, subcritical regime. In both modes, there was a threshold value for the laser pulse repetition frequency , which corresponded to the duration of the sweeping effect (e.g., in subcritical mode). Below this frequency, the increase in the pressure was proportional to the repetition frequency; whereas above , the effect per single pulse was reduced.},

At a high speed of , the extendable chord, with a width of 10\% rotor radius and responded to an extension magnitude of 10\% chord length, obtained a maximum force reduction of 89.4\%. The magnitude of the dynamic chord needs to be optimized according to the flight state. The performance can be enhanced by increasing the extension or width of the dynamic chord. The dynamically extendable chord was not suitable for reducing the 2/rev blade flapwise root bending moment. However, a 3/rev dynamic chord extension showed great potential in reducing the 3/rev flapwise root bending moment and the 4/rev rotor rolling and pitching moments simultaneously.

Flow details indicate that the blade-end slots can generate self-adaptive high-momentum jet flows through the pressure difference between blade pressure and suction surface. The self-adaptive jet flow reenergizes the local low-momentum fluid to reduce separation, and restrain its migration toward midspan. The low-momentum flows near the endwall on the pressure side are aspirated, thus weakening the cross-passage migration of low-momentum endwall flow into suction surface corner. Proportion of unseparated regions in the blade midspan is enlarged; consequently, flow capacities are improved. The attachment at the blade-end regions is enhanced, and the insufficient circulation originally found at the blade extremity is improved.},

The geometries are obtained from the extrusion of a two-dimensional (2-D) airfoil with an added sweep angle, and periodic boundary conditions are imposed at both ends. First, numerical simulations of transonic buffet are performed. The numerical solutions exhibit three-dimensional cellular flow patterns, forming what has been named buffet cells. The latter are convected in the spanwise direction when a sweep angle is added, leading to the superposition of two frequencies. The first one is independent of the sweep angle and is characteristic of the two-dimensional buffet. The second one increases with the sweep angle and is related to the convection of the buffet cells. These cells are reminiscent of the stall cells, which are well known for low-speed flow conditions. Second, solutions of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for infinite swept wings in stall conditions at low speed are computed, showing the same convection of the cellular patterns. These results indicate that the discrepancies between 2-D and 3-D buffet are caused by the appearance of stall cells, which are the same as buffet cells.},

Some localized pressure waves are induced by the discharge, propagating at a speed of about . A fairly weak vortex is also induced, with a maximum velocity of about . Wind tunnel experiments are conducted on a wing–body combination with a 47 deg swept wing. Three actuator arrangements are tested by force measurements. For the full leading-edge actuation, obvious changes of the normal forces can be achieved at high angles of attack before stall, when the actuator works at the optimum reduced frequency of . However, the stall angle is not delayed under the actuation. For front-half actuation at the leading edge, the obvious control effect is obtained at large angles of attack (22–30 deg), while for rear-half actuation, the normal force gets a relatively modest increase at a broad range of attack angles (10–34 deg). The flow pattern obtained by particle image velocimetry shows that the actuation frequency mainly determines the number of chordwise vortices coexisting along the shear layer. It is hard to engender the reattachment vortex over the wing under high-frequency actuations (such as ).},

  abstract     = {The unsteady flows past a NACA0015 airfoil near stall at a high Reynolds number are investigated numerically using the delayed detached-eddy simulation with adaptive coefficient model. The unsteady feature is primarily represented by a low-frequency oscillation, attributed to the quasi-period movement of the separation point. Correlation analysis between the instantaneous lift coefficient and separation point location indicates that the two signals present nearly in-phase behavior. Other unsteady characteristics such as the trailing-edge vortex shedding and instability of the upper surface shear layer are also analyzed. Since the Strouhal number corresponding to the movement of the separation point based on the projected airfoil height varies significantly with the angle of attack, the normalized Strouhal number based on the length of the recirculation region is observed to have a value of approximately 0.036 and be insensitive to the angle of attack.},

  abstract     = {General expressions are derived in this paper for the aerodynamic force and moment on an arbitrary set of pitching and heaving foils from the vortical impulse theory in the limit of linearized potential, two-dimensional flow. Of special interest for studying the propulsion of some aquatic and aerial animals and small unmanned vehicles is the case of two oscillating foils in an aligned tandem configuration, for which analytical explicit expressions for the lift, thrust, and moment are obtained. In the limit of large separation distance, the expressions of a single oscillating foil for the forewing are recovered, but the hindwing is always affected by the unsteady wake of the forewing in the present inviscid model. Relatively simple expressions are obtained in the cases of two heaving foils and of two pitching foils, for which the optimal conditions generating a maximum thrust force and a maximum propulsion efficiency are mapped in terms of the nondimensional separation distance, reduced frequency, and phase shift, and discussed physically in relation to the optimal results for a single oscillating foil. The present theoretical results are compared with available experimental and numerical data, with good agreement for small amplitude of the oscillations and sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.},

This study focuses on a modernized U-net architecture and evaluates a large number of trained neural networks with respect to their accuracy for the calculation of pressure and velocity distributions. In particular, it is illustrated how training data size and the number of weights influence the accuracy of the solutions. With the best models, this study arrives at a mean relative pressure and velocity error of less than 3\% across a range of previously unseen airfoil shapes. In addition all source code is publicly available in order to ensure reproducibility and to provide a starting point for researchers interested in deep learning methods for physics problems. Although this work focuses on RANS solutions, the neural network architecture and learning setup are very generic, and applicable to a wide range of partial differential equation boundary value problems on Cartesian grids.},

  abstract     = {The use of surrogate models (response surface models, curve fits) of various types (radial basis functions, Gaussian process models, neural networks, support vector machines, etc.) is now an accepted way for speeding up design search and optimization in many fields of engineering that require the use of expensive computer simulations, including problems with multiple goals and multiple domains. Surrogates are also widely used in dealing with uncertainty quantification of expensive black-box codes where there are strict limits on the number of function evaluations that can be afforded in estimating the statistical properties of derived performance quantities. This paper compares and contrasts a wide range of surrogate types on an aerodynamic section data set that allows for design variation, manufacturing uncertainty, and damage in service, all solved with a high-quality industrial-strength Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. This paper examines speed of training and model quality for different sizes of problem up to one where there are 26 input variables and nearly half a million CFD results in the available data set.},

  abstract     = {A novel high-frequency flow control strategy for mitigation of dynamic stall is demonstrated for the case of a finite wing using high-fidelity wall-resolved implicit large-eddy simulations. A NACA 0012 wing of aspect ratio is considered at freestream Mach number and chord Reynolds number . The wing undergoes an oscillatory pitching motion with reduced frequency and maximum angle of attack , resulting in deep dynamic stall for the baseline case. Very-high-frequency spanwise uniform low-amplitude pulsed forcing is imparted through a zero-net mass flow blowing/suction slot located on the wing lower surface near the leading edge. The imposed small fluctuations are amplified by the laminar separation bubble (LSB) and inhibit LSB bursting and the formation of large-scale dynamic stall vortices. By maintaining effectively attached flow throughout the pitching cycle, actuation provides a significant reduction in the cycle-averaged drag and in the force and moment excursions. In addition, the negative (unstable) net-cycle pitch damping found in the baseline case is eliminated.},
