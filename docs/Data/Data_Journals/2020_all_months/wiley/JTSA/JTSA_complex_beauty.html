  abstract     = {In this article, we re-visit a recent idea of Phillips and Lee (2015. Econometric Reviews 34: 1035 - 1056). They examine an empirically relevant situation when two time series exhibit different degrees of non-stationarity and one need to learn whether their persistence properties are the same. By bridging the asymptotic theory of local to unity and mildly explosive processes, they construct a Wald test for the commonality of the long-run behavior of the series. However, inference is complicated by the fact that their statistic does not converge in distribution under the null and diverges under the alternative. This is true if the parameters of the data generating process are known and a re-normalizing function can be constructed. If the parameters are unknown, which will be the case in practice, the test statistic may be divergent even under the null. We solve this problem by converting the original setting of vector time series into a panel setting with N individual vector series. We show that the proposed panel Wald test statistics converge to chi-squared distribution which is free of nuisance parameters under the null hypothesis of common local to unity behavior. The result is an extreme example of simplified asymptotics brought about by panel data.},

  abstract     = {A functional (lagged) time series regression model involves the regression of scalar response time series on a time series of regressors that consists of a sequence of random functions. In practice, the underlying regressor curve time series are not always directly accessible, but are latent processes observed (sampled) only at discrete measurement locations. In this article, we consider the so-called sparse observation scenario where only a relatively small number of measurement locations have been observed, possibly different for each curve. The measurements can be further contaminated by additive measurement error. A spectral approach to the estimation of the model dynamics is considered. The spectral density of the regressor time series and the cross-spectral density between the regressors and response time series are estimated by kernel smoothing methods from the sparse observations. The impulse response regression coefficients of the lagged regression model are then estimated by means of ridge regression (Tikhonov regularization) or principal component analysis (PCA) regression (spectral truncation). The latent functional time series are then recovered by means of prediction, conditioning on all the observed data. The performance and implementation of our methods are illustrated by means of a simulation study and the analysis of meteorological data.},

This new class of ConwayŮMaxwell–Poisson autoregressive moving average (CMP-ARMA) models is suitable for the analysis of time series of counts. The CMP distribution is a two-parameter generalization of the Poisson distribution that allows the modeling of underdispersed, equidispersed, and overdispersed data. Our main contribution is to combine this dispersion flexibility with the inclusion of lagged terms to model the conditional mean response, inducing an autocorrelation structure, usually relevant in time series. We present the conditional maximum likelihood estimation, hypothesis testing inference, diagnostic analysis, and forecasting along with their asymptotic properties. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the conditional score vector and conditional Fisher information matrix. We conduct a Monte Carlo experiment to evaluate the performance of the estimators in finite sample sizes.

We also propose and investigate multivariate circular models obtained from the high-order spectra of stationary stochastic processes generated using linear filtering with an autoregressive moving average response function. A new family of distributions for a Markov process on the circle is also introduced. Results for asymptotically optimal inference for dependent observations on the circle are presented which provide a new paradigm for inference with circular models.

  abstract     = {Discrete-time models with periodic behavior are useful for the description of different phenomenon. The most popular time series taking into consideration the periodicity of the real data is the periodic autoregressive moving average (PARMA) model. The PARMA models were considered in the literature from a theoretical and practical point of view. Most of the considerations related to the PARMA models are based on the assumption of the Gaussian (or finite-variance) distribution of the noise. However, in many applications, the Gaussian distribution seems to be inappropriate. Thus, generalized models are considered. The natural extension of the Gaussian distribution is the -stable one which is a perfect distribution for the modeling of real data with large observations. However, for the -stable-based models the classical methods adequate to Gaussian-based systems cannot be used. The main problem comes from the fact that, in general, for the -stable based models the covariance cannot be applied as a measure of dependence. Thus, alternative measures are used. In this article, we consider the generalization of the classical PARMA models and take into consideration the -stable PAR system. Moreover, we analyze the bidimensional version of the univariate model and examine its structure of cross-dependence in the language of the alternative cross-dependence measures appropriate for the infinite-variance systems. As the main result, we prove that the ratio of two considered alternative cross-dependence measures tends to the stability index of the noise distribution. This result is the continuation of the authors&#39; previous research where a similar study was performed for one-dimensional models based on the -stable distribution. Moreover, in the authors&#39; recent papers the stationary bidimensional time series models were considered in the same direction. Finally, we propose a possible application of the introduced methodology.},

  abstract     = {A Bayesian lattice filtering and smoothing approach is proposed for fast and accurate modeling and inference in multivariate non-stationary time series. This approach offers computational feasibility and interpretable time-frequency analysis in the multivariate context. The proposed framework allows us to obtain posterior estimates of the time-varying spectral densities of individual time series components, as well as posterior measurements of the time-frequency relationships across multiple components, such as time-varying coherence and partial coherence. The proposed formulation considers multivariate dynamic linear models (MDLMs) on the forward and backward time-varying partial autocorrelation coefficients (TV-VPARCOR). Computationally expensive schemes for posterior inference on the multivariate dynamic PARCOR model are avoided using approximations in the MDLM context. Approximate inference on the corresponding time-varying vector autoregressive (TV-VAR) coefficients is obtained via Whittle&#39;s algorithm. A key aspect of the proposed TV-VPARCOR representations is that they are of lower dimension, and therefore more efficient, than TV-VAR representations. The performance of the TV-VPARCOR models is illustrated in simulation studies and in the analysis of multivariate non-stationary temporal data arising in neuroscience and environmental applications. Model performance is evaluated using goodness-of-fit measurements in the time-frequency domain and also by assessing the quality of short-term forecasting.},

We propose two portmanteau type tests to measure conditional heteroscedasticity in the squares of asset return curves. A complete asymptotic theory is provided for each test. We also show how such tests can be adapted and applied to model residuals to evaluate adequacy, and inform order selection, of FGARCH models. Simulation results show that both tests have good size and power to detect conditional heteroscedasticity and model mis-specification in finite samples. In an application, the tests show that intra-day asset return curves exhibit conditional heteroscedasticity. This conditional heteroscedasticity cannot be explained by the magnitude of inter-daily returns alone, but it can be adequately modeled by an FGARCH(1,1) model.},

The proposed modeling approach yields analytically tractable dynamic marginal likelihoods, a property not typically found outside of linear Gaussian time series models. These dynamic marginal likelihoods can be tied back to known static multivariate distributions such as the Lomax, generalized Lomax, and the multivariate Burr distributions. The availability of the marginal likelihoods allows us to develop efficient estimation methods for various settings using Markov chain Monte Carlo as well as sequential Monte Carlo methods. Our approach can be considered to be a multivariate generalization of commonly used univariate non-Gaussian class of state space models. To illustrate our methodology, we use simulated data examples and a real application of multivariate time series for modeling the joint dynamics of stochastic volatility in financial indexes, the VIX and VXN.},

We also propose a sequential procedure to estimate the number of persistence breaks based on ordering the regime-specific bootstrap p -values. The asymptotic validity of the advocated procedures is established both under the null of stability and a variety of persistence change alternatives.

It is well known that if the likelihood of missing an observation depends on its value, then the missing is MNAR, no consistent estimation is possible, and the only way to recover destroyed information is to study the likelihood of missing via an extra experiment. One of the main practical issues with an extra-sample approach is as follows. Let n and m be the numbers of observations in a MNAR time series and in an extra sample exploring the likelihood of missing respectively. An oracle, that knows the likelihood of missing, can estimate the spectral density of an ARMA-type spectral density with the MISE proportional to ln ( n ) n − 1 , while a differentiable likelihood may be estimated only with the MISE proportional to m −2/3 . On first glance, these familiar facts yield that the proposed approach is impractical because m must be in order larger than n to match the oracle. Surprisingly, the article presents the theory and a numerical study indicating that m may be in order smaller than n and still the statistician can match performance of the oracle. The proposed methodology is used for the analysis of MNAR time series of systolic blood pressure of a person with immunoglobulin D multiple myeloma.

Therefore, we propose an indirect estimation procedure that first estimates the parameters of the auxiliary AR( r ) representation ( r ≥ 2 p −1) of the sampled CARMA process using a generalized M- (GM-)estimator. Since the map which maps the parameters of the auxiliary AR( r ) representation to the parameters of the CARMA process is not given explicitly, a separate simulation part is necessary where the parameters of the AR( r ) representation are estimated from simulated CARMA processes. Then, the parameters which take the minimum distance between the estimated AR parameters and the simulated AR parameters give an estimator for the CARMA parameters. First, we show that under some standard assumptions the GM-estimator for the AR( r ) parameters is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Then, we prove that the indirect estimator is also consistent and asymptotically normally distributed when the asymptotically normally distributed LS-estimator is used in the simulation part. The indirect estimator satisfies several important robustness properties such as weak resistance, -robustness and it has a bounded influence functional. The practical applicability of our method is illustrated in a small simulation study with replacement outliers.},

  abstract     = {This article theoretically and empirically analyzes backtesting portfolio value-at-risk (VaR) with estimation risk in an intrinsically multi-variate framework. It particularly takes into account the estimation of portfolio weights in forecasting portfolio VaR and its impact on backtesting. It shows that the estimation risk from estimating portfolio weights and that from estimating the multi-variate dynamic model make the existing methods in a univariate framework inapplicable. It proposes a general theory to quantify estimation risk applicable to the present problem and suggests practitioners a simple but effective way to implement valid inference to overcome the effect of estimation risk in backtesting portfolio VaR. In particular, we apply our theory to the efficient mean-variance-skewness portfolio for a multi-variate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model with multi-variate general hyperbolic distributed innovations. Some Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application demonstrate the merits of our method.},

The article aims at establishing and using such discretization and embedding formulae between extended AR continuous time processes and discrete time sequences. The continuous-time processes are driven by either Brownian or jump processes, and may have random coefficients depending on time; Lévy-driven processes are also considered. The innovation of the discrete time processes may be of many types – including Gaussian. In one way, observing the continuous time AR process at discrete times leads the AR dynamics of the discretized process to be characterized. The other way round, AR sequences can be embedded, in the almost sure sense, into continuous time AR processes with the same dynamics. Illustration is provided through many examples and simulation.},

It is based on directly bootstrapping the time series of tensor products which overcomessome common difficulties associated with applications of the bootstrap to related testing problems. The suggested methodology can be potentially applied to a broad range of test statistics of the hypotheses of interest. As an example, we establish validity for approximating the distribution under the null of a test statistic based on the Hilbert–Schmidt distance of the corresponding sample lag-zero autocovariance operators, and show consistency under the alternative. As a prerequisite, we prove a central limit theorem for the MBB procedure applied to the sample autocovariance operator which is of interest on its own.

  abstract     = {A time varying autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model is proposed to describe the changing volatility of a financial return series over long time horizon, along with two-step least squares and maximum likelihood estimation procedures. After preliminary estimation of the time varying trend in volatility scale, approximations to the latent stationary ARCH series are obtained, which are used to compute the least squares estimator (LSE) and maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the ARCH coefficients. Under elementary and mild assumptions, oracle efficiency of the two-step LSE for ARCH coefficients is established, that is, the two-step LSE is asymptotically as efficient as the infeasible LSE based on the unobserved ARCH series. As a matter of fact, the two-step LSE deviates from the infeasible LSE by o p ⁡ ( n − 1 / 2 ) . The two-step MLE, however, does not enjoy such efficiency, but n 1/2 asymptotic normality is established for both the two-step MLE as well as its deviation from the infeasible MLE. Simulation studies corroborate the asymptotic theory, and application to the S&amp;P 500 index daily returns from 1950 to 2018 indicates significant change in volatility scale over time.},

In this article, we analyze the bidimensional vector autoregressive (VAR) model based on general bidimensional α -stable distribution. This time series can be applied in modeling bidimensional data with impulsive behavior. We focus on the description of the spatio-temporal dependence for analyzed bidimensional time series which in the considered case cannot be expressed in the language of the classical cross-covariance or cross-correlation function. We propose a new cross measure based on the alternative measure of dependence adequate for infinite variance processes, namely cross-covariation. This article is an extension of the authors&#39; previous work where the cross-codifference was considered as the spatio-temporal measure of the components of VAR model based on sub-Gaussian distribution. In this article, we demonstrate that cross-codifference and cross-covariation can give different information about the relationships between components of bidimensional VAR models.},

  abstract     = {Integer-valued time series data have an ever-increasing presence in various applications (e.g., the number of purchases made in response to a marketing strategy, or the number of employees at a business) and need to be analyzed properly. While a Poisson autoregressive (PAR) model would seem like a natural choice to model such data, it is constrained by the equi-dispersion assumption (i.e., that the variance and the mean equal). Hence, data that are over- or under-dispersed (i.e., have the variance greater or less than the mean respectively) are improperly modeled, resulting in biased estimates and inaccurate forecasts. This work instead develops a flexible integer-valued autoregressive model for count data that contain over- or under-dispersion. Using the Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (CMP) distribution and related distributions as motivation, we develop a first-order sum-of-CMP&#39;s autoregressive (SCMPAR(1)) model that will instead offer a generalizable construct that captures the PAR, and versions of what we refer to as a negative binomial AR model, and binomial AR model respectively as special cases, and serve as an overarching representation connecting these three special cases through the dispersion parameter. We illustrate the SCMPAR model&#39;s flexibility and ability to effectively model count time series data containing data dispersion through simulated and real data examples.},

The asymptotic justification however depends on the specific class of models assumed for the underlying unobservable process. We show by means of a simulation study that the asymptotic robustness of the Hill estimator is clearly manifested in finite samples.

The stationary marginal distribution of a multivariate ( d -dimensional) SETAR process of order one MSETAR d ( 1 ) with multivariate normal innovations is shown to belong to the unified skew-normal ( 𝒮 𝒰 𝒩 ) family and characterized under a fairly broad condition. This article also characterizes the stationary marginal distributions of a subclass of the MSETAR d ( 1 ) processes with symmetric multivariate stable innovations. To characterize the stationary marginal distributions of these processes, the authors show that they belong to specific skew-distribution families, and for a given skew-distribution from the corresponding family, an MSETAR d ( 1 ) process, with stationary marginal distribution identical to the given skew-distribution, can be associated. Furthermore, this article illustrates a diagnostic of an MSETAR 2 ( 1 ) model using the corresponding stationary marginal density.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by improving the fitting of non-negative financial time series, we extend the multiplicative error model and study the semi-parametric estimation. We first introduce a location parameter and use the sample minimum to a truncate data set. In the case that there is a non-trivial proportion of zeros in the truncated data, we adopt a zero-augmented mixture distribution for the innovation terms. For both cases, we propose quasi maximum likelihood estimation for the multiplicative coefficients and establish asymptotic results. We conduct large simulation studies to demonstrate substantial estimation errors with misspecified models, and confirm the asymptotic properties. Moreover, we present an empirical study to illustrate the fitting improvement.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new class of functional-coefficient predictive regression models, where the regressors consist of auto-regressors and latent factor regressors, and the coefficients vary with certain index variable. The unobservable factor regressors are estimated through imposing an approximate factor model on high dimensional exogenous variables and subsequently implementing the classical principal component analysis. With the estimated factor regressors, a local linear smoothing method is used to estimate the coefficient functions (with appropriate rotation) and obtain a one-step ahead nonlinear forecast of the response variable, and then a wild bootstrap procedure is introduced to construct the prediction interval. Under regularity conditions, the asymptotic properties of the proposed methods are derived, showing that the local linear estimator and the nonlinear forecast using the estimated factor regressors are asymptotically equivalent to those using the true latent factor regressors. The developed model and methodology are further generalized to the factor-augmented vector predictive regression with functional coefficients. Finally, some extensive simulation studies and an empirical application to forecast the UK inflation are given to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed model and methodology.},

Second we obtain bias expansions for those pseudo MLEs also in terms of ρ ≥ 0. We provide a general framework since only the cases with ρ = 0 and ρ = 0.5 have been considered in the literature so far.

By viewing the observed signals as realizations of locally dyadic stationary (LDS) processes, a LDS model can be used to provide a time-frequency decomposition of the signals, under which the evolutionary Walsh spectrum and related statistics can be defined and estimated. The classification procedure is as follows. First choose a training data set that comprises two groups of time series with a known group. Then compute the time frequency feature (the energy) using the training data set, and use a best tree method to maximize the discrepancy of this feature between the two groups. Finally, choose the testing data set with the unknown group as validation data, and use a discriminant statistic to classify the validation data to one of the groups. The classification method is illustrated via an electroencephalographic dataset and the Ericsson B transaction time dataset. The proposed classification method performs better for integer-valued time series in terms of classification error rates in both simulations and real-life applications.},

In this article, we study an ICA method which combines the use of linear and quadratic autocorrelations to enable efficient estimation of various kinds of stationary time series. Statistical properties of the estimator are studied by finding its limiting distribution under general conditions, and the asymptotic variances are derived in the case of ARMA-GARCH model. We use the asymptotic results and a finite sample simulation study to compare different choices of a weight coefficient. As it is often of interest to identify all those components which exhibit stochastic volatility features we suggest a test statistic for this problem. We also show that a slightly modified version of the principal volatility component analysis can be seen as an ICA method. Finally, we apply the estimators in analysing a data set which consists of time series of exchange rates of seven currencies to US dollar.

Although the robust one-step-ahead predictor and interpolator has already been considered separately in the previous literature, we give two conditions for the uncertainty class to find the minimax interpolator and extrapolator in the general framework from both the point of view of the observation set and the point of view of evaluation on the interpolation and extrapolation error under the L p -norm. We show that there exists a minimax interpolator and extrapolator for the class of spectral densities ε -contaminated by unknown spectral densities under our conditions. When the uncertainty class contains spectral distribution functions which are not absolutely continuous to the Lebesgue measure, we show that there exists an approximate interpolator and extrapolator in L p such that its maximal interpolation and extrapolation error is arbitrarily close to the minimax error when the spectral distributions have densities.

The model and its translation invariant neighbourhood system are wrapped around a torus forming a model with finite spatial domain, which we call circular spatio-temporal GARCH. Such a model could be seen as an approximation of the infinite one and simulation experiments show that the circular estimator with a straightforward bias correction performs well on such non-circular data. Since the spatial boundaries are tied together, the well-known boundary issue in spatial statistical modelling is effectively avoided. We derive stationarity conditions for these circular processes and study the spatio-temporal correlation structure through an ARMA representation. We also show that the matrices defined by a vectorized version of the model are block circulants. The maximum quasi-likelihood estimator is presented and we prove its strong consistency and asymptotic normality by generalizing results from univariate GARCH theory.},

Both stationary and explosive alternatives are considered. The envelope can be characterized by probabilities for two, related, sums of Chi-square random variables. A stochastic expansion, in powers of the local-to-unity parameter, of the difference between these loses its leading term when a linear trend is included. This implies that the power envelope converges to size at a faster rate, which can then be exploited to prove that the power envelope must necessarily be lower. This effect is shown to be, analytically, greater asymptotically than in small samples and numerically far greater for explosive than for stationary alternatives. Only a linear trend has a specific rate effect on the power envelope, however other deterministic variables will have some effect. The methods of the article lead to a simple direct measure of this effect which is then informative about power, in practice.},

  abstract     = {We consider a model of deterministic one-time parameter change in a continuous time autoregressive model around a deterministic trend function. The exact discrete time analogue model is detailed and compared to corresponding parameter change models adopted in the discrete time literature. The relationships between the parameters in the continuous time model and the discrete time analogue model are also explored. Our results show that the discrete time models used in the literature can be justified by the corresponding continuous time model, with a only a minor modification needed for the (most likely) case where the changepoint does not coincide with one of the discrete time observation points. The implications of our results for a number of extant discrete time models and testing procedures are discussed.},

Under weak moment conditions, we prove joint asymptotic normality for local empirical characteristic functions. For time-varying linear processes, we establish a central limit theorem under the assumption of finite absolute first moments of the process. Additionally, we prove weak convergence of the local empirical characteristic process. We apply our asymptotic results to parameter estimation. Furthermore, by extending the notion of distance correlation to locally stationary processes, we are able to provide asymptotic theory for local empirical distance correlations. Finally, we provide a simulation study on minimum distance estimation for α -stable distributions and illustrate the pairwise dependence structure over time of log returns of German stock prices via local empirical distance correlations.},

  abstract     = {Modeling volatility is one of the prime objectives of financial time-series analysis. A significant feature encountered in the modeling of financial data is the asymmetric response to the volatility process of unanticipated shocks. With improvements in data acquisition, functional versions of the heteroskedastic models have emerged to deal with the high-frequency observations. Although previous studies have developed some functional time-series methods, it remains a necessity to analyze the variations in the asymmetry of the discrete model and the function model. In this study, we propose a functional threshold GARCH (fTGARCH) model and extend the news impact curve (NIC) and the cumulative impact response function (CIRF) within the functional heteroskedastic framework. We find that the fTGARCH model can describe the asymmetry of the observation data, which are revealed by the sample cross-correlation functions. The slope of the NIC changes with time for functional GARCH class models, and the changes are asymmetrical for the fTGARCH model. Using the generalized CIRF, we can explore the persistent effects of volatility for the functional GARCH class models. By fitting the models to the S&amp;P 500 stock market index, we conclude that the fTGARCH model has some flexibility and superiority in regard to volatility asymmetry.},

It examines SSA constructed using re-scaled trajectories (RT-SSA) and presents a theoretical analysis of RT-SSA under very general conditions concerning the structure of the observed series. The spectral features of population ensemble models implicit in the large sample properties of RT-SSA are investigated, motivating a new time series modelling methodology based on a stepwise application of RT-SSA. The operation of the theoretical results is illustrated via numerical examples involving trend stationary and difference stationary processes, and a random walk with drift. An analysis of the S&amp;P 500 index also serves as a vehicle to demonstrate the practical impact of the stepwise RT-SSA processing methodology.},

  abstract     = {We discuss a model for long memory and persistence in time series that amounts to harmonically weighting short memory processes, . A non-standard rate of convergence is required to establish a Gaussian functional central limit theorem. Theoretically, the harmonically weighted (HW) process displays less persistence and weaker memory than the classical competitor, fractional integration (FI) of order d . Still, we establish that a test rejects the null hypothesis of d = 0 if the process is HW. Similarly, a bias approximation shows that estimators of d will fail to distinguish between HW and FI given realistic sample sizes. The difficulties to disentangle HW and FI are illustrated experimentally and with USA inflation data.},

  abstract     = {Under the frequency domain framework for weakly dependent functional time series, a key element is the spectral density kernel which encapsulates the second-order dynamics of the process. We propose a class of spectral density kernel estimators based on the notion of a flat-top kernel. The new class of estimators employs the inverse Fourier transform of a flat-top function as the weight function employed to smooth the periodogram. It is shown that using a flat-top kernel yields a bias reduction and results in a higher-order accuracy in terms of optimizing the integrated mean square error (IMSE). Notably, the higher-order accuracy of flat-top estimation comes at the sacrifice of the positive semi-definite property. Nevertheless, we show how a flat-top estimator can be modified to become positive semi-definite (even strictly positive definite) in finite samples while retaining its favorable asymptotic properties. In addition, we introduce a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure realized by an automatic inspection of the estimated correlation structure. Our asymptotic results are complemented by a finite-sample simulation where the higher-order accuracy of flat-top estimators is manifested in practice.},
