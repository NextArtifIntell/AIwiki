  abstract     = {Knowledge Graphs have been fast emerging as the de facto standard to model and explore knowledge in weakly structured data. Large corpora of documents constitute a source of weakly structured data of particular interest for both the academic and business world. Key examples include scientific publications, technical reports, manuals, patents, regulations, etc. Such corpora embed many facts that are elementary to critical decision making or enabling new discoveries. In this paper, we present a scalable cloud platform to create and serve Knowledge Graphs, which we named corpus processing service (CPS). Its purpose is to process large document corpora, extract the content and embedded facts, and ultimately represent these in a consistent knowledge graph that can be intuitively queried. To accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art natural language understanding models to extract entities and relationships from documents converted with our previously presented corpus conversion service platform. This pipeline is complemented with a newly developed graph engine which ensures extremely performant graph queries and provides powerful graph analytics capabilities. Both components are tightly integrated and can be easily consumed through REST APIs. Additionally, we provide user interfaces to control the data ingestion flow and formulate queries using a visual programming approach. The CPS platform is designed as a modular microservice system operating on Kubernetes clusters. Finally, we validate the quality of queries on our end-to-end knowledge pipeline in a real-world application in the oil and gas industry.},

  abstract     = {Fast approximations of power flow results are beneficial in power system planning and live operation. In planning, millions of power flow calculations are necessary if multiple years, different control strategies, or contingency policies are to be considered. In live operation, grid operators must assess if grid states comply with contingency requirements in a short time. In this paper, we compare regression and classification methods to either predict multivariable results, for example, bus voltage magnitudes and line loadings, or binary classifications of time steps to identify critical loading situations. We test the methods on three realistic power systems based on time series in 15 and 5 minutes resolution of 1 year. We compare different machine learning models, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, gradient boosting, and evaluate the required training time and prediction times as well as the prediction errors. We additionally determine the amount of training data needed for each method and show results, including the approximation of untrained curtailment of generation. Regarding the compared methods, we identified the MLPs as most suitable for the task. The MLP-based models can predict critical situations with an accuracy of 97% to 98% and a very low number of false negative predictions of 0.0% to 0.64%.},

  abstract     = {Benchmarking the performance of generative methods for drug design is complex and multifaceted. In this report, we propose a separation of concerns for de novo drug design, categorizing the task into three main categories: generation , discrimination and exploration . We demonstrate that changes to any of these three concerns impacts benchmark performance for drug design tasks. In this report, we present Deriver, an open-source Python package that acts as a modular framework for molecule generation, with a focus on integrating multiple generative methods. Using Deriver, we demonstrate that changing parameters related to each of these three concerns impacts chemical space traversal significantly, and that the freedom to independently adjust each is critical to real-world applications having conflicting priorities. We find that combining multiple generative methods can improve optimization of molecular properties and lower the chance of becoming trapped in local minima. In addition, filtering molecules for drug-likeness (based on physicochemical properties and SMARTS pattern matching) before they are scored may hinder exploration, but can also improve the quality of the final molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that any given task has an exploration algorithm best suited to it, though in practice linear probabilistic sampling generally results in the best outcomes, when compared to Monte Carlo sampling or greedy sampling. Deriver is being made freely available, to help others interested in collaboratively improving existing methods in de novo drug design centered around inheritance of molecular structure, modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns.},

Although this work stems from the development of GraphINVENT, a Python platform for iterative molecular generation using graph neural networks, this work is relevant to researchers studying other architectures for graph-based molecular design. In this work, technical details that could be of interest to researchers developing their own molecular generative models are discussed, including an overview of previous work in graph-based molecular design and strategies for designing new models. Advice on development and debugging tools which are helpful during code development is also provided. Finally, methods that were tested but which ultimately did not lead to promising results in the development of GraphINVENT are described here in the hope that this will help other researchers avoid pitfalls in development and instead focus their efforts on more promising strategies for graph-based molecular generation.},

  abstract     = {To develop a convolutional neural network visualization strategy so that optical coherence tomography (OCT) features contributing to the evolution of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can be better determined. We have trained a U-Net model to utilize baseline OCT to predict the progression of geographic atrophy (GA), a late stage manifestation of AMD. We have augmented the U-Net architecture by attaching deconvolutional neural networks (deconvnets). Deconvnets produce the reconstructed feature maps and provide an indication regarding the inherent baseline OCT features contributing to GA progression. Experiments were conducted on longitudinal spectral domain (SD)-OCT and fundus autofluorescence images collected from 70 eyes with GA. The intensity of Bruch&#39;s membrane-outer choroid (BMChoroid) retinal junction exhibited a relative importance of 24%, in the GA progression. The intensity of the inner retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and BM junction (InRPEBM) showed a relative importance of 22%. BMChoroid (where the AMD feature/damage of choriocapillaris was included) followed by InRPEBM (where the AMD feature/damage of RPE was included) are the layers which appear to be most relevant in predicting the progression of AMD.},

An evolutionary symbolic implementation was developed based on a case study on prediction of the shear strength of slender reinforced concrete beams without stirrups including 1942 set of published test results. In the implementation of the MOGP model, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II with adaptive regression by mixing algorithm with considering the optimization of mean-square error as the fitness measure and the subtree complexity was used. The developed MOGP model was compared to previously developed genetic programming models, different building codes, and additional machine learning based approaches. It is clearly shown that the MOGP model outperformed the other algorithms applied on this database and can be a general solution on any engineering problems with the main advantage of prediction equations without assuming prior form of the relevance among the input predictor variables.},
