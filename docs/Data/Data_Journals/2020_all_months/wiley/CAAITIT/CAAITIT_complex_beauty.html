  abstract     = {Video inpainting is a technique that fills in the missing regions or gaps in a video by using its known pixels. The existing video inpainting algorithms are computationally expensive and introduce seam in the target region that arises due to variation in brightness or contrast of the patches. To overcome these drawbacks, the authors propose a novel two-stage framework. In the first step, sub-bands of wavelets of a low-resolution image are obtained using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. Criminisi algorithm and auto-regression technique are then applied to these sub-bands to inpaint the missing regions. The fuzzy logic-based histogram equalisation is used to further enhance the image by preserving the image brightness and improve the local contrast. In the second step, the image is enhanced using super-resolution technique. The process of down-sampling, inpainting and subsequently enhancing the video using the super-resolution technique reduces the video inpainting time. The framework is tested on video sequences by comparing and analysing the structural similarity index matrix, peak-signal-to-noise ratio, visual information fidelity in pixel domain and execution time with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental analysis gives visually pleasing results for object removal and error concealment.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzy set and neutrosophic set are two efficient tools to handle the uncertainties and vagueness of any real-world problems. Neutrosophic set is more useful than fuzzy set (intuitionistic fuzzy sets) to manage the uncertainties of a real-life problem. This study introduces some new concepts of single-valued neutrosophic graph (SVNG). The authors have discussed the definition of regular SVNG, complete SVNG and strong SVNG. The shortest path problem is a well-known combinatorial optimisation problem in the field of graph theory due to its various applications. Uncertainty is present in almost every application of shortest path problem which makes it very hard to decide the edge weight properly. The main objective behind the work in this study is to determine an algorithmic technique for shortest path problem which will be very easy and efficient for use in real-life scenarios. In this study, the authors consider neutrosophic number to describe the edge weights of a neutrosophic graph for neutrosophic shortest path problem. An algorithm is introduced to solve this problem. The uncertainties are incorporated in Bellman–Ford algorithm for shortest path problem using neutrosophic number as arc length. They use one numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Automated segmentation of histopathological images is a challenging task to detect cancerous cells in breast tissue. Recent reviews state high accuracy to segment image, but depends on user input, say window area size, time steps, level set, magnification factor and so on. To extract the region of interest effectively, the subject expert performs post-processing operations several times on the segmentation results with different input values for different parameters say, area opening, fill holes and selects most appropriate enhanced image required for further analysis. The authors proposed an automated segmentation technique followed by self-driven post-processing operations to detect cancerous cells effectively. The post-processing method itself determines the value of different parameters for different operations based on segmented results obtained. The proposed technique has the following features: (i) technique is context sensitive; (ii) no prior setting of time step, weighted area coefficient parameters is required; (iii) magnification independent; (iv) post-processing operations are self-driven which enhance segmentation results adaptively. The experimental results are compared with four state-of-the-art techniques: fuzzy C-means, spatial fuzzy C-means, spatial neutrosophic distance regularised level set and convolutional neural network-based PangNet. Experimental results obtained on two publicly available data sets show that the proposed technique outperforms effectively.},

As different selection techniques identify different feature sets, relying on a single method may result in risky decisions. The authors propose an ensemble approach using union and quorum combination techniques with five primary individual selection methods which are analysis of variance, variance threshold, sequential backward search, recursive feature elimination, and least absolute selection and shrinkage operator. The proposed method reduces features in three rounds: (i) discard redundant features using pairwise correlation, (ii) individual methods select their own feature sets independently, and (iii) equalise individual feature sets. The equalised individual feature sets are combined using union and quorum techniques. Both the combined and individual sets are tested for network anomaly detection using random forest, decision tree, K-nearest neighbours, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and logistic regression classifiers. The experimental results on the UNSW-NB15 data set show that random forest with union and quorum feature sets yields 99 and 99.02% f1_score with minimum 6 and 12 features, respectively. The results on the NSL-KDD data set show that random forest with union and quorum gets 99.34 and 99.21% f1_score with a minimum of 28 and 18 features.},

However, current word vector models have not made full use of both POS information and DG information, and hence the models’ performances are limited to some extent. The authors first put forward the concept of POS vector, and then, based on continuous bag-of-words (CBOW), constructed four models: CBOW + P, CBOW + PW, CBOW + G, and CBOW + G + P to incorporate POS information and DG information into word vectors. The CBOW + P and CBOW + PW models are based on POS tagging, the CBOW + G model is based on DG parsing, and the CBOW + G + P model is based on POS tagging and DG parsing. POS information is integrated into the training process of word vectors through the POS vector to solve the problem of the POS similarity being difficult to measure. The POS vector correlation coefficient and distance weighting function are used to train the POS vector as well as the word vector. DG information is used to correct the information loss caused by fixed context windows. Dependency relations weight is used to measure the difference of dependency relations. Experiments demonstrated the superior performance of their models while the time complexity is still kept the same as the base model of CBOW.},

Though implicit feedback is too challenging, it is highly applicable to use in building recommendation systems. Conventional collaborative filtering techniques such as matrix decomposition, which consider user preferences as a linear combination of user and item latent features, have limited learning capacities, hence suffer from a cold start and data sparsity problems. To tackle these problems, the research direction towards considering the integration of conventional collaborative filtering with deep neural networks to maps user and item features. Conversely, the scalability and the sparsity of the data affect the performance of the methods and limit the worthiness of the results of the recommendations. Therefore, the authors proposed a multi-model deep learning (MMDL) approach by integrating user and item functions to construct a hybrid RS and significant improvement. The MMDL approach combines deep autoencoder with a one-dimensional convolution neural network model that learns user and item features to predict user preferences. From detail experimentation on two real-world datasets, the proposed work exhibits substantial performance when compared to the existing methods.},

They selected Gaussian blur, pretzel noise, and combined noise to destroy the image, and then evaluated the consistency of the original alpha mask and noise alpha mask. To determine the robustness of the matting algorithm, they assessed the degree of consistency of the alpha mask using three different evaluation levels. The experimental results show that noise has a greater impact on the performance of the matting algorithm, which shows a decreasing trend as the noise level in the image deepens. In noisy images, the traditional matting algorithm exhibits better robustness compared to the recently proposed trap matting algorithm. Different matting algorithms present different adaptations to different noises.},

This is called the butterfly effect that rules the behaviour of chaotic systems. AIFC is chosen as a different method that has not been used before to synchronise the chaotic systems. The scaling factors of the inputs and the output of the intuitionistic fuzzy controller (IFC) are tuned using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm depending on a specified objective function.

  abstract     = {Federated learning aims to collaboratively train a machine learning model with possibly geo-distributed workers, which is inherently communication constrained. To achieve communication efficiency, the conventional federated learning algorithms allow the worker to decrease the communication frequency by training the model locally for multiple times. Conventional federated learning architecture, inherited from the parameter server design, relies on highly centralised topologies and large nodes-to-server bandwidths, and convergence property relies on the stochastic gradient descent training in local, which usually causes the large end-to-end training latency in real-world federated learning scenarios. Thus, in this study, the authors propose the adaptive partial gradient aggregation method, a gradient partial level decentralised federated learning, to tackle this problem. In FedPGA, they propose a partial gradient exchange mechanism that makes full use of node-to-node bandwidth for speeding up the communication time. Besides, an adaptive model updating method further reduces the convergence rate by adaptive increasing the step size of the stable direction of gradient descent. The experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the training time is reduced up to compared to baselines without accuracy degrade.},

A WBAN is primarily composed of a miniature, and smart devices called sensors that are worn in, on, or around the human body. In recent years, research has been mainly centred towards the reduction of the energy consumption and stability of the network. The selection of the relay node is one of the foremost issues for balancing the energy consumption in WBAN. To overcome this issue, the authors propose a hybrid analytic hierarchy process–neutrosophic method for making the decision of the relay node selection, in which the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique calculates the weights for different criteria and forwards them to the neutrosophic technique which finds out the best alternative solution or choice which is closest to the ideal solution. A detailed analysis is carried out on multi-criteria decision-making techniques by comparing the proposed AHP–neutrosophic and AHP techniques taking into account various criteria and alternatives. The experimental outcomes of this research indicate a significant reduction in terms of energy consumption and enhanced overall network-stability.},

PDT predicts human behaviour in terms of gains and losses and considers the expected utility relation to a reference point rather than complete outcomes. In the analysis of merged criteria weight and the prospect decision-making matrix, the authors get a new dimension level for ranking the array of alternatives. This manuscript provides an improved score function (SF) to convert the interval-valued membership grades of truth, indeterminacy and falsity into a mathematical and computational value. The advantage of this method is that it merges the objective and subjective weight during the proposed method. They propose an algorithm based on the SF to determine MCDA problems with IVNSSs.

  abstract     = {This study proposed the concepts of a multi-valued interval neutrosophic linguistic soft set (MVINLSS) by integrating the concepts of multi-valued interval neutrosophic soft set and linguistic set. MVINLSS is presented as it can deal with ambiguous and uncertain information in decision making which is characterised by linguistic membership. This proposed set amalgamates quantitative assessment with the qualitative assessment which can solve complex problems with ambiguity, uncertainty, and inconsistency. It can be an effective tool to describe the real decision-makers’ opinions and reflect their hesitancy. Then, the authors propose the basic operational rules of MVINLSS. Moreover, they define a multi-valued interval neutrosophic linguistic soft weighted arithmetic averaging operator. This work proposed a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method which considers different priority levels of criteria and the criteria values take the form of multi-valued interval neutrosophic linguistic soft numbers. Finally, the proposed MCDM method is applied to the knowledge management case, considering 11 criteria.},

This kind of social network integrated with geographical location information is called location-based social networks (abbreviate for LBSNs). In the LBSN, each user has location information when he or she checked in hotels or feature spots. Based on this information, they can identify user&#39;s trajectory of movement behaviour and activity patterns. In general, if there is friendship between two users, their trajectories in reality are likely to be similar. In this study, according to user&#39;s geographical location information over a period of time, they explore whether there exists friendly relationship between two users based on trajectory similarity and the structure theory of graphs.

Therefore, accurate detection of JS codes that masquerade as innocuous scripts is vital. The existing deobfuscation methods assume that a specific tool can recover an original JS code entirely. For a multi-layer obfuscation, general tools realize a formatted JS code, but some sections remain encoded. For the detection of such codes, this study performs Deobfuscation, Unpacking, and Decoding (DUD-preprocessing) by function redefinition using a Virtual Machine (VM), a JS code editor, and a python int_to_str() function to facilitate feature learning by the FastText model. The learned feature vectors are passed to a classifier model that judges the maliciousness of a JS code. In performance evaluation, the authors use the Hynek Petrak&#39;s dataset for obfuscated malicious JS codes and the SRILAB dataset and the Majestic Million service top 10,000 websites for obfuscated benign JS codes. They then compare the performance to other models on the detection of DUD-preprocessed obfuscated malicious JS codes. Their experimental results show that the proposed approach enhances feature learning and provides improved accuracy in the detection of obfuscated malicious JS codes.},

The aim of the Q-learning algorithm in deep reinforcement learning is to address two shortcomings of the robot path-planning problem: slow convergence and excessive randomness. Preceding the start of the algorithmic process, prior knowledge and prior rules are used to improve the DQN algorithm. Simulation results show that the improved DQN algorithm converges faster than the classic deep reinforcement learning algorithm and can more quickly learn the solutions to path-planning problems.

  abstract     = {In recent years, hyper-complex deep networks (such as complex-valued and quaternion-valued neural networks – QVNNs) have received a renewed interest in the literature. They find applications in multiple fields, ranging from image reconstruction to 3D audio processing. Similar to their real-valued counterparts, quaternion neural networks require custom regularisation strategies to avoid overfitting. In addition, for many real-world applications and embedded implementations, there is the need of designing sufficiently compact networks, with few weights and neurons. However, the problem of regularising and/or sparsifying QVNNs has not been properly addressed in the literature as of now. In this study, the authors show how to address both problems by designing targeted regularisation strategies, which can minimise the number of connections and neurons of the network during training. To this end, they investigate two extensions of and structured regularisations to the quaternion domain. In the authors’ experimental evaluation, they show that these tailored strategies significantly outperform classical (real-valued) regularisation approaches, resulting in small networks especially suitable for low-power and real-time applications.},

To tackle the lost-track issue due to fast illumination changes under HDR scene such as tunnels, an object tracking framework has been presented based on event count images from an event camera. The framework contains an offline-trained detector and an online-trained tracker which complement each other: The detector benefits from pre-labelled data during training, but may have false or missing detections; the tracker provides persistent results for each initialised object but may suffer from drifting issues or even failures. Besides, process and measurement equations have been modelled, and a Kalman fusion scheme has been proposed to incorporate measurements from the detector and the tracker. Self-initialisation and track maintenance in the fusion scheme ensure autonomous real-time tracking without user intervene. With self-collected event data in urban driving scenarios, experiments have been conducted to show the performance of the proposed framework and the fusion scheme.},

Owing to the high dimensionality of robotic hands and intermittent contact dynamics, effectively programming a robotic hand for in-hand manipulations is still a challenging problem. To address this challenge, this work employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to learn in-hand manipulations for multi-fingered robotic hands. A reward-shaping method is proposed to assist the learning of in-hand manipulation. The synergy of robotic hand postures is analysed to build a low-dimensional hand posture space. Two additional rewards are designed based on both the analysis of hand synergies and its learning history. The two additional rewards cooperating with an extrinsic reward are used to assist the in-hand manipulation learning. Three value functions are trained jointly with respect to their reward functions. Then they cooperate to optimise a control policy for in-hand manipulation. The reward shaping not only improves the exploration efficiency of the DRL algorithm but also provides a way to incorporate domain knowledge. The performance of the proposed learning method is evaluated with object rotation tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed learning method enables multi-fingered robotic hands to learn in-hand manipulation effectively.},

Fuzzy sets provide a solution for uncertainties, and intuitionistic fuzzy sets handle incomplete information, but both concepts failed to handle indeterminate information. To handle this complicated situation, researchers require a powerful mathematical tool, naming, neutrosophic sets, which is a generalised concept of fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Neutrosophic sets provide a solution for both incomplete and indeterminate information. It has mainly three degrees of membership such as truth, indeterminacy and falsity. Boolean values are obtained from the three degrees of membership by cut relation method. Data items which contrast from other objects by their qualities are outliers. The weighted density outlier detection method based on rough entropy calculates weights of each object and attribute.

  abstract     = {The recent boom of economic activities has escalated the demand for oil that eventually will affect its prices. However, oil prices are difficult to predict because most of the factors affecting oil prices are vague and intangible. The challenges in predicting oil prices urgently require a novel approach where issues related to multiple-factors, uncertainty, and periodicity can be addressed. The authors propose the single-valued neutrosophic relations based decision-making method inspired by the three memberships of neutrosophic sets, and amplitude and periodicity of complex numbers. The proposed method is applied to the case of oil prices where six factors affecting oil prices and six benchmarks measuring oil prices are employed. This new method combines with complex neutrosophic numbers and algebraic relations, and can suggest the most influential factor that affects oil prices. Considering the periodicity of 24 months, computation results verify the ‘global economic rate’ as the most influential factor that affects the prices of oil. The main contribution of this study is the development of a neutrosophic relations-based decision-making method to suggest the most influential factor that affects oil prices. The result provides evidence on the feasibility of the proposed method in suggesting the influential factors that affect oil prices.},

  abstract     = {The problem of finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) is one of the most studied and important combinatorial optimisation problems in graph theory. Several types of uncertainties exist in real-life problems, which make it very hard to find the exact length of the arc. The neutrosophic set is an efficient tool to model and deal with the uncertainties in information due to inconsistent and indeterminate. In this study, the authors use triangular neutrosophic numbers to represent the edge weights of a neutrosophic graph for the MST problem in the neutrosophic environment. They call this problem a neutrosophic MST (NMST) problem. They formulate the NMST problem in terms of the linear programming model. Here, they introduce an algorithmic method based on a genetic algorithm for solving the NMST problem. They present the utility of triangular neutrosophic numbers as edge weights and their application in the electrical distribution network.},

The original DEA methods are developed to tackle the information based on the crisp number but no ability to handle the indeterminacy, impreciseness, vagueness, inconsistent, and incompleteness information such as triangular neutrosophic numbers (TNNs). This study attempts to establish a new model of DEA, where the information on decision-making units is TNNs. Initially, the concept and features of a conventional DEA model and the comparative TNNs are discussed. Besides, some new ranking functions of TNNs are presented. Furthermore, based on the mentioned ranking functions, an algorithm for solving the new model has been established. A comparison of the new model with an existing method and other kinds of uncertainty tools has been provided. In comparison with the existing methods, the significant characteristic of the new model is that it can handle the triangular neutrosophic information simply and effectively. Finally, the implementation of this strategy for an example has been applied for various models of DEA.},

One of the good algorithms is Bellman-Ford, which has been applied in network, for the last some years. Due to complexity in the decision-making process, the decision makers face complications to express their view and judgment with an exact number for single valued membership degrees under neutrosophic environment. Though the interval number is a special situation of the neutrosophic, it did not solve the shortest path problems in an absolute manner. Hence, in this work, the authors have introduced the score function and accuracy function of trapezoidal interval valued neutrosophic numbers with their illustrative properties. These properties provide important theoretical base of the trapezoidal interval valued neutrosophic number. Also, they proposed an intelligent algorithm called trapezoidal interval valued neutrosophic version of Bellman&#39;s algorithm to solve neutrosophic shortest path problem in network analysis. Further, comparative analysis has been made with the existing algorithm.},

The aim of this manuscript is to initiate the novel dice similarity measures and generalised dice similarity using CNS.

The proposed method extracts structural features, such as loops, slants, cursive, straight lines, stroke thickness, contour shapes, aspect ratio and other geometrical properties, from different zones of isolated character images to derive the hypothesis based on a dictionary of Graphological rules. The derived hypothesis has the ability to categorise the personal, positive, and negative social aspects of an individual. To evaluate the proposed method, an automatic system is developed which accepts characters from a to z written by different individuals across different genders and age groups. This automatic privacy projected system is available on the website ( http://subha.pythonanywhere.com ). For quantitative evaluation of the proposed method, several people are requested to use the system to check their characteristics with the system automatic response based on his/her handwriting by choosing to agree or disagree options. The automatic system receives 5300 responses from the users, for which, the proposed method achieves 86.70% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Large displacement optical flow algorithms are generally categorised into descriptor-based matching and pixel-based matching. Descriptor-based approaches are robust to geometric variation, however they have inherent localisation precision limitation due to histogram nature. This work presents a novel method called improved precision dense descriptor flow (IPDDF). The authors introduce an additional pixel-based matching cost within an existing dense Daisy descriptor framework to improve the flow estimation precision. Pixel-based features such as pixel colour and gradient are computed on top of the original descriptor in the authors&#39; matching cost formulation. The pixel-based cost only requires a light-weight pre-computation and can be adapted seamlessly into the matching cost formulation. The framework is built based on the Daisy Filter Flow work. In the framework, Daisy descriptor and a filter-based efficient flow inference technique, as well as a randomised fast patch match search algorithm, are adopted. Given the novel matching cost formulation, the framework enables efficiently solving dense correspondence field estimation in a high-dimensional search space, which includes scale and orientation. Experiments on various challenging image pairs demonstrate the proposed algorithm enhances flow estimation accuracy as well as generate a spatially coherent yet edge-aware flow field result efficiently.},

The hybrid model is a combination of a physics-based and data-driven model and has some properties of both modelling approaches. In the authors’ case, it is used for the modelling of an atmospheric variable, namely relative humidity in a particular location for the purpose of using the predictions of the model as an input to the air-pollution-dispersion model for radiation exposure. The presented hybrid model is a combination of a physics-based atmospherical model and a Gaussian-process (GP) regression model. The GP model is a probabilistic kernel method that also enables evaluation of prediction confidence. The problem of poor scalability of GP modelling was solved using sparse GP modelling; in particular, the fully independent training conditional method was used. Two different approaches to dataset selection for empirical model training were used and multiple-step-ahead predictions for different horizons were assessed. It is shown in this study that the accuracy of the predicted relative humidity in the Krško basin improved when using hybrid models over using the physics-based model alone and that predictions for a considerable length of horizon can be used.},

  abstract     = {In social network analysis, community detection is one of the significant tasks to study the structure and characteristics of the networks. In recent years, several intelligent and meta-heuristic algorithms have been presented for community detection in complex social networks, among them label propagation algorithm (LPA) is one of the fastest algorithms for discovering community structures. However, due to the randomness of the LPA, its performance is not suitable for the general purpose of network analysis. In this study, the authors propose an improved version of the label propagation (called AntLP) algorithm using similarity indices and ant colony optimisation (ACO). The AntLP consists of two steps: in the first step, the algorithm assigns weights for edges of the input network using several similarity indices, and in the second step, the AntLP using ACO tries to propagate labels and optimise modularity measure by grouping similar vertices in each community based on the local similarities among the vertices of the network. In order to study the performance of the AntLP, several experiments are conducted on some well-known social network datasets. Experimental simulations demonstrated that the AntLP is better than some community detection algorithms for social networks in terms of modularity, normalised mutual information and running time.},

The small sample size and dimensionality problems are addressed by considering a well-known dimensionality reduction technique namely principal component analysis. The feature values are scaled using the Min–Max approach and the proposed approach is validated on eight standard microarray cancer datasets. To measure the loss, a binary cross-entropy is used and adaptive moment estimation is considered for optimisation. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using classification accuracy, precision, recall, f -measure, log-loss, receiver operating characteristic curve, and confusion matrix.

However, the high variability in the content requests makes prediction demand not trivial and, typically, the majority of the classical prediction approaches require the gathering of personal users&#39; information at a central unit, giving rise to many users&#39; privacy issues. In this context, federated learning gained attention as a solution to perform learning procedures from data disseminated across multiple users, keeping the sensitive data protected. This study applies federated learning to the demand prediction problem, to accurately forecast the more popular application types in the network. The proposed framework reaches high accuracy levels on the predicted applications demand, aggregating in a global and weighted model the feedback received by users, after their local training.
