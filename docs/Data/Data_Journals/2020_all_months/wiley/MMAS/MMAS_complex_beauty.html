  abstract     = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) impairs a person&#39;s immune system against many infections and some types of cancer, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is characterized by severe illnesses. The number of HIV infections in the Philippines has increased, more than doubled, within the last decade. This alarming HIV crisis in the country requires urgent actions. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to describe the disease transmission in the Philippines. Disease-free and endemic equilibria are obtained, stability analysis is performed, and the basic reproduction number is computed. Sensitivity analyses and subset selection are performed to identify influential parameters and to determine an identifiable parameter set given measurements, respectively. Available data on the number of asymptomatic aware infectious, those who are in the AIDS stage, and those under treatment are utilized to estimate key epidemiological parameters such as transmission, treatment, and screening rates. Uncertainty of these parameter estimates is quantified through bootstrapping method. Furthermore, intervention strategies are investigated in the framework of optimal control theory. Control measures include precaution, HIV screening, antiretroviral treatment, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment. These various control efforts are compared with regard to cost efficiency and effectiveness in reducing the number of infected individuals. Given limited available control measures, the PrEP-only scenario is shown to be the most cost-effective, followed by other scenarios that combine PrEP with other controls.},

  abstract     = {We consider a two-compartment model of chemotherapy resistant tumour growth under angiogenic signalling. Our model is based on the one proposed by Hahnfeldt et al. (1999), but we divide tumour cells into sensitive and resistant subpopulations. We study the influence of antiangiogenic treatment in combination with chemotherapy. The main goal is to investigate how sensitive are the theoretically optimal protocols to changes in parameters quantifying the interactions between tumour cells in the sensitive and resistant compartments, that is, the competition coefficients and mutation rates, and whether inclusion of an antiangiogenic treatment affects these results. Global existence and positivity of solutions and bifurcations (including bistability and hysteresis) with respect to the chemotherapy dose are studied. We assume that the antiangiogenic agents are supplied indefinitely and at a constant rate. Two optimisation problems are then considered. In the first problem a constant, indefinite chemotherapy dose is optimised to maximise the time needed for the tumour to reach a critical (fatal) volume. It is shown that maximum survival time is generally obtained for intermediate drug dose. Moreover, the competition coefficients have a more visible influence on survival time than the mutation rates. In the second problem, an optimal dosage over a short, 30-day time period, is found. A novel, explicit running penalty for drug resistance is included in the objective functional. It is concluded that, after an initial full-dose interval, an administration of intermediate dose is optimal over a broad range of parameters. Moreover, mutation rates play an important role in deciding which short-term protocol is optimal. These results are independent of whether antiangiogenic treatment is applied or not.},

Our attention is focused to finding ultimate sizes of interacting populations, and, in addition, we show the existence of a global attracting set. Then, we derive various global conditions of ultimate extinction of at least one of the predators subpopulations and describe conditions under which all types of internal bounded dynamics are ruled out. In particular, we describe convergence conditions to omega-limit sets located (1) in the intersection of the prey-free plane with the infected predators-free plane and (2) in the infected predators-free plane. Based on the dynamical analysis of the 2D infection-free subsystem, we obtain conditions of global attraction to (i) the prey-only disease-free equilibrium point, (ii) the disease-free prey-predator equilibrium point (self-healing of the predator population), and (iii) the omega-limit set containing an equilibrium point or a periodic orbit. Main theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulation. Tools and techniques developed in this work can be appropriated in the studies within predictive population ecology of more complex eco-epidemiological models.},

  abstract     = {Programmed to retain active responsivity to environmental stimuli, diverse types of synthetic gels have been attracting interests regarding various applications, such as elastomer biodevices. In a different approach, when the gels are made of tissue-derived biopolymers, they can act as an artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) for use as soft implants in medicine. To explore the physical properties of hydrogels in terms of statistical thermodynamics, the mean-field Flory–Huggins–Rehner theory has long been used with various analytical and numerical modifications. Here, we suggest a novel mathematical model on the phase transition of a biological hybrid gel that is sensitive to ambient temperature. To mimic acellular soft tissues, the ECM-like hydrogel is modeled as a network of biopolymers, such as type I collagen and gelatin, which are covalently crosslinked and swollen in aqueous solvents. Within the network, thermoresponsive synthetic polymer chains are doped by chemical conjugation. Based on the Flory–Huggins–Rehner framework, our analytical model phenomenologically illustrates a well-characterized volume phase behavior of engineered tissue mimics as a function of temperature by formulating the ternary mixing free energy of the polymer–solvent system and by generalizing the elastic free energy term. With this formalism, the decoupling of the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter between the thermoresponsive polymer and ECM biopolymer enables deriving a simple steady-state formula for the volume phase transition as a function of the structural and compositional parameters. We show that the doping ratio of thermoresponsive polymers and the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter between biopolymer and water affect the phase transition temperature of the ECM-like gels.},

The model considered possesses two equilibrium points, namely, the conjunctivitis-free and conjunctivitis-present equilibrium, which are dependent on the basic reproduction number ( R c o ). The local and global stabilities of derived model system were investigated at the equilibrium solutions, and it was found that if R c o &lt; 1, the conjunctivitis-free equilibrium is both locally and globally asymptotically stable. Also, if R c o &gt; 1, the conjunctivitis-present equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. The sensitivity analysis of R c o is performed, and the corresponding graphical results are presented to examine the relative importance of conjunctivitis model parameters as to conjunctivitis prevalence. The model is reformulated by applying control measures of isolation and hygiene compliance to minimize conjunctivitis infection and irritants concentration as well as the cost associated with it. An optimality system is derived and numerically solved with and without controls using the forward–backward Runge–Kutta scheme via computational software MATLAB. The graphical results obtained showed that each of the control strategies has its own importance for conjunctivitis elimination. Further graphical descriptions reveal that the combination of isolation and hygiene compliance strategies are more effective in curtailing conjunctivitis prevalence in human and environmental host community.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the biological principles that govern blood vessel growth in the retina has important clinical implications, for the prevention of possible retinopathies, which may eventually lead to blindness. The availability of a realistic mathematical model of the relevant phenomenon may support the medical community in both issues, diagnosis being related to inverse problems, and therapy to optimal control strategies. The mathematical modeling of retinal angiogenesis leads to an highly complex problem, because of dimension, nonlinearity, and intrinsic randomness. In this paper, we propose a reduced model which leads to numerical simulations that somehow reproduce normal vascularization and predict possible pathologies. We call our model hybrid because it includes the coupling of a fully stochastic model for the construction of a vessel network in the retina, with continuum underlying fields describing relevant factors, such as growth factors and oxygen. We perform numerical simulations of a stochastic particle system coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs)&#39; so to obtain images of vessel structure resembling real retina vasculatures. We then derive a possible mean field approximation of the stochastic vessel network, so to obtain a fully deterministic PDE system for the evolution of the underlying fields. Actually, in order to reproduce the geometric structure of the retina vessel network, we have to keep a stochastic model (though simplified) for its construction. Future investigations may concern the use of such a mean field approximation in the numerical simulations of the retina vasculature. Inverse and optimal control problems being the final goal of our research plan.},

The resulting estimates are consistent in the large volume limit and are obtained without employing complicated tuning strategies and expensive resampling as typically used by likelihood-free MCMC and approximate Bayesian methods.

  abstract     = {The formation of Turing vegetation patterns in flat arid environments is investigated in the framework of a generalized version of the hyperbolic Klausmeier model. The extensions here considered involve, on the one hand, the strength of the rate at which rainfall water enters into the soil and, on the other hand, the functional dependence of the inertial times on vegetation biomass and soil water. The study aims at elucidating how the inclusion of these generalized quantities affects the onset of bifurcation of supercritical Turing patterns as well as the transient dynamics observed from an uniformly vegetated state towards a patterned state. To achieve these goals, linear and multiple-scales weakly nonlinear stability analysis are addressed, this latter being inspected in both large and small spatial domains. Analytical results are then corroborated by numerical simulations, which also serve to describe more deeply the spatio-temporal evolution of the emerging patterns as well as to characterize the different timescales involved in vegetation dynamics.},

We build a simple model describing a consumer/predator which, besides random dispersion, searches for food by moving toward the gradient of some chemical released by prey. This mechanism is referred as indirect prey-taxis. The predator&#39;s rate of consumption is assumed to drop due to interference among predators when too many of them encounter on some aggregate of prey. The latter is assumed to have a negligible motility with its density governed by an ODE. The interference among consumers is modeled by a modification of the Beddington&#39;s de Angelis functional response. Detailed bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations of an auxiliary system indicate that nonconstant steady states imitating patches of species occur in the model provided the predator density exceeds certain threshold and taxis strength is big enough.},

  abstract     = {Vector/pest control is essential to reduce the risk of vector-borne diseases or losses in crops. Among all biological control tools, the sterile insect technique (SIT), which consists of massive releases of sterile insects to reach elimination or to lower a vector/pest population under a certain threshold, is the most promising one. The models presented here are minimalistic with respect to the number of parameters and variables. The first model deals with the dynamics of the vector population, while the second model tackles the interaction between treated males and wild female vectors. For the vector population model, equilibrium 0 is globally asymptotically stable when the basic offspring number, R ≤ 1 , whereas 0 becomes unstable and one stable positive equilibrium exists, with well-determined basins of attraction, when . For the SIT model, we obtain a threshold number of treated males above which the control of wild population is effective using massive releases. When the amount of treated males is lower than the aforementioned threshold, the SIT model experiences a strong Allee effect, that is, 0 becomes locally asymptotically stable, while a positive equilibrium still exists. Practically, massive releases of sterile males are only possible for a short period. That is why using the Allee effect, we develop a new strategy to maintain the wild population under a certain threshold, for a permanent and sustainable low level of SIT control. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical simulations. In particular, we study the combination of SIT with other control tools, like mechanical control and adulticide.},

It is assumed that the linear part of the equation considered admits an exponential dichotomy. Finally, an application is given on the very interesting model of Markus and Yamabe.},

For this purpose, Lumped Galerkin finite element (LGFE) method, an effective, accurate, and cost-effective method, is applied to model equation by the aid of quadratic B-spline basis. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are tested with two problems, namely, propagation solitary wave and interaction of two solitary waves. The error norms L 2 and L ∞ have been computed in order to measure how “accurate” the numerical solutions. Also, the stability analysis has been investigated.},

  abstract     = {We show that the superposition principle applies to coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations with cubic nonlinearity where exact solutions may be obtained as a linear combination of other exact solutions. This is possible due to the cancelation of cross terms in the nonlinear coupling. First, we show that a composite solution, which is a linear combination of the two components of a seed solution, is another solution to the same coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Then, we show that a linear combination of two composite solutions is also a solution to the same equation. With emphasis on the case of Manakov system of two-coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations, the superposition is shown to be equivalent to a rotation operator in a two-dimensional function space with components of the seed solution being its coordinates. Repeated application of the rotation operator, starting with a specific seed solution, generates a series of composite solutions, which may be represented by a generalized solution that defines a family of composite solutions. Applying the rotation operator to almost all known exact seed solutions of the Manakov system, we obtain for each seed solution the corresponding family of composite solutions. Composite solutions turn out, in general, to possess interesting features that do not exist in the seed solution. Using symmetry reductions, we show that the method applies also to systems of N -coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations. Specific examples for the three-coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation are given.},

We introduce an entropy functional for reaction-diffusion models of this type, which allows predictions of the longtime behavior of the solutions. As a result, we find more conditions on the reaction functions to derive a model covering different inflammation courses. Finally, we discuss the models in the frame of a hierarchical model family.},

  abstract     = {The high-speed flight of cluster flight spacecraft modules increases the uncertainty of network topology. In order to better design the orbital of the cluster flight spacecraft and improve the performance of cluster flight spacecraft network (CFSN), this paper studies the nodal distance distributions (NDDs). First, based on twin-satellites mode, the mobility model of nodes is established. And then by adopting empirical statistical method and curve fitting method, the solution of the nodal distance density function in the CFSN is obtained. Second, the probability density function is applied to the model distance-dependent path loss, and the probability density of path loss under the model is analyzed. Finally, the distributions of maximum and minimum distance among multiple nodes and the threshold range of nodal connection distance are derived, and the probabilistic connectivity matrix of any time slot in the orbital hyper-period and spatial–temporal evolution graphs under different thresholds is obtained. The analytical results verify the feasibility of the model and the approximate solution of the NDDs in this paper. This method also provides a theoretical reference for the nodal connection in irregular wireless networks.},

Considering the stream function, we convert the boundary layer equation into nonlinear third-order ordinary differential equation together with appropriate boundary conditions in an infinite domain. The nonlinear boundary value problem has been linearized by using the quasilinearization technique. Then, we develop a nonpolynomial spline method, which is used to solve the flow problem. The convergence analysis of the method is also discussed. We study the velocity function for different angles of inclination and Froude number with the help of various graphs and tables. Then using these in heat convection flow, we obtain the expression for temperature field. Skin friction is also calculated. The various results have been given in tables. At last, we calculated the Nusselt number.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, random functional or stochastic equations have been reported in a large class of problems. In many cases, an exact analytical solution of such equations is not available and, therefore, is of great importance to obtain their numerical approximation. This study presents a numerical technique based on Bernstein operational matrices for a family of stochastic fractional integro-differential equations (SFIDE) by means of the trapezoidal rule. A relevant feature of this method is the conversion of the SFIDE into a linear system of algebraic equations that can be analyzed by numerical methods. An upper error bound, the convergence, and error analysis of the scheme are investigated. Three examples illustrate the accuracy and performance of the technique.},

The obtained solutions for solving the current equation represent some localized waves including soliton, breather, lump, and their interactions, which have been investigated by the approach of the long-wave limit. Mainly, by choosing the specific parameter constraints in the M -soliton and N -soliton solutions, all cases of the one breather or one lump can be captured from the two, three, four, and five solitons. In addition, the performances of the mentioned technique, namely, the Hirota bilinear technique, are substantially powerful and absolutely reliable to search for new explicit solutions of nonlinear models. Meanwhile, the obtained solutions are extended with numerical simulation to analyze graphically, which results in localized waves and their interaction from the two-, three-, four-, and five-soliton solutions profiles. They will be extensively used to report many attractive physical phenomena in the fields of acoustics, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, classical mechanics, and so on.},

As an application of singularity theory, we study the singularities classifications of the Darboux developable of n th principal-directional curve of γ .

Both geodesic and geodetic (i.e., without any external potential) equations of motion on surfaces with nontrivial curvatures that are embedded into the three-dimensional Euclidean space are discussed. The Mylar balloon as a concrete example for the application of the scheme was chosen. A new parameterization of this surface is presented, and the corresponding equations of motion for geodesics and geodetics are expressed in an analytical form through the elliptic functions and elliptic integrals. The so-obtained results are also compared with those for the two-dimensional sphere embedded into the three-dimensional Euclidean space for which it can be shown that the geodesics and geodetics are plane curves realized as the great and small circles on the sphere, respectively.},

We describe how to incorporate a regularization term depending on a parameter in the projection method and then establish the strong convergence of the resulting iterative regularization projection methods. Unlike known hybrid methods, the strong convergence of the new methods comes from the regularization technique. The first method is designed to work in the case where the Lipschitz constant of cost operator is known, whereas the second one is more easily implemented without this requirement. The reason is because the second method has used a simple computable stepsize rule. The variable stepsizes are generated by the second method at each iteration and based on the previous iterates. These stepsizes are found with only one cheap computation without line-search procedure. Several numerical experiments are implemented to show the computational effectiveness of the new methods over existing methods.},

Within the framework of the Lyapunov method, we first show existence and uniqueness of global positive solution of the model and then establish the sufficient conditions for existence of an ergodic stationary distribution of the positive solution. Ultimately, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {The dynamical characteristics of the electrical and mechanical domains are usually detected by means of electromechanical model of piezoelectric actuator; this is because it manages extremely small displacements in the range from 10 pm (1 pm = 10 −12 m) to 100 μm . This manuscript is dedicatedly written on the fractional modeling of electromechanical model of piezoelectric actuator through modern fractional definitions, namely, Atangan–Baleanu and Caputo–Fabrizio fractional operators, which are based on capturing the full memory effects with and without Markovian and non-Markovian properties. The modeled governing partial differential equation of displacement is solved by means of Laplace transform method. The investigated solutions of displacement have been expressed in terms of Fox- H function and series format for avoiding the involvement of gamma functions. A comparative analysis is performed graphically between solutions obtained from Atangan–Baleanu fractional operator and Caputo–Fabrizio fractional operator. Our results suggest that displacement via Atangan–Baleanu fractional operator dominates than displacement via Caputo–Fabrizio fractional operator for controller design even to bypass the hysteresis effect. Additionally, comparison of both fractional techniques on displacement suggests that the utilization of the frequency domain is much more effective than the displacement via classical approaches.},

The considered system describes the interfaces between intermediate long and short waves. The projected fractional operator is proposed with the help of Mittag-Leffler function to incorporate the nonsingular kernel to the system. The projected algorithm is a modified and accurate method with the help of Laplace transform. The convergence analysis is presented with the help of the fixed point theorem in the form existence and uniqueness. To validate and illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm considered, we exemplified considered system with respect of arbitrary order. Further, the behaviour of achieved results is captured in contour and 3D plots for distinct arbitrary order. The results show that the projected scheme is very effective, highly methodical and easy to apply for complex and nonlinear systems and help us to captured associated behaviour diverse classes of the phenomenon.},

After that, by means of Lyapunov method, graph theory, and some techniques of inequality, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the synchronization for SHDCLN. In addition, the designed range of aperiodically intermittent controller parameters is shown. Meanwhile, the coupling strength and the perturbed intensity of noise have a great impact on the intensity of control.

We also show that under the same conditions, these operators preserve the subspace of such Morrey space, known as vanishing Morrey space. We also give necessary conditions for the boundedness when the kernel is non-negative. In the case of classical Morrey spaces, the obtained sufficient and necessary conditions coincide with each other. In the one-dimensional case, we also obtain similar results for global Morrey spaces. In the case of radial kernels, we also obtain stronger estimates of K f via spherical means of f . We demonstrate the efficiency of the obtained conditions for a variety of examples such as weighted Hardy operators, weighted Hilbert operator, their multidimensional versions, and others.},

In the present work, a new series representation for e ( ρ , x ) is derived with the aid of the Levin formula for the Jost solution and a recently proposed Fourier-Laguerre series expansion of the integral kernel from the Levin formula. The representation for e ( ρ , x ) has the form e ( ρ , x ) = e i ρ x ( 1 + ∑ n = 0 ∞ z n b n ( x ) ) , where, for the coefficients b n ( x ), a simple recurrent integration procedure is obtained and the parameter z : = 1 2 + i ρ / 1 2 − i ρ belongs to the unit disk. An analogous representation is derived for the derivative of the Jost solution as well. With the aid of the series representations, numerical solution of the classical spectral problem on the half-line becomes an easy task. Indeed, computation of the eigenvalues reduces to finding zeros of a polynomial for z ∈(−1,1). For computing corresponding normalizing constants, a simple formula is derived. Moreover, computation of the (usually) most difficult spectral characteristics, the spectral density function (or its derivative) for all positive values of the spectral parameter reduces to calculation of an easily computable function along the unitary upper half-circle. Numerical illustrations of the efficiency of the computational method based on the obtained results are presented.},

The surface-dependent model is developed for modeling the kinematics of surface growth for objects that can be generated by the curves on the surface, such as parasites and plants. This paper includes two main purposes for this model. The first is to parameterize this model using quaternions and homothetic motions, while expressing matrix representations of the surface-dependent growth model. The second one is to construct the surface-dependent growth model by using the growth velocity components related to the Darboux frame at each point of the generating curve. Moreover, to support the theory studied in the paper, various examples are illustrated.},

The considered system has only one Lyapunov stable equilibrium and positive Lyapunov exponent in some certain parameter range, which means there coexists chaotic attractors and Lyapunov stable equibirium in system. First, from the perspective of analyzing the global structure of the system, based on the Poincaré compactification technique, the complete description of its dynamical behavior on the sphere at infinity is presented. The obtaining results show that its global dynamical behavior is very complex. Second, from a geometric perspective, the Jacobi stability of the system is investigated, including the unique equilibrium and a periodic orbit. Interestingly, we find that the unique Lyapunov stable equilibrium is always Jacobi unstable, a Lyapunov stable periodic orbit falls into both Jacobi stable and Jacobi unstable regions. It is shown that we might witness chaotic behavior of the system before the trajectories enter a neighborhood of the equilibrium point. It is hoped that the investigation of this paper can contribute to better understand and study the complex chaotic system with stable equilibria.},

Heat is exchanged from the external fluid with the plates. The reference temperature is taken as equal and also as different for the external fluid. Solutions in the absence of viscous dissipation and buoyancy forces are also obtained as special cases. General solutions including the effects of viscous dissipation and buoyancy forces are obtained analytically using the method of perturbation. The analytical solutions can be used only if the Brinkman number is small. Hence to know the flow properties for all values of Brinkman number, we resort to numerical solutions. The effects of thermal Grashof number, solutal Grashof number, and the chemical reaction parameter on the flow field are evaluated numerically. The obtained results are validated against previously published results for special case of the problems.},

By using the ladder operator approach for the orthogonal polynomials, we find that the logarithmic derivative of the Hankel determinant satisfies a nonlinear second-order differential equation, which turns out to be the Jimbo–Miwa–Okamoto σ -form of the Painlevé VI equation by a translation transformation. We also show that, after a suitable double scaling, the differential equation is reduced to the Jimbo–Miwa–Okamoto σ -form of the Painlevé III.

Also, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of this new derivative and its connection with Hilger-derivative are discussed.

Here, we aim to estimate parameters in a Cahn–Hilliard type diffuse interface model in an optimised way using model order reduction (MOR) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Based on snapshots derived from finite element simulations for the full-order model (FOM), we use POD for dimension reduction and solve the parameter estimation for the reduced-order model (ROM). Neuroimaging data are used to define the highly inhomogeneous diffusion tensors as well as to define a target functional in a patient-specific manner. The ROM heavily relies on the discrete empirical interpolation method, which has to be appropriately adapted in order to deal with the highly nonlinear and degenerate parabolic partial differential equations. A feature of the approach is that we iterate between full order solvers with new parameters to compute a POD basis function and sensitivity-based parameter estimation for the ROM problems. The algorithm is applied using neuroimaging data for two clinical test cases, and we can demonstrate that the reduced-order approach drastically decreases the computational effort.},

The results obtained are expected to be useful for problems such as acoustic scattering of a plane wave by a sphere in a rarefied gas.},

First, we perform a complete symmetry classification of the equation, and then we find some interesting similarity solutions by means of the symmetries and the variable coefficient heat equation. Local dynamical behaviors are analyzed via the solutions for the growing cell populations. Second, we show that the conservation law multipliers of the equation take the form Λ=Λ( t , x , u ), which satisfy a linear partial differential equation, and then give the general formula of conservation laws. Finally, symmetry properties of the conservation law are investigated and used to construct conservation laws of the reduced equations.},

Under the invariance property of Lie groups, the infinitesimal generators for the governing equation have been obtained. Thereafter, commutator table, adjoint table, invariant functions, and one-dimensional optimal system of subalgebras are derived by using Lie point symmetries. The symmetry reductions and some group invariant solutions of the DJKM equation are obtained based on some subalgebras. The obtained solutions are new and more general than the rest while known results reported in the literature. In order to show the physical affirmation of the results, the obtained solutions are supplemented through numerical simulation.

Second, we deal with a special case of our fractional differential system; in order to obtain novel results, an abstract sum-type operator equation A ( x , x )+ B x + e = x on ordered Banach space is discussed. Without requiring the existence of upper–lower solutions or compactness conditions, we get several unique results of solutions for this operator equation, which provide new inspiration for the study of boundary value problems.

Consequently, the governing problem is transformed into an equivalent system of algebraic equations, which can be tackled with any classical method. The applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated via an illustrative comparison of the numerical outcomes with those found by other known methods.

Therefore, the whole stability of network is influenced by not only the dynamics of node subsystem but also the dynamics of link subsystem. According to the above view, the wholly asymptotical stability (WAS) is defined in this paper for the complex dynamical network with the model of differential equations. The WAS is used to describe the node subsystem achieves asymptotical stability when link subsystem achieves also the asymptotic stability in Lyapunov sense. For the WAS of the complex dynamical network, the corresponding criteria are derived by checking whether certain matrices are Hurwitz. The analysis results show that even if the isolated nodes are not asymptotically stable in Lyapunov sense, employing the dynamics of link can also force the node subsystem to achieve the asymptotical stability. Finally, the simulation examples show the validity of methods in this paper.},

First, we derive a formula of the fractional-order C-F derivative of x k . Using this formula and some properties of shifted Chebyshev polynomials, we find out the operational matrix of the C-F derivative. We solve a new class of fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) using the collocation method and C-F operational matrix. We depict the feasibility and validity of this numerical method by giving the solution of some numerical examples. We take the diffusion equation, nonlinear reaction–diffusion equation, diffusion-wave equation, and Cattaneo equation as a particular case of our model. By comparing the obtained numerical results with the given exact solution, we draw an error table depicting that our results are so accurate and desirable accuracy.

We study its longtime stability, which means the attractor semiconverges to a compact set as the current time tends to minus infinity, and also its zero-memory stability, which means the delayed attractor semiconverges to the nondelayed attractor as the memory time tends to zero. The stochastic nonautonomous p -Laplacian equation with variable delays on an unbounded domain will be applied to illustrate the method and some suitable assumptions about the nonlinearity and time-dependent delayed forces can ensure existence, backward compactness, and double stabilities of a PRA.},

We investigate a novel numerical method for the nonlinear two-dimensional cable equation in which time-fractional derivative is of Mittag-Leffler kernel type. First, we derive an approximation formula of the fractional-order ABC derivative of a function t k using a numerical integration scheme. Using this approximation formula and some properties of shifted Legendre polynomials, we derived the operational matrix of ABC derivative. In the author of knowledge, this operational matrix of ABC derivative is derived the first time. We have shown the efficiency of this newly derived operational matrix by taking one example. Then we solved a new class of fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) by the implementation of this ABC operational matrix. The two-dimensional model of the time-fractional model of the cable equation is solved and investigated by this method. We have shown the effectiveness and validity of our proposed method by giving the solution of some numerical examples of the two-dimensional fractional cable equation. We compare our obtained numerical results with the analytical results, and we conclude that our proposed numerical method is feasible and the accuracy can be seen by error tables. We see that the accuracy is so good. This method will be very useful to investigate a different type of model that have Mittag-Leffler fractional derivative.},

The improved boundary treatment technique provides a full treatment for complicated geometries and can handle sharp edges without any special treatment. The boundary particles are uniformly distributed in compliance with the curvature of the objects, therefore taking into consideration the effect of the boundary. Several simulations are presented to validate and demonstrate the applicability and versatility of the proposed technique.},

  abstract     = {A methodology to model a process in which repeated events occur is presented. The context is the evolution of non-muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma (NMIBC), characterized by recurrent relapses. It is based on the statistical flowgraph approach, a technique specifically suited for semi-Markov processes. A very useful feature of the flowgraph framework is that it naturally incorporates the management of censored data. However, this approach presents two difficulties with the process to be modeled. On one hand, the management of covariates is not straightforward. However, it is of great interest to know how the characteristics of a certain patient influence the evolution of the disease. On the other hand, repeated events on the same subject are generally not independent, in which case the semi-Markov framework is not sufficient because the semi-Markov assumption implies independence among waiting time distributions. We solve this issue by extending the flowgraph methodology using the Markovian arrival process (MAP), which does successfully model the dependence between events. Along the way, we provide a procedure to consider covariates and censored times in MAPs, a pending task needed in this field. In short, we have managed to extend the flowgraph methodology beyond the semi-Markovian framework, simplifying the incorporation of covariates and keeping the management of censored times. All of which has allowed us to build a multistate model of the evolution of NMIBC. The developed model allows us to compute the Survival function for any evolution of a patient with specific clinic-pathological characteristics in this primary tumor.},

Some of the main disadvantages of these trending models are that the choice of the network underlying architecture profoundly influences the performance of the model and that the architecture design requires prior knowledge of the field of study. The use of questionnaires is hugely extended in social/behavioral sciences. The main contribution of this work is to automate the process of a DNN architecture design by using an agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that mimics the conceptual structure of such surveys. Although the train had regression purposes, it is easily convertible to deal with classification tasks. Our proposed methodology will be tested with a database containing socio-demographic data and the responses to five psychometric Likert scales related to the prediction of happiness. These scales have been already used to design a DNN architecture based on the subdimension of the scales. We show that our new network configurations outperform the previous existing DNN architectures.},

These processes might have two resolutions: The first is the possibility of pathogen elimination, and the other the possibility of the inflammation resolution. In this work, we present several mathematical models involving immune cell densities and inflammation levels. Our general goal is to exhibit the possible pathogen eradication or the inflammation resolution. We use bifurcation techniques in order to analyze how parameter variations may change the system evolution. Our results indicate that the elimination of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages has a dichotomy effect: It contributes to the decrease of the inflammation level, but it may hinder the pathogen elimination. Also, an increment of the average neutrophil life can improve healthy outcomes. Moreover, we find scenarios when pathogens cannot be eliminated, as well as conditions for their successful eradication.},

The explicit solutions which govern the dynamics of this system can be expressed in terms of matrix trigonometric functions. For the derivation we employ the Lagrangian formalism to determine the correct solutions, which extremize the underlying action of the system. In the numerical evaluation we develop diverse state-of-the-art algorithms which efficiently tackle equations with matrix sine and cosine functions. For this purpose, we introduce two special series related to trigonometric functions. They provide approximate solutions of the system through a suitable combination. For the final computation an algorithm based on Taylor expansion with forward and backward error analysis for computing those series had to be devised. We also implement several MATLAB programs which simulate and visualize the two-dimensional lattice and check its energy conservation.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of a full randomization of approximate SIR-type epidemiological models based on discrete-time Markov chain formulation. The randomization is performed by assuming that all input data (initial conditions, the contagion, and recovering rates involved in the transition matrix) are random variables instead of deterministic constants. In the first part of the paper, we determine explicit expressions for the so called first probability density function of each subpopulation identified as the corresponding states of the Markov chain (susceptible, infected, and recovered) in terms of the probability density function of each input random variable. Afterwards, we obtain the probability density functions of the times until a given proportion of the population remains susceptible, infected, and recovered, respectively. The theoretical analysis is completed by computing explicit expressions of important randomized epidemiological quantities, namely, the basic reproduction number, the effective reproduction number, and the herd immunity threshold. The study is conducted under very general assumptions and taking extensive advantage of the random variable transformation technique. The second part of the paper is devoted to apply our theoretical findings to describe the dynamics of the pandemic influenza in Egypt using simulated data excerpted from the literature. The simulations are complemented with valuable information, which is seldom displayed in epidemiological models. In spite of the nonlinear mathematical nature of SIR epidemiological model, our results show a strong agreement with the approximation via an appropriate randomized Markov chain. A justification in this regard is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Plants are a food source for man and many species. But, plants are subject to diseases, many of which are caused by viruses. Usually, virus propagation is done by a vector. Insect vectors typically have a seasonal behavior, and processes have delays. To combat the vectors, chemical insecticides are commonly used as a control. Unfortunately, these chemicals not only are expensive but also have toxic effects on humans, animals, and the environment. An alternative is to introduce a predator species to prey on the insects and limit the spread of the virus. A combination of insecticide and predators can be used to control the vector population. The question is whether there is an optimal combination. We introduce a mathematical model of ordinary differential equations describing the interaction between plants, vectors, and predators. To determine the optimal amount of predators to introduce and insecticide to use, an objective function giving the total cost to the farmer of the disease is given. We find the controls that minimize the objective function subject to the population variables satisfying the differential equation model and initial conditions together with constraints. There are two main different approaches that can be used to solve the optimal control problem: indirect and direct methods. We use direct methods to solve the problem with and without seasonality and delays. From the practical side, the model can be used to help farmers determine the right balance of insecticide and predators to minimize the total cost.},

We have used a continuous time version of traffic model based on the deterministic-stochastic approach developed by A.P. Buslaev. There are N cells and M particles in the closed contour. Particles can move in both directions. We consider two versions of the system. In the continuous time version, the time interval between attempts of a particle to move is distributed exponentially. The intensity of attempts depends on the particle. In the discrete time version, a particle tries to move in one of direction with a given probability at any discrete moment. The attempt is realized if the particle tries to move to a vacant cell. In the discrete time system, if two particles try to move to the same cell, then only one particle moves. We use equivalence of the continuous time system to a queueing network to find the system stationary state distribution of the system. Stationary probabilities of the discrete time system have been found under the assumptions that the number of particles is equal to two and the number of cells is even. We have proved that, under these assumptions, the system is time reversible, and in the general case, the system is not time reversible.},

  abstract     = {There are few studies developed about the general factor of personality (GFP) dynamics. This paper uses a dynamical mathematical model, the response model, to predict the short-term effects of a dose of alcohol on GFP and reports the results of an alcohol intake experiment. The GFP dynamical mechanism of change is based on the unique trait personality theory (UTPT). This theory proposes the existence of GFP, which occupies the apex of the hierarchy of personality. An experiment with 37 volunteers was performed. All the participants completed The five-adjective scale of the general factor of personality (GFP-FAS) in trait-format (GFP-T) and state-format (GFP-S) before alcohol consumption. The participants in the experimental group (28) received 26.51 g of alcohol and a slight food, while the participants in the control group (9) just received the food. Every participant filled the GFP-S each 7 minutes. The results show that GFP is modified by a single dose of alcohol: both the high scores of GFP-T and the high scores of GFP-S explain the most part of the alcohol impact. Moreover, they prove that the response model calibration to the GFP-S scores reproduces the biphasic GFP dynamics as a consequence of an alcohol dose intake described by the literature. In fact, the results also demonstrate that the response model provides the UTPT prediction: the high scores of GFP-T predict a stronger stimulant-like effect and a stronger inhibitor effect. Thus, the response model is a useful mathematical tool to predict those individuals inclined to the alcohol misuse.},

This paper presents a compartmental discrete matrix mathematical model that allows short-term estimates of ordinary, impulsive, and pathological buyers in Spain in three different economic scenarios. The results show that impulsive and pathological buyers will increase in all the economic scenarios. Notable differences in the number of ordinary buyers are found for the group aged over 65 years.},

  abstract     = {Buildings account 40% of the EU&#39;s total energy consumption. Therefore, they represent a key potential source of energy savings to fight, among others, against climate change. Furthermore, around 54% of the buildings in Spain date back before 1980, when no thermal regulation was available. The refurbishment of a façade of an old building is usually the most effective way to improve its energy efficiency, by adding layers to the external envelope in order to reduce its thermal transmittance. This paper deals with the problem of minimizing costs for the thermal refurbishment of a façade with thickness and thermal transmittance bounds and with an intervention both on the opaque part (wall) and the transparent part (windows). Among thousands, even millions of combinations of materials and thicknesses for the different layers to be added to the opaque part, types of frame, and combinations of glasses and air chambers for the transparent part, the aim is to choose the one that minimizes the cost without violating any restriction imposed to the thermal refurbishment, in particular the current energy efficiency regulations in the zone. To optimally solve this problem, it will be modelled as an Integer Linear Programming problem with binary variables. The case study will be Building 1B of the School for Building Engineering of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. It was built in the late 1960s and has had a very inefficient energy consumption record. The optimal solution will be found among more than 6 million feasible solutions.},

  abstract     = {Solar observation is the branch of astronomy devoted to the study of the Sun. When the light wavefront that comes from the Sun penetrates the atmosphere, it suffers some distortions caused by optically turbulent layers that change the wavefront&#39;s shape and morphology. Therefore, in order to obtain a good-quality image, it is necessary to correct the induced error. This is done by applying adaptive optics (AO) techniques. In the case of the present research, it is performed with the help of a Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (SCAO). The reconstruction technique proposed in this research is a SCAO based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This research develops and assesses a real-time tomographic reconstructor based on CNN, able to correct the error introduced by the atmosphere in the light wavefront received from the Sun. The CNN was trained and validated using data from the Durham AO Simulation Platform as input information. This platform incorporates certain solar functionalities that have been employed in the present research, allowing us to simulate a solar telescope. The normalized errors obtained for both ReLu and Leaky ReLu kernels were promising, without showing statistically significant differences among kernels in the value of RMSE volts of the deformable mirror commands. When different kernel dimensions are compared, statistically significant differences are found, showing that RMSE volts of the deformable mirror commands are lower for 3 × 3 kernels when compared with those of dimensions 5 × 5 and 7 × 7. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that an AO system based on CNN has been developed for solar telescopes.},

The construction of the numerical scheme is performed in two stages. Firstly, a semidiscretization technique transforms the original continuous problem into a nonlinear inhomogeneous system of random differential equations. Then, by extending to the random framework, the ideas of the exponential time differencing method, a full vector discretization of the problem addresses to a random vector difference scheme. A sample approach of the random vector difference scheme, the use of properties of Metzler matrices and the logarithmic norm allow the proof of stability of the numerical solutions in the mean square sense. In spite of the computational complexity, the results are illustrated by comparing the results with a test problem where the exact solution is known.},

In this kind of problems, a two-dimensional partial integro-differential equation is derived for the values of zero-coupon bonds. To apply standard numerical methods to this equation, it is customary to consider a bounded domain and incorporate suitable boundary conditions. However, for these two-dimensional interest rate models, there are not well-known boundary conditions, in general. Here, in order to approximate bond prices, we propose new boundary conditions, which maintain the discount function property of the zero-coupon bond price. Then, we illustrate the numerical approximation of the corresponding boundary value problem by means of an alternative direction implicit method, which has been already applied for pricing options. We test these boundary conditions with several interest rate pricing models.},

  abstract     = {The two-phase Stefan problems with phase formation and depletion are special cases of moving boundary problems with interest in science and industry. In this work, we study a solidification problem, introducing a front-fixing transformation. The resulting non-linear partial differential system involves singularities, both at the beginning of the freezing process and when the depletion is complete, that are treated with special attention in the numerical modelling. The problem is decomposed in three stages, in which implicit and explicit finite difference schemes are used. Numerical analysis reveals qualitative properties of the numerical solution spatial monotonicity of both solid and liquid temperatures and the evolution of the solidification front. Numerical experiments illustrate the behaviour of the temperatures profiles with time, as well as the dynamics of the solidification front.},

It is well known that in most cases these types of problems are solved numerically by performing a discretization and applying the finite difference technique to approximate the derivatives, transforming the equation into a finite-dimensional nonlinear system of equations. However, we would like to focus on the continuous problem, and therefore, we try to set the domain of existence and uniqueness for its analytic solution. For this purpose, we study the semilocal convergence of a Newton-type method with frozen first derivative in Banach spaces. We impose only the assumption that the Fréchet derivative satisfies the Lipschitz continuity condition and that it is bounded in the whole domain in order to obtain appropriate recurrence relations so that we may determine the domains of convergence and uniqueness for the solution. Our final aim is to apply these theoretical results to solve applied problems that come from integral equations, ordinary differential equations, and boundary value problems.},

  abstract     = {Railway interaction is characterised by the coupling between the train and the track introduced through the wheel/rail contact. The introduction of the flexibility in the wheelset and the track through the finite element (FE) method in the last four decades has permitted to study high-frequency phenomena such as rolling noise and squeal, whose origin lies in the strongly non-steady state and non-linear behaviour of the contact forces that arise from the small contact area. In order to address models with a large number of degrees of freedom, innovative Eulerian-modal models for wheelsets with rotation and cyclic tracks have been developed in recent years. The aim of this paper is to extend the resulting formulation to an uncoupled linear matrix equation of motion that allows solving each equation independently for each time step, considerably reducing the associated computational cost. The decoupling integration method proposed is compared in terms of computational performance with Newmark and Runge-Kutta schemes, commonly used in vehicle dynamics, for simulations with the leading wheelset negotiating a tangent track and accounting the rail roughness.},

[ Electronic Transactions on Numerical Analysis , 34, 44–58 (2009)], a logistic model was proposed to model the growth of anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria. In the laboratory experiment, actual data for two species of bacteria were considered: Rhodobacter capsulatus and Chlorobium vibrioforme . In this paper, we suggest a new nonlinear model by assuming that the population growth rate is not proportional to the size of the bacteria population, but to the number of interactions between the microorganisms, and by taking into account the beginning of the death phase in the kinetic curve. Stanescu et al. evaluated the effect of randomness into the model coefficients by using generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions, by setting arbitrary distributions without taking into account the likelihood of the data. By contrast, we utilize a Bayesian inverse approach for parameter estimation to obtain reliable posterior distributions for the random input coefficients in both the logistic and our new model. Since our new model does not possess an explicit solution, we use gPC expansions to construct the Bayesian model and to accelerate the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the Bayesian inference.},

  abstract     = {Newton-Raphson method has always remained as the widely used method for finding simple and multiple roots of nonlinear equations. In the past years, many new methods have been introduced for finding multiple zeros that involve the use of weight function in the second step, thereby, increasing the order of convergence and giving a flexibility to generate a family of methods satisfying some underlying conditions. However, in almost all the schemes developed over the past, the usual way is to use Newton-type method at the first step. In this paper, we present a new two-step optimal fourth-order family of methods for multiple roots ( m &gt; 1). The proposed iterative family has the flexibility of choice at both steps. The development of the scheme is based on using weight functions. The first step can not only recapture Newton&#39;s method for multiple roots as special case but is also capable of defining new choices of first step. A stability analysis of some particular cases is also given to explain the dynamical behavior of the new methods around the multiple roots and decide the best values of the free parameters involved. Finally, we compare our methods with the existing schemes of the same order with a real life application as well as standard test problems. From the numerical results, we find that our methods can be considered as a better alternative for the existing procedures of same order.},

The analysis highlights a significant difference between the two possible ways to choose the alternating LDG fluxes showing that the variant that is inconsistent with the upwind advective flux is more accurate in case of advection–diffusion discretizations. Furthermore, whereas for the BR1 scheme used within a third order DG scheme on Gauss-Legendre nodes, a higher accuracy for well-resolved problems has previously been observed in the literature, this work shows that higher accuracy of the BR1 discretization only holds for odd orders of the DG scheme. In addition, this higher accuracy is generally lost on Gauss–Legendre–Lobatto nodes.},

This problem is solved by constructing completely conservative difference schemes in a view of these magnetohydrodynamic processes and self-gravitating phenomena. In this work, to study and apply the difference methods for solving problems of magnetic gas dynamics, a discrete representation of symmetrized spatial deformations of the medium was obtained.

By reviewing the literature and using experts&#39; knowledge, supply chain configuration criteria are determined. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map methodology is employed to consider the interrelations between criteria. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map methodology is a suitable tool due to the presence of causalities and relationships among criteria and the difficulty of expressing the interrelations with crisp numbers. It also deals with uncertain and vague data and allows representing hesitation. The application is conducted in an automobile factory, which is one of the largest manufacturers in Turkey.

The problem is in solving the linear Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. After discretization of the domain and approximation of the integral operator, this problem is reduced to solving a large system of linear algebraic equations. It is shown that the matrix of coefficients is the Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz one in the case of the horizontal layer. For calculating and storing the elements of this matrix, we construct an efficient method, which significantly reduces the required memory and time. For the case of the curvilinear layer, we construct a method for approximating the parts of the matrix by a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz one. This allows us to exploit the same efficient method for storing and processing the coefficient matrix in the case of a curvilinear layer. To solve the system of linear equations, we constructed the parallel algorithm on the basis of the stabilized biconjugated gradient method with using the Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz structure of the matrix. We implemented the BiCGSTAB and BiCGSTABmem algorithms for the Uran cluster supercomputer using the hybrid MPI + OpenMP technology. A model problem with synthetic data was solved for a large grid.

Any estimates of meteoric NO production depend not only on a quantifiable meteoroid population and a rate of fragmentation, with a size capable of producing high temperature flows, but also on understanding the physical properties of the meteor flows along with their thermal history. We performed an exploratory pilot numerical study using ANSYS Fluent, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, to investigate the production of NO in the upper atmosphere by small meteoroids (or fragments of meteoroids after they undergo a disruption episode) in the size range from 10 −2 to 1 m. Our model uses the simulation of a spherical body in the continuum flow at 70- and 80-km altitude to approximate the behaviour of a small meteoroid capable of producing NO. The results presented in this exploratory study are in good agreement with previous studies.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a fuzzy logic–based mathematical model of a sequence of earthquakes using fuzzy reasoning tools. We formed a set of fuzzy implications in order to study them, and we computed their deviation, so that we could compare them and conclude about the most accurate one. The compositional rule of inference was considered, which is based on the generalized modus ponens scheme. The new fuzzy methodology was used for each implication. The data required for the implications were obtained from the aftershocks of an earthquake with significant effects in a specific area. The magnitude of the aftershocks and their time difference from the main incident provided the values for the new fuzzy algorithm application. Two samples were selected relative with the seismic activity, which occurred the following days. The one sample consisted of 30 values, and the other sample from all the values found in the data archives of the National Observatory of Athens. Results were shown for both samples. So a mathematical technique, which reproduces the incidents using basic information and based on only two parameters, is developed for the simulation of a seismic sequence, which follows a strong earthquake.},

  abstract     = {Asian options represent an important subclass of the path-dependent contracts that are identified by payoff depending on the average of the underlying asset prices over the prespecified period of option lifetime. Commonly, this average is observed at discrete dates, and also, early exercise features can be admitted. As a result, analytical pricing formulae are not always available. Therefore, some form of a numerical approximation is essential for efficient option valuation. In this paper, we study a PDE model for pricing discretely observed arithmetic Asian options with fixed as well as floating strike for both European and American exercise features. The pricing equation for such options is similar to the Black-Scholes equation with 1 underlying asset, and the corresponding average appears only in the jump conditions across the sampling dates. The objective of the paper is to present the comprehensive methodological concept that forms and improves the valuation process. We employ a robust numerical procedure based on the discontinuous Galerkin approach arising from the piecewise polynomial generally discontinuous approximations. This technique enables a simple treatment of discrete sampling by incorporation of jump conditions at each monitoring date. Moreover, an American early exercise constraint is directly handled as an additional nonlinear source term in the pricing equation. The proposed solving procedure is accompanied by an empirical study with practical results compared to reference values.},

The main purpose of the work is to investigate the capacity of the main mechanical parameter used in the analyses, namely, the friction coefficient, to have effects on the mechanical response of ancient masonry structures undergoing seismic actions. Therefore, the tower was modelled following the discrete element method (DEM) and assembling the masonry texture as rigid bodies tied by frictional joints. Thus a discontinuous approach was used to assess the dynamic properties and the vulnerability of the masonry structure, through large deformations regulated by the Signorini&#39;s law, concerning the impenetrability between the rigid bodies; and by the Coulomb&#39;s law, regarding the dry-friction model. Afterward, different values were assigned to the friction coefficient of the models, and a variety of real seismic shocks have been applied in the nonlinear analyses. Finally, it is possible to see different failure mechanisms resulting for each friction value and types of dynamic actions used, as expected.},

The model is obtained identifying the states on the state space A o where two or more sequences share the same transition probabilities (see also García and González-López 2 ). This identification establishes a partition on {1,…, p }× A o , the set of sequences, and the state space. We show that by means of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the partition can be estimated eventually almost surely. Also, in García and Londoño, 1 it is given a notion of divergence, derived from the BIC, which serves to identify the proximity/discrepancy between elements of {1,…, p }× A o (see also García et al 3 ). In the present article, we prove that this notion is a metric in the space where the model is built and that it is statistically consistent to determine proximity/discrepancy between the elements of the space {1,…, p }× A o . We apply the notions discussed here for the construction of a parsimonious model that represents the common stochastic structure of 153 complete genomic Zika sequences, coming from tropical and subtropical regions.},

The differences and common features of CH 4 and CO 2 spatial distribution in this region of the Arctic during specified periods were analyzed.

For CO 2 on the contrary, lower values were observed over the continent, and they increased with a distance from the coastline.

The vital feature of spectral graph wavelets is that they can be constructed on any complex network using the graph Laplacian. The essence of the method is that the same operator can be used for the construction of the spectral graph wavelet and the approximation of the differential operator involved in the Burgers&#39; equation. In this paper, two test problems are considered with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. The numerical results show that the method accurately captures the evolution of the localized patterns at all the scales, and the adaptive node arrangement is accordingly obtained. The convergence of the given method is verified, and efficiency is shown using CPU time.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of approximate symmetries of a class of nonlinear wave equations with a small nonlinear dissipation has been investigated. In order to compute the first-order approximate symmetry, we have applied the method that was proposed by Valenti basically based on the expansion of the dependent variables in perturbation series but removing the drawback of the impossibility to work in hierarchy in calculating symmetries. The algebraic structure of the approximate symmetries is discussed, an optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras is defined and constructed, and, finally, some invariant solutions corresponding to the resulted symmetries are obtained.},

Under the assumption of the existence of a law that prevails in at least q% of the samples of the collection, we show that the procedure allows to identify samples governed by the predominant law. The approach is based on a local metric between samples, which tends to zero when we compare samples of identical law and tends to infinity when comparing samples with different laws. The local metric allows to define a criterion which takes arbitrarily large values when the previous assumption about the existence of a predominant law does not hold.

Unlike the classical statement when the vacuum magnetic field obeys the div-curl system of pre-Maxwell dynamics, to better understand the influence of the electric field in vacuum, we do not neglect the displacement current in the vacuum region and consider the Maxwell equations for electric and magnetic fields. Under the necessary and sufficient stability condition for a planar interface found earlier by Trakhinin, we prove an energy a priori estimate for the linearized constant coefficient problem. The process of derivation of this estimate is based on various methods, including a secondary symmetrization of the vacuum Maxwell equations, the derivation of a hyperbolic evolutionary equation for the interface function, and the construction of a degenerate Kreiss-type symmetrizer for an elliptic-hyperbolic problem for the total pressure.},

Holling type-II functional response for the relation between nutrient and autotroph while Beddington-DeAngelis-type functional response for autotroph and herbivore relation are considered here. It is plausible that the conversion of nutrient from dead biomass (autotroph and herbivore) by decomposers (i.e., bacteria and fungi) are not instantaneous, which takes times. Hereby, two different discrete time delays for the decomposition process are introduced. The local and global stability behaviours of both nondelayed and delayed models are analysed around the equilibrium points. The stability and direction of Hopf-bifurcation using normal form theory and centre manifold theorem by taking one delay as a bifurcation parameter while keeping the other one fixed in the stable interval are discussed. It is observed that if the delay increases, the system loses its stability and hence becomes unstable. It is analysed how autotroph-herbivore ecosystem can be affected by the quantity of input nutrient and the properties of delays. The quantity of nutrient and the length of delays play significant roles in determining the stability of the system since a sufficiently small amount of nutrients or a long enough delay leads to the extinction of a species.},

The equations under consideration are important in several applied problems in physics and material science, in particular for phenomena where memory effects are important. Several models in the area of viscoelasticity, including heat conduction and wave propagation correspond to the general class of integro-differential equations considered here.

The dynamic characteristics of the wheelset motion system under a nonholonomic constraint are investigated. These results generalize and improve some known results about the wheelset motion system. Meanwhile, based on multiple equilibrium analysis, calculation of Lyapunov exponents and Poincaré section, the chaotic behaviors of the wheelset system are discussed, which indicates that there are more complex dynamic behaviors in the railway wheelset system with higher order terms of Taylor series of trigonometric functions. This paper has also realized the chaos control and bifurcation control for the wheelset motion system by adaptive feedback control method and linear feedback control. The results show that the chaotic wheelset system and bifurcation wheelset system are all well controlled, whether by controlling the yaw angle and the lateral displacement or only by controlling the yaw angle.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we explore a pricing model for corporate bond accompanied with multiple credit rating migration risk and stochastic interest rate. The bond price volatility strongly depends on potentially multiple credit rating migration and stochastic change of interest rate. A free boundary problem of partial differential equation is presented, which is the equivalent transformation of the pricing model. The existence, uniqueness, and regularity for the free boundary problem are established to guarantee the rationality of the pricing model. Due to the stochastic change of interest rate, the discontinuous coefficient in the free boundary problem depends explicitly on the time variable but is convergent as time tends to infinity. Accordingly, an auxiliary free boundary problem is constructed, whose coefficient is the convergent limit of the coefficient in the original free boundary problem. With some constraint on the risk discount rate satisfied, we prove that a unique traveling wave exists in the auxiliary free boundary problem. The inductive method is adopted to fit the multiplicity of credit rating. Then we show that the solution of the original free boundary problem converges to the traveling wave in the auxiliary free boundary problem. Returning to the pricing model with multiple credit rating migration and stochastic interest rate, we conclude that the bond price profile can be captured by a traveling wave pattern coupling with a guaranteed bond price with face value equal to one at the maturity.},

  abstract     = {A Filippov-type plant disease model is developed by introducing a interaction ratio threshold, the number of susceptible plants infected by per diseased plant, which determines whether control measures including replanting or roguing are carried out. The main purpose of this paper is to give a completely qualitative analysis of the model. By employing Poincaré maps, our analysis reveals rich dynamics including a global attractor bounded by a touching closed orbit, which is convergent in finite time from its outside, a global attractor bounded by two touching closed orbits and a pseudo-saddle, and a globally asymptotically stable pseudo-node. Moreover, we give biological implications of our results in implementing control strategies for plant diseases.},

The Markovian switching with uncertain mode transition rates is first drawn into modeling the predator–prey system and the uncertainty of model parameters is also fully discussed, which can reflect the realistic practical significance. The robust passivity for the uncertain LV model with disturbance input and feedback control is studied by the passivity theories and inequality techniques. Some sufficient criteria are derived by the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional, and the corresponding controllers are designed to ensure the passivity of the proposed closed-loop uncertain LV model. Finally, a three-specie two-mode LV model is provided to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.},

For the Type II, the problem is given by four hyperbolic equations, and it is conservative (there is no energy dissipation). We introduce in the system a couple of dissipation mechanisms in order to obtain the exponential decay of the solutions. To be precise, we introduce a pair of the following damping mechanisms: viscoelasticity, viscoporosities, and thermal dissipation. We prove that the system is exponentially stable in three different scenarios: viscoporosity in one structure jointly with thermal dissipation, viscoporosity in each structure, and viscoporosity in one structure jointly with viscoelasticity. However, if viscoelasticity and thermal dissipation are considered together, undamped solutions can be obtained},

Furthermore, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of traversal static distribution in the model. Numerical simulation shows that the role of media coverage is crucial to reduce the rumor propagation scale. The larger the coverage rate is, the smaller the rumor propagation scale is.},

Then, the scattering wave induced by the inclusion and the standing wave in the inclusion is deduced. Different incident wave angles and the corresponding anisotropy of the half space are considered to obtain the reflected waves. The elliptical inclusion is transferred into a unit circle by conformal mapping method, and then the undetermined coefficients in scattering wave and standing wave are solved by using the continuous condition at the boundary of the inclusion. Subsequently, the dynamic stress concentration factor (DSCF) around the inclusion is calculated and analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the distribution of the DSCF is mainly influenced by the incident wave angle and the incident wave number. It is affected by anisotropic parameters as well.},

Using the variable separation method, the direct problem on determining the radial and longitudinal components of the displacement field is investigated. The influence of the laws of variation for the Lamé parameters on acoustic characteristics is analysed. The inverse coefficient problem on the identification of the variable Lamé parameters from the data on the amplitude-frequency characteristic is stated. Based on the weak formulation of the problem for an elastic inhomogeneous body, a general linearised relation for the desired and given characteristics is obtained. A system of the Fredholm integral equations of the first kind is formulated with respect to two unknown corrections to the restored laws of the Lamé parameters change. The solution is built by means of an iterative process. A reconstruction of various laws of changing the Lamé parameters is carried out.

  abstract     = {The objective of this work is to introduce a new system of differential equations describing the nonlocal thermoelasticity theory with higher time derivatives and two-phase lags. In order to obtain this model, we used the nonlocal continuum theory proposed by Eringen and the methodology of the Taylor series expansion of higher-order time derivatives. Some generalized thermoelasticity theories follow as limited cases. This model is used to study the thermoelastic interaction in a nonlocal medium. The medium is exposed to an applied magnetic field and a periodic time heat source with a constant strength. Some comparisons have been displayed in figures to estimate the influences of the nonlocal parameter and magnetic field as well as the parameters of higher-order on all the field quantities.},

This approach is based on a coupled system of nonlinear ordinary integral inequalities and lower bound estimates for the spatial integral of the nonlinearities. In the critical case, we employ a test function-type method that has been developed recently by Ikeda-Sobajima-Wakasa and relies strongly on a family of certain self-similar solutions of the adjoint linear equation. Therefore, as critical curve in the p − q plane of the exponents of the power nonlinearities for this weakly coupled system, we conjecture a shift of the critical curve for the corresponding weakly coupled system of semilinear wave equations.},

The cell-free and cell-cell incidence rates are modeled by general functions. The model incorporates both, latently and actively, infected cells as well as three distributed time delays. Nonnegativity and boundedness properties of the solutions are proven to show the well-posedness of the model. The model admits two equilibria that are determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 . The global stability of each equilibrium is proven by utilizing Lyapunov function and LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations. The effect of impairment of B-cell functions and time delays on the virus dynamics are studied. We have shown that if the functions of B-cell is impaired, then the concentration of viruses is increased in the plasma. Moreover, we have observed that increasing the time delay will suppress the viral replication.},

In this paper, we consider the reconstruction of any functions in l 2 ⁡ ( Z ) from coefficients obtained from NSG frames. Since perfect reconstruction is in general not feasible from NSG frame coefficients, we resort to approximately dual frames and estimate the reconstruction errors. We provide different approximately dual frames of NSG frames under some conditions and give the corresponding reconstruction error bounds. In particular, for a class of NSG frames that are related to painless NSG frames, we show that the approximately dual frames carry the NSG structure.

Indeed, there are a large number of phenomena, including fluid flow, diffusive transport akin to diffusion, rheology, probability, and electrical networks, that are modeled by different equations involving fractional order derivatives. This paper deals with multiplicity results of solutions for a class of impulsive fractional differential systems. The approach is based on variational methods and critical point theory. Indeed, we establish existence results for our system under some algebraic conditions on the nonlinear part with the classical Ambrosetti–Rabinowitz (AR) condition on the nonlinear and the impulsive terms. Moreover by combining two algebraic conditions on the nonlinear term, which guarantee the existence of two weak solutions, applying the mountain pass theorem, we establish the existence of third weak solution for our system.},

Starting from the idea of grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm and combining the geometric properties of SG-Bézier surfaces, this method transforms the degree reduction problem of SG-Bézier surfaces into an optimization problem. By choosing the fitness function, the degree reduction approximation of shape-adjustable SG-Bézier surfaces under unconstrained and angular interpolation constraints is realized. At the same time, some concrete examples of degree reduction and its errors are given. The results show that this method not only achieves good degree reduction effect but also is easy to implement and has high precision.},

The mathematical model of memristor is established in terms of newly defined fractal-fractional differential operators so called Atangana-Baleanu, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Caputo fractal-fractional differential operator. A novel numerical approach is developed for the governing differential equations of memristor on the basis of Atangana-Baleanu, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Caputo fractal-fractional differential operator. We discussed chaotic behavior of memristor under three criteria such as (i) varying fractal order, we fixed fractional order; (ii) varying fractional order, we fixed fractal order; and (ii) varying fractal and fractional orders simultaneously. Our investigated graphical illustrations and simulated results via MATLAB for the chaotic behaviors of memristor suggest that newly presented Atangana-Baleanu, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Caputo fractal-fractional differential operators generate significant results as compared with classical approach.},

The fractional order quaternion-valued neural networks are separated into four real-valued systems forming an equivalent four real-valued fractional order neural networks, which decreases the computational complexity by avoiding the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication. Via some fractional inequality techniques and suitable Lyapunov functional, a brand new criterion is proposed first to ensure the Mittag-Leffler stability for the addressed neural networks. Besides, the combination of quaternion-valued adaptive and impulsive control is intended to realize the asymptotically synchronization between two fractional order quaternion-valued neural networks. Ultimately, two numerical simulations are provided to check the accuracy and validity of our obtained theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Potentials play an important role in solving boundary value problems for elliptic equations. In the middle of the last century, a potential theory was constructed for a two-dimensional elliptic equation with one singular coefficient. In the study of potentials, the properties of the fundamental solutions of the given equation are essentially and fruitfully used. At the present time, fundamental solutions of a multidimensional elliptic equation with one degeneration line are already known. In this paper, we investigate the double- and simple-layer potentials for this kind of elliptic equations. Results from potential theory allow us to represent the solution of the boundary value problems in the form of an integral equation. By using some properties of the Gaussian hypergeometric function, we first prove limiting theorems and derive integral equations concerning the densities of the double- and simple-layer potentials. The obtained results are then applied in order to find an explicit solution of the Holmgren problem for the multidimensional singular elliptic equation in the half of the ball.},

It shows the high accuracy and low computational cost of the LSCM compared with some other numerical methods. The fractional Bratu differential equation is transformed into a nonlinear system of algebraic equations for the unknown Legendre coefficients and solved with some spectral collocation methods. Some illustrative examples are also given to show the validity and applicability of this method, and the obtained results are compared with the existing studies to highlight its high efficiency and neglectable error.},

The model consists of two hosts, with three compartments each, and concentration of the parasites from environment as sources of infection. The model takes into account a predator-prey relationship between the major hosts and obtained a threshold value for their existence. Systematic derivation of basic reproduction number, is provided. Thorough qualitative analysis of the model reveals that it has a local and global asymptotic stable disease-free equilibrium when ; thus, ( EM ) will die out in the populations. However, when exceeds unity, the model exhibits a unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotic stable; hence, disease will persist. The elasticity indices and partial rank correlation coefficients of the basic reproduction number and cumulative new cases of the two hosts with respect to parameter values are computed. Sensitivity analyses identified key parameters that are the most sensitive and can be used for control strategies in reducing below unity. Numerical simulations are used to verify theoretical results and quantify prevalence of the disease in host populations.},

  abstract     = {The solutions of the one-dimensional (1D) steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations have been thoroughly discussed before, but restrained for uniform total enthalpy, which leads to only a shock wave profile possible in an infinite domain. To date, very little progress has been made for the case with nonuniform total enthalpy. In this paper, we affirm that under nonuniform total enthalpy, there also exists steady solution for the 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equations, but the flow domain must be finite in the positive x -axis. The 1D steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a singular perturbed nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for velocity with the assumptions of P ⁢ r = 3 / 4 and a constant viscosity coefficient. By analyzing the mathematical property of the nonlinear ODE for velocity, we propose an asymptotic expansion for the solution of it as an exponential type sequence and also prove the convergence. Unlike the case of uniform total enthalpy, where the solutions for all variables keep monotone, we show that under nonuniform total enthalpy and some specific boundary conditions, there exists extreme inside the thin boundary layer. Numerical results verify the accuracy and convergence of the asymptotic expansion. This asymptotic expansion solution can serve as an important testing to demonstrate the efficiency of numerical methods developed for compressible Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds number.},

The growth of the prey is affected by the parameter M , which defines the Allee effect. In addition, the delay τ also influences the logistic growth of the prey, which can be interpreted as the maturity time or the gestation period. In the study of the characteristic equation, we observe that the delay τ also depends on the parameter M , which affects the dynamics in the prey population. Considering the delay as a bifurcation parameter, the local asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium is investigated. On the other hand, we find that the system can also suffer a Hopf bifurcation in the positive equilibrium when the delay passes through a sequence of critical values. In particular, we study the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions, an explicit algorithm is provided applying the normal form theory and center manifold reduction for the functional differential equations. Finally, numerical simulations that support the theoretical analysis are included.},

  abstract     = {This article presents the closed-form solutions of two-sector human capital–based Romer growth model. The partial Hamiltonian approach is effectively applied to some growth models in order to compute the closed-form solutions for economic variables involved in the model. Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle provides the set of first-order system of ODEs, which are regarded as an essential criteria for optimality. The partial Hamiltonian approach is utilized to construct three first integrals of the system using the current value Hamiltonian. With the aid of these first integrals, we computed two distinct exact solutions of Romer model under certain parametric restrictions. The closed-form expressions for control, state, and costate variables are presented explicitly as a function of . We have graphically illustrated the solution curves and observed the effect of human capital parameter on control and state variables. The growth rates of all economic variables are evaluated, and their long-run behavior is predicted.},

Fluid motion is considered in presence of viscous dissipation, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), radiation, and heat generation absorption. Homotopy analysis method (HAM) is employed to solve nonlinear ordinary differential system. Results show that fluid flow reduces for larger Weissenberg and Hartman numbers. Temperature gradually enhances for larger Weissenberg number and radiation parameter. For higher estimation of thermophoresis parameter, the temperature and concentration are enhanced. Opposite impact of Hartman and Weissenberg numbers is noticed for entropy generation and Bejan number. Disorderedness and Bejan number are reduced near the sheet, while the opposite trend is seen away from the sheet.},

Effects of pulsatile nature of blood flows as well as the initial length on transport of the LDL species in the arterial boundary layer region are analyzed numerically in the present work. The set of governing equations consisting of continuity, Navier-Stokes, and species transport is solved using a projection method based on the second-order central difference discretization. The obtained results are in excellent agreement with the pertinent data. The computational results imply that the flow field and concentration distribution are time dependent but the variation of the filtration velocity can be ignored. The LDL concentration boundary layer thickness decreases in the outer part and increases in the inner part for both with or without straight length. Presence of initial straight length generates about 26% growth in the boundary layer thickness, although its effect on the LDL surface concentration (LSC) is negligible. The maximum LSC is related to the regions with minimum wall shear stress in the inner part of the curved artery, which have more potential for formation of atherosclerosis. A new numerical correlation between the LSC and boundary layer thickness is proposed and examined.},

It is worth observing that temperature is one of the most principal limiting factors for phytoplanktons production due to photosynthetic enzymes work at their optimum temperature levels. In this study, the fractional oxygen-phytoplankton-zooplankton model is considered by singular and nonsingular fractional operators within Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Atangana-Baleanu in Caputo sense. The rate of oxygen production is considered by a function of temperature account for the sea surface warming. At first, the temperature function is constant and then it starts to increase, after a certain time of increase, before the oxygen depletion begins, the temperature is set to a higher secure value. With this temperature function choice, detailed numerical simulations are carried out to provide details of the internal structure of the system.

  abstract     = {We consider a one-dimensional aggregation equation for a non-negative density ρ ( x , t ) associated with a quartic potential W ( x ) = β x 2 + δ x 4 ( δ &gt; 0 , β ∈ R ). We show that for the case of symmetric initial data [ ρ ( x , 0 ) ≡ ρ ( − x , 0 ) ], the solution of the aggregation equation can be expressed in terms of an explicit function of x , L ( t ) , and Φ ( t ) , where the functions L ( t ) and Φ ( t ) are determined by an ordinary differential equation initial value problem, the numerical solution of which is relatively straightforward. The function L ( t ) , which can be interpreted as an upper bound for the radius of the support of ρ ( x , t ) , is finite for all t &gt; 0 , even if the support of ρ ( x , 0 ) is unbounded, while Φ ( t ) is a potential related to the time integral of the second spatial moment ϕ ( t ) of ρ ( x , t ) . We develop various bounds on L ( t ) and ϕ ( t ) and a number of results concerning convexity and monotonicity that require no knowledge of ρ ( x , 0 ) other than its symmetry. We show that many, but not all, of these results persist if the assumption of symmetry is relaxed. Our general results are tested against numerical solutions for two examples of symmetric ρ ( x , 0 ) . We also exhibit some counterintuitive behaviour of the model, by finding conditions under which ρ x x ( 0 , t ) → ∞ as t → ∞ , even if we start with ρ x x ( 0 , 0 ) &lt; 0 and take β ≥ 0 , which ensures ultimate collapse to a single Dirac component at the origin.},

A mathematical study of PGD methods is first presented for general regularization problems in the framework of (Hilbert) Sobolev spaces, and their convergence is then illustrated on OF computation. The convergence study is divided in two parts: (a) the weak convergence based on the Brézis-Lieb decomposition and (b) the strong convergence based on a growth result on the sequence of descent directions. A practical PGD-based OF implementation is then proposed and evaluated on freely available OF data sets. The proposed PGD-based OF approach outperforms the corresponding non-PGD implementation in terms of both accuracy and computation time for images containing a weak level of information, namely, low image resolution and/or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).},

  abstract     = {In a lot of engineering applications, one has to recover the temperature of a heat body having a surface that cannot be measured directly. This raises an inverse problem of determining the temperature on the surface of a body using interior measurements, which is called the sideways problem. Many papers investigated the problem (with or without fractional derivatives) by using the Cauchy data u ( x 0 , t ) , u x ( x 0 , t ) measured at one interior point x = x 0 ∈ ( 0 , L ) or using an interior data u ( x 0 , t ) and the assumption lim x → ∞ u ( x , t ) = 0 . However, the flux u x ( x 0 , t ) is not easy to measure, and the temperature assumption at infinity is inappropriate for a bounded body. Hence, in the present paper, we consider a fractional sideways problem, in which the interior measurements at two interior point, namely, x = 1 and x = 2 , are given by continuous data with deterministic noises and by discrete data contaminated with random noises. We show that the problem is severely ill-posed and further construct an a posteriori optimal truncation regularization method for the deterministic data, and we also construct a nonparametric regularization for the discrete random data. Numerical examples show that the proposed method works well.},

  abstract     = {For the initial boundary value problem of compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations in one-dimensional bounded domains with general density-dependent viscosity and large external force, we prove that there exists a unique global classical solution with large initial data containing vacuum. Furthermore, we show that the density is bounded from above independently of time, which yields the large time behavior of the solutions as time tends to infinity. More precisely, the density and the velocity converge to the steady states in L p and in W 1 , p ( 1 ≤ p &lt; + ∞ ), respectively. Moreover, the decay rate in time of the solutions is shown to be exponential. Finally, we also prove that the spatial gradient of density will blow up as time tends to infinity when the vacuum states appear initially even at one point.},

Next, we show that there exists a global unique solution for the initial boundary value problem with periodic conditions in torus T d ( d = 2 , 3 ) , by using a continuation argument of local solution.

Due to the blow-up result for the corresponding problem with the initial data of compact support, which was first obtained by S. Alinhac ( The null condition for quasilinear wave equations in two space dimensions II. Amer. J. Math, 123 [2001], no. 6, 1071-1101 ), this means that it is impossible to prove the global solvability in time in general. Therefore, in this case, what we can expect is to obtain the same lower bound of the lifespan as in Alinhac&#39;s work. That is, we also show the almost global existence, and the lower bound of the lifespan is e c / ε 2 for sufficiently small ε &gt; 0 and some constant c &gt; 0 . To achieve this goal, the methods we adopt are the “ghost weight” technique and the modified weighted L ∞ - L ∞ estimates of the solutions to the linear wave equations. In addition, an alternative proof of the global existence is given for a similar case in three dimensions, using only the L ∞ - L 2 estimates of the “good derivatives.”},

We model a commercial bank that complies with Basel III&#39;s minimum capital requirement on an interval [ 0 , T ] for T &gt; 0 . The bank model is achieved via a specific rate of capital influx that fixes the bank&#39;s CAR at the minimum prescribed level of 8%. On the basis of this capital influx rate, we derive models for the bank&#39;s asset portfolio and capital dynamics required for maintaining the CAR at the minimum prescribed level. For the aforementioned bank, we further study a deposit insurance (DI) pricing problem with a coverage horizon equal to years. More specifically, we employ a multiperiod DI pricing model to approximate the cost of DI for the bank on the interval , where the constant (minimum) CAR is maintained. We study the behaviours of the models leading to the constant (minimum) CAR, and the behaviour of the DI premium estimate by means of numerical simulations. In the simulation study pertaining to the DI premium estimate specifically, we determine the effects of changes in the bank&#39;s initial leverage level (deposit-to-asset ratio), the DI coverage horizon, and the volatility of the asset portfolio on the DI premium estimate.},

By studying a suitable Gamma-limit, we identify a parameter regime in which the sheet is inextensible, and the bending energy of the sheet is negligible. In this regime, the problem simplifies to one with an explicit solution. In order to prove Γ − convergence, we introduce a retardation argument in order to deal with the possibly infinite bending energy of the ansatz.

The TDD-NCP model was developed recently by Chengąŕs group in Fudan and Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). The TDD-NCP model introduced the time delay process into the differential equations to describe the latent period of the epidemic. The Fudan-CDCC model was established when Wenbin Chen suggested to determine the kernel functions in the TDD-NCP model by the public data from CDCC. By the public data of the cumulative confirmed cases in different regions in China and different countries, these models can clearly illustrate that the containment of the epidemic highly depends on early and effective isolations.},

  abstract     = {The numerical approach for computer simulation of femtosecond laser pulse interaction with a semiconductor is considered under the formation of 3D contrast time-dependent spatiotemporal structures. The problem is governed by the set of nonlinear partial differential equations describing a semiconductor characteristic evolution and a laser pulse propagation. One of the equations is a Poisson equation concerning electric field potential with Neumann boundary conditions that requires fulfillment of the well-known condition for Neumann problem solvability. The Poisson equation right part depends on free-charged particle concentrations that are governed by nonlinear equations. Therefore, the charge conservation law plays a key role for a finite-difference scheme construction as well as for solvability of the Neumann difference problem. In this connection, the iteration methods for the Poisson equation solution become preferable than using direct methods like the fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the following: if the finite-difference scheme does not possess the conservatism property, then the problem solvability could be broken, and the numerical solution does not correspond to the differential problem solution. It should be stressed that for providing the computation in a long-time interval, it is crucial to use a numerical method that possessing asymptotic stability property. In this regard, we develop an effective numerical approach—the three-stage iteration process. It has the same economic computing expenses as a widely used split-step method, but, in contrast to the split-step method, our method possesses conservatism and asymptotic stability properties. Computer simulation results are presented.},

To fight back this disease or control the spread, mankind relies on modeling and medicine to control, cure, and behavior of the cancer diseases. We developed the fractional-order immunotherapy bladder cancer model and used the BCG vaccine for treatment by using the Caputo fractional derivative operator φɛ (0,1] . A mathematical model has four variables B , E , T i , T u which represent the vaccine for the immune system, effector cells, total population of affected, and unaffected cells, respectively. In this model, we have two cases according to the growth rate of cells. The fractional-order system is stable in both cases and gives the solution infeasible region for uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness to illustrate the treatment of cancer. The effect of fractional parameter on our obtained solutions is presented, and a comparison is made with the classical ordinary derivative operator. It is worthy to observe that fractional derivatives show significant changes and memory effects as compared with ordinary derivatives to control the disease at the initial stage to overcome the risk of living with cancer.},

First, we give the asymptotic behavior for the oscillatory distributional kernels and their Bessel potentials by using Fourier analytic techniques. Then, the space regularity is derived by employing some results on singular Fourier multipliers. Using the asymptotic behavior for the above kernels, we prove the time regularity. Finally, we use mismatch estimates to prove the pointwise convergence to the initial data in Hölder spaces. In addition, we also prove Hölder regularity result for the Schrödinger equation.},

Considering the relationship between the sampling period and the dwell time of two switching instants, sampling interval with no switching and sampling interval with one switching are discussed, respectively. By Wirtinger-based inequality, Wirtinger-based double integral inequality, and free-weighting matrix technique, some delay-dependent sufficient conditions are given to guarantee the exponential stability of uncertain switched neutral nonlinear systems under asynchronous switching. In addition, sampled-data controllers can also be designed by special operations of matrices.

Our discretization algorithm is based on the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) schemes along with using the natural upwind fluxes, which enables us to solve the model problem element by element. This means that we require to solve a low-order system of equations in each subinterval, hence avoiding the need for a full global solution. The proposed schemes are tested on a range of initial- and boundary-value problems including a variable coefficient example, a nonsmooth problem, and some oscillatory test cases with exact solutions. Also, the validation of the proposed methods was compared with those obtained available existing computational procedures. Overall, it was found that LDG methods indicated highly satisfactory performance with comparatively lower degree of polynomials and number of elements compared with other numerical models.},

Firstly, based on a priori estimates of spatial semidiscrete numerical solutions, stability and convergence results of one-level space-time finite element solutions in different norms are provided under some restrictions on the time step. Secondly, in order to improve the computational efficiency, multilevel space-time finite element method is introduced. In the multilevel numerical scheme, the nonlinear Kelvin-Voigt problem is just solved in the coarsest mesh, the Newton iteration is adopted to treat the nonlinear term, and a series of linear Kelvin-Voigt problems are considered in successive shape conforming regular triangulations. The multilevel space-time finite element approximate solution is shown to have a convergence rate of the same order as that of the one-level space-time finite element solutions of the nonlinear Kelvin-Voigt problem on a fine mesh with some appropriate choices between the time steps and mesh sizes: . Finally, some numerical results are provided to verify the established theoretical findings. Compared with the standard Galerkin finite element method, from the view point of theoretical analysis, the space-time finite element method has the same convergence orders for variables as the Galerkin method. However, from the view point of numerical simulations, the space-time finite element method improves the computational accuracy without additional computational cost.},

For the KdV equation with periodic boundary condition, this is done by Ghidaglia in 1988. But since then, it seems little is known on this topic for the KdV equation on unbounded domains. The main difficulties are (a) the dissipative effect of the KdV equation is weak, and (b) the Sobolev embeddings on R are not compact. To overcome these difficulties, we present some new idea to prove the Chueshov-Lasicka quasi-stable estimates for the KdV equation on R . In this way, we show that for the KdV equation on the real line, the global attractor has a finite fractal dimension in the sharp space H 3 ( R ) whenever the force belongs to L 2 ( R ) .},

The local property means that the semicontinuity of bispatial attractors is local uniform with regard to the time as the singular perturbation parameter tends to 0. To do this, by introducing some new and local-uniform concepts of nonautonomous cocycles, we first establish the regularity and local upper semicontinuity of pullback attractors simultaneously. In applications, the presence of the singular perturbation term brings some difficulties even to prove the existence of pullback attractors in . Therefore, we prove an -pullback attractor without any restriction on the order of the nonlinearity. With the critical exponent of the nonlinearity, we apply positive-negative truncations and splitting methods to attest an -pullback attractor. We use weak assumptions for both the nonlinearity and force here. Finally, from the viewpoint of left and right limits, we prove the local upper semicontinuity of the family of obtained attractors as the perturbation parameter approaches to 0 in , by using the continuity of solutions on the time. This result essentially improves and completes previous works on upper semicontinuity of attractors only as the change of single parameter.},

In this paper, we introduce a class of space-fractional reaction-diffusion model with singular source term arising in combustion process. The fractional derivative employed in this model is defined in the sum of left-sided and right-sided Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives. With assistance of Kaplan&#39;s first eigenvalue method, we prove that the classic solution of this model may not be globally well-defined, and the heat conduction governed by this model depends on the order of fractional derivative, the parameters in the equation, and the length of spatial interval. Finite difference method is implemented to solve this model, and an adaptive strategy is applied to improve the computational efficiency. The positivity, monotonicity, and stability of the numerical scheme are discussed. Numerical simulation and observation of the quenching and stationary solutions coincide the theoretical studies.},

Then we use the Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle to find the optimal solution of the model, so that the number of infected people can be minimized. In numerical simulation, firstly, we validate the global stability of DFE and EE. Secondly, we consider three kind of control measures (treatment, isolation, and education) and divide them into four cases. The models with control and without control are solved numerically by using forward and backward sweep Runge-Kutta method.

  abstract     = {The paper considers a discrete dynamical system containing two contours. There are n cells and m particles in each contour. At any time, the particles of each contour form a cluster. There are two common points of the contours. These common points are called nodes. The nodes divide the contours into two nonequal parts. The system belongs to the class of dynamical systems introduced by A. P. Buslaev. In these systems, the movement of particles (clusters) can be interpreted as the mass transfer on regular networks. A cyclic trajectory in the system state space is called a spectral cycle. The system state space is divided into sets such that any of this set contains the states of the spectral cycle and the nonrecurrent states from which the system results in the set of the spectral cycle states. We have found that, in the general case, what spectral cycle is realized and with what average velocity the clusters move depends on the initial state of the system. We have found the set of spectral cycles and the values of the clusters average velocities taking into account the delays due to that the clusters cannot pass through the same node simultaneously. In one of two considered versions of the system, the clusters move counterclockwise (one-directional movement). In the other version, one of the clusters moves clockwise and the other cluster moves counterclockwise (codirectional movement). It is turned out that the behavior of system is significantly different in these versions. In particular, in the case of the codirectional movement, the average clusters velocity does not depend on the initial state.},

In terms of synthesis and Gram operator methods, we in this paper characterize continuous g -Bessel, g -frame, and g -Riesz sequences, respectively, and obtain the Pythagorean theorem for continuous g -orthonormal systems. It is worth that our results are similar to the case of g -ones, but their proofs are nontrivial.

The basic reproduction number of the epidemic model, R 0 , is first obtained. If R 0 &lt; 1 , the local and global stabilities of the disease-free steady state are strictly proved. If R 0 &gt; 1 , to control the disease, an optimal control problem is discussed by evaluating the cost of control strategies (vaccination and treatment) and using Pontryagin&#39;s maximum principle. We use specific parameter values related to influenza A to do some numerical simulations. Results show that the recovery age plays an important role in the optimal control, where precisely, the control with vaccination only has no effect when the acquired immunity period is not more than the vaccination immunity period; otherwise, it plays a significant role in disease control.},

The proposed method is graceful fusions of Laplace transform technique with q -homotopy analysis scheme, and the derivative is considered in Caputo sense. In order to validate and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method, we analysed the projected model in terms of fractional order. Moreover, the physical behaviour of the obtained solution has been captured for the three different cases in terms of 3D and contour plots for diverse values of the fractional order. The obtained results confirm that the future method is easy to implement, highly methodical, and very effective to analyse the behaviour of complex non-linear fractional differential equations exist in the connected areas of science and engineering.},

The applications to the space-time-fractional KdV and time-fractional Boussenisq-Burger&#39;s equation are carried. Semi-self-similar SS wave solutions are obtained. That is, there exists a soliton wave propagates along a specific characteristic curve in the x ⁢ t - plane. This may be due to the effects associated with the distributed time delay. The effects of space fractional derivative on a system are attributed to the transition states. Thus, anomalous wave transport is produced mainly near the origin.},

We call this method 2D mechanical quadrature method (2D-MQM). Numerical experiments show that 2D-MQM outperforms the library function “hilbert” in Matlab when the values of the functions being handled are very large or approach to infinity. Second, we propose a complex analytic method to calculate the double Hilbert transform, which is based on the 2D adaptive Fourier decomposition, and the method is called as 2D-HAFD. In contrast to the pointwise approximation, 2D-HAFD provides explicit rational functional approximations and is valid for all signals of finite energy.},

  abstract     = {Fractional Brusselator reaction-diffusion system (BRDS) is used for modeling of specific chemical reaction-diffusion processes. It may be noted that numerous models in nonlinear science are defined by fractional differential equations (FDEs) in which an unknown function appears under the operation of a fractional-order derivative. Even though many researchers have studied the applicability and practicality of this model, the analytical approach of this model is rarely found in the literature. In this investigation, a novel semi-analytical technique called fractional reduced differential transform method (FRDTM) has been applied to solve the present model, which is characterized by the time-fractional derivative (FD). Obtained outcomes are compared with the solution of other existing methods for a particular case. Also, the convergence analysis of this model has been studied here.},

Based on these analyses, we establish some results about stability and instability of the solutions for our model. At end, the model is applied to describe tuberculosis transmission in China. The number of the total population and the number of the annual newly reported TB cases both match the statistical data well.

Therefore, initiating HIV treatment with the TB treatment development has some advantages including less HIV-related losses and an inferior risk of HIV spread also having difficulties including incidence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) because of a large pill encumbrance. It has been analyzed that patients with HIV have more weaker immune system and are susceptible to infections, for example, tuberculosis (TB). Keeping the importance of the HIV models, we are interested to consider an analysis of HIV-TB coinfected model in the Atangana-Baleanu fractional differential form.

To prove existence of a stable limit cycle in the case “focus-center,” we use a pure geometric approach. In the case “focus-focus,” we prove existence of a special configuration of five parameters leading to the existence of a unique stable limit cycle, whose period can be found by solving a transcendent equation. An estimate of this period is obtained. We apply this theory on a two-dimensional system describing the qualitative behavior of a two-dimensional excitable membrane model.},

These solutions are presented explicitly in terms of Gram determinants, whose matrix elements have simply algebraic expressions. The breather and rogue wave solutions are derived from two different types of tau functions of a bilinear equation in the single-component KP hierarchy. By taking a long wave limit of high-order breather solutions, a range of hybrid solutions consisting of solitons, breathers, and one fundamental rogue wave are generated. For the rational rogue waves, some typical patterns such as Peregrine-type, triple, and sextuple rogue waves are put forward by modifying the input parameters. Besides, a new rogue wave pattern of third-order rogue waves is found, which features a mixture of a triangular pattern of three fundamental rogue waves and a fundamental pattern of second-order rogue wave. These results may help understand the protean rogue wave manifestations in areas ranging from water waves to fluid dynamics.},

For this purpose, firstly, an effective implicit time discretization approach is used for discretizing the variable-order time fractional problem in the time direction. Then a global meshless technique based on the method of approximate particular solutions is performed to fully discretize the model in the spatial domain.

  abstract     = {We study a free boundary problem modeling the growth of multilayer tumors. This model describes the invasion of tumors: the tumor cells produce matrix degrading enzymes (MDEs) to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) which provides structural support of the surrounding tissue. As in Pan and Xing, the influence of ECM and MDE interactions is considered in this paper. The model equations include two diffusion equations for the nutrient concentration and MDE concentration and an ordinary differential equation for ECM concentration. The tumor cell proliferation is at the rate λ λ , which characterizes the aggressiveness of the tumor. In contrast to Pan and Xing, we consider “flat stationary solution” in this paper. We first show that there exists a unique flat stationary solution for any . Then, we prove that there are infinite branches of bifurcation solutions from the flat stationary solutions at the bifurcation points ( ).},

  abstract     = {We propose a novel model for the population dynamics of mosquitoes by considering the dispersal states of female mosquitoes of oviposition&#39;s cycle and spatial variations. From the modeling perspective, a general functional form of eggs oviposition rate is used including the Malthusian, the Verhlust-Pearl logistic, the Hassell, and the Maynard-Smith-Slatkin functions. From the theoretical and numerical perspectives, the study is done in two steps using the more realistic birth Maynard-Smith-Slatkin function. First, we consider an ordinary differential equations model and show that the mosquito-free equilibrium (MFE) is globally asymptotically stable, whenever the basic offspring number R 0 o ⁢ d ⁢ e is less than unity. Using a fluctuation argument, we prove that the unique mosquito-persistent equilibrium (MPE) is globally attractive, whenever exceeds the unity. Moreover, the temporal model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation in the absence of density-dependent mortality in the aquatic stage of mosquitoes. Second, the temporal model is extended into an advection-reaction-diffusion model in order to account for the movement of mosquitoes and their spatial source of heterogeneity. We establish the uniform persistence and the existence of at least one positive steady state whenever the spatial basic offspring number is greater than unity. Finally, for the case study of malaria vector agent ( Anopheles mosquito), we construct a nonstandard finite difference scheme that is dynamically consistent with the features of the continuous model to illustrate our results, including the spatial heterogeneity of mosquito resources.},

These solutions that we discover in this article will help us understand the phenomena of the (2 + 1)-dimensional Gardner KP equation. Comparing the study in this paper and existing work, we find more exact solutions with soliton and periodic structures and the rational function solution in this paper is more general than the rational solution in existing literature. Most of the Jacobi elliptic function solutions and the mixed Jacobi elliptic function solutions to the (2 + 1)-dimensional Gardner KP equation discovered in this paper, to the best of our highest understanding are not seen in any existing paper until now.},

It is well-known that the classical solutions of the Euler equation in 1-D may blow up in finite time for general initial data. The global existence of the solution in this paper means that the radiation effect stabilizes the system and prevents the formation of singularity when the initial data is small. To study the precise effect of the radiation in this model, we also treat the pointwise estimates of the solution for the original nonlinear problem by combining the Green&#39;s function for the linearized radiation hydrodynamic equations with the Duhamel&#39;s principle. The result in this paper shows that the pointwise structure of this model is similar to that of full Navier-Stokes equations in 1-D.},

  abstract     = {This article deals with the modeling for an individual car path through a road network, where the dynamics is driven by a coupled system of ordinary and partial differential equations. The network is characterized by bounded buffers at junctions that allow for the interpretation of roundabouts or on-ramps while the traffic dynamics is based on first-order macroscopic equations of Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) type. Trajectories for single drivers are then influenced by the surrounding traffic and can be tracked by appropriate numerical algorithms. The computational experiments show how the modeling framework can be used as navigation device.},

  abstract     = {This study is concerned with the large time behavior of the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, which are used to model compressible fluids with internal capillarity. Based on the fact that the rarefaction wave, one of the basic wave patterns to the hyperbolic conservation laws is nonlinearly stable to the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations, the planar rarefaction wave to the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations is first derived. Then, it is shown that the planar rarefaction wave is asymptotically stable in the case that the initial data are suitably small perturbations of the planar rarefaction wave. The proof is based on the delicate energy method. This is the first stability result of the planar rarefaction wave to the multi-dimensional viscous fluids with internal capillarity.},

The multiscale model is developed by integrating the within-host scale and the between-host scale. Using the example of IAV as a paradigm, we demonstrate the utility and process by which multiscale modelling can be used to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of health interventions that operate at different scale domains.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses an integrated vector management (IVM) approach for combating Aedes aegypti , the transmission vector of dengue, zika, and chikungunya diseases, some of the most important viral epidemics worldwide. In order to tackle this problem, a receding horizon control (RHC) strategy is adopted, considering a mono-objective and a multiobjective version of the optimal control model of combating the mosquito using chemical and biological control. RHC is essentially a suboptimal scheme of classical optimal control strategies considering discrete-time approximations. The integrated vector control actions used in this work consist in applying insecticides and inserting sterile males produced by irradiation in the population of mosquitoes. The cost function is defined in terms of social and economic costs, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed epidemiological control throughout a time window of 4 months. Numerical simulations show that the obtained results are better than those from the optimal control strategies found in literature. Furthermore, through the application of the multiobjetive approach, varying the scenarios in the mono-objective formulation is no longer necessary and a set of optimal strategies can be obtained at once. Finally, in order to help health authorities in the choice of the best solution of the Pareto-optimal set to be implemented in practice, a cost-effectiveness analysis is performed and a strategy representing the most cost-effective control policy is obtained.},

The extinction scenarios of intermediate and top predator species along with the existence and stability of all equilibrium points have been discussed. The effects of competition and conversion efficiency of top predators in the dynamics of the system have been discussed with great thrust, and it is observed that the conversion efficiency of top predators deteriorates the stability of the system, whereas intraspecific competition in top predators enhances the stable coexistence of all the populations of the system. Further, nonautonomous version of the model system has been taken into consideration to study the impact of seasonal variation in the dynamics of the model system. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a globally attractive positive periodic have been established in a periodic environment. Finally, numerical simulations have been carried out to validate our analytical findings.},

  abstract     = {Here, we apply the general scheme for description of mechanics of infinitesimal bodies in Riemannian spaces to the example of geodetic and non-geodetic (for two different model potentials) motions of infinitesimal rotators on the Mylar balloon. The structure of partial degeneracy is investigated with the help of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation and action-angle analysis. In all situations, it was found that for any of the sixth disjoint regions in the phase space among the three action variables only two are essential for the description of our models at the level of the old quantum theory (according to the Bohr-Sommerfeld postulates). Moreover, in both non-geodetic models, the action variables were intertwined with the quantum number N corresponding to the quantized value of the radius r of the inflated Mylar balloon.},

  abstract     = {We proposed a nutrient-phytoplankton interaction model with a discrete and distributed time delay to provide a better understanding of phytoplankton growth dynamics and nutrient-phytoplankton oscillations induced by delay. Standard linear analysis indicated that delay can induce instability of a positive equilibrium via Hopf bifurcation. We derived the conditions guaranteeing the existence of Hopf bifurcation and tracked its direction and the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions. We also obtained the sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of the unique positive steady state. Numerical analysis in the fully nonlinear regime showed that the stability of the positive equilibrium is sensitive to changes in delay values under select conditions. Numerical results were consistent with results predicted by linear analysis.},

A modified velocity function that can transform spherical coordinate system–based eikonal equation into ones based on a spherical Cartesian coordinate system is deduced by using a differential geometric method where a layered distribution of the velocity function is assumed. After comparing the results of using this approach with the traditional method of solving eikonal equation based on a spherical coordinate system, the viability of the transformation to a spherical Cartesian coordinate system based on a modified velocity function is proven. Despite the assumption of a layered distribution of the velocity function, it is also proven that the method will hold for a velocity function under any three-dimensional distribution. The new method overcomes problems present in traditional approaches and opens up a new way of solving eikonal equation in a spherical computational domain.},

Then, using the finite element method to approximate the spatial variable and the implicit Euler scheme to discretize the time derivatives, fully discrete approximations are introduced. A discrete stability property is proved, and a priori error estimates are obtained, from which the linear convergence of the approximation is derived.

This equation reduces to a set of linear algebraic equations by using the wavelet transform matrix and the operational matrix of integration. To reach the sparse coefficients matrix for having a reduction in the computational cost, thresholding is used. This sparse system solves by generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. If the appropriate threshold selects, the number of nonzero coefficients reduces while the error will not be less than a certain amount. The convergence analysis has been investigated.

The spectral analysis of the Lax pair associated with a (2 N +1)×(2 N +1) matrix spectral problem for the N -CHNLS equations is firstly carried out, from which a kind of RH problem is structured. Then a series of multi-soliton solutions including breather, bright, and dark solutions for the N -CHNLS equations can be formulated by the RH problem with the reflection-less case. In addition, with N =4 taken as an example, the propagation behavior of these solutions and their interactions are presented by selecting appropriate parameters with some graphics.},

In this paper, we explore the idea that what are the advantages if the flexibility of choice is also given at the first substep. Therefore, we present a new two-point sixth-order scheme for multiple roots ( m &gt;1). The main advantages of our scheme over the existing schemes are flexibility at both substeps, simple body structure, smaller residual error, smaller error difference between two consecutive iterations, and smaller asymptotic error constant. The development of the scheme is based on midpoint formula and weight functions of two variables. We compare our methods with the existing methods of the same order with real-life applications as well as standard test problems. From the numerical results, we find that our methods can be considered as better alternates for the existing methods of the same order. Finally, dynamical study of the proposed schemes is presented that confirms the theoretical results.},

By using the continued-fraction method, combining with the dynamic transition theory, we show the existence of a Hopf bifurcation in this model as Reynolds number crosses a critical value. Upon deriving the explicit expression of a non-dimensional number P called transition number, which is a function of the critical Reynolds number and the aspect ratio, we further analyze the transition associated with the Hopf bifurcation. More precisely, it is shown that the modeled flow exhibits either a continuous or catastrophic transition at the critical Reynolds number, whose specific type of the transition is determined by the sign of the real part of P at the critical Reynolds number, and the spatio-temporal structure of the limit cycle bifurcated that corresponds to a wave that propagates slowly westward and is symmetric about the mid-axis of the channel.},

Using the linear stability analysis, the conditions for the positive constant steady state at which undergoes Hopf bifurcation, T-H bifurcation (Turing-Hopf bifurcation) are investigated. The Turing patterns occur in the presence of the nonlocal competition and cannot be found in the original system. For determining the dynamical behavior near T-H bifurcation point, the normal form of the T-H bifurcation has been used. Some graphical representations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In the current paper, a heat transfer model is suggested based on a time-fractional dual-phase-lag (DPL) model. We discuss the model in two parts, the direct problem and the inverse problem. Firstly, for solving it, the finite difference/Legendre spectral method is constructed. In the temporal direction, we employ the weighted and shifted Grünwald approximation, which can achieve second order convergence. In the spatial direction, the Legendre spectral method is used, it can obtain spectral accuracy. The stability and convergence are theoretically analyzed. For the inverse problem, the Bayesian method is used to construct an algorithm to estimate the four parameters for the model, namely, the time-fractional order α , the time-fractional order β , the delay time τ T , and the relaxation time τ q . Next, numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme, with the values of τ q and τ T for processed meat employed. We also make a comparison with another method. The data obtained for the direct problem are used in the parameter estimation. The paper provides an accurate and efficient numerical method for the time-fractional DPL model.},

The present ADM has the capability to produce three different types of solutions, namely, explicit exact solution, analytic solution, and semi-analytic solution. In the best cases, when a closed-form solution exists, ADM is able to capture this exact solution, while most of the numerical methods can only provide an approximation solution. The proposed ADM is validated using different test cases dealing with inviscid and viscous Burgers&#39; equations. Satisfactory results are obtained for all test cases, and, particularly, results reported in this paper agree well with those reported by other researchers.},

The results developed in this article reveal far richer dynamics compared with the system without harvesting. We first make qualitative and bifurcation analysis of the system without harvesting and show that the system has a weak focus of multiplicity at most 2, at which a Hopf bifurcation occurs. However, the system with harvesting has four nonhyperbolic equilibria for some parameter values, such as two saddle-node, a cusp, and a weak focus of multiplicity at most 4, and exhibits two saddle-node bifurcations, a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2, and a Hopf bifurcation. It reveals that there exist some critical harvesting values such that the species are in danger of extinction when the harvesting rate is greater than the critical values, which indicates that the dynamics of the system are sensitive to the constant prey harvesting. Moreover, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the approximated analytical solution for fractional Swift-Hohenberg (S-H) equation is found with the aid of novel technique called q -homotopy analysis transform method ( q -HATM ) . To ensure the applicability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we consider non-linear arbitrary-order S-H equation in presence and absence of dispersive term. The convergence analysis for the projected problem is presented, and the numerical simulations have been conducted to verify the future scheme is reliable and accurate. Further, the effect of bifurcation and dispersive parameters with physical importance on the probability density function for distinct fractional Brownian and standard motions are presented through plots. The obtained results elucidate that the proposed technique is easy to implement and very effective to analyse the complex problems that arose in science and technology.},

The flow of a fluid is taken parallel to an axis of cylinder and a uniform magnetic field is applied in transverse direction of the flow. The problem is solved by using the cell model technique for the flow through assemblage of cylindrical particles. The solution of the problem has been obtained by using no-slip condition, continuity of velocity and stresses at interfaces along with Happle&#39;s no-couple stress condition as the boundary conditions. The expressions for the linear velocity, micro-rotational velocity, flow rate and hydrodynamic permeability of the membrane are achieved in this work. The obtained solution for velocities is used to plot the graph against various transport parameters such as, Hartmann number, coupling parameter, porosity, scaling parameter etc. The effect of these transport parameters on the flow velocity, micro-rotational velocity, and the hydrodynamic permeability of the membrane have been presented and discussed in this work.},

In the considered problem, the coefficients and the initial values are constant intervals. In the developed approach, there is no need to define a derivative for interval-valued functions. All derivatives used in the approach are classical derivatives of real functions. The reason for this is that the solution of the problem is defined as a bunch of real functions. Such a solution concept is compatible also with the robust stability concept. Sufficient conditions are provided for the solution to be expressed analytically. In addition, on a numerical example, the solution obtained by the proposed approach is compared with the solution obtained by the generalized Hukuhara differentiability. It is shown that the proposed approach gives a new type of solution. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the solution to the considered interval initial value problem exists and is unique, as in the real case.},

Therefore, we derive an accurate linear representation for the BBXII density and a new power series for the BXII generating function. We provide Rspienter scripts for these calculations and a numerical study to illustrate the convergence of the density expansion.

  abstract     = {The present article deals with multi-waves and breather wave solutions of the generalized Bogoyavlensky-Konopelchenko equation by virtue of the Hirota bilinear operator method and the semi-inverse variational principle. The obtained solutions for solving the current equation represent some localized waves including soliton, periodic, and cross-kink solutions in which have been investigated by the approach of the bilinear method. With certain parameter constraints in the multi-waves and breather, all cases of the periodic and cross-kink solutions can be captured from the one and two soliton(s). The obtained solutions are extended with numerical simulation to analyze graphically, which results into 1- and 2-soliton solutions and also periodic and cross-kink solutions profiles, that will be extensively used to report many attractive physical phenomena in the fields of acoustics, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, classical mechanics, and so on.},

A new approximation for predator-prey interaction in the presence of prey social behavior has been considered. For the model analysis, the study has been divided into two principal parts. First of all, we study the local stability of the equilibria and the existence of Hopf bifurcation. Then, for the numerical analysis, the Caputo fractional derivative operator is utilized to approximate the numerical solution of the model. An excellent agreement is seen between the numerical results and the theoretical predictions.},

This problem was already considered in 6,8,9 under the hypothesis that the collision frequency σ (·) and the collision operator are bounded. In this work, we show that these hypotheses are not necessary; it suffices to assume that σ (·) is locally bounded, and the collision operator is bounded between X p σ (a weighted space) and X p (cf Section 2). Although the analysis for p ∈(1,+ ∞ ) is standard in the sense that it uses the Schauder fixed point theorem, the compactness of the involved operator is not easy to derive. However, the analysis in the case p =1 uses the concept of Dunford-Pettis operators and a new version of the Darbo fixed point theorem for a measure of weak noncompactness introduced in the paper.},

Further, we have solved explicitly the Cauchy initial value problem with three different kinds of superoscillatory initial data. The operator is defined on a space of entire functions. Particular examples include Caldirola-Kanai and degenerate parametric harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians, and other examples could include Hamiltonians not self-adjoint.

Bicone is excited axial-symmetrically by the ring magnetic source. The diffracted field is represented through the series of the transversal magnetic (TM) modes; the lower mode among them is called the transversal electromagnetic wave (TEM). On the basis of this representation and using the mode matching technique, we derive the series equations to determine the unknown complex modes magnitudes. In view of the electric field singularities at the conical edges, these equations are represented in the form of the limiting transition from the finite sums to the series. We derive the rule of this transition, as well as the procedure for reducing them to the infinite system of linear algebraic equations (ISLAE) of the first kind. We study asymptotic properties of the matrix elements and find that the main part of their static limit and their behavior for large indexes form the matrix operator of the convolution type; the corresponding inverted operator in the analytical form is obtained. Both these operators, which we call the regularization operators, are used for the transition from the ISLAE of the first kind to the ISLAE of the second kind. The ISLAE thus obtained allow for the solution of any geometrical parameters and frequency with the given accuracy. The asymptotic properties of their solutions are analyzed, and the numerical examinations of the far field patterns are provided.},

The simulation results show that (a) the fascial structure is the main contributor to the force on the needle, the axial force will gradually increase before piercing the fascial, and suddenly decrease after piercing the fascial; (b) there is an inverse relationship between the needle radius and the maximum radial stress, which indicates that the needle should not be too sharp to cause local stress concentration and piece the fascia layer; and (c) the simulation results of comprehensively considering the static friction and sliding friction is identical with the experiment results.

  abstract     = {We ponder a different kind of complex synchronization. We name this sort “complex phase synchronization” (CPHS). This review concentrates on two chaotic complex structures, including a similar structure of direct terms with totally differing or incompletely in nonlinear terms. A novel plan is needed to complete the complex phase synchronization (CPHS) for the chaotic complex structures. In this plan, we have utilized the dependability hypothesis to decide diagnostically the complex control capacities that are expected to accomplish CPHS. From this plan, we found that CPHS holds or incorporates two sorts of synchronizations (phase and anti-phase synchronizations) and the state factors of the main structure synchronize with alternate state factors of the slave structure. We connected this plan, for instance, to study the CPHS of two chaotic complex Lü structures with incompletely changing in nonlinear terms. These complex (or mind-boggling) structures resemble in various imperative areas of mineral science and building. Numerical outcomes are sketched out to uncover the phases and modules errors of these chaotic attractors, subsequently communicating that CPHS is fulfilled. A specific application in secure communication is designed. Amongst this secure communication, CPHS between transmitter and collector is the key to the information signs are regained.},

This neural network uses roots of Jacobi polynomials as the training dataset, and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is chosen as the optimizer. The linear and nonlinear fractional dynamics are considered as test examples showing the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed neural network. The numerical results are compared with the obtained results of some other networks and numerical approaches such as meshless methods. Numerical experiments are presented confirming that the proposed model is accurate, fast, and feasible.},

The related coefficients of the method are then represented explicitly, the local error is given, and the order of the method is determined. If a numerical method is consistent and stable, then it is necessarily convergent. Moreover, a weighted type of the new method is introduced and proposed for solving a special case of the Cauchy problem for singular differential equations.

The velocity and shear stress fields in the Laplace transform domain are obtained. Numerical solutions for the real velocity and shear stress have been found by employing the Stehfest numerical algorithm for the inverse Laplace transform. The influence of the fractional parameters on the velocity and shear stress has been studied by numerical simulations and graphical illustrations.

We found two sets of coupled longitudinal waves, which are dispersive in nature and experience attenuation. In addition to the coupled waves, there also exists one independent vertically shear-type wave, which is dispersive but experiences no attenuation. All these waves are found to be influenced by the elastic nonlocality parameter. Furthermore, the shear-type wave is found to face a critical frequency, while the coupled longitudinal waves may face critical frequencies conditionally. The problem of reflection of the thermoelastic waves at the stress-free insulated and isothermal boundary of a homogeneous, isotropic nonlocal thermoelastic half-space has also been investigated. The formulae for various reflection coefficients and their respective energy ratios are determined in various cases. For a particular material, the effects of the angular frequency and the elastic nonlocal parameter have been shown on phase speeds and the attenuation coefficients of the propagating waves. The effect of the elastic nonlocality on the reflection coefficients and the energy ratios has been observed and depicted graphically. Finally, analysis of the various results has been interpreted.},

The residual symmetry derived from the truncated Painlevé expansion can be extended to the multiple residual symmetries, which can be localized to Lie point symmetries by prolonging the combined mKdV-nmKdV equation to a larger system. The corresponding finite symmetry transformation, ie, n th BT, is presented in determinant form. As a result, new multiple singular soliton solutions can be obtained from known ones. We prove that the combined mKdV-nmKdV equation is integrable, possessing the second-order Lax pair and consistent Riccati expansion (CRE) property. Furthermore, we derive the exact soliton and soliton-cnoidal wave interaction solutions by applying the nonauto-BT obtained from the CRE method.},

  abstract     = {Rapid advancements of modern technologies put high demands on mathematical modelling of engineering systems. Typically, systems are no longer “simple” objects, but rather coupled systems involving multiphysics phenomena, the modelling of which involves coupling of models that describe different phenomena. After constructing a mathematical model, it is essential to analyse the correctness of the coupled models and to detect modelling errors compromising the final modelling result. Broadly, there are two classes of modelling errors: (a) errors related to abstract modelling, eg, conceptual errors concerning the coherence of a model as a whole and (b) errors related to concrete modelling or instance modelling, eg, questions of approximation quality and implementation. Instance modelling errors, on the one hand, are relatively well understood. Abstract modelling errors, on the other, are not appropriately addressed by modern modelling methodologies. The aim of this paper is to initiate a discussion on abstract approaches and their usability for mathematical modelling of engineering systems with the goal of making it possible to catch conceptual modelling errors early and automatically by computer assistant tools. To that end, we argue that it is necessary to identify and employ suitable mathematical abstractions to capture an accurate conceptual description of the process of modelling engineering systems.},

  abstract     = {Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer. Current HPV vaccines protect against both HPV-16 and -18, which are known to cause approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide. These vaccines have shown to be highly effective in preventing infection by their targeted types. However, there is a broad diversity of HPV types not targeted by the vaccines, and there is controversy about a possible increase in the prevalence of these non-targeted types after a vaccination program. Here, we propose a within-host metapopulation model to study the possibility of vaccine-induced type replacement for oncogenic types. It is generally believed that the theoretical possibility of type replacement strongly depends on the existence of natural type competition mechanisms. Nevertheless, our results suggest that type replacement is viable at the within-host level if the degree of cross-protection induced by the vaccine is low, even if there is no underlying competition among HPV types. Consequently, the impact of current HPV vaccines at both the immunological and epidemiological levels rely upon the level of cross-protection.},

Five threshold parameters are computed, which insure the existence of the equilibria of the model under consideration. A set of conditions on the general functions has been established, which is sufficient to investigate the global dynamics of the model. The global asymptotic stability of all equilibria is proven by utilizing Lyapunov function and LaSalle&#39;s invariance principle.

  abstract     = {Cancer is one of the most serious diseases in the world. The investigation on cancer treatment has attracted great attention from medical workers, mathematical researchers, and scholars in various fields. To understand the intrinsic characteristics of cancer, numerous scholars have established cancer treatment models and discussed the dynamical properties. However, the main work of many scholars only focuses on the integer-order cancer treatment models, while the study on fractional-order ones is quite a few. In the present article, on the basis of previous publications, we will put up a new fractional-order chemotherapy model with two different delays. By applying the stability theory and the Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order differential equations, we obtain a series of new stability criteria of the involved model and some sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of Hopf bifurcation of the involved model. Furthermore, the impact of two different delays and the fractional order on the stability and the emergence of Hopf bifurcation of involved model is presented. To illustrate the validity of analytical predictions, we perform computer simulations with Matlab software. The theoretical results in the manuscript are innovative and play an important role in cancer treatment.},

The cexp function is shown to be scator holomorphic in the entire scator set according to the differential quotient criterion. The scator derivative of the cexp function is the cexp function itself. The relationship between the Cartesian and polar forms of the cexp function can be seen as a higher-dimensional extension of Euler formula. The mappings of grids in 1+2 dimensional space exhibit ellipses and Lissajous-like figures in addition to circles and radial lines. A cusphere surface is generated for the isometric condition in the function&#39;s image.

Based on the gauge transformation between Lax pairs, both onefold and multifold classical Darboux transformations are constructed for the matrix long-wave–short-wave equation. Resorting to the classical Darboux transformation, a multifold generalized Darboux transformation of the matrix long-wave–short-wave equation is derived by utilizing the limit technique, from which rogue wave solutions, in particular, can be obtained by employing the generalized Darboux transformation. As applications, we obtain rogue-wave solutions of the long-wave–short-wave equation and some explicit solutions of the three-component long-wave–short-wave model, including soliton solutions, breather solutions, the first-order and higher-order rogue-wave solutions, and others by using the generalized Darboux transformation.},

The meshless method that is used in this study is the new version of backward substitution method (BSM). First, the time-derivative term is discretized by the Crank-Nicolson method. Then, the approximate solution is given as the separation of the approximation of the boundary data and the correcting functions using the Müntz polynomials. In general form, this approximate solution that does not necessarily satisfy the original equation is shown as the sum of the system basics in which it consists free parameters. Finally, these parameters are determined by the BSM method inside the domain. The main advantage of the method is efficiency and reliability that is examined by six numerical experiments.},

It is shown that for a Kolmogorov forcing on the first energy shell, there exist a family of exact solutions that are dissipative Rossby waves. The nonlinear stability of these exact solutions are analyzed based on the assumptions on the growth rate of the forcing. In the absence of forcing, we show the existence of selective decay states for the 3D QGPV equation. The selective decay states are the 3D Rossby waves traveling horizontally at a constant speed. All these results can be regarded as the expansion of that of the 2D QGPV system and in the case of 3D QGPV system with isotropic viscosity. Finally, we present a geometric foundation for the model as a general equation for nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling.},

  abstract     = {The solutions to the Riemann problem for a nonsymmetric system of Keyfitz-Kranzer type are constructed explicitly when the initial data are located in the quarter phase plane. In particular, some singular hyperbolic waves are discovered when one of the Riemann initial data is located on the boundary of the quarter phase plane, such as the delta shock wave and some composite waves in which the contact discontinuity coincides with the shock wave or the wave back of rarefaction wave. The double Riemann problem for this system with three piecewise constant states is also considered when the delta shock wave is involved. Furthermore, the global solutions to the double Riemann problem are constructed through studying the interaction between the delta shock wave and the other elementary waves by using the method of characteristics. Some interesting nonlinear phenomena are discovered during the process of constructing solutions; for example, a delta shock wave is decomposed into a delta contact discontinuity and a shock wave.},

On the other hand, Rodriguez (Phys. D, 260 (2013), 191-200) asserted the uniform-in-time boundedness of classical solution; however, there is a gap in the proof. In this work, we first solve this open problem by establishing some crucial a priori estimates. Then, invoking the uniform boundedness, we present that the classical solution converges exponentially to the steady state.

The proposed approach is based on the hybrid of collocation method, cubic B-spline, and bi-cubic B-spline interpolation and Itô approximation. Using this method, the problem solving turns into a nonlinear system solution of equations that is solved by a suitable numerical method. Also, the convergence analysis of this numerical approach has been discussed. In the end, examples are given to test the accuracy and the implementation of the method. The results are compared with the results obtained by other methods to verify that this method is accurate and efficient.},

The mathematical analytic procedure, which we have used here, has shown that the LADM is a fairly accurate and computable method for the solution of problems involving fractional-order Helmholtz equations in two dimensions.

We use a Galerkin method, derive crucial a priori estimates for the approximate solutions, and combine profound analytic and probabilistic compactness results in order to pass to the limit. Several difficulties arise in obtaining these uniform bounds and passing to the limit since the nonlinear elliptic part of the leading operator admits nonstandard growth.

The novel approach of the proposed procedure mainly resides in enhancing the resolution of the image by the application of the algorithm deduced from the mathematical theory of sampling Kantorovich operators. After the application of suitable digital image processing techniques, the pervious zone of the artery can be distinguished from the occluded one. Numerical tests have been performed using 233 CT images, and suitable numerical errors have been computed and introduced ex novo to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The above procedure is completely automatic in all its parts after the initial region of interest (ROI) selection. The main advantages of this approach relies in the potential possibility of performing diagnosis concerning vascular pathologies even for patients with severe kidney diseases or allergic problems, for which CT images with contrast medium cannot be achieved.},

In particular, these benefits are realised when frequency-dependent magnetic polarizability tensors (MPTs) are used to provide an economical characterisation of conducting permeable objects, and a dictionary-based classifier is employed. However, despite the advantages shown in dictionary-based classifiers, the behaviour of the MPT coefficients with frequency is not properly understood. In this paper, we rigorously analyse, for the first time, the spectral properties of the coefficients of the MPT. This analysis has the potential to improve existing algorithms and design new approaches for object location and identification in metal detection. Our analysis also enables the response transient response from a conducting permeable object to be predicted for more general forms of excitation.},

  abstract     = {Choosing an alternative frame, which is the Frenet frame of the principal-directional curve along a nonlightlike Frenet curve γ , we define de Sitter Darboux images, hyperbolic Darboux images, and lightcone images generated by the principal directional curves of nonlightlike Frenet curves and investigate geometric properties of these associated curves under considerations of singularity theory, contact, and Legendrian duality. It is shown that pseudo-spherical Darboux images and lightcone images can occur singularities (ordinary cusp) characterized by some important invariants. More interestingly, the cusp is closely related to the contact between nonlightlike Frenet curve γ and a slant helix, the principal-directional curve ψ of γ and a helix or the principal-directional curve ψ and a slant helix. In addition, some relations of Legendrian dualities between C -curves and pseudo-spherical Darboux images or lightcone images are shown. Some concrete examples are provided to illustrate our results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, by introducing a new frame on spacelike curves lying in lightcone 3-space, we investigate the geometric properties of the lightlike surface of the Darboux-like indicatrix and the lightlike surface of the binormal indicatrix generated by spacelike curves in lightcone 3-space. As an extension of our previous work and an application of the singularity theory, the singularities of the lightlike surfaces of the Darboux-like indicatrix and the lightlike surface of the binormal indicatrix are classified, several new invariants of spacelike curves are discovered to be useful for characterizing these singularities, meanwhile, it is found that the new invariants also measure the order of contact between spacelike curves or principal normal indicatrixes of spacelike curves located in lightcone 3-space and two-dimensional lightcone whose vertices are at the singularities of lightlike surfaces. One concrete example is provided to illustrate our results.},
