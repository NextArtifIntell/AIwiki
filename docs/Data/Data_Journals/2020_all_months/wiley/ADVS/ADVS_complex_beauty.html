Similar to photodynamic therapy but suitable for large and deep tumors, this new approach where nanomaterials acting as sensitizing agents are combined with clinical radiation can be effective at well-tolerated low radiation doses. Suitably engineered nanomaterials can enhance cancer radiotherapy by increasing the tumor selectivity and decreasing side effects. Additionally, the nanomaterial platform offers therapeutically valuable functionalities, including molecular targeting, drug/gene delivery, and adaptive responses to trigger drug release. The potential of such nanomaterials to be combined with radiotherapy is widely recognized. In order for further breakthroughs to be made, and to facilitate clinical translation, the applicable principles and fundamentals should be articulated. This review focuses on mechanisms underpinning rational nanomaterial design to enhance radiation therapy, the understanding of which will enable novel ways to optimize its therapeutic efficacy. A roadmap for designing nanomaterials with optimized anticancer performance is also shown and the potential clinical significance and future translation are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Glioma is a common primary brain malignancy with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for brain tumors but low efficiency of drugs in crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and drug resistance related to tumor hypoxia thwart its efficacy. Herein, a theranostic nanodrug (iRPPA@TMZ/MnO) is developed by incorporating oleic acid-modified manganese oxide (MnO) and temozolomide (TMZ) into a polyethylene glycol-poly(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate-based polymeric micelle containing internalizing arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (iRGD). The presence of iRGD provides the nanodrug with a high capacity of crossing the BBB and penetrating the tumor tissue. After accumulation in glioma, the nanodrug responds to the tumor microenvironment to simultaneously release TMZ, Mn 2+ , and O 2 . The released TMZ induces tumor cell apoptosis and the released Mn 2+ causes intracellular oxidative stress that kill tumor cells via a Fenton-like reaction. The O 2 produced in situ alleviates tumor hypoxia and enhances the chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapeutic effects against glioma. The Mn 2+ can also serve as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent for tumor imaging during therapy. The study demonstrates the great potential of this multifunctional nanodrug for MRI-visible therapy of brain glioma.},

Early diagnosis of NASH is vital to detect disease before it becomes life-threatening, yet noninvasively differentiating NASH from simple steatosis is challenging. Herein, bifunctional probes have been developed that target the hepatocyte-specific asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), the expression of which decreases during NASH progression. The results show that the probes allow longitudinal, noninvasive monitoring of ASGPR levels by positron emission tomography in the newly developed rat model of NASH.

Only the fluorophore bond at the ortho -position of the aniline moiety can specifically recognize nitrite, which ensures that the reaction products displays a robust green emission. The unique 2-(2-amino-4-carboxyphenyl) benzothiazole ( ortho -BT) shows superior nitrite detection performance, including a low detection limit (2.2 fg), rapid detection time (&lt;5 s), and excellent specificity even in the presence of &gt;40 types of strong redox active, colored substances, nitro compounds, and metal ions. Moreover, the probe is highly applicable for the rapid on-site and semiquantitative measurement of nitrite.

  abstract     = {Annexin-based probes have long been used to study apoptotic cell death, which is of key importance to many areas of biological research, drug discovery, and clinical applications. Although apoptosis is a dynamic biological event with cell-to-cell variations, current annexin-based probes are impractical for monitoring apoptosis in real-time. Herein, a quenched annexin V-near-infrared fluorophore conjugate (Q-annexin V) is reported as the first OFF-ON annexin protein-based molecular sensor for real-time near-infrared fluorescence imaging of apoptosis. Q-annexin V is non-fluorescent in the extracellular region, due to photoinduced electron transfer interactions between the conjugated dye and amino acid quenchers (tryptophan and tyrosine). The probe becomes highly fluorescent when bound to phosphatidylserines on the outer layer of cell membranes during apoptosis, thereby enabling apoptosis to be monitored in real-time in 2D and 3D cell structures. In particular, Q-annexin V shows superior utility for in vivo apoptosis fluorescence imaging in animal models of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and cancer immune therapy, compared to the conventional polarity-sensitive pSIVA-IANBD or annexin V-Alexa647 conjugates.},

Using first-principles defect calculations, here, a systematic computational screening of potential efficient n-type lanthanide dopants is conducted for Mg 3 Sb 2 . In addition to La, Ce, Pr, and Tm, it is found that high electron concentration (≳10 20 cm −3 at the growth temperature of 900 K) can be achieved by doping on the Mg sites with Nd, Gd, Ho, and Lu, which are generally more efficient than other lanthanide dopants and the anion-site dopant Te. Experimentally, Nd and Tm are confirmed as effective n-type dopants for Mg 3 Sb 2 since doping with Nd and Tm shows higher electron concentration and thermoelectric figure of merit zT than doping with Te. Through codoping with Nd (Tm) and Te, simultaneous power factor improvement and thermal conductivity reduction are achieved. As a result, high zT values of ≈1.65 and ≈1.75 at 775 K are obtained in n-type Mg 3.5 Nd 0.04 Sb 1.97 Te 0.03 and Mg 3.5 Tm 0.03 Sb 1.97 Te 0.03 , respectively, which are among the highest values for n-type Mg 3 Sb 2 without alloying with Mg 3 Bi 2 .

Here, a novel precision medicine approach for PC treatment is developed, which is composed of a rationally designed tumor-targeting ICAM1 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with optimized chemical linker and cytotoxic payload, complemented with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based molecular imaging approach to noninvasively evaluate the efficiency of ICAM1 ADC therapy. It is shown that ICAM1 is differentially overexpressed on the surface of human PC cells with restricted expression in normal tissues, enabling ICAM1 antibody to selectively recognize and target PC tumors in vivo. It is further demonstrated that the developed ICAM1 ADC induces potent and durable tumor regression in an orthotopic PC mouse model. To build a precision medicine, an MRI-based molecular imaging approach is developed that noninvasively maps the tumoral ICAM1 expression that can be potentially used to identify ICAM1-overexpressing PC patients. Collectively, this study establishes a strong foundation for the development of a promising ADC to address the critical need in the PC patient care.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell transfer is a novel paradigm of adoptive T-cell immunotherapy. When coming into contact with a target cancer cell, CAR T-cell forms a nonclassical immunological synapse with the cancer cell and dynamically orchestrates multiple critical forces to commit cytotoxic immune function. Such an immunologic process involves a force transmission in the CAR and a spatiotemporal remodeling of cell cytoskeleton to facilitate CAR activation and CAR T-cell cytotoxic function. Yet, the detailed understanding of such mechanotransduction at the interface between the CAR T-cell and the target cell, as well as its molecular structure and signaling, remains less defined and is just beginning to emerge. This article summarizes the basic mechanisms and principles of CAR T-cell mechanoimmunology, and various lessons that can be comparatively learned from interrogation of mechanotransduction at the immunological synapse in normal cytotoxic T-cell. The recent development and future application of novel bioengineering tools for studying CAR T-cell mechanoimmunology is also discussed. It is believed that this progress report will shed light on the CAR T-cell mechanoimmunology and encourage future researches in revealing the less explored yet important mechanosensing and mechanotransductive mechanisms involved in CAR T-cell immuno-oncology.},

Here, an ultraflexible, lightweight, and highly conformable passively operated thin film perovskite X-ray detector with a sensitivity as high as 9.3 ± 0.5 µC Gy −1 cm −2 at 0 V and a remarkably low limit of detection of 0.58 ± 0.05 μGy s −1 is presented. Various electron and hole transporting layers accessing their individual impact on the detector performance are evaluated. Moreover, it is shown that this ultrathin form-factor allows for fabrication of devices detecting X-rays equivalently from front and back side.},

In addition to the presence of herringbone domains and stacking faults, the Ge 0.92 Sb 0.08 Te exhibits significant modification to phonon dispersion with an extra phonon excitation around ≈5–6 meV at Γ point of the Brillouin zone as confirmed through inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) confirmed this phonon excitation, and predicted another higher energy phonon excitation ≈12–13 meV at W point. These phonon excitations collectively increase the number of phonon decay channels leading to softening of phonon frequencies such that a three-phonon process is dominant in Ge 0.92 Sb 0.08 Te, in contrast to a dominant four-phonon process in pristine GeTe, highlighting the importance of phonon engineering approaches to improving thermoelectric ( TE ) performance.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring the organic spacing cations enables developing new Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites with tunable optoelectronic properties and superior stabilities. However, the formation of highly crystallized RP perovskites can be hindered when the structure of organic cations become complex. Strategies to regulate crystal growing process and grains quality remain to be explored. In this study, mixing Rb + ions in precursor solution is reported to significantly promote the crystallinity of phenylethylammonium (PEA + ) based RP perovskites without impacting on the major orientation of perovskite grains, which leads to increased power conversion efficiencies from 12.5% to 14.6%. It is found that the added Rb + ions prefer to accumulate at crystal growing front and form Rb + ions-rich region, which functions as mild crystal growth inhibitor to retard the absorption and diffusion of organic cations at growing front and hence regulates crystal growing rate. The retarded crystal growth benefits PEA-based RP perovskite films with elevated crystal qualities and prolonged carrier recombination lifetimes. Similar increased crystallinity and photovoltaic performance are achieved in other RP perovskites with non-linear organic cations such as phenylmethylammonium (PMA + ), 1-(2-naphthyl)-methanammoniun (NMA + ) by adding Rb + ions, demonstrating using a small amount of growth inhibitor as a general route to regulate crystal growth.},

  abstract     = {COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a coronavirus that is highly pathogenic and virulent. It spreads very quickly through close contact, and so in response to growing numbers of cases, many countries have imposed lockdown measures to slow its spread around the globe. The purpose of a lockdown is to reduce reproduction, that is, the number of people each confirmed case infects. Lockdown measures have worked to varying extents but they come with a massive price. Nearly every individual, community, business, and economy has been affected. In this paper, switching strategies that take into account the total “cost” borne by a community in response to COVID-19 are proposed. The proposed cost function takes into account the health and well-being of the population, as well as the economic impact due to the lockdown. The model allows for a comparative study to investigate the effectiveness of various COVID-19 suppression strategies. It reveals that both the strategy to implement a lockdown and the strategy to maintain an open community are individually losing in terms of the total “cost” per day. However, switching between these two strategies in a certain manner can paradoxically lead to a winning outcome—a phenomenon attributed to Parrondo&#39;s paradox.},

  abstract     = {Plasmonics have been well investigated on photodetectors, particularly in IR and visible regimes. However, for a wide range of ultraviolet (UV) applications, plasmonics remain unavailable mainly because of the constrained optical properties of applicable plasmonic materials in the UV regime. Therefore, an epitaxial single-crystalline aluminum (Al) film, an abundant metal with high plasma frequency and low intrinsic loss is fabricated, on a wide bandgap semiconductive gallium nitride (GaN) to form a UV photodetector. By deliberately designing a periodic nanohole array in this Al film, localized surface plasmon resonance and extraordinary transmission are enabled; hence, the maximum responsivity (670 A W −1 ) and highest detectivity (1.48 × 10 15 cm Hz 1/2 W −1 ) is obtained at the resonance wavelength of 355 nm. In addition, owing to coupling among nanoholes, the bandwidth expands substantially, encompassing the entire UV range. Finally, a Schottky contact is formed between the single-crystalline Al nanohole array and the GaN substrate, resulting in a fast temporal response with a rise time of 51 ms and a fall time of 197 ms. To the best knowledge, the presented detectivity is the highest compared with those of other reported GaN photodetectors.},

Thus-obtained MMMs with high uniformity, excellent robustness, well-tuned loading, and thickness can be massively produced in industrial-level efficiency (≈4 m in a batch experiment). Furthermore, they can be readily applied as powerful separators for Li–S cell with high specific capacity (1163.7 mAh g −1 ) and a capacity retention of 500.7 mAh g −1 after 700 cycles at 0.5 C (0.08% fading per cycle).

The optics based on a spatial light modulator assembles wrinkle pixels of a notably small dimension over a large area at fast fabrication speed. Furthermore, these pixelated wrinkles can be formed on curved geometries. The pixelated wrinkles can record images, which are naturally invisible, by mapping the gray level to the orientation of wrinkles. They can retrieve those images using the patterned optical phase retardation generated under the crossed polarizers. As a result, it is shown that the pixelated wrinkles enable new applications in optics such as image storage, informative labeling, and anti-counterfeiting.},

Conventional approaches for loading photosensitizers (PS) to UCNPs using noncovalent physical adsorption and covalent conjugation had been previously described. However, these methods are time-consuming and require extra modification steps. Incorporating PS loading during the controlled UCNPs assembly process is seldom reported. In this study, an amphiphilic copolymer, poly(styrene- co -maleic anhydride), is used to instruct UCNPs assembly formations into well-controlled UCNPs clusters of various sizes, and the gap zones formed between individual UCNPs can be used to encapsulate PS. This nanostructure production process results in a considerably simpler and reliable method to load PS and other compounds. Also, after considering factors such as PS loading quantity, penetration in 3D bladder tumor organoids, and singlet oxygen production, the small UCNPs clusters displayed superior cell killing efficacy compared to single and big sized clusters. Therefore, these UCNPs clusters with different sizes could facilitate a clear and deep understanding of nanoparticle-based delivery platform systems for cell killing and may pave a new way for other fields of UCNPs based applications.},

The ZnO SPP nanowire lasers on the GIM platforms are demonstrated up to room temperature to be actively modulated by applying external current to graphene, which transforms the cavity mode from the standing to propagation wave pattern. With applying 100 mA external current, the laser threshold increases by ≈100% and a 1.2 nm Doppler shift is observed due to the nonreciprocal propagation characteristic. The nanolaser performance also depends on the orientation of the nanowire with respect to the current flow direction. The GIM platform can be a promising platform for integrated plasmonic system functioning laser generation, modulation, and detection.},

  abstract     = {DNA computing is recognized as one of the most outstanding candidates of next-generation molecular computers that perform Boolean logic using DNAs as basic elements. Benefiting from DNAs’ inherent merits of low-cost, easy-synthesis, excellent biocompatibility, and high programmability, DNA computing has evoked substantial interests and gained burgeoning advancements in recent decades, and also exhibited amazing magic in smart bio-applications. In this review, recent achievements of DNA logic computing systems using multifarious materials as building blocks are summarized. Initially, the operating principles and functions of different logic devices (common logic gates, advanced arithmetic and non-arithmetic logic devices, versatile logic library, etc.) are elaborated. Afterward, state-of-the-art DNA computing systems based on diverse “toolbox” materials, including typical functional DNA motifs (aptamer, metal-ion dependent DNAzyme, G-quadruplex, i-motif, triplex, etc.), DNA tool-enzymes, non-DNA biomaterials (natural enzyme, protein, antibody), nanomaterials (AuNPs, magnetic beads, graphene oxide, polydopamine nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, DNA-templated nanoclusters, upconversion nanoparticles, quantum dots, etc.) or polymers, 2D/3D DNA nanostructures (circular/interlocked DNA, DNA tetrahedron/polyhedron, DNA origami, etc.) are reviewed. The smart bio-applications of DNA computing to the fields of intelligent analysis/diagnosis, cell imaging/therapy, amongst others, are further outlined. More importantly, current “Achilles’ heels” and challenges are discussed, and future promising directions of this field are also recommended.},

  abstract     = {Through years of development, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been demonstrated as a burgeoning efficient energy harvester. Plenty of efforts have been devoted to further improving the electric output performance through material/surface optimization, ion implantation or the external electric circuit. However, all these methods cannot break through the fundamental limitation brought by the inevitable electrical breakdown effect, and thus the output energy density is restricted. Here, a method for enhancing the threshold output energy density of TENGs is proposed by suppressing the breakdown effects in the high-pressure gas environment. With that, the output energy density of the contact-separation mode TENG can be increased by over 25 times in 10 atm than that in the atmosphere, and that of the freestanding sliding TENG can also achieve over 5 times increase in 6 atm. This research demonstrates the excellent suppression effect of the electric breakdown brought by the high-pressure gas environment, which may provide a practical and effective technological route to promote the output performance of TENGs.},

Practical realization of these advancements is hampered by the challenges of fabricating large-area, defect-free membranes containing a high density of open, small diameter SWCNT pores. Here, large-scale (≈60 cm 2 ) nanocomposite membranes comprising of an ultrahigh density (1.89 × 10 12 tubes cm −2 ) of 1.7 nm SWCNTs as sole transport pathways are demonstrated. Complete opening of all conducting nanotubes in the composite enables unprecedented accuracy in quantifying the enhancement of pressure-driven transport for both gases (&gt;290× Knudsen prediction) and liquids (6100× no-slip Hagen–Poiseuille prediction). Achieved water permeances (&gt;200 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 ) greatly exceed those of state-of-the-art commercial nano- and ultrafiltration membranes of similar pore size. Fabricated membranes reject nanometer-sized molecules, permit fractionation of dyes from concentrated salt solutions, and exhibit excellent chemical resistance. Altogether, these SWCNT membranes offer new opportunities for energy-efficient nano- and ultrafiltration processes in chemically demanding environments.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge to treat vascular endothelial injury is the restoration of endothelium integrity in which endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) plays a central role. Transplantation of EPCs as a promising therapeutic means is subject to two interrelated processes, homing and differentiation of EPCs in vivo, and thus a lack of either one may greatly affect the outcome of EPC-based therapy. Herein, a polymeric nanocarrier is applied for the codelivery of CXCR4 and VEGFa genes to simultaneously promote the migration and differentiation of EPCs. Moreover, MRI T 2 contrast agent SPION and NIR dye Cy7.5 are also loaded into the nanocarrier in order to track EPCs in vivo. Based on the synergistic effect of the two codelivered genes, an improved reendothelialization of EPCs is achieved in a rat carotid denuded model. The results show the potential of this bimodal imaging-visible nanomedicine to improve the performance of EPCs in repairing arterial injury, which may push forward the stem cell-based therapy of cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract     = {Recently, 2D niobium carbide MXene has drawn vast attention due to its merits of large surface area, good metallic conductivity, and tunable band gap, making it desirable for various applications. However, the usage of highly toxic fluoride-containing etchant and quite long etching time in the conventional synthesis route has greatly hindered further exploration of MXene, especially restricting its biomedical application. Herein, novel fluoride-free Nb 2 CT x nanosheets are prepared by a facile strategy of electrochemical etching (E-etching) exfoliation. Taking advantage of rapid aluminum clearance, excellent chemical stability, and biocompatibility from the MXene by E-etching, fluoride-free Nb 2 CT x /acetylcholinesterase-based biosensors are constructed for phosmet detection with the limit of detection down to 0.046 ng mL −1 . The fabricated Nb 2 CT x -based biosensor is superior to the counterpart from hydrofluoric acid-etched Nb 2 CT x , indicating that fluoride-free MXene can enhance the enzyme activity and electron transfer in the biosensor. The results prove that the fluorine-free MXene shows promise for developing biosensors with high performance of ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity. It is highly expected that the fluoride-free MXene as a stable and biocompatible nanoplatform has great potential to be expanded to many other biomedical fields.},

  abstract     = {Dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS), achieved through substitutional doping of spin-polarized transition metals into semiconducting systems, enable experimental modulation of spin dynamics in ways that hold great promise for novel magneto–electric or magneto–optical devices, especially for two-dimensional (2D) systems such as transition metal dichalcogenides that accentuate interactions and activate valley degrees of freedom. Practical applications of 2D magnetism will likely require room-temperature operation, air stability, and (for magnetic semiconductors) the ability to achieve optimal doping levels without dopant aggregation. Here, room-temperature ferromagnetic order obtained in semiconducting vanadium-doped tungsten disulfide monolayers produced by a reliable single-step film sulfidation method across an exceptionally wide range of vanadium concentrations, up to 12 at% with minimal dopant aggregation, is described. These monolayers develop p-type transport as a function of vanadium incorporation and rapidly reach ambipolarity. Ferromagnetism peaks at an intermediate vanadium concentration of ~2 at% and decreases for higher concentrations, which is consistent with quenching due to orbital hybridization at closer vanadium–vanadium spacings, as supported by transmission electron microscopy, magnetometry, and first-principles calculations. Room-temperature 2D-DMS provide a new component to expand the functional scope of van der Waals heterostructures and bring semiconducting magnetic 2D heterostructures into the realm of practical application.},

Here, we present explicit solutions for capital statistics and outcome conditions for a generalized game pair.

Here, the phenotypic, genomic and transcriptomic variations of two wild barley populations collected from sharply divergent and adjacent micro-geographic sites to identify candidate genes associated with edaphic local adaptation are investigated. Common garden and reciprocal transplant studies show that large phenotypic differentiation and local adaptation to soils occur between these populations. Genetic, phylogenetic and admixture analyses based on population resequencing show that significant genetic divergences occur between basalt and chalk populations. These divergences are consistent with the phenotypic variations observed in the field. Genome sweep analyses reveal 162.7 Mb of selected regions driven by edaphic local adaptation, in which 445 genes identified, including genes associated with root architecture, metal transport/detoxification, and ABA signaling. When the phenotypic, genomic and transcriptomic data are combined, HvMOR, encoding an LBD transcription factor, is determined to be the vital candidate for regulating the root architecture to adapt to edaphic conditions at the microgeographic scale. This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of edaphic adaptation and demonstrates that edaphic factors may contribute to the evolution and speciation of barley.},

  abstract     = {It is demonstrated that a novel eutectic solution including 1,3,5-trioxane (TXE) and succinonitrile (SN) can be converted into solid-state polymer electrolyte (SPE) via in situ polymerization triggered by lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB). It is worth noting that all the precursors (LiDFOB, TXE, and SN) of this novel SPE are totally solid and nonvolatile at room temperature, where, LiDFOB works as a lithium salt and an initiator simultaneously to avoid the introduction of impurity. It is noted that such SPE presents a considerable ionic conductivity of 1.14 × 10 −4 S cm −1 and a sufficiently wide electrochemical window of 4.5 V, which is significant for supporting the high-energy lithium batteries. In addition, this dedicatedly designed in situ polymerization is powerful to build kinetically favorable polymer-based protective layers on LiCoO 2 cathode and Li metal anode simultaneously, guaranteeing outstanding cycling stability (capacity retention of 88% after 200 cycles) of 4.3 V LiCoO 2 /lithium metal batteries at room temperature. More intriguingly, soft packed LiCoO 2 /SPE/Li metal batteries can still light a blue light emitting diode (LED) under the harsh conditions of being bent, cut, and stroked by a hammer, demonstrating excellent safety characteristics.},

A major hallmark of aging is the accumulation of senescent cells, which have entered a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest after experiencing inherent or environmental stresses. Although cellular senescence is essential in several physiological events, it plays a detrimental role in a large array of age-related pathologies. Recent biomedical advances in specifically targeting senescent cells to improve healthy aging, or alternatively, postpone natural aging and age-related diseases, a strategy termed senotherapy, have attracted substantial interest in both scientific and medical communities. Challenges for aging research are highlighted and potential avenues that can be leveraged for therapeutic interventions to control aging and age-related disorders in the current era of precision medicine.},

Here, a new physiological role of PRMT5 in adipocytes and systemic metabolism is reported. Conditional knockout mice were generated to ablate the Prmt5 gene specifically in adipocytes (Prmt5 AKO ). The Prmt5 AKO mice exhibit sex- and depot-dependent progressive lipodystrophy that is more pronounced in females and in visceral (than subcutaneous) white fat. The lipodystrophy and associated energy imbalance, hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance are exacerbated by high-fat-diet. Mechanistically, Prmt5 methylates and releases the transcription elongation factor SPT5 from Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy 2 ( Bscl2 , encoding Seipin) promoter, and Prmt5 AKO disrupts Seipin-mediated lipid droplet biogenesis. Prmt5 also methylates Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Transcription Factor 1a (SREBP1a) and promotes lipogenic gene expression, and Prmt5 AKO suppresses SREBP1a-dependent fatty acid metabolic pathways in adipocytes. Thus, PRMT5 plays a critical role in regulating lipid metabolism and lipid droplet biogenesis in adipocytes.},

Drug-releasable biomaterials provide a reliable tool to regulate the nerve healing-associated microenvironment for nerve repair.

Via a 3D printing technique, the bandage is prepared with a special structure and made up of two different hydrogel layers that can adhere to each other by a click reaction. The nanodrug is encapsulated in one layer with a grating structure. Wrapping the injured nerve, the grating layer of the bandage is closed to the injured site. The drug can be mainly released to the inner area of the wrap to promote the nerve repair by improving the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells. In this study, the bandage is used to assist the neurorrhaphy for the treatment of complete sciatic nerve transection without obvious defect in rats. Results indicate that the self-adhesive capacity can simplify the installation process and the drug-loaded bandage can promote the repairing of injured nerves. The demonstrated 3D-printed self-adhesive bandage has potential application in assisting the neurorrhaphy for nerve repair.},

Their bioactivity is most often attributed to their protein and nucleic acid components, while the function of exosomal lipids remains comparatively unexplored. This work specifically assesses the involvement of lipids and the transmembrane enzyme CD73 in the exosomes’ biological activity in stimulating the cutaneous wound healing process. Since exosome preparation processes are not harmonized yet, certain production and purification parameters are first systematically investigated, enabling the optimization of a standardized protocol delivering high exosome integrity, yield, and purity. An in situ enzymatic assay is introduced to specifically assess the vesicle functionality, and quantitative proteomics is employed to establish the cell culture conditions yielding a stable exosome protein profile. Using a combination of in vitro approaches, CD73 and constitutional lipids of HPV-16 E6/E7 transformed human bone marrow stromal cell-derived exosomes are identified as key bioactive components promoting the exosome-driven acceleration of processes required for wound repair. A pilot wound healing study in mice indeed suggests a role of lipids in the exosomes’ biological activity. Strikingly, the extent of the bioactivity of these exosomal components is found to be dependent on the target cell type.},

  abstract     = {The glorious charge transfer efficiency of photoanode is an important factor for efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, it is often limited by slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, a dual transition metal-based metal–organic frameworks (MOF) cocatalyst, Fe@Ni–MOF, is introduced into a titanium-doped hematite (Fe 2 O 3 :Ti) photoanode. The combination of Ni and Fe can optimize the filling of 3d orbitals. Moreover, the introduction of Fe donates electrons to Ni in the MOF structure, thus, suppressing the irreversible (long-life-time) oxidation of Ni 2+ into Ni 3+ . The resulting Fe@Ni–MOF/Fe 2 O 3 :Ti photoanode exhibits ∼threefold enhancement in the photocurrent density at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Kinetic analysis of the PEC water oxidation processes indicates that this performance improvement is primarily due to modulating the charge transfer efficiency of hematite photoanode. Further results show that a single transition metal-based MOF cocatalyst, Ni–MOF, exhibits slow charge transfer in spite of a reduction in surface charge recombination, resulting in a smaller charge transfer efficiency. These findings provide new insights for the development of photoelectrodes decorated with MOFs.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy has shifted the clinical paradigm of cancer management. However, despite promising initial progress, immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer still suffer from relatively low response rates and the possibility of severe side effects, likely due to the low inherent immunogenicity of tumor cells, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and significant inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. Recently, nanoformulations of prodrugs have been explored as a means to enhance cancer immunotherapy by simultaneously eliciting antitumor immune responses and reversing local immunosuppression. Prodrug nanomedicines, which integrate engineering advances in chemistry, oncoimmunology, and material science, are rationally designed through chemically modifying small molecule drugs, peptides, or antibodies to yield increased bioavailability and spatiotemporal control of drug release and activation at the target sites. Such strategies can help reduce adverse effects and enable codelivery of multiple immune modulators to yield synergistic cancer immunotherapy. In this review article, recent advances and translational challenges facing prodrug nanomedicines for cancer immunotherapy are overviewed. Last, key considerations are outlined for future efforts to advance prodrug nanomedicines aimed to improve antitumor immune responses and combat immune tolerogenic microenvironments.},

However, the unique role of nonhalide lead sources in improving perovskite film morphology and PSC performance has largely remained unexplored, impeding broader application of these materials. Here, it is demonstrated that by using a new nonhalide lead source, lead formate (Pb(HCOO) 2 ), good control of perovskite film morphology can be achieved. With the usage of lead formate, PbI 2 can nicely border the perovskite grain boundaries (GBs) and form domain “walls” that segregate the individual perovskite crystal domains. The PbI 2 at the GBs lead to significant improvement in film quality and device performance through passivating the defects at the perovskite GBs and suppressing lateral carrier diffusion. An impressive carrier lifetime at the microsecond scale ( τ 2 = 1714 ns) is achieved, further with an optimal power conversion efficiency of 20.3% for the resulting devices. This work demonstrates a promising and effective method toward fabricating high-quality perovskites and high-efficiency PSCs.},

In the nucleus, β -actin regulates neuronal reprogramming by consolidating a heterochromatin landscape required for transcription of neuronal gene programs, yet it remains unknown whether it has a role in other differentiation models. To explore the potential roles of β -actin in osteogenesis, β -actin wild-type (WT) and β -actin knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are reprogrammed to osteoblast-like cells using small molecules in vitro. It is discovered that loss of β -actin leads to an accelerated mineralization phenotype (hypermineralization), accompanied with enhanced formation of extracellular hydroxyapatite microcrystals, which originate in the mitochondria in the form of microgranules. This phenotype is a consequence of rapid upregulation of mitochondrial genes including those involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in reprogrammed KO cells. It is further found that osteogenic gene programs are differentially regulated between WT and KO cells, with clusters of genes exhibiting different temporal expression patterns. A novel function for β -actin in osteogenic reprogramming through a mitochondria-based mechanism that controls cell-mediated mineralization is proposed.},

There is neither a cure nor a standard treatment for this disease. In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based cell therapy is developed for CD. A functional ASPA gene is introduced into patient iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (iNPCs) or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (iOPCs) via lentiviral transduction or TALEN-mediated genetic engineering to generate ASPA iNPC or ASPA iOPC. After stereotactic transplantation into a CD (Nur7) mouse model, the engrafted cells are able to rescue major pathological features of CD, including deficient ASPA activity, elevated NAA levels, extensive vacuolation, defective myelination, and motor function deficits, in a robust and sustainable manner. Moreover, the transplanted mice exhibit much prolonged survival. These genetically engineered patient iPSC-derived cellular products are promising cell therapies for CD. This study has the potential to bring effective cell therapies, for the first time, to Canavan disease children who have no treatment options.

The deletion of STING reduces neuronal differentiation and increases proliferation of mouse and human NPCs. Furthermore, STING cKO mice display autistic-like behaviors. In NPCs, STING specifically recruits IKK β and activates nuclear factor κ B (NF- κ B) through phosphorylation. NF- κ B binds to ALX4 promoter and triggers ALX4 transcription. In addition, tumor necrosis factor α , an activator of NF- κ B, can rescue some phenotypes caused by STING deletion in mice. Together, the findings show that STING signaling is essential for neuronal gene expression program and has profound consequences on brain function.},

Currently, there are not many effective medications and surgical options are limited due to invasiveness and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques cannot be well targeted and cannot access deep brain areas. A novel therapy is transcranial ultrasound which allows a variety of treatments without opening of the skull. Recent technological developments generated three revolutionary options including 1) targeted non-invasive surgery, 2) highly targeted drug, antibody, or gene therapy via local opening of the blood–brain barrier, and 3) highly targeted brain stimulation to improve pathological brain functions. This progress report summarizes the current state of the art for clinical application and the results of recent patient investigations.},

  abstract     = {Integration of diverse materials into 3D ordered structures is urgently required for advanced manufacture owing to increase in demand for high-performance products. Most additive manufacturing techniques mainly focus on simply combining different equipment, while interfacial binding of distinctive materials remains a fundamental problem. Increasing studies on macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA) have revealed efficient interfacial interactions based on multivalency of supramolecular interactions facilitated by a “flexible spacing coating.” To demonstrate facile fabrication of 3D heterogeneous ordered structures, the combination of MSA and magnetic field-assisted alignment has been developed as a new methodology for in situ integration of a wide range of materials, including elastomer, resin, plastics, metal, and quartz glass, with modulus ranging from tens of MPa to over 70 GPa. Assembly of single material, coassembly of two to four distinctive materials, and 3D alignment of “bridge-like” and “cross-stacked” heterogeneous structures are demonstrated. This methodology has provided a new solution to mild and efficient assembly of multiple materials at the macroscopic scale, which holds promise for advanced fabrication in fields of tissue engineering, electronic devices, and actuators.},

Herein, a curcumin-assisted electroless deposition technology is developed for the first time to achieve stretchable strain sensing yarns (SSSYs) with high conductivity (0.2 Ω cm −1 ) and ultralight weight (1.5 mg cm −1 ). The isotropically deposited structural yarns can bear high uniaxial elongation (&gt;&gt;1100%) and still retain low resistivity after 5000 continuous stretching–releasing cycles under 50% strain. Apart from the high flexibility enabled by helical loaded structure, a precise strain sensing function can be facilitated under external forces with metal-coated conductive layers. Based on the mechanics analysis, the strain sensing responses are scaled with the dependences on structural variables and show good agreements with the experimental results. The application of interfacial enhanced yarns as wearable logic HMIs to remotely control the robotic hand and manipulate the color switching of light on the basis of gesture recognition is demonstrated. It is hoped that the SSSYs strategy can shed an extra light in future HMIs development and incoming IoT and artificial intelligence technologies.},

It has been shown that by optically triggering the reversal of the magnetization in a GdFeCo layer, the magnetization of a nearby ferromagnetic thin film can also be reversed via spin currents originating in the GdFeCo layer. Here, using a similar structure, it is shown that the magnetization reversal of the GdFeCo is not required in order to reverse the magnetization of the ferromagnetic thin film. This switching is attributed to the ultrafast spin current and can be generated by the GdFeCo demagnetization. A larger energy efficiency of the ferromagnetic layer single pulse switching is obtained for a GdFeCo with a larger Gd concentration. Those ultrafast and energy efficient switchings observed in such spintronic devices open a new path toward ultrafast and energy efficient magnetic memories.},

Unfortunately, the emission of methane into the atmosphere has long been ignored and considered as a trivial matter. Therefore, emphatic effort must be put into decreasing the concentration of methane in the atmosphere of the earth. At the same time, the conversion of less valuable methane into value-added chemicals is of significant importance in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Although, the transformation of methane to valuable chemicals and fuels is considered the “holy grail,” the low intrinsic reactivity of its C  H bonds is still a major challenge. This review discusses the advancements in the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic oxidation of methane at low temperatures with products containing oxygen atom(s).

  abstract     = {The current outbreak of the beta-coronavirus (beta-Cov) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in December 2019. No specific antiviral treatments or vaccines are currently available. A recent study has reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with neutrophil-specific plasma membrane rupture, and release excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and extracellular DNAs (eDNAs). This mechanism involves the activation of NETosis, a neutrophil-specific programmed cell death, which is believed to play a crucial role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Further progression of the disease can cause uncontrolled inflammation, leading to the initiation of cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. Herein, it is reported that DNase-I-coated melanin-like nanospheres (DNase-I pMNSs) mitigate sepsis-associated NETosis dysregulation, thereby preventing further progression of the disease. Recombinant DNase-I and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are used as coatings to promote the lengthy circulation and dissolution of NET structure. The data indicate that the application of bioinspired DNase-I pMNSs reduce neutrophil counts and NETosis-related factors in the plasma of SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients, alleviates systemic inflammation, and attenuates mortality in a septic mouse model. Altogether, the findings suggest that these nanoparticles have potential applications in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-related illnesses and other beta-CoV-related diseases.},

Combining a whole whole-genome-wide RNA interference screening and an evolutionary drug pressure model with MDA-MB-231 cells, it is found that enhanced protein damage clearance and reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity are responsible for cisplatin resistance. Screening drug-resistant cancer cells and human patient-derived organoids for breast and colon cancers with many anticancer drugs indicates that activation of mitochondrion protein import surveillance system enhances proteasome activity and minimizes caspase activation, leading to broad drug resistance that can be overcome by co-treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. It is further demonstrated that cisplatin and bortezomib encapsulated into nanoparticle further enhance their therapeutic efficacy and alleviate side effects induced by drug combination treatment. These data demonstrate a feasibility for eliminating broad drug resistance by targeting its common mechanism to achieve effective therapy for multiple cancers.},

  abstract     = {Highly efficient removal of bilirubin from blood by hemoperfusion for liver failure therapy remains a challenge in the clinical field due to the low adsorption capacity and slow adsorption kinetics of currently used bilirubin adsorbents (e.g., activated carbon and ion-exchange resin). Recently, porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) with high surface areas, tunable structures, and remarkable stability provide numerous possibilities to obtain satisfying adsorbents. Here, a cationic PAF with more mesopores, named iPAF-6, is successfully constructed via a de novo synthetic strategy for bilirubin removal. The prepared iPAF-6 exhibits a record-high adsorption capacity of 1249 mg g −1 and can adsorb bilirubin from 150 mg L −1 to normal concentration in just 5 min. Moreover, iPAF-6 shows a removal efficiency of 96% toward bilirubin in the presence of 50 g L −1 bovine serum albumin. It is demonstrated that positively charged aromatic frameworks and large pore size make a significant contribution to its excellent adsorption ability. More notably, iPAF-6/polyethersulfone composite fibers or beads are fabricated for practical hemoperfusion adsorption, which also show better removal performance than commercial adsorbents. This work can offer a new possibility for designing PAF-based bilirubin adsorbents with an appealing application prospect.},

The periodic ultrathin MoO 3 /CBP-stacked HTL results in improved lateral current spreading for the QLEDs, which significantly relieves the crowding of holes and thus enhances hole transport capability across the CBP in QLEDs. Comprehensive analysis on the photoelectric properties of devices shows that the optimal thickness for MoO 3 interlayer inserted in CBP is only ≈1 nm. The resulting devices with periodic two insertion layers of MoO 3 into CBP exhibit better performance compared with the CBP-only ones, such that the peak current efficiency is 88.7 cd A −1 corresponding to the external quantum efficiency of 20.6%. Furthermore, the resulting QLEDs show an operational lifetime almost 2.5 times longer compared to CBP-only devices.},

In this section, important considerations that must be made to improve bacterial SERS signals are discussed. Then, the label-based SERS strategy involves the design strategy of SERS tags, the immunomagnetic separation of SERS tags, and the capture of bacteria from solution and dye-labeled SERS primers.

More importantly, their use in nanotheranostics, a field that combines diagnostics with therapy via drug or gene delivery in an all-in-one platform, has been applied extensively in recent years to provide personalized cancer treatments. Conveniently, the ease of attachment of both imaging and therapeutic moieties to DNA-NSs or DNA-NPs enables high biostability, biocompatibility, and drug loading capabilities, and as a consequence, has markedly catalyzed the rapid growth of this field.

The test-tube-inversion method shows that this ERT-loaded hydrogel composite (ERT@HMSNs/gel) presents as an injectable flowing solution under room temperature and transfers into a physically crosslinked non-flowing gel structure at physiological temperature.The ERT@HMSNs/gel composite shows a much longer intratumoral and peritumoral drug retention by in vivo imaging study. Notably, this injectable drug delivery system (DDS) provides an impressive balance between antitumor efficacy and systemic safety in a mice xenograft model. The novel ERT loaded HMSNs/gel system may be a promising candidate for the in situ treatment of NSCLC. Moreover, this study provides a prospective platform for the design and fabrication of a nano-scaled delivery system for localized anticancer therapies.},

  abstract     = {Metal chiral nanoparticles (CNPs), composed of atomically chiral lattices, are an emerging chiral nanomaterial showing unique asymmetric properties. Chirality transmission from the host CNPs mediated with galvanic replacement reactions (GRRs) has been carried out to extend their compositional space from the unary to binary. Further compositional extension to, e.g., the ternary is of fundamental interest and in practical demand. Here, layer-by-layer glancing angle deposition is used to dope galvanically “inert” dopant Au in the host Cu CNPs to generate binary Cu:Au CNPs. The “inert” dopants serve as structural scaffold to assist the chirality transmission from the host to the third metals (M: Pt and Ag) cathodically precipitating in the CNPs, enabling the formation of polycrystalline ternary Cu:Au:M CNPs whose compositions are tailored with engineering the GRR duration. More scaffold Au atoms are favored for the faster chirality transfer, and the Au-assisted chirality transfer follows the first-order kinetics with the reaction rate coefficient of ≈0.3 h −1 at room temperature. This work provides further understanding of the GRR-mediated chirality transfer and paves the way toward enhancing the application functions in enantiodifferentiation, enantioseperation, asymmetric catalysis, bioimaging, and biodetection.},

Here, cells from E10.5, E12.5, and E15.5 murine limbs are analyzed by high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing to illustrate the cellular architecture during limb development. Single-cell transcriptional profiling demonstrates the identity and differentiation architecture of musculoskeletal stem cells (MSSC), soft and hard tissue progenitors through expression pattern of musculoskeletal markers (scleraxis [ Scx ], Hoxd13 , Sox9 , and Col1a1 ). This is confirmed by genetic in vivo lineage tracing. Moreover, single-cell analyses of Scx knockout mice tissues illustrates that Scx regulates MSSC self-renewal and proliferation potential. A high-throughput and low-cost multi-tissues RNA sequencing strategy further provides evidence that musculoskeletal system tissues, including muscle, bone, meniscus, and cartilage, are all abnormally developed in Scx knockout mice. These results establish the presence of an indispensable limb Scx+Hoxd13+ MSSC population and their differentiation into soft tissue progenitors ( Scx+Col1a1+ ) and hard tissue progenitors ( Scx+Sox9+ ). Collectively, this study paves the way for systematically decoding the complex molecular mechanisms and cellular programs of musculoskeletal tissues morphogenesis in limb development and regeneration.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular detection at a low concentration is usually the most important criterion for biological measurement and early stage disease diagnosis. In this paper, a highly sensitive nanoplasmonic biosensing approach is demonstrated by achieving near-infrared plasmonic excitation on a continuous gold-coated nanotriangular array. Near-infrared incident light at a small incident angle excites surface plasmon resonance with much higher spectral sensitivity compared with traditional configuration, due to its greater interactive volume and the stronger electric field intensity. By introducing sharp nanotriangular metallic tips, intense localization of plasmonic near-fields is realized to enhance the molecular perception ability on sensing surface. This approach with an enhanced sensitivity (42103.8 nm per RIU) and a high figure of merit (367.812) achieves a direct assay of ssDNA at nanomolar level, which is a further step in label-free ultrasensitive sensing technique. Considerable improvement is recorded in the detection limit of ssDNA as 1.2 × 10 −18 m based on the coupling effect between nanotriangles and gold nanoparticles. This work combines high bulk- and surface-sensitivities, providing a simple way toward label-free ultralow-concentration biomolecular detection.},

Moreover, the chemical materials cost of this aqueous Zn–S battery can be lowered to be $45 kWh −1 due to the cheap raw materials, reaching to the level of pumped energy storage.

BPs are 2D materials with broad light absorption and high photothermal performance, which are synthesized and covalently modified with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to produce the PMMA-modified BPs (mBPs). With the aid of PMMA, the mBPs and phase-changing materials (PCM, eicosane) are encapsulated together to form microcapsules. The microencapsulated eicosane and mBPs (mBPs-MPCM) composites exhibit a high latent heat of over 180 kJ kg −1 , good thermal reliability, as well as excellent photothermal characteristics inherited from BPs. Owing to the direct contact in the integrated mBPs-MPCM composites, the thermal energy generated by mBPs is transferred to eicosane immediately giving rise to three times higher efficiency in solar energy storage compared to microcapsules with mBPs on the surface. The mBPs-MPCM composites have great potential in solar energy storage applications and the concept of integrating photothermal materials and PCMs as the core provides insights into the design of high-efficiency solar energy storage materials.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention due to their strong absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, strong spin-orbit coupling, and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, CoFeMn dichalcogenide nanosheets (CFMS NSs) are prepared via facile vulcanization of a lamellar CoFeMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor followed by polyvinyl pyrrolidone modification (to give CFMS-PVP NSs), and found to show excellent photoacoustic (PA) imaging and synergistic photothermal/chemodynamic therapy (PTT/CDT) performance. The as-prepared CFMS-PVP NSs inherit the ultrathin morphology of the CoFeMn-LDH precursor and exhibit an outstanding photothermal performance with a η of 89.0%, the highest PCE reported to date for 2D TMD materials. Moreover, 50% of maximum catalytic activity (Michaelis–Menten constant, K m ) is attained by CFMS-PVP NSs with 0.26 × 10 −3 m H 2 O 2 at 318 K, markedly lower than the endogenous concentration of H 2 O 2 inside tumor cells. In addition, complete apoptosis of HepG2 cancer cells and complete tumor elimination in vivo are observed after treatment with CFMS-PVP NSs at a low dose, substantiating the NSs’ remarkable PTT/CDT efficacy. This work provides a new and facile approach for the synthesis of high-quality multicomponent TMD nanosheets with precise process control, the potential for mass production, and outstanding performance, providing great promise in cancer theranostics.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have proven that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit regulatory functions of both DNA damage response (DDR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Herein, ER stress-induced lncRNA transcriptomic changes are reported in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and a novel lncRNA HITTERS ( H ERPUD1 i n t ronic t ranscript of ER s tress) is identified as the most significantly upregulated lncRNA. It is shown that HITTERS is a nucleus-located lncRNA including two transcript variants. HITTERS lacks an independent promoter but shares the same promoter with HERPUD1 . HITTERS is transcriptionally regulated by Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) 6 , ATF4 , X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1) , and DNA methylation. In human OSCC tissues, HITTERS is significantly correlated with OSCC clinicopathological features and prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function studies reveal that HITTERS promotes OSCC proliferation and invasion via influencing the expression of growth factor receptors and the downstream pathways. Once ER stress is triggered, HITTERS significantly attenuates ER stress-induced apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, HITTERS functions as RNA scaffold to promote MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex formation in the repair of ER stress-induced DNA damage. To sum up, this study presents a novel lncRNA, namely HITTERS , which links ER stress and DDR together in OSCC.},

  abstract     = {Chromatin modifications, such as histone acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation, play fundamental roles in maintaining chromatin architecture and regulating gene transcription. Although their crosstalk in chromatin remodeling has been gradually uncovered, the functional relationship between histone ubiquitination and methylation in regulating immunity and inflammation remains unclear. Here, it is reported that USP38 is a novel histone deubiquitinase that works together with the histone H3K4 modifier KDM5B to orchestrate inflammatory responses. USP38 specifically removes the monoubiquitin on H2B at lysine 120, which functions as a prerequisite for the subsequent recruitment of demethylase KDM5B to the promoters of proinflammatory cytokines Il6 and Il23a during LPS stimulation. KDM5B in turn inhibits the binding of NF- κ B transcription factors to the Il6 and Il23a promoters by reducing H3K4 trimethylation. Furthermore, USP38 can bind to KDM5B and prevent it from proteasomal degradation, which further enhances the function of KDM5B in the regulation of inflammation-related genes. Loss of Usp38 in mice markedly enhances susceptibility to endotoxin shock and acute colitis, and these mice display a more severe inflammatory phenotype compared to wild-type mice.

  abstract     = {Tumor cells present profound alterations in their composition, structural organization, and functional properties. A landmark of cancer cells is an overall altered mechanical phenotype, which so far are linked to changes in their cytoskeletal regulation and organization. Evidence exists that the plasma membrane (PM) of cancer cells also shows drastic changes in its composition and organization. However, biomechanical characterization of PM remains limited mainly due to the difficulties encountered to investigate it in a quantitative and label-free manner. Here, the biomechanical properties of PM of a series of MCF10 cell lines, used as a model of breast cancer progression, are investigated. Notably, a strong correlation between the cell PM elasticity and oncogenesis is observed. The altered membrane composition under cancer progression, as emphasized by the PM-associated cholesterol levels, leads to a stiffening of the PM that is uncoupled from the elastic cytoskeletal properties. Conversely, cholesterol depletion of metastatic cells leads to a softening of their PM, restoring biomechanical properties similar to benign cells. As novel therapies based on targeting membrane lipids in cancer cells represent a promising approach in the field of anticancer drug development, this method contributes to deciphering the functional link between PM lipid content and disease.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) provides a facile and sustainable strategy to produce ammonia (NH 3 ) at ambient conditions. However, the low NH 3 yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) are still the main challenges due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a three-phase electrocatalyst through in situ fabrication of Au nanoparticles (NPs) located on hydrophobic carbon fiber paper (Au/o-CFP) is designed. The hydrophobic CFP surface facilitates efficient three-phase contact points (TPCPs) for N 2 (gas), electrolyte (liquid), and Au NPs (solid). Thus, concentrated N 2 molecules can contact the electrocatalyst surface directly, inhibiting the HER since the lowered proton concentration and overall enhancing NRR. The three-phase Au/o-CFP electrocatalyst presents an excellent NRR performance with high NH 3 yield rate of 40.6 µg h −1 mg −1 at −0.30 V and great FE of 31.3% at −0.10 V versus RHE (0.1 m Na 2 SO 4 ). The N 2 -bubble contact angle result and cyclic voltammetry analysis confirm that the hydrophobic interface has a relatively strong interaction with N 2 bubble for enhanced NRR and weak electrocatalytic activity for HER. Significantly, the three-phase Au/o-CFP exhibits excellent stability with a negligible fluctuation of NH 3 yield and FE in seven-cycle test. This work provides a new strategy for improving NRR and simultaneously inhibiting HER.},

Most importantly, integration of the near-infrared-responsive template significantly improves the photoresponse of up to 600 fold in device made of NaYF 4 :Yb/Er@MoS 2 compared with that of MoS 2 nanosheets under 980 nm laser illumination. Multichannel optoelectronic device is further fabricated by simply changing luminescent ions in the template, e.g., NaYF 4 :Er@MoS 2 , operating at 1532 nm light excitation with a 276-fold photoresponse enhancement.

The innovative methodology of crossover alloying is herein used to synthesize an aluminium alloy with a radiation resistant hardening phase. This alloy—a crossover of 5xxx and 7xxx series Al-alloys—is subjected to extreme heavy ion irradiations in situ within a TEM up to a dose of 1 dpa and major experimental observations are made: the Mg 32 (Zn,Al) 49 hardening precipitates (denoted as T-phase) for this alloy system surprisingly survive the extreme irradiation conditions, no cavities are found to nucleate and displacement damage is observed to develop in the form of black-spots. This discovery indicates that a high phase fraction of hardening precipitates is a crucial parameter for achieving superior radiation tolerance.

  abstract     = {Germanium (Ge)-based materials have been considered as potential anode materials for sodium-ion batteries owing to their high theoretical specific capacity. However, the poor conductivity and Na + diffusivity of Ge-based materials result in retardant ion/electron transportation and insufficient sodium storage efficiency, leading to sluggish reaction kinetics. To intrinsically maximize the sodium storage capability of Ge, the nitrogen doped carbon-coated Cu 3 Ge/Ge heterostructure material (Cu 3 Ge/Ge@N-C) is developed for enhanced sodium storage. The pod-like structure of Cu 3 Ge/Ge@N-C exposes numerous active surface to shorten ion transportation pathway while the uniform encapsulation of carbon shell improves the electron transportation, leading to enhanced reaction kinetics. Theoretical calculation reveals that Cu 3 Ge/Ge heterostructure can offer decent electron conduction and lower the Na + diffusion barrier, which further promotes Ge alloying reaction and improves its sodium storage capability close to its theoretical value. In addition, the uniform encapsulation of nitrogen-doped carbon on Cu 3 Ge/Ge heterostructure material efficiently alleviates its volume expansion and prevents its decomposition, further ensuring its structural integrity upon cycling. Attributed to these unique superiorities, the as-prepared Cu 3 Ge/Ge@N-C electrode demonstrates admirable discharge capacity, outstanding rate capability and prolonged cycle lifespan (178 mAh g −1 at 4.0 A g −1 after 4000 cycles).},

To overcome TRAIL resistance, this study identifies curcumol as a novel safe sensitizer from a food-source compound library, which exhibits synergistic lethal effects in combination with TRAIL on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SILAC-based cellular thermal shift profiling identifies NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) as the key target of curcumol. Mechanistically, curcumol directly targets NQO2 to cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) death receptor (DR5) signaling, sensitizing NSCLC cell to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Molecular docking analysis and surface plasmon resonance assay demonstrate that Phe178 in NQO2 is a critical site for curcumol binding. Mutation of Phe178 completely abolishes the function of NQO2 and augments the TRAIL sensitization. This study characterizes the functional role of NQO2 in TRAIL resistance and the sensitizing function of curcumol by directly targeting NQO2, highlighting the potential of using curcumol as an NQO2 inhibitor for clinical treatment of TRAIL-resistant cancers.},

Device uniformity is one of the key challenges which limit the practical applications of threshold switching selectors. Here, high-uniformity threshold switching HfO 2 -based selectors are fabricated by using e-beam lithography to pattern controllable Ag nanodots (NDs) with high order and uniform size in the cross-point region. The selectors exhibit excellent bidirectional threshold switching performance, including low leakage current (&lt;1 pA), high on/off ratio (&gt;10 8 ), high endurance (&gt;10 8 cycles), and fast switching speed (≈75 ns). The patterned Ag NDs in the selector help control the number of Ag atoms diffusing into HfO 2 and confine the positions to form reproducible filaments. According to the statistical analysis, the Ag NDs selectors show much smaller cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variations ( C V &lt; 10%) compared to control samples with nonpatterned Ag thin film. Furthermore, when integrating the Ag NDs selector with resistive switching memory in one-selector-one-resistor (1S1R) structure, the reduced selector variation helps significantly reduce the bit error rate in 1S1R crossbar array. The high-uniformity Ag NDs selectors offer great potential in the fabrication of large-scale 1S1R crossbar arrays for future memory and neuromorphic computing applications.},

In this work, efforts are devoted to exploring a new flexible structure that is competent in providing large amounts of oxygen vacancies as well as offering the freedom to manipulate the electronic structure of metal cations. This is demonstrated by anchoring low valence state Co at high valence state Nb sites in the tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB)-structured Sr 0.5 Ba 0.5 Nb 2- x Co x O 6- δ , with different ratios of Co to Nb to optimize the Co substitution proportion. It is found that the occupation of Co in the Nb 5+ sites gives rise to the generation of massive surface oxygen vacancies (O vac ), while Co itself is stabilized in Co 2+ by adjacent O vac . The coexistence of O vac and LS Co 2+ enables an oxygen intercalation mechanism in the optimal SBNC45 with specific activity at 1.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode that is 20 times higher than for the commercial IrO 2 .

Here, the authors inverstigate a panel of 31 ENMs with different core chemistries and a variety of surface modifications using conventional in vitro assays coupled with omics-based approaches. Cytotoxicity screening and multiplex-based cytokine profiling reveals a good concordance between primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and the human monocyte-like cell line THP-1. Proteomics analysis following a low-dose exposure of cells suggests a nonspecific stress response to ENMs, while microarray-based profiling reveals significant changes in gene expression as a function of both surface modification and core chemistry. Pathway analysis highlights that the ENMs with cationic surfaces that are shown to elicit cytotoxicity downregulated DNA replication and cell cycle responses, while inflammatory responses are upregulated. These findings are validated using cell-based assays. Notably, certain small, PEGylated ENMs are found to be noncytotoxic yet they induce transcriptional responses reminiscent of viruses. In sum, using a multiparametric approach, it is shown that surface chemistry is a key determinant of cellular responses to ENMs. The data also reveal that cytotoxicity, determined by conventional in vitro assays, does not necessarily correlate with transcriptional effects of ENMs.},

  abstract     = {Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging desalination technology for effective removal of ionic species from aqueous solutions. Compared to conventional CDI, which is based on carbon electrodes and struggles with high salinity streams due to a limited salt removal capacity by ion electrosorption and excessive co-ion expulsion, the emerging Faradaic electrodes provide unique opportunities to upgrade the CDI performance, i.e., achieving much higher salt removal capacities and energy-efficient desalination for high salinity streams, due to the Faradaic reaction for ion capture. This article presents a comprehensive overview on the current developments of Faradaic electrode materials for CDI. Here, the fundamentals of Faradaic electrode-based CDI are first introduced in detail, including novel CDI cell architectures, key CDI performance metrics, ion capture mechanisms, and the design principles of Faradaic electrode materials. Three main categories of Faradaic electrode materials are summarized and discussed regarding their crystal structure, physicochemical characteristics, and desalination performance. In particular, the ion capture mechanisms in Faradaic electrode materials are highlighted to obtain a better understanding of the CDI process. Moreover, novel tailored applications, including selective ion removal and contaminant removal, are specifically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges and research directions are also outlined to provide guidelines for future research.},

Li can be hosted in a framework material to address these key issues, but methods to encage Li inside scaffolds remain challenging. The melt infusion of molten Li into substrates has attracted enormous attention in both academia and industry because it provides an industrially adoptable technology capable of fabricating composite Li anodes. In this review, the wetting mechanism driving the spread of liquefied Li toward a substrate is discussed. Following this, various strategies are proposed to engineer stable Li metal composite anodes that are suitable for liquid and solid-state electrolytes. A general conclusion and a perspective on the current limitations and possible future research directions for constructing composite Li anodes for high-energy lithium metal batteries are presented.},

Herein, a unique approach is reported for the controlled synthesis of pure-phase Mn 2+ -doped Cs 4 PbCl 6 perovskite NCs and the excited-state dynamics of Mn 2+ is unveiled through temperature-dependent steady-state and transient photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Because of the spatially confined 0D structure of Cs 4 PbCl 6 perovskite, the NCs exhibit drastically different PL properties of Mn 2+ in comparison with their 3D CsPbCl 3 analogues, including significantly improved PL quantum yield in solid form (25.8%), unusually long PL lifetime (26.2 ms), large exciton binding energy, strong electron–phonon coupling strength, and an anomalous temperature evolution of Mn 2+ -PL decay from a dominant slow decay (in tens of ms scale) at 300 K to a fast decay (in 1 ms scale) at 10 K. These findings provide fundamental insights into the excited-state dynamics of Mn 2+ in 0D Cs 4 PbCl 6 NCs, thus laying a foundation for future design of 0D perovskite NCs through metal ion doping toward versatile applications.},

In this contribution, 0D MXene Ti 3 C 2 T x quantum dots are synthesized by a liquid exfoliation method and a wideband nonlinear optical response from 800 to 1550 nm is studied, which have a larger nonlinear absorption coefficient β of –(11.24 ± 0.14) × 10 –2 cm GW –1 . The carrier dynamic processes of 0D MXene are explored with ultrahigh time resolution nondegenerate transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, which indicates that the TA signal reaches its maximum in 1.28 ps. Furthermore, 0D MXene is used to generate ultrashort pulses in erbium or ytterbium-doped fiber laser cavity. High signal-to-noise (72 dB) femtosecond lasers with pulse durations as short as 170 fs with spectrum bandwidth of 14.8 nm are obtained. Finally, an ultranarrow fiber laser based on 0D MXene is also investigated and has a full width at half maximum of only 5 kHz, and the power fluctuation is less than 0.75% of the average power. The experimental works prove that 0D MXene is an excellent SA and has a promising application in ultrafast and ultranarrow photonics.},

The extensive range of possible inorganic and hybrid perovskites coupled with their processing versatility and ability to convert external stimuli into easily measurable optical/electrical signals makes them an auspicious sensing element even for the high-energy domain of the electromagnetic spectrum. Key to this is the ability of MHPs to accommodate heavy elements while being able to form large, high-quality crystals and polycrystalline layers, making them one of the most promising emerging X-ray and γ -ray detector technologies.

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) have shown great potential as a rival for next generation batteries, for its relatively high theoretical capacity and eco-friendly properties. Nevertheless, blocked by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LPSs, Li 2 S 4 -Li 2 S 8 ) and insulation of sulfur, LSBs show rapid capacity loss and cannot achieve the practical application. Herein, a composite of carbon nanofibers coated by Co 3 S 4 nanosheets (denoted as CNF@Co 3 S 4 ) is successfully synthesized as freestanding sulfur host to optimize the interaction with sulfur species. The combination of the two materials can lead extraordinary cycling and rate performance by alleviating the shuttle of LPSs effectively. N-doped carbon nanofibers serve as long-range conductive networks and Co 3 S 4 nanosheets can accelerate the conversion of LPSs through its electrocatalytic and chemical adsorption ability. Benefiting from the unique structure, the transporting rate of Li + can be enhanced. Distribution of Li + is uniform for enough exposed negative active sites. As a result, the cell with CNF@Co 3 S 4 as sulfur host is able to stabilize at 710 mA h g −1 at 1 C after 200 cycles with average coulombic efficiency of 97.8% in a sulfur loading of 1.7 mg cm −2 and deliver 4.1 mA h cm −2 at 0.1 C even in 6.8 mg cm −2 for 100 cycles.},

This Progress Report reviews recent advances in human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic culture technology, both with single Organ Chips and fluidically coupled human “Body-on-Chips” platforms, which demonstrate their ability to recapitulate human physiology and disease states, as well as human patient responses to clinically relevant drug pharmacokinetic exposures, with higher fidelity than other in vitro models or animal studies. These findings raise the question of whether continuing to require results of animal testing for publication or grant funding still makes scientific or ethical sense, and if more physiologically relevant human Organ Chip models might better serve this purpose. This issue is addressed in this article in context of the history of the field, and advantages and disadvantages of Organ Chip approaches versus animal models are discussed that should be considered by the wider research community.},

Molecular and single cell analysis identifies different molecular subtypes with varying prognosis, while multiple subtypes can reside in the same tumor. Cellular plasticity among different subtypes in response to therapies or during recurrence adds another hurdle in the treatment of GBM. This phenotypic shift is induced and sustained by activation of several pathways within the tumor itself, or microenvironmental factors.

MYSM1 functionally represses cellular senescence and the aging process in human and mice primary cells and in mice organs. MYSM1 mechanistically attenuates the aging process by promoting DNA repair processes. Remarkably, MYSM1 deficiency facilitates the aging process and reduces lifespan, whereas MYSM1 over-expression attenuates the aging process and increases lifespan in mice. The functional role of MYSM1 is demonstrated in suppressing the aging process and prolonging lifespan.

  abstract     = {Supercapacitors with the advantages of high power density and fast discharging rate have full applications in energy storage. However, the low energy density restricts their development. Conventional methods for improving energy density are mainly confined to doping atoms and hybridizing with other active materials. Herein, a Co 3 O 4 /g-C 3 N 4 p–n junction with excellent capacity is developed and its application in an all-solid-state flexible device is demonstrated, whose capacity and energy density are considerably enhanced by simulated solar light irradiation. Under photoirradiation, the capacity is increased by 70.6% at the maximum current density of 26.6 mA cm −2 and a power density of 16.0 kW kg −1 . The energy density is enhanced from 7.5 to 12.9 Wh kg −1 with photoirradiation. The maximum energy density reaches 16.4 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 6.4 kW kg −1 . It is uncovered that the lattice distortion of Co 3 O 4 , reduces defects of g-C 3 N 4 , and the facilitated photo-generated charge separation by the Co 3 O 4 /g-C 3 N 4 p–n junction all make contributions to the promoted electrochemical storage performance. This work may provide a new strategy to enhance the energy density of supercapacitors and expand the application range of photocatalytic materials.},

  abstract     = {In bulk crystals, the kinetics of dislocations is usually hindered by the twining boundaries (TB) or grain boundaries (GB), rendering the well-known grain boundary strengthening effects. Nevertheless, here it is found that in 2D rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ), twinning is much easier than dislocation slip. Consequently, the highly mobile TBs or GBs are inversely pinned by the relatively immobile dislocations. Due to the strong in-plane covalent bonding, the GBs in high-symmetry 2D materials such as graphene which consists of defects are immobile at room temperature. In contrast, in monoclinic 2D ReS 2 several types of GBs (including TBs) can be readily generated and driven by mechanical loading. A complete library of the GBs in 2D ReS 2 is established by the (in situ) atomic-scale transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The twinning (shear) stresses for 2D ReS 2 are estimated as low as 4–30 MPa, one or two orders of magnitude lower than the traditional bulk materials. Full elucidation on the GB structures and especially the intriguing GB kinetics in such anisotropic 2D materials are of fundamental importance to understand the structure–property relationships and develop strain-tunable applications for 2D materials in future.},

Herein, intrinsic long-range ferromagnetic order in 2D Ta 3 FeS 6 is reported, which exhibits ultrahigh stability under the atmospheric environment. The intrinsic ferromagnetism of few-layer Ta 3 FeS 6 is revealed by polar magneto-optical Kerr effect measurement, which exhibits giant MOKE response and has Curie temperature of ≈80 K. More importantly, few-layer Ta 3 FeS 6 nanosheet exhibits excellent air stability and its ferromagnetism remains unchanged after 4 months of aging under the atmosphere.

The lack of effective diagnostic biomarkers for DR leads to unsatisfactory curative treatments. To define potential metabolite biomarkers for DR diagnosis, a multiplatform-based metabolomics study is performed. In this study, a total of 905 subjects with diabetes without DR (NDR) and with DR at different clinical stages are recruited. Multiplatform metabolomics methods are used to characterize the serum metabolic profiles and to screen and validate the DR biomarkers. Based on the criteria p &lt; 0.05 and false-discovery rate &lt; 0.05, 348 and 290 metabolites are significantly associated with the pathogenesis of DR and early-stage DR, respectively. The biomarker panel consisting of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 2-piperidone exhibited better diagnostic performance than hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in differentiating DR from diabetes, with AUCs of 0.946 versus 0.691 and 0.928 versus 0.648 in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. In addition, this panel showed higher sensitivity in early-stage DR detection than HbA1c. In conclusion, this multiplatform-based metabolomics study comprehensively revealed the metabolic dysregulation associated with DR onset and progression. The defined biomarker panel can be used for detection of DR and early-stage DR.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight and flexible tactile learning machines can simultaneously detect, synaptically memorize, and subsequently learn from external stimuli acquired from the skin. This type of technology holds great interest due to its potential applications in emerging wearable and human-interactive artificially intelligent neuromorphic electronics. In this study, an integrated artificially intelligent tactile learning electronic skin (e-skin) based on arrays of ferroelectric-gate field-effect transistors with dome-shape tactile top-gates, which can simultaneously sense and learn from a variety of tactile information, is introduced. To test the e-skin, tactile pressure is applied to a dome-shaped top-gate that measures ferroelectric remnant polarization in a gate insulator. This results in analog conductance modulation that is dependent upon both the number and magnitude of input pressure-spikes, thus mimicking diverse tactile and essential synaptic functions. Specifically, the device exhibits excellent cycling stability between long-term potentiation and depression over the course of 10 000 continuous input pulses. Additionally, it has a low variability of only 3.18%, resulting in high-performance and robust tactile perception learning. The 4 × 4  device array is also able to recognize different handwritten patterns using 2-dimensional spatial learning and recognition, and this is successfully demonstrated with a high degree accuracy of 99.66%, even after considering 10% noise.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, in which the higher frequency of cancer stem cells (CSCs) correlates with the poor clinical outcome. An aberrant activation of CDK5 is found to associate with TNBC progression closely. CDK5 mediates PPAR γ phosphorylation at its Ser 273, which induces CD44 isoform switching from CD44s to CD44v, resulting in an increase of stemness of TNBC cells. Blocking CDK5/pho-PPAR γ significantly reduces CD44v+ BCSCs population in tumor tissues, thus abrogating metastatic progression in TNBC mouse model. Strikingly, diminishing stemness transformation reverses immunosuppressive microenvironment and enhances anti-PD-1 therapeutic efficacy on TNBC. Mechanistically, CDK5 switches the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PPAR γ and directly protects ESRP1 from a ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. This finding firstly indicates that CDK5 blockade can be a potent strategy to diminish stemness transformation and increase the response to PD-1 blockade in TNBC therapy.},

Benefiting from the abundant porosity of the porous yolk–shell structure and unique electronic properties by nitrogen doping, the as-prepared N-CoS 2 YSSs possess more exposed active surface, thus giving rise to superior activity for reversible oxygen electrocatalysis and outstanding cycling stability (more than 165 h at 10 mA cm −2 ) in ZABs, exceeding the commercial Pt/C and RuO 2 hybrid catalysts. Moreover, the assembled ZABs, delivering a specific capacity of 640 mAh g Zn −1 , can be used for practical devices.

  abstract     = {Long bone mineralization occurs through endochondral ossification, where a cartilage template mineralizes into bone-like tissue with a hierarchical organization from the whole bone-scale down to sub-nano scale. Whereas this process has been extensively studied at the larger length scales, it remains unexplored at some of the smaller length scales. In this study, the changes in morphology, composition, and structure during embryonic mineralization of murine humeri are investigated using a range of high-resolution synchrotron-based imaging techniques at several length scales. With micro- and nanometer spatial resolution, the deposition of elements and the shaping of mineral platelets are followed. Rapid mineralization of the humeri occurs over approximately four days, where mineral to matrix ratio and calcium content in the most mineralized zone reach adult values shortly before birth. Interestingly, zinc is consistently found to be localized at the sites of ongoing new mineralization. The mineral platelets in the most recently mineralized regions are thicker, longer, narrower, and less aligned compared to those further into the mineralized region. In summary, this study demonstrates a specific spatial distribution of zinc, with highest concentration where new mineral is being deposited and that the newly formed mineral platelets undergo slight reshaping and reorganization during embryonic development.},

  abstract     = {Tamoxifen remains the most effective treatment for estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancer. However, many patients still develop resistance to tamoxifen in association with metastatic recurrence, which presents a tremendous clinical challenge. To better understand tamoxifen resistance from the perspective of the tumor microenvironment, the whole microenvironment landscape is charted by single-cell RNA sequencing and a new cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) subset, CD63 + CAFs, is identified that promotes tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. Furthermore, it is discovered that CD63 + CAFs secrete exosomes rich in miR-22, which can bind its targets, ER α and PTEN, to confer tamoxifen resistance on breast cancer cells. Additionally, it is found that the packaging of miR-22 into CD63 + CAF-derived exosomes is mediated by SFRS1. Furthermore, CD63 induces STAT3 activation to maintain the phenotype and function of CD63 + CAFs. Most importantly, the pharmacological blockade of CD63 + CAFs with a CD63-neutralizing antibody or cRGD-miR-22-sponge nanoparticles enhances the therapeutic effect of tamoxifen in breast cancer. In summary, the study reveals a novel subset of CD63 + CAFs that induces tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer via exosomal miR-22, suggesting that CD63 + CAFs may be a novel therapeutic target to enhance tamoxifen sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {A charge transport layer based on transition metal-oxides prepared by an anhydrous sol–gel method normally requires high-temperature annealing to achieve the desired quality. Although annealing is not a difficult process in the laboratory, it is definitely not a simple process in mass production, such as roll-to-roll, because of the inevitable long cooling step that follows. Therefore, the development of an annealing-free solution-processable metal-oxide is essential for the large-scale commercialization. In this work, a room-temperature processable annealing-free “aqueous” MoO x solution is developed and applied in non-fullerene PBDB-T-2F:Y6 solar cells. By adjusting the concentration of water in the sol–gel route, an annealing-free MoO x with excellent electrical properties is successfully developed. The PBDB-T-2F:Y6 solar cell with the general MoO x prepared by the anhydrous sol–gel method shows a low efficiency of 7.7% without annealing. If this anhydrous MoO x is annealed at 200 °C, the efficiency is recovered to 17.1%, which is a normal value typically observed in conventional structure PBDB-T-2F:Y6 solar cells. However, without any annealing process, the solar cell with aqueous MoO x exhibits comparable performance of 17.0%. In addition, the solar cell with annealing-free aqueous MoO x exhibits better performance and stability without high-temperature annealing compared to the solar cells with PEDOT:PSS.},

Non-conventional heterostructures formed by stacking 2D materials onto structurally distinct materials are of great interest in achieving novel phenomena that are both scientifically and technologically relevant. Here, a heterostructure based on a 2D (molybdenum ditelluride) MoTe 2 and an amorphous strontium titanium oxide (a-STO) thin film is reported. The heterostructure functions as a high-performance photodetector, which exhibits anomalous negative photoresponse in the pristine device due to the scattering effect from the light-induced O δ- ions. The photoresponsivity and the specific detectivity are found to be &gt;10 4 AW -1 and &gt;10 13 Jones, respectively, which are significantly higher than those in standard MoTe 2 devices. Moreover, through tuning the light programming time, the photodetection behavior of the MoTe 2 /a-STO heterostructure experiences a dynamic evolution from negative to positive. This is due to the optically controllable modulation of the interfacial states, which is further confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence measurements. It is envisioned that the 2D material/a-STO heterostructure could be a potential platform for exploring new functional devices.},

  abstract     = {Endothelium can secrete vasoactive mediators and produce specific extracellular matrix, which contribute jointly to the thromboresistance and regulation of vascular cell behaviors. From a bionic point of view, introducing endothelium-like functions onto cardiovascular stents represents the most effective means to improve hemocompatibility and reduce late stent restenosis. However, current surface strategies for vascular stents still have limitations, like the lack of multifunctionality, especially the monotony in endothelial-mimic functions. Herein, a layer-by-layer grafting strategy to create endothelium-like dual-functional surface on cardiovascular scaffolds is reported. Typically, a nitric oxide (NO, vasoactive mediator)-generating compound and an endothelial polysaccharide matrix molecule hyaluronan (HA) are sequentially immobilized on allylamine-plasma-deposited stents through aqueous amidation. In this case, the stents could be well-engineered with dual endothelial functions capable of remote and close-range regulation of the vascular microenvironment. The synergy of NO and endothelial glycocalyx molecules leads to efficient antithrombosis, smooth muscle cell (SMC) inhibition, and perfect endothelial cell (EC)-compatibility of the stents in vitro. Moreover, the dual-functional stents show efficient antithrombogenesis ex vivo, rapid endothelialization, and long-term prevention of restenosis in vivo. Therefore, this study will provide new solutions for not only multicomponent surface functionalization but also the bioengineering of endothelium-mimic vascular scaffolds with improved clinical outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of transcription factors which sense hormonal signals or nutrients to regulate various biological events, including development, reproduction, and metabolism. Here, this study identifies nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 6 (NR2F6), as an important regulator of hepatic triglyceride (TG) homeostasis and causal factor in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of NR2F6 in the liver promotes TG accumulation in lean mice, while hepatic-specific suppression of NR2F6 improves obesity-associated hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, and methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Mechanistically, the fatty acid translocase CD36 is identified as a transcriptional target of NR2F6 to mediate its steatotic role. NR2F6 is able to bind directly onto the CD36 promoter region in hepatocytes and increases the enrichment of nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) and histone acetylation at its promoter. Of pathophysiological significance, NR2F6 is significantly upregulated in the livers of obese mice and NAFLD patients. Moreover, treatment with metformin decreases NR2F6 expression in obese mice, resulting in suppression of CD36 and reduced hepatic TG contents. Therefore, these results provide evidence for an unpredicted role of NR2F6 that contributes to liver steatosis and suggest that NR2F6 antagonists may present a therapeutic strategy for reversing or treating NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis.},

  abstract     = {Despite the ultrahigh intrinsic strength of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), the strengthening effect on ceramic matrix composite remains far from expectation mainly due to the weak load transfer between the reinforcement and ceramic matrix. With the assistance of the in situ pullout test, it is revealed that the liquid-phase sintering (LPS) can serve as a novel strategy to achieve effective load transfer in MWCNT reinforced ceramic matrix composites. The YAlO 3 formed liquid phase during spark plasma sintering of SiC composite greatly facilitates radical elastic deformation of MWCNT, leading to highly increased interfacial shear strength (IFSS) as well as interlayer shear resistance (ISR) of nested walls. The liquid phase with superior wettability can even penetrate into the defects of MWCNT, which further increases the ISR of MWCNT. Moreover, the first-principles calculation indicates that the oxygen terminated YAlO 3 phase displays much stronger bonding compared with SiC matrix, which is also responsible for the large IFSS in the composite. As a result, as high as 30% improvement of bending strength is achieved in the composite with only 3 wt% MWCNT in comparison to the monolithic ceramic, manifesting the unprecedented strengthening effect of MWCNT assisted by LPS.},

Herein, a dual-strategy is developed to boost the Na-storage performance of the Fe/Mn-based layered oxide cathode by copper (Cu) doping and nanoengineering. The P2-Na 0.76 Cu 0.22 Fe 0.30 Mn 0.48 O 2 cathode material synthesized by electrospinning exhibits the pearl necklace-like hierarchical nanostructures assembled by nanograins with sizes of 50–150 nm. The synergistic effects of Cu doping and nanotechnology enable high Na + coefficients and low ionic migration energy barrier, as well as highly reversible structure evolution and Cu/Fe/Mn valence variation upon repeated sodium insertion/extraction; thus, the P2-Na 0.76 Cu 0.22 Fe 0.30 Mn 0.48 O 2 nano-necklaces yield fabulous rate capability (125.4 mA h g −1 at 0.1 C with 56.5 mA h g −1 at 20 C) and excellent cyclic stability (≈79% capacity retention after 300 cycles). Additionally, a promising energy density of 177.4 Wh kg −1 is demonstrated in a prototype soft-package Na-ion full battery constructed by the tailored nano-necklaces cathode and hard carbon anode.

However, the uncontrollable dendrite growth and low coulombic efficiency of the Zn plating/stripping process severely impede further practical applications of Zn-based batteries. Here, these roadblocks are removed by using in situ grown zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as the ion modulation layer to tune the diffusion behavior of Zn 2+ ions on Zn anodes. The well-ordered nanochannels and N species of ZIF-8 can effectively homogenize Zn 2+ flux distribution and modulate the plating/stripping rate, ensuring uniform Zn deposition without dendrite growth. The Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution are also alleviated by the insulating nature of ZIF-8, resulting in high coulombic efficiency. Therefore, the Zn@ZIF anode shows highly reversible, dendrite-free Zn plating/stripping behavior under a broad range of current densities, and a symmetric cell using this anode can work correctly up to 1200 h with a low polarization at 2 mA cm −2 . Moreover, this ultrastable Zn@ZIF anode also enables a full Zn ion battery with outstanding cyclic stability (10 000 cycles).},

  abstract     = {In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with extrahepatic metastasis, the lung is the most frequent site of metastasis. However, how the lung microenvironment favors disseminated cells remains unclear. Here, it is found that nidogen 1 (NID1) in metastatic HCC cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) promotes pre-metastatic niche formation in the lung by enhancing angiogenesis and pulmonary endothelial permeability to facilitate colonization of tumor cells and extrahepatic metastasis. EV-NID1 also activates fibroblasts, which secrete tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), facilitate lung colonization of tumor cells, and augment HCC cell growth and motility. Administration of anti-TNFR1 antibody effectively diminishes lung metastasis induced by the metastatic HCC cell-derived EVs in mice. In the clinical perspective, analysis of serum EV-NID1 and TNFR1 in HCC patients reveals their positive correlation and association with tumor stages suggesting the potential of these molecules as noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of HCC. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the interplay of HCC EVs and activated fibroblasts in pre-metastatic niche formation and how blockage of their functions inhibits distant metastasis to the lungs. This study offers promise for the new direction of HCC treatment by targeting oncogenic EV components and their mediated pathways.},

Then the feasibility of using self-healing strategies designed for repairing mechanical damage in the healing of electrical damage is evaluated, based on which the challenges and bottleneck issues are pointed out. The emerging self-healing methods specifically designed for healing electrical damage are highlighted and some useful mechanisms for developing novel self-healing dielectric polymers are proposed.

  abstract     = {To meet the demands of future intelligent application scenarios, the time-efficient information acquisition and energy-efficient data processing capabilities of terminal electronic systems are indispensable. However, in current commercial visual systems, the visible information is collected by image sensors, converted into digital format data, and transferred to memory units and processors for subsequent processing tasks. As a result, most of the time and energy are wasted in the data conversion and movement, which leads to large time latency and low energy efficiency. Here, based on 2D semiconductor WSe 2 , a logic-memory transistor that integrates visible information sensing-memory-processing capabilities is successfully demonstrated. Furthermore, based on 3 × 3 fabricated devices, an artificial visible information sensing-memory-processing system is proposed to perform image distinction tasks, in which the time latency and energy consumption caused by data conversion and movement can be avoided. On the other hand, the logic-memory transistor can also execute digital logic processing (logic) and logic results storage (memory) at the same time, such as AND logic function. Such a logic-memory transistor could provide a compact approach to develop next-generation efficient visual systems.},

  abstract     = {Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, expected to result in 61 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2020. Rapid diagnostics is the core of stroke management for early prevention and medical treatment. Serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) reflect underlying disease progression, predictive of patient phenotypes. Deep learning (DL) encoding SMFs with clinical indexes outperforms single biomarkers, while posing challenges with poor prediction to interpret by feature selection. Herein, rapid computer-aided diagnosis of stroke is performed using SMF based multi-modal recognition by DL, to combine adaptive machine learning with a novel feature selection approach. SMFs are extracted by nano-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS), consuming 100 nL of serum in seconds. A multi-modal recognition is constructed by integrating SMFs and clinical indexes with an enhanced area under curve (AUC) up to 0.845 for stroke screening, compared to single-modal diagnosis by only SMFs or clinical indexes. The prediction of DL is addressed by selecting 20 key metabolite features with differential regulation through a saliency map approach, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms in stroke. The approach highlights the emerging role of DL in precision medicine and suggests an expanding utility for computational analysis of SMFs in stroke screening.},

Unfortunately, realizing this opportunity is hampered by increasing concerns about the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly toxic halogenated solvents that are detrimental to the environment and human health. Here, a cradle-to-grave process is reported to achieve high performance p- and n-type OSC devices based on indacenodithiophene and diketopyrrolopyrrole semiconducting polymers that utilizes aqueous-processes, fewer steps, lower reaction temperatures, a significant reduction in VOCs (&gt;99%) and avoids all halogenated solvents. The process involves an aqueous mini-emulsion polymerization that generates a surfactant-stabilized aqueous dispersion of OSC nanoparticles at sufficient concentration to permit direct aqueous processing into thin films for use in organic field-effect transistors. Promisingly, the performance of these devices is comparable to those prepared using conventional synthesis and processing procedures optimized for large amounts of VOCs and halogenated solvents. Ultimately, the holistic approach reported addresses the environmental issues and enables a viable guideline for the delivery of future OSC devices using only aqueous media for synthesis, purification and thin-film processing.},

In contrast to the conventional 2D culture, the cells within the PLGA PMs exhibit significantly higher half-maximal inhibitory concentration values against anticancer drugs, including doxorubicin and cisplatin. Furthermore, the feasibility of coculturing other cell types, such as fibroblasts (L929) and HepG2 cells, is investigated.

In particular, the two-population prisoner&#39;s dilemma game with periodically oscillating payoffs is discussed, such that the time-average of these oscillations over the period of environmental variations vanishes. The possible overlaps of these oscillations generate completely new dynamical effects that drastically change the phase space structure of the two-population evolutionary dynamics. Due to these effects, the emergence of some level of cooperators in both populations is possible under certain conditions on the environmental variations. In the domain of stable coexistence the dynamics of cooperators in each population form stable cycles. Thus, the cooperators in each population promote the existence of cooperators in the other population. However, the survival of cooperators in both populations is not guaranteed by a large initial fraction of them.},

This study finds that the adsorbed arsenite (As(III)) on rGO/MO is oxidized to arsenate (As(V)) in the absence of other oxidants or radicals. The oxidation of As(III) is observed on varying rGO/MOs, including rGO/MOs composited of different types of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and metal oxide. The epoxy group on rGO acts as the oxidant, evidenced by the significant correlation between the consumption of epoxy group and oxidation of As(III). Meanwhile, metal oxide provides adsorption sites for As(III) during the adsorption–oxidation process. Based on a combination of spectroscopic measurements and computational calculation, a possible pathway for As(III) oxidation by rGO/MO is proposed: the oxygen atom in the epoxy group is bonded to the adsorbed As III O 3 , which is consequently oxidized to As V O 4 . Overall, this study proves the role of rGO/MO as an oxidant, which opens a new perspective on future studies using rGO/MO as a catalyst for the oxidation reaction.},

A non-invasive and biomimetic concept known as the “artificial placenta” (AP) would be beneficial to overcome complications associated with the current respiratory support of preterm infants. Here, a pumpless oxygenator connected to the systemic circulation supports the lung function to relieve respiratory distress. In this paper, the first successful operation of a microfluidic, artificial placenta type neonatal lung assist device (LAD) on a newborn piglet model, which is the closest representation of preterm human infants, is demonstrated. This LAD has high oxygenation capability in both pure oxygen and room air as the sweep gas. The respiratory distress that the newborn piglet is put under during experimentation, repeatedly and over a significant duration of time, is able to be relieved. These findings indicate that this LAD has a potential application as a biomimetic artificial placenta to support the respiratory needs of preterm neonates.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma is the most malignant cancer in the brain and currently incurable. It is urgent to identify effective targets for this lethal disease. Inhibition of such targets should suppress the growth of cancer cells and, ideally also precancerous cells for early prevention, but minimally affect their normal counterparts. Using genetic mouse models with neural stem cells (NSCs) or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) as the cells-of-origin/mutation, it is shown that the susceptibility of cells within the development hierarchy of glioma to the knockout of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R) is determined not only by their oncogenic states, but also by their cell identities/states. Knockout of IGF1R selectively disrupts the growth of mutant and transformed, but not normal OPCs, or NSCs. The desirable outcome of IGF1R knockout on cell growth requires the mutant cells to commit to the OPC identity regardless of its development hierarchical status. At the molecular level, oncogenic mutations reprogram the cellular network of OPCs and force them to depend more on IGF1R for their growth. A new-generation brain-penetrable, orally available IGF1R inhibitor harnessing tumor OPCs in the brain is also developed. The findings reveal the cellular window of IGF1R targeting and establish IGF1R as an effective target for the prevention and treatment of glioblastoma.},

Its increasing prevalence worldwide has aroused great concerns of the researchers on adipose development and metabolic function. During adipose expansion, adipogenesis is a way to store lipids as well as to avoid lipotoxicity in other tissues, and may be an approach to offset the negative metabolic effects of obesity. In this Review, the transcriptional regulation of adipogenesis is outlined to characterize numerous biological processes in research on the determination of adipocyte fate and regulation of adipogenic differentiation. Notably, one of the post-transcriptional modifications of mRNA, namely, N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), has been recently found to play a role in adipogenesis. Here, the roles of m 6 A-related enzymes and proteins in adipogenesis, with a particular focus on how these m 6 A-related proteins function at different stages of adipogenesis, are mainly discussed. The Review also highlights the coordination role of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional (RNA m 6 A methylation) regulation in adipogenesis and related biological processes. In this context, a better understanding of adipogenesis at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels may facilitate the development of novel strategies to improve metabolic health in obesity.},

Here, it is addressed by modeling and simulation approaches guided by classic ecological theories and by treating the COVID-19 pandemic as a metapopulation dynamics problem. Three classic ecological theories are harnessed, including TPL (Taylor’s power-law) and Ma’s population aggregation critical density (PACD) for spatiotemporal aggregation/stability scaling, approximating virus metapopulation dynamics with Hubbell’s neutral theory, and Ma’s diversity-time relationship adapted for the infection−time relationship. Fisher-Information for detecting critical transitions and tipping points are also attempted. It is discovered that: (i) TPL aggregation/stability scaling parameter ( b &gt; 2), being significantly higher than the b -values of most macrobial and microbial species including SARS, may interpret the chaotic pandemic of COVID-19. (ii) The infection aggregation critical threshold ( M 0 ) adapted from PACD varies with time (outbreak-stage), space (region) and public-health interventions. Exceeding M 0 , local contagions may become aggregated and connected regionally, leading to epidemic/pandemic. (iii) The ratio of fundamental dispersal to contagion numbers can gauge the relative importance between local contagions vs. regional migrations in spreading infections. (iv) The inflection (turning) points, pair of maximal infection number and corresponding time, are successfully predicted in more than 80% of Chinese provinces and 68 countries worldwide, with a precision &gt;80% generally.},

Furthermore, lnc-Ip53 impedes p53 acetylation by interacting with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and E1A binding protein p300 (p300) to prevent HDAC1 degradation and attenuate p300 activity, resulting in abrogation of p53 activity and subsequent cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. Mouse xenograft models reveal that lnc-Ip53 promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance in vivo, which is attenuated by an HDAC inhibitor. Silencing lnc-Ip53 inhibits the growth of xenografts with wild-type p53, but not those expressing acetylation-resistant p53. Consistently, lnc-Ip53 is upregulated in multiple cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High levels of lnc-Ip53 is associated with low levels of acetylated p53 in human HCC and mouse xenografts, and is also correlated with poor survival of HCC patients. These findings identify a novel p53/lnc-Ip53 negative feedback loop in cells and indicate that abnormal upregulation of lnc-Ip53 represents an important mechanism to inhibit p53 acetylation/activity and thereby promote tumor growth and chemoresistance, which may be exploited for anticancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor nanowires are widely considered as the building blocks that revolutionized many areas of nanosciences and nanotechnologies. The unique features in nanowires, including high electron transport, excellent mechanical robustness, large surface area, and capability to engineer their intrinsic properties, enable new classes of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). Wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors in the form of nanowires are a hot spot of research owing to the tremendous possibilities in NEMS, particularly for environmental monitoring and energy harvesting. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the recent progress on the growth, properties and applications of silicon carbide (SiC), group III-nitrides, and diamond nanowires as the materials of choice for NEMS. It begins with a snapshot on material developments and fabrication technologies, covering both bottom-up and top-down approaches. A discussion on the mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal properties is provided detailing the fundamental physics of WBG nanowires along with their potential for NEMS. A series of sensing and electronic devices particularly for environmental monitoring is reviewed, which further extend the capability in industrial applications. The article concludes with the merits and shortcomings of environmental monitoring applications based on these classes of nanowires, providing a roadmap for future development in this fast-emerging research field.},

  abstract     = {The transcription factor SOX9 is frequently amplified in diverse advanced-stage human tumors. Its stability has been shown to be tightly controlled by ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. However, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This work reports that SOX9 protein abundance is regulated by the Cullin 3-based ubiquitin ligase KEAP1 via proteasome-mediated degradation. Loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 compromise polyubiquitination-mediated SOX9 degradation, leading to increased protein levels, which facilitate tumorigenesis. Moreover, the loss of critical ubiquitination residues in SOX9, by either a SOX9 (ΔK2) truncation or K249R mutation, leads to elevated protein stability. Furthermore, it is shown that the KEAP1/SOX9 interaction is modulated by CKI γ -mediated phosphorylation. Importantly, it is demonstrated that DNA damage drugs, topoisomerase inhibitors, can trigger CKI activation to restore the KEAP1/SOX9 interaction and its consequent degradation. Collectively, herein the findings uncover a novel molecular mechanism through which SOX9 protein stability is negatively regulated by KEAP1 to control tumorigenesis. Thus, these results suggest that mitigating SOX9 resistance to KEAP1-mediated degradation can represent a novel therapeutic strategy for cancers with KEAP1 mutations.},

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain high-quality III-nitride epilayers on 2D materials such as hexagonal BN (h-BN) due to different atom hybridizations. Here, the epitaxy of single-crystalline GaN films on the chemically activated h-BN/Al 2 O 3 substrates is reported, paying attention to interface atomic configuration. It is found that chemical-activated h-BN provides B  O  N and N  O bonds, where the latter ones act as effective artificial dangling bonds for following GaN nucleation, leading to Ga-polar GaN films with a flat surface. The h-BN is also found to be effective in modifying the compressive strain in GaN film and thus improves indium incorporation during the growth of InGaN quantum wells, resulting in the achievement of pure green light-emitting diodes. This work provides an effective way for III-nitrides epitaxy on h-BN and a possible route to overcome the epitaxial bottleneck of high indium content III-nitride light-emitting devices.},

As a representative, CsPbI 2 Br is attracting considerable attention as it can balance the high efficiency of CsPbI 3 and the stability of CsPbBr 3 . However, most research employs doped charge transport materials or applies bilayer transport layers to obtain decent performance, which vastly complicates the fabrication process and scarcely satisfies the commercial production requirement. In this work, all-layer-doping-free inorganic CsPbI 2 Br PSCs using organic ligands armored ZnO as the electron transport materials achieve an encouraging performance of 16.84%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among published works. Meanwhile, both the ZnO-based CsPbI 2 Br film and device show superior photostability under continuous white light-emitting diode illumination and improved thermal stability under 85 °C. The remarkable enhanced performance arises from the favorable organic ligands (acetate ions) residue in the ZnO film, which not only can conduce to maintain high crystallinity of perovskite, but also passivate traps at the interface through cesium/acetate interactions, thus suppressing the photo- and thermal- induced perovskite degradation.},

Herein, a multifunctional interlayer is developed by growing metallic molybdenum disulfide nanosheets on both outer and inner walls of cotton cloth derived carbon microtube textile (MoS 2 @CMT). The hollow structure of CMT provides channels to favor electrolyte penetration, Li + diffusion and restrains polysulfides via physical confinement. The hydrophilic and conductive 1T-MoS 2 nanosheets facilitate chemisorption and kinetic behavior of polysulfides. The synergic effect of 1T-MoS 2 nanosheets and CMT affords the MoS 2 @CMT interlayer with an efficient trapping-diffusion-conversion ability toward polysulfides. Therefore, the cell with the MoS 2 @CMT interlayer exhibits enhanced cycling life (765 mAh g −1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 C) and rate performance (974 mAh g −1 at 2 C and 740 mAh g −1 at 5 C).

This work clearly explains the effect of Na doping on the fill factor (FF) rather than on all of the solar cell parameters (open-circuit voltage, FF, and sometimes short circuit current) for overall performance improvement. When doping is optimized, the fabricated device shows sufficient built-in potential and selects a better carrier transport path by the high potential difference between the intragrains and the grain boundaries. On the other hand, when doping is excessive, the device shows low contact potential difference and FF and selects a worse carrier transport path even though the built-in potential becomes stronger. The fabricated CZTSSe solar cell on a flexible metal foil optimized with a 25 nm thick NaF doping layer achieves an FF of 62.63%, thereby clearly showing the enhancing effect of Na doping.},

However, it is challenging to combine these features. Semi-crystalline polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been used to make hydrogels by conventional methods such as freeze–thaw and chemical crosslinking, but it is formidable to produce strong materials with adjustable properties. Herein, a method to induce crystallinity and produce physically crosslinked PVA hydrogels via applying high-concentration sodium hydroxide into dense PVA polymer is introduced. Such a strategy enables the production of physically crosslinked PVA biomaterial with high mechanical properties, low water content, resistance to injury, and shape memory properties. It is also found that the developed PVA hydrogel can recover 90% of plastic deformation due to extension upon supplying water, providing a strong contraction force sufficiently to lift objects 1100 times more than their weight. Cytocompatibility, antifouling property, hemocompatibility, and biocompatibility are also demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. The fabrication methods of PVA-based catheters, injectable electronics, and microfluidic devices are demonstrated. This gelation approach enables both layer-by-layer and 3D printing fabrications.},

  abstract     = {Unique metal sulfide (MS) clusters embedded ultrathin nanosheets of Fe/Ni metal–organic framework (MOF) are grown on nickel foam (NiFe-MS/MOF@NF) as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. It exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and stability toward both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, ƞ = 230 mV at 50 mA cm −2 ) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, ƞ = 156 mV at 50 mA cm −2 ) in alkaline media, and bi-functionally catalyzes overall alkaline water splitting at a current density of 50 mA cm −2 by 1.74 V cell voltage without iR compensation. The enhancement mechanism is ascribed to the impregnated metal sulfide clusters in the nanosheets, which not only promote the formation of ultrathin nanosheet to greatly enlarge the reaction surface area while offering high electric conductivity, but more importantly, efficiently modulate the electronic structure of the catalytically active atom sites to an electron-rich state via strong electronic interaction and strengthen the adsorption of oxygenate intermediate to facilitate fast electrochemical reactions. This work reports a highly efficient HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst and may shed light on the rational design and synthesis of uniquely structured MOF-derived catalysts.},

Herein, 520 fecal samples are collected from different regions of China, the gut microbiome in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized, and CKD classifiers based on microbial markers are constructed. Compared with healthy controls (HC, n = 210), gut microbial diversity is significantly decreased in CKD ( n = 110), and the microbial community is remarkably distinguished from HC. Genera Klebsiella and Enterobacteriaceae are enriched, while Blautia and Roseburia are reduced in CKD. Fifty predicted microbial functions including tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolisms increase, while 36 functions including arginine and proline metabolisms decrease in CKD. Notably, five optimal microbial markers are identified using the random forest model. The area under the curve (AUC) reaches 0.9887 in the discovery cohort and 0.9512 in the validation cohort (49 CKD vs 63 HC). Importantly, the AUC reaches 0.8986 in the extra diagnosis cohort from Hangzhou. Moreover, Thalassospira and Akkermansia are increased with CKD progression. Thirteen operational taxonomy units are correlated with six clinical indicators of CKD. In conclusion, this study comprehensively characterizes gut microbiome in non-dialysis CKD and demonstrates the potential of microbial markers as non-invasive diagnostic tools for CKD in different regions of China.},

Self-assembling investigation reveals that several morphologies of self-assembled DAdDMA@2 β -CD including leaf-like lamellar structure, nanoribbons, vesicles, nanofibers, helical nanofibers, and toroids, can be straightforwardly fabricated by simply manipulating the self-assembling solvent proportioning and/or temperature. To the best of knowledge, this presented protocol probably holds the most types of self-assembling morphology alterations using a single entity. Moreover, the developed leaf-like lamellar structure performs well in mimicking the light-harvesting antenna system by incorporating with a Förster resonance energy transfer acceptor, providing up to 94.2% of energy transfer efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Here, a facile approach to enhance the performance of solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is described by means of the synergistic effects of a hybrid network of plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The device based on TiO 2 –Au:CNTs hybrid network sensitized with colloidal CdSe/(CdSe x S 1− x ) 5 /(CdS) 1 core/alloyed shell quantum dots (QDs) yields a saturated photocurrent density of 16.10 ± 0.10 mA cm −2 [at 1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm −2 ), which is ≈26% higher than the control device. The in-depth mechanism behind this significant improvement is revealed through a combined experimental and theoretical analysis for QDs/TiO 2 –Au:CNTs hybrid network and demonstrates the multifaceted impact of plasmonic Au NPs and CNTs: i) hot-electron injection from Au NPs into CNTs and TiO 2 ; ii) near-field enhancement of the QDs absorption and carrier generation/separation processes by the plasmonic Au NPs; iii) enhanced photoinjected electron transport due to the highly directional pathways offered by CNTs. These results provide fundamental insights on the properties of QDs/TiO 2 –Au:CNTs hybrid network, and highlights the possibility to improve the performance of other solar technologies.},

  abstract     = {The combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) has promising potential in the synergistic treatment of cancer. However, chemotherapy and photodynamic synergistic therapy are impeded by uncontrolled chemotherapeutics release behavior, targeting deficiencies, and hypoxia-associated poor PDT efficacy in solid tumors. Here, a platinum nanozyme (PtNP) loaded reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive prodrug nanoparticle (CPT-TK-HPPH/Pt NP) is created to overcome these limitations. The ROS-responsive prodrug consists of a thioketal bond linked with camptothecin (CPT) and photosensitizer-2-(1-hexyloxyethyl)-2-devinyl pyropheophorbide-a (HPPH). The PtNP in CPT-TK-HPPH/Pt NP can efficiently catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) into oxygen to relieve hypoxia. The production of oxygen can satisfy the consumption of HPPH under 660 nm laser irradiation to attain the on-demand release of CPT and ensure enhanced photodynamic therapy. As a tumor diagnosis agent, the results of photoacoustic imaging and fluorescence imaging for CPT-TK-HPPH/Pt NP exhibit desirable long circulation and enhanced in vivo targeting. CPT-TK-HPPH/Pt NPs effectively inhibit tumor proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo. CPT-TK-HPPH/Pt NP, with its excellent ROS-responsive drug release behavior and enhanced PDT efficiency can serve as a new cancer theranostic agent, and will further promote the research of chemophotodynamic synergistic cancer therapy.},

However, nonmonotonic multi-S/R systems are still rarely studied so far. In this work, a rational design strategy is proposed to achieve such a unique S/R system by integrating opposite luminescence behaviors in one molecule. When solvent polarity increases, many heterocyclic or carbonyl-containing compounds often become more emissive due to the suppression of the proximity effect, whereas molecules with donor–acceptor (D–A) structures tend to be less emissive because of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Meanwhile, protonation on D/A moieties will weaken/strengthen the D–A interaction to result in blue/redshifted emissions. By combining a protonatable heterocyclic acceptor and a protonatable donor together in one molecule, nonmonotonic brightness responses to polarity stimuli and nonmonotonic color responses to pH stimuli can be achieved. The design strategy is successfully verified by a simple molecule named 4-(dimethylamino)styryl)quinoxalin-2(1 H )-one (ASQ). ASQ exhibits nonmonotonic responses to polarity and pH stimuli, and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with a nonmonotonic AIE curve. Meanwhile, ASQ can be adjusted to emit white light in an acidic environment, and it shows multivalent functionalities including albumin protein sensing, ratiometric pH sensing, and amine gas sensing.},

  abstract     = {Chronic low-grade inflammation orchestrated by macrophages plays a critical role in metabolic chronic diseases, like obesity and atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, the E3 ubiquitin ligase F-box/WD Repeat-Containing Protein 2 (FBXW2), the substrate-binding subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF (a complex of FBXW2, SKP1, and cullin-1), as an inflammatory mediator in macrophages, is identified. Myeloid-specific FBXW2 gene deficiency improves both obesity-associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in murine models. The beneficial effects by FBXW2 knockout are accompanied by decreased proinflammatory responses and macrophage infiltration in the microenvironment. Mechanistically, it is identified that KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is a new bona fide ubiquitin substrate of SCF FBXW2 . Inhibition of KSRP prevents FBXW2-deficient macrophages from exerting a protective effect on inflammatory reactions, insulin resistance and plaque formation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the C-terminus (P3) of FBXW2 competitively ablates the function of FBXW2 in KSRP degradation and serves as an effective inhibitor of obesity and atherogenesis progression. Thus, the data strongly suggest that SCF FBXW2 is an important mediator in the context of metabolic diseases. The development of FBXW2 (P3)-mimicking inhibitors and small-molecular drugs specifically abrogating KSRP ubiquitination-dependent inflammatory responses are viable approaches for obesity and atherosclerosis treatment.},

These benzothiazolium crystals simultaneously satisfy the crucial requirements for efficient THz wave generation, including having nonlinear optical chromophores with parallel alignment that provide large optical nonlinearity; good phase matching for enhancing the THz generation efficiency in the near-infrared region; strong intermolecular interactions that provide restraining THz self-absorption; high solubility that promotes good crystal growth ability; and a plate-like crystal morphology with excellent optical quality. Consequently, the as-grown benzothiazolium crystals exhibit excellent characteristics for THz wave generation, particularly at near-infrared pump wavelengths around 1100 nm, which is very promising given the availability of femtosecond laser sources at this wavelength, where current conventional THz generators deliver relatively low optical-to-THz conversion efficiencies. Compared to a 1.0-mm-thick ZnTe crystal as an inorganic benchmark, the 0.28-mm-thick benzothiazolium crystal yields a 19 times higher peak-to-peak THz electric field with a broader spectral bandwidth (&gt;6.5 THz) when pumped at 1140 nm.

A blue-emitting nanocrystal with a central wavelength at 459 nm, an exceptionally high photoluminescence quantum yield of 90%, and a spectral width of 19 nm is achieved. First principles calculations reveal that the increase in photoluminescence quantum yield upon doping is driven by an enhancement of the exciton binding energy due to increased electron and hole effective masses and an increase in oscillator strength due to shortening of the Pb  Br bond. Putting these results together, an all-perovskite white light-emitting diode is successfully fabricated, demonstrating that B-site composition engineering is a reliable strategy to further exploit the perovskite family for wider optoelectronic applications.},

The carbonization mechanism of cucurbit[6]uril is verified by an in situ TG-IR technology.

Moreover, systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations, and theory calculations are carried out to reveal the origin of the superior electrochemical performances of CBC@G.

In this work, a method is developed to encapsulate nanoemulsions in alginate capsules for the controlled delivery of lipophilic active ingredients. Functional nanoemulsions loaded with active ingredients and calcium ions are first prepared, followed by encapsulation inside alginate shells. The intrinsically high viscosity of the nanoemulsions ensures the formation of spherical capsules and high encapsulation efficiency during the synthesis. Moreover, a facile approach is developed to measure the nanoemulsion release profile from capsules through UV–vis measurement without an additional extraction step. A quantitative analysis of the release profiles shows that the capsule systems possess a tunable, delayed-burst release. The encapsulation methodology is generalized to other active ingredients, oil phases, nanodroplet sizes, and chemically crosslinked inner hydrogel cores. Overall, the capsule systems provide promising platforms for various functional nanoemulsion formulations.},

  abstract     = {To improve the prognosis of glioblastoma, innovative radiotherapy regimens are required to augment the effect of tolerable radiation doses while sparing surrounding tissues. In this context, nanoscintillators are emerging radiotherapeutics that down-convert X-rays into photons with energies ranging from UV to near-infrared. During radiotherapy, these scintillating properties amplify radiation-induced damage by UV-C emission or photodynamic effects. Additionally, nanoscintillators that contain high-Z elements are likely to induce another, currently unexplored effect: radiation dose-enhancement. This phenomenon stems from a higher photoelectric absorption of orthovoltage X-rays by high-Z elements compared to tissues, resulting in increased production of tissue-damaging photo- and Auger electrons. In this study, Geant4 simulations reveal that rare-earth composite LaF 3 :Ce nanoscintillators effectively generate photo- and Auger-electrons upon orthovoltage X-rays. 3D spatially resolved X-ray fluorescence microtomography shows that LaF 3 :Ce highly concentrates in microtumors and enhances radiotherapy in an X-ray energy-dependent manner. In an aggressive syngeneic model of orthotopic glioblastoma, intracerebral injection of LaF 3 :Ce is well tolerated and achieves complete tumor remission in 15% of the subjects receiving monochromatic synchrotron radiotherapy. This study provides unequivocal evidence for radiation dose-enhancement by nanoscintillators, eliciting a prominent radiotherapeutic effect. Altogether, nanoscintillators have invaluable properties for enhancing the focal damage of radiotherapy in glioblastoma and other radioresistant cancers.},

  abstract     = {The development of advanced materials based on well-defined polymeric architectures is proving to be a highly prosperous research direction across both industry and academia. Controlled radical polymerization techniques are receiving unprecedented attention, with reversible-deactivation chain growth procedures now routinely leveraged to prepare exquisitely precise polymer products. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a powerful protocol within this domain, where the unique chemistry of thiocarbonylthio (TCT) compounds can be harnessed to control radical chain growth of vinyl polymers. With the intense recent focus on RAFT, new strategies for initiation and external control have emerged that are paving the way for preparing well-defined polymers for demanding applications. In this work, the cutting-edge innovations in RAFT that are opening up this technique to a broader suite of materials researchers are explored. Emerging strategies for activating TCTs are surveyed, which are providing access into traditionally challenging environments for reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. The latest advances and future perspectives in applying RAFT-derived polymers are also shared, with the goal to convey the rich potential of RAFT for an ever-expanding range of high-performance applications.},

Recent research on digital coding metasurfaces has built an alternative bridge between wave-behaviors and information science. Different from the logic information in traditional circuits, the digital bit in coding metasurfaces is based on wave-structure interaction, which is capable of exploiting multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). However, to what extent the digital coding metasurface can expand the information representation has not been discussed. In this work, it is shown that classical metasurfaces have the ability to mimic qubit and quantum information. An approach for simulating a two-level spin system with meta-atoms is proposed, from which the superposition for two optical spin states is constructed. It is further proposed that using geometric-phase elements with nonseparable coding states can induce the classical entanglement between polarization and spatial modes, and give the condition to achieve the maximal entanglement. This study expands the information representing range of coding metasurfaces and provides an ultrathin platform to mimic quantum information.},

The applied biaxial strain is controlled through the substrate expansion upon temperature increase and the effective strain transfer from the substrate to the thin InSe is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The bandgap change upon biaxial strain is determined through photoluminescence measurements, finding a gauge factor of up to ≈200 meV % −1 . The effect of biaxial strain on the electrical properties of the InSe devices is further characterized. In the dark state, a large increase of the current is observed upon applied strain which gives a piezoresistive gauge factor value of ≈450–1000, ≈5–12 times larger than that of other 2D materials and of state-of-the-art silicon strain gauges. Moreover, the biaxial strain tuning of the InSe bandgap also translates in a strain-induced redshift of the spectral response of the InSe photodetectors with Δ E cut-off ≈173 meV at a rate of ≈360 meV % −1 of strain, indicating a strong strain tunability of the spectral bandwidth of the photodetectors.},

While it is important to understand the characteristics of energy transfer in MCSs, the effect of multiple donors on energy transfer has not been understood completely, mainly due to the lack of a platform to investigate such an effect systematically. Here, a systematic study on how the number of donors ( n D ) and interchromophore distances affect the efficiency of energy transfer ( η FRET ) is presented. Specifically, η FRET is calculated for a series of model MCSs using simulations, a series of multiporphyrin dendrimers with systematic variation of n D and interdonor distances is synthesized, and η FRET s of those dendrimers using transient absorption spectroscopy are measured. The simulations predict η FRET in the multiporphyrin dendrimers well. In particular, it is found that η FRET is enhanced by donor-to-donor energy transfer only when structural heterogeneity exists in an MCS, and the relationships between the η FRET enhancement and the structural parameters of the MCS are revealed.},

Most methods to measure the stacking characteristics are time consuming and are not suited for obtaining information by directly imaging dispersions. Conventional optical microscopy has difficulty in identifying the size and thickness of a few layers of graphene stacks due to their low photon absorption capacity. Utilizing a contrast based on anisotropic refractive index in 2D materials, it is shown that localized thickness-specific information can be captured in birefringence images of graphene dispersions. Coupling pixel-by-pixel information from brightfield and birefringence images and using unsupervised statistical learning algorithms, three unique data clusters representing flakes (unexfoliated), nanoplatelets (partially exfoliated), and 2D sheets (well-exfoliated) species in various laboratory-based and commercial dispersions of graphene and graphene oxide are identified. The high-throughput, multitasking capability of the approach to classify stacking at sub-nanometer to micrometer scale and measure the size, thickness, and concentration of exfoliated-species in generic dispersions of graphene/graphene oxide are demonstrated. The method, at its current stage, requires less than half an hour to quantitatively assess one sample of graphene/graphene oxide dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Optical thermal sensing holds great promise for disease theranostics. However, traditional ratiometric thermometry methods, in which intensity ratio of two nonoverlapping emissions is defined as the thermosensitive parameter, may have a limited accuracy in temperature read-out due to the deleterious interference from wavelength- and temperature-dependent photon attenuation in tissue. To overcome this limitation, a dual-excitation decoding strategy based on NIR hybrid nanocomposites comprising self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) and Nd 3+ doped fluoride nanocrystals (NCs) is proposed for thermal sensing. Upon excitation at 808 nm, the intensity ratio of two emissions at identical wavelength (1057 nm) from QDs and NCs, respectively, is defined as the thermometric parameter R . By employing another 830 nm laser beam following the same optical path as 808 nm laser to exclusively excite QDs, the two overlapping emissions can be easily decoded. The acquired R proves to be inert to the detection depth in tissue, with a minimized temperature reading error of ≈2.3 °C at 35 °C (at a depth of ≈1.1 mm), while the traditional thermometry mode based on the nonoverlapping 1025 and 863 nm emissions may exhibit a large error of ≈43.0 °C.

Here, a landscape-switching model is developed to explore the microscopic chromosomal structural origin of embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming. It is shown that chromosome structure exhibits significant compartment-switching in the unit of topologically associating domain. It is found that the chromosome during differentiation undergoes monotonic compaction with spatial repositioning of active and inactive chromosomal loci toward the chromosome surface and interior, respectively. In contrast, an overexpanded chromosome, which exhibits universal localization of loci at the chromosomal surface with erasing the structural characteristics formed in the somatic cells, is observed during reprogramming. An early distinct differentiation pathway from the ESC to the terminally differentiated cell, giving rise to early bifurcation on the Waddington landscape for the ESC differentiation is suggested. The theoretical model herein including the non-equilibrium effects, draws a picture of the highly irreversible cell differentiation and reprogramming processes, in line with the experiments. The predictions provide a physical understanding of cell differentiation and reprogramming from the chromosomal structural and dynamical perspective and can be tested by future experiments.},

However, the best solar cells provide limited power, compared to conventional power sources, making their use for aerial vehicles difficult to realize, especially in rotorcraft where significant lift ordinarily generated by a wing is already sacrificed for the ability to hover. In recent years, advances in materials (use of carbon-fiber components, improvement in specific solar cells and motors) have finally brought solar rotorcraft within reach. Here, the application is explored through a concise mathematical model of solar rotorcraft based on the limits of solar power generation and motor power consumption. Multiple solar quadcopters based on this model with majority solar power are described. One of them has achieved an outdoor airtime over 3 hours, 48 times longer than it can last on just battery alone with the solar cells carried as dead weight and representing a significant prolongation of drone operation. Solar-power fluctuations during long flight and their interaction with power requirements are experimentally characterized. The general conclusion is that solar cells have reached high enough efficiencies and can outperform batteries under the right conditions for quadcopters.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchy in natural and synthetic materials has been shown to grant these architected materials properties unattainable independently by their constituent materials. While exceptional mechanical properties such as extreme resilience and high deformability have been realized in many human-made three-dimensional (3D) architected materials using beam-and-junction-based architectures, stress concentrations and constraints induced by the junctions limit their mechanical performance. A new hierarchical architecture in which fibers are interwoven to construct effective beams is presented. In situ tension and compression experiments of additively manufactured woven and monolithic lattices with 30 µm unit cells demonstrate the superior ability of woven architectures to achieve high tensile and compressive strains (&gt;50%)—without failure events—via smooth reconfiguration of woven microfibers in the effective beams and junctions. Cyclic compression experiments reveal that woven lattices accrue less damage compared to lattices with monolithic beams. Numerical studies of woven beams with varying geometric parameters present new design spaces to develop architected materials with tailored compliance that is unachievable by similarly configured monolithic-beam architectures. Woven hierarchical design offers a pathway to make traditionally stiff and brittle materials more deformable and introduces a new building block for 3D architected materials with complex nonlinear mechanics.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneous on-chip sensing of multiple greenhouse gases in a complex gas environment is highly desirable in industry, agriculture, and meteorology, but remains challenging due to their ultralow concentrations and mutual interference. Porous microstructure and extremely high surface areas in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) provide both excellent adsorption selectivity and high gases affinity for multigas sensing. Herein, it is described that integrating MOFs into a multiresonant surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) platform can overcome the shortcomings of poor selectivity in multigas sensing and enable simultaneous on-chip sensing of greenhouse gases with ultralow concentrations. The strategy leverages the near-field intensity enhancement (over 1500-fold) of multiresonant SEIRA technique and the outstanding gas selectivity and affinity of MOFs. It is experimentally demonstrated that the MOF–SEIRA platform achieves simultaneous on-chip sensing of CO 2 and CH 4 with fast response time (&lt;60 s), high accuracy (CO 2 : 1.1%, CH 4 : 0.4%), small footprint (100 × 100 µm 2 ), and excellent linearity in wide concentration range (0–2.5 × 10 4 ppm). Additionally, the excellent scalability to detect more gases is explored. This work opens up exciting possibilities for the implementation of all-in-one, real-time, and on-chip multigas detection as well as provides a valuable toolkit for greenhouse gas sensing applications.},

Here, two-level micropillar arrays with nanocavities on top are discovered on the toe pads of a tree frog, and they exhibit strong boundary friction ≈20 times higher than dry and wet friction without the need of a special external or preloaded normal force. Microscale in situ observations show that the specific micro–nano hierarchical pillars in turn trigger three-level liquid adjusting phenomena, including two-level liquid self-splitting and liquid self-sucking effects. Under these effects, uniform nanometer-thick liquid bridges form spontaneously on all pillars to generate strong boundary friction, which can be ≈2 times higher than for single-level pillar surfaces and ≈3.5 times higher than for smooth surfaces. Finally, theoretical models of boundary friction in terms of self-splitting and self-sucking are built to reveal the importance of liquid behavior induced by micro–nano hierarchical structure.},

A droplet microfluidic technique to deposit a defined amount of 3D hydrogel matrices around single cells independently of material composition, elasticity, and stress relaxation times is developed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) undergo isotropic volume expansion more rapidly in thinner gels that present an Arg-Gly-Asp integrin ligand. Mathematical modeling and experiments show that MSCs experience higher membrane tension as they expand in thinner gels. Furthermore, thinner gels facilitate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. By modulating ion channels, it is shown that isotropic volume expansion of single cells predicts intracellular tension and stem cell fate. The results suggest the utility of precise microscale gel deposition to control single cell functions.},

  abstract     = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) or its reverse process mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) occurs in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, whether an entire EMT–MET process exists and the potential function during human hematopoiesis remain largely elusive. Utilizing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based systems, it is discovered that while EMT occurs at the onset of human hematopoietic differentiation, MET is not detected subsequently during differentiation. Instead, a biphasic activation of mesenchymal genes during hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs is observed. The expression of mesenchymal genes is upregulated during the fate switch from pluripotency to the mesoderm, sustained at the hemogenic endothelium (HE) stage, and attenuated during hemogenic endothelial cell (HEP) differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). A similar expression pattern of mesenchymal genes is also observed during human and murine hematopoietic development in vivo. Wnt signaling and its downstream gene SNAI1 mediate the up-regulation of mesenchymal genes and initiation of mesoderm induction from pluripotency. Inhibition of transforming growth factor- β (TGF- β ) signaling and downregulation of HAND1, a downstream gene of TGF- β , are required for the downregulation of mesenchymal genes and the capacity of HEPs to generate HPCs. These results suggest that the biphasic regulation of mesenchymal genes is an essential mechanism during human hematopoiesis.},

In this work, inspired by some natural models, such as lotus leaf, springtail skin, and filefish skin, switchable repellency for liquids ( γ = 12.0–72.8 mN m −1 ) in both air and liquid is realized via employing 3D deformable multiply re-entrant microstructures. Herein, the microstructures are fabricated by a two-photon polymerization based 3D printing technique and the reversible deformation is elaborately tuned by evaporation-induced bending and immersion-induced fast recovery (within 30 s). Based on 3D controlled microstructural architectures, this work offers an insightful explanation of repellency/penetration behavior at any three-phase interface and starts some novel ideas for manipulating opposite repellency by designing/fabricating stimuli-responsive microstructures.},

The M13 bacteriophage-added perovskite films show a larger grain size and reduced trap-sites compared with the reference perovskite films.

The denatured M13 bacteriophage-added perovskite solar cells exhibit an efficiency of 20.1% while the reference devices give an efficiency of 17.8%.

  abstract     = {Forkhead-Box Class O 4 (FOXO4) is involved in critical biological functions, but its response to EGF-PKB/Akt signal regulation is not well characterized. Here, it is reported that FOXO4 levels are downregulated in response to EGF treatment, with concurrent elevation of COP9 Signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) and E3 ubiquitin ligase constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (COP1) levels. Mechanistic studies show that CSN6 binds and regulates FOXO4 stability through enhancing the E3 ligase activity of COP1, and that COP1 directly interacts with FOXO4 through a VP motif on FOXO4 and accelerates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of FOXO4. Metabolomic studies demonstrate that CSN6 expression leads to serine and glycine production. It is shown that FOXO4 directly binds and suppresses the promoters of serine-glycine-one-carbon (SGOC) pathway genes, thereby diminishing SGOC metabolism. Evidence shows that CSN6 can regulate FOXO4-mediated SGOC gene expression. Thus, these data suggest a link of CSN6-FOXO4 axis and ser/gly metabolism. Further, it is shown that CSN6-COP1-FOXO4 axis is deregulated in cancer and that the protein expression levels of CSN6 and FOXO4 can serve as prognostic markers for cancers. The results illustrate a pathway regulation of FOXO4-mediated serine/glycine metabolism through the function of CSN6-COP1 axis. Insights into this pathway may be strategically designed for therapeutic intervention in cancers.},

  abstract     = {While the capsaicin receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a polymodal nociceptor for heat, capsaicin, and protons, the channel&#39;s responses to each of these stimuli are profoundly regulated by membrane potential, damping or even prohibiting its response at negative voltages and amplifying its response at positive voltages. Therefore, voltage sensitivity of TRPV1 is anticipated to play an important role in shaping pain responses. How voltage regulates TRPV1 activation remains unknown. Here, it is shown that voltage sensitivity does not originate from the S4 segment like classic voltage-gated ion channels; instead, outer pore acidic residues directly partake in voltage-sensitive activation, with their negative charges collectively constituting the observed gating charges. Outer pore gating-charge movement is titratable by extracellular pH and is allosterically coupled to channel activation, likely by influencing the upper gate in the ion selectivity filter. Elucidating this unorthodox voltage-gating process provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding TRPV1 polymodal gating and opens the door to novel approaches regulating channel activity for pain management.},

  abstract     = {Metallic implants are frequently used in medicine to support and replace degenerated tissues. Implant loosening due to particle exposure remains a major cause for revision arthroplasty. The exact role of metal debris in sterile peri-implant inflammation is controversial, as it remains unclear whether and how metals chemically alter and potentially accumulate behind an insulating peri-implant membrane, in the adjacent bone and bone marrow (BM). An intensively focused and bright synchrotron X-ray beam allows for spatially resolving the multi-elemental composition of peri-implant tissues from patients undergoing revision surgery. In peri-implant BM, particulate cobalt (Co) is exclusively co-localized with chromium (Cr), non-particulate Cr accumulates in the BM matrix. Particles consisting of Co and Cr contain less Co than bulk alloy, which indicates a pronounced dissolution capacity. Particulate titanium (Ti) is abundant in the BM and analyzed Ti nanoparticles predominantly consist of titanium dioxide in the anatase crystal phase. Co and Cr but not Ti integrate into peri-implant bone trabeculae. The characteristic of Cr to accumulate in the intertrabecular matrix and trabecular bone is reproducible in a human 3D in vitro model. This study illustrates the importance of updating the view on long-term consequences of biomaterial usage and reveals toxicokinetics within highly sensitive organs.},

  abstract     = {Repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for genome integrity, and is accompanied by transcriptional repression at the DSB regions. However, the mechanisms how DNA repair induces transcriptional inhibition remain elusive. Here, it is identified that BRD7 participates in DNA damage response (DDR) and is recruited to the damaged chromatin via ATM signaling. Mechanistically, BRD7 joins the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complex at the damaged DNA and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 to the DSBs. Furthermore, ATM-mediated BRD7 phosphorylation is required for recruitment of the PRC2 complex, NuRD complex, DSB sensor complex MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN), and RNF168 to the active transcription sites at DSBs, resulting in transcriptional repression and DNA repair. Moreover, BRD7 deficiency sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibition. Collectively, BRD7 is crucial for DNA repair and DDR-mediated transcription repression, which may serve as a therapeutic target. The findings identify the missing link between DNA repair and transcription regulation that maintains genome integrity.},

  abstract     = {The rational design of previously unidentified materials that could realize excellent electrochemical-controlled optical and charge storage properties simultaneously, are especially desirable and useful for fabricating smart multifunctional devices. Here, a facile synthesis of a 1D π –d conjugated coordination polymer (Ni-BTA) is reported, consisting of metal (Ni)-containing nodes and organic linkers (1,2,4,5-benzenetetramine), which could be easily grown on various substrates via a scalable chemical bath deposition method. The resulting Ni-BTA film exhibits superior performances for both electrochromic and energy storage functions, such as large optical modulation (61.3%), high coloration efficiency (223.6 cm 2 C −1 ), and high gravimetric capacity (168.1 mAh g −1 ). In particular, the Ni-BTA film can maintain its electrochemical recharge-ability and electrochromic properties even after 10 000 electrochemical cycles demonstrating excellent durability. Moreover, a smart energy storage indicator is demonstrated in which the energy storage states can be visually recognized in real time. The excellent electrochromic and charge storage performances of Ni-BTA films present a great promise for Ni-BTA nanowires to be used as practical electrode materials in various applications such as electrochromic devices, energy storage cells, and multifunctional smart windows.},

In a superconducting system, the strength of disorder is found to be associated with the vortex pinning energy, which is closely related to the quantum Griffiths singularity; however, a direct study to elucidate the role of vortex pinning energy on the quantum Griffiths singularity in 2DSC remains to be undertaken. Here, an artificial 2DSC system is designed by randomly depositing superconducting nanoislands on 2Delectron gas (2DEG). Quantum Griffiths singularity is present in a graphene/Pb-islands-array hybrid, where the superconducting behavior transits to weakly localized metallic behavior induced by the vertical magnetic field and exhibits critical behavior with a diverging dynamical critical exponent approaching zero temperature. Compared to the study of graphene/Sn-islands-array hybrid where the sharp QPT is observed, the vortex pinning energy acquired from the Arrhenius plot analysis is greater in graphene/Pb-islands-array hybrid, which may contribute to the presence of the quantum Griffiths singularity. This work may provide a comprehensive interpretation of the QPT in 2DSC.},

  abstract     = {Identification of a low-potential decomposition pathway for lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ) in nonaqueous lithium–oxygen (Li–O 2 ) battery is urgently needed to ameliorate its poor energy efficiency. In this study, experimental data and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the recharge overpotential ( η RC ) of Li–O 2 battery is fundamentally dependent on the Li 2 O 2 crystallization pathway which is intrinsically related to the microscopic structural properties of the growing crystals during discharge. The Li 2 O 2 grown by concurrent surface reduction and chemical disproportionation seems to form two discrete phases that have been deconvoluted and the amount of Li 2 O 2 deposited by these two routes is quantitatively estimated. Systematic analyses have demonstrated that, regardless of the bulk morphology, solution-grown Li 2 O 2 shows higher η RC (&gt;1 V) which can be attributed to higher structural order in the crystal compared to the surface-grown Li 2 O 2 . Presumably due to a cohesive interaction between the electrode surface and growing crystals, the surface-grown Li 2 O 2 seems to possess microscopic structural disorder that facilitates a delithiation induced partial solution-phase oxidation at lower η RC (&lt;0.5 V). This difference in η RC for differently grown Li 2 O 2 provides crucial insights into necessary control over Li 2 O 2 crystallization pathways to improve the energy efficiency of a Li–O 2 battery.},

Early detection of melanoma has been hampered due to the lack of promising markers for testing. Recent advances in liquid biopsy have proposed noninvasive alternatives for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cancer-exosomes are gaining influence as promising biomarkers because of their cancer-associated molecular markers and signatures. However, technologies that offer the dual-isolation of CTCs and exosomes using a single sample have not been thoroughly developed. The dual-utilization OncoBean (DUO) device is conjugated with melanoma specific antibodies, MCAM and MCSP, enabling simultaneous CTC and exosome isolations. Using blood samples from patients, CTCs and exosomes are specifically isolated from a single sample and then undergo molecular profiling for comprehensive study. Melanoma patients have 0–17CTCs mL −1 and 299 µg exosomal protein mL −1 while healthy donors display fewer than 2CTCs and 75.6 µg of exosomes mL −1 , respectively. It is also demonstrated that both markers express melanoma-associated genes using multiplex qRT-PCR to test for expression pattern of a 96 gene panel. The dual isolation and molecular characterization will allow for further research into melanoma to identify viable markers for disease progression and treatment efficacy.},

In this study, transparent sapphire-substrate-based radiative coolers comprising a simple structure and selective emitter-like optical characteristics are proposed. Utilizing the intrinsic optical properties of the sapphire substrate and adopting additional IR emissive layers, such as those composed of silicon nitride thin film or aluminum oxide nanoparticles, high-performance radiative coolers can be fabricated with a low mean absorptivity (3–4%) at 0.3–2.5 µm and a high mean emissivity of over 90% at 8–13 µm. Experiments show that the fabricated radiative coolers reach temperature drops of ≈10 °C in the daytime. From the theoretical calculations of radiative cooling performance, the sapphire-substrate-based radiative coolers demonstrate a net cooling power as high as 100 Wm −2 .},

The addition of Ti 3 C 2 makes more balanced charge carrier transport in LEDs by changing the energy level structure and electron mobility of ETL. Moreover, lower surface roughness is obtained for the ETL, thus guaranteeing uniform distribution of the perovskite NCs layer and further reducing leakage current.

However, repetitive photolithography processes in the fabrication of on-chip electronic components including various photoresists, masks, and toxic etchants are often not well-suited for industrial production. Here, a cost-effective stamping strategy is developed for scalable and rapid preparation of graphene-based planar MSCs. Combining stamps with desired shapes and highly conductive graphene inks, flexible MSCs with controlled structures are prepared on arbitrary substrates without any metal current collectors, additives, and polymer binders. The interdigitated MSC exhibits high areal capacitance up to 21.7 mF cm −2 at a current of 0.5 mA and a high power density of 6 mW cm −2 at an energy density of 5 µWh cm −2 . Moreover, the MSCs show outstanding cycling performance and remarkable flexibility over 10 000 charge–discharge cycles and 300 bending cycles. In addition, the capacitance and output voltage of the MSCs are easily adjustable through interconnection with well-defined arrangements.

  abstract     = {Acetone is a toxic air pollutant and a key breath marker for non-invasively monitoring fat metabolism. Its routine detection in realistic gas mixtures (i.e., human breath and indoor air), however, is challenging, as low-cost acetone sensors suffer from insufficient selectivity. Here, a compact detector for acetone sensing is introduced, having unprecedented selectivity (&gt;250) over the most challenging interferants (e.g., alcohols, aldehydes, aromatics, isoprene, ammonia, H 2 , and CO). That way, acetone is quantified with fast response (&lt;1 min) down to, at least, 50 parts per billion (ppb) in gas mixtures with such interferants having up to two orders of magnitude higher concentration than acetone at realistic relative humidities (RH = 30–90%). The detector consists of a catalytic packed bed (30 mg) of flame-made Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (120 m 2 g −1 ) decorated with Pt nanoclusters (average size 9 nm) and a highly sensitive chemo-resistive sensor made by flame aerosol deposition and in situ annealing of nanostructured Si-doped ε -WO 3 (Si/WO 3 ). Most importantly, the catalytic packed bed converts interferants continuously enabling highly selective acetone sensing even in the exhaled breath of a volunteer. The detector exhibits stable performance over, at least, 145 days at 90% RH, as validated by mass spectrometry.},

  abstract     = {Exercise-induced fatigue and exhaustion are interesting areas for many researchers. Muscle glycogen is critical for physical performance. However, how glycogen metabolism is manipulated during exercise is not very clear. The aim here is to assess the impact of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) on skeletal muscle glycogen and subsequent regulation of exercise capacity. Skeletal muscle-specific IRF4 knockout mice show normal body weight and insulin sensitivity, but better exercise capacity and increased glycogen content with unaltered triglyceride levels compared to control mice on chow diet. In contrast, mice overexpression of IRF4 displays decreased exercise capacity and lower glycogen content. Mechanistically, IRF4 regulates glycogen-associated regulatory subunit protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) to manipulate glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle. Knockdown of PTG can reverse the effects imposed by the absence of IRF4 in vivo. These studies reveal a regulatory pathway including IRF4/PTG/glycogen synthesis on controlling exercise capacity.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium (Mg) alloys are good candidates for applications with requirement of energy saving, taking advantage of their low density. However, the fewer slip systems of the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) structure restrict ductility of Mg alloys. Here, a hybrid nanostructure concept is presented by combining nano-dual-phase metallic glass (NDP-MG) and gradient nanograin structure in Mg alloys to achieve a higher yield strength (230 MPa, 31% improvement compared with the reference base alloy) and larger ductility (20%, threefold higher than the SMAT-H sample), which breaks the strength–ductility trade-off dilemma. This hybrid nanostructure is realized by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) on the surface of a crystalline Mg alloy, and followed by physical vapor deposition of a Mg-based NDP-MG. The higher strength is provided by the nanograin layer generated by SMAT. The larger ductility is a synergistic effect of multiple shear bandings and nanocrystallization of the NDP-MG, inhibition of crack propagation from the SMATed nanograined structure by the NDP-MG, and strain-induced grain growth in the SMATed nanograin layer. This hybrid nanostructure design provides a general route to render brittle alloys stronger and ductile, especially in hcp systems.},

  abstract     = {Heterojunction structures using 2D materials are promising building blocks for electronic and optoelectronic devices. The limitations of conventional silicon photodetectors and energy devices are able to be overcome by exploiting quantum tunneling and adjusting charge balance in 2D p–n and n–n junctions. Enhanced photoresponsivity in 2D heterojunction devices can be obtained with WSe 2 and BP as p-type semiconductors and MoS 2 and WS 2 as n-type semiconductors. In this study, the relationship between photocurrent and the charge balance of electrons and holes in van der Waals heterojunctions is investigated. To observe this phenomenon, a p-WSe 2 /n-WS 2 /n-MoS 2 heterojunction device with both p–n and n–n junctions is fabricated. The device can modulate the charge carrier balance between heterojunction layers to generate photocurrent upon illumination by selectively applying electrostatic doping to a specific layer. Using photocurrent mapping, the operating transition zones for the device is demonstrated, allowing to accurately identify the locations where photocurrent generates. Finally, the origins of flicker and shot noise at the different semiconductor interfaces are analyzed to understand their effect on the photoresponsivity and detectivity of unit active area (2.5 µm 2 , λ = 405 nm) in the p-WSe 2 /n-WS 2 /n-MoS 2 heterojunction device.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular particles (EPs) including extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exomeres play significant roles in diseases and therapeutic applications. However, their spatiotemporal dynamics in vivo have remained largely unresolved in detail due to the lack of a suitable method. Therefore, a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based reporter, PalmGRET, is created to enable pan-EP labeling ranging from exomeres (&lt;50 nm) to small (&lt;200 nm) and medium and large (&gt;200 nm) EVs. PalmGRET emits robust, sustained signals and allows the visualization, tracking, and quantification of the EPs from whole animal to nanoscopic resolutions under different imaging modalities, including bioluminescence, BRET, and fluorescence. Using PalmGRET, it is shown that EPs released by lung metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibit lung tropism with varying distributions to other major organs in immunocompetent mice. It is further demonstrated that gene knockdown of lung-tropic membrane proteins, solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2A1, alanine aminopeptidase/Cd13, and chloride intracellular channel 1 decreases HCC-EP distribution to the lungs and yields distinct biodistribution profiles. It is anticipated that EP-specific imaging, quantitative assays, and detailed in vivo characterization are a starting point for more accurate and comprehensive in vivo models of EP biology and therapeutic design.},

These treatments currently do not have reliable predictors of efficacy and may lead to side effects. The future development of additional immunotherapy options and the prediction of patient-specific response to treatment require advanced screening platforms associated with accurate and rapid data interpretation. Advanced engineering approaches ranging from sequencing and gene editing, to tumor organoids engineering, bioprinted tissues, and organs-on-a-chip systems facilitate the screening of cancer immunotherapies by recreating the intrinsic and extrinsic features of a tumor and its microenvironment. High-throughput platform development and progress in artificial intelligence can also improve the efficiency and accuracy of screening methods.

The application of external excitation, such as magnetic fields and spatial–temporal modulation, has been employed to achieve nonreciprocal responses. Alternatively, nonlinear effects may also be employed to break reciprocity in a completely passive fashion. Herein, a coupled system comprised of linear and nonlinear meta-atoms that achieves nonreciprocity based on the coupling and frequency detuning of its constituent meta-atoms is presented. An analytical model is developed based on the coupled mode theory (CMT) in order to design and optimize the nonreciprocal meta-atoms in this coupled system. Experimental demonstration of an RF isolator is performed, and the contrast between forward and backward propagation approximates 20 dB. Importantly, the use of the CMT model developed herein enables a generalizable capacity to predict the limitations of nonlinearity-based nonreciprocity, thereby facilitating the development of novel approaches to breaking Lorentz reciprocity. The CMT model and implementation scheme presented in this work may be deployed in a wide range of applications, including integrated photonic circuits, optical metamaterials, and metasurfaces, among others.},

To provide an applicable method to remove m 6 A modification at specific loci, an m 6 A editing system called “ t argeted R N A de methylation by S unTag system (TRADES)” is engineered. In this system, the targeting element dCas13b is fused to ten copies of GCN4 peptides which can recruit multiple scFv-fusion RNA demethylase to demethylate the target m 6 A site. Owing to this design, TRADES is more flexible to the indistinct m 6 A sites for its wide editing window. By site-specific demethylation of messenger RNA (mRNA) SON A2699, the lifetime of SON RNA is successfully prolonged in HeLa cells. Meanwhile, TRADES negligibly influences the lifetime of other non-targeted transcripts. TRADES also can regulate the gene expression of target transcript in an m 6 A-dependent manner. Moreover, the interference occuring for HBV and HIV replications demonstrates that the TRADES system holds potential in viral life cycle regulation and clinical applications.},

In this work, inspired by the physical mechanism of mass transport in channel proteins and the chemical mechanism of mass transport in carrier proteins, recent progress in channel-based and carrier-based membranes toward olefin/paraffin separations is summarized. Further, channel-based membranes are categorized into membranes with network structures and with framework structures according to the morphology of channels. The separation mechanisms, separation performance, and membrane stability in channel-based and carrier-based membranes are elaborated. Future perspectives toward membrane-based olefin/paraffin separation are proposed.},

  abstract     = {Implantation of stem cells for tissue regeneration faces significant challenges such as immune rejection and teratoma formation. Cell-free tissue regeneration thus has a potential to avoid these problems. Stem cell derived exosomes do not cause immune rejection or generate malignant tumors. Here, exosomes that can induce osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are identified and used to decorate 3D-printed titanium alloy scaffolds to achieve cell-free bone regeneration. Specifically, the exosomes secreted by hMSCs osteogenically pre-differentiated for different times are used to induce the osteogenesis of hMSCs. It is discovered that pre-differentiation for 10 and 15 days leads to the production of osteogenic exosomes. The purified exosomes are then loaded into the scaffolds. It is found that the cell-free exosome-coated scaffolds regenerate bone tissue as efficiently as hMSC-seeded exosome-free scaffolds within 12 weeks. RNA-sequencing suggests that the osteogenic exosomes induce the osteogenic differentiation by using their cargos, including upregulated osteogenic miRNAs (Hsa-miR-146a-5p, Hsa-miR-503-5p, Hsa-miR-483-3p, and Hsa-miR-129-5p) or downregulated anti-osteogenic miRNAs (Hsa-miR-32-5p, Hsa-miR-133a-3p, and Hsa-miR-204-5p), to activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Consequently, identification of osteogenic exosomes secreted by pre-differentiated stem cells and the use of them to replace stem cells represent a novel cell-free bone regeneration strategy.},

  abstract     = {Predicting protein structure from the amino acid sequence has been a challenge with theoretical and practical significance in biophysics. Despite the recent progresses elicited by improved inter-residue contact prediction, contact-based structure prediction has gradually reached the performance ceiling. New methods have been proposed to predict the inter-residue distance, but unanimously by simplifying the real-valued distance prediction into a multiclass classification problem. Here, a lightweight regression-based distance prediction method is shown, which adopts the generative adversarial network to capture the delicate geometric relationship between residue pairs and thus could predict the continuous, real-valued inter-residue distance rapidly and satisfactorily. The predicted residue distance map allows quick structure modeling by the CNS suite, and the constructed models approach the same level of quality as the other state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods when tested on CASP13 targets. Moreover, this method can be used directly for the structure prediction of membrane proteins without transfer learning.},

One major challenge for polymer solid-state batteries is the relatively high operating temperature (60–80 °C), which means operating such batteries will require significant ramp up time due to heating. On the other hand, as polymer electrolytes are poor thermal conductors, thermal variation across the polymer electrolyte can lead to nonuniformity in ionic conductivity. This can be highly detrimental to lithium deposition and may result in dendrite formation. Here, a polyethylene oxide-based electrolyte with improved thermal responses is developed by incorporating 2D boron nitride (BN) nanoflakes. The results show that the BN additive also enhances ionic and mechanical properties of the electrolyte. More uniform Li stripping/deposition and reversible cathode reactions are achieved, which in turn enable all-solid-state lithium–sulfur cells with superior performances.},

  abstract     = {To undergo mitosis successfully, most animal cells need to acquire a round shape to provide space for the mitotic spindle. This mitotic rounding relies on mechanical deformation of surrounding tissue and is driven by forces emanating from actomyosin contractility. Cancer cells are able to maintain successful mitosis in mechanically challenging environments such as the increasingly crowded environment of a growing tumor, thus, suggesting an enhanced ability of mitotic rounding in cancer. Here, it is shown that the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a hallmark of cancer progression and metastasis, gives rise to cell-mechanical changes in breast epithelial cells. These changes are opposite in interphase and mitosis and correspond to an enhanced mitotic rounding strength. Furthermore, it is shown that cell-mechanical changes correlate with a strong EMT-induced change in the activity of Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1. Accordingly, it is found that Rac1 inhibition rescues the EMT-induced cortex-mechanical phenotype. The findings hint at a new role of EMT in successful mitotic rounding and division in mechanically confined environments such as a growing tumor.},

  abstract     = {Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) is a powerful technique that enables imaging of diverse specimens (e.g., biomaterials, chemical materials, nanomaterials) in a hydrated or native state while simultaneously maintaining micro-to-nanoscale resolution. However, it is difficult to achieve high signal-to-noise and artifact-free secondary electron images in a high-pressure gaseous environment due to the intensive electron-gas collisions. In addition, nanotextured substrates can mask the signal from a weakly scattering sample. These drawbacks limit the study of material dynamics under extreme conditions and correspondingly our understanding in many fields. In this work, an imaging framework called Quasi-Newtonian ESEM is proposed, which introduces the concepts of quasi-force and quasi-work by referencing the scattering force in light–matter interactions, to break these barriers without any hardware changes. It is shown that quasi-force is a more fundamental quantity that has a more significant connection with the sample morphology than intensity in the strongly scattering regime. Experimental and theoretical studies on the dynamics of droplet condensation in a high-pressure environment (up to 2500 Pa) successfully demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the framework and that the overwhelmed signal of interest in ESEM images can be reconstructed through information stored in the time domain, i.e., frames captured at different moments.},

However, sufficient scalability, semiconducting compatibility, and robust flexibility of the ferroelectric memories remain great challenges, e.g., owing to Pb-containing materials, oxide electrode, and limited thermal stability. Here, high-performance flexible nonvolatile memories based on ferroelectric Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 (HZO) via quasi-van der Waals heteroepitaxy are reported. The flexible ferroelectric HZO exhibits not only high remanent polarization up to 32.6 µC cm −2 without a wake-up effect during cycling, but also remarkably robust mechanical properties, degradation-free retention, and endurance performance under a series of bent deformations and cycling tests. Intriguingly, using HZO as a gate, flexible ferroelectric thin-film transistors with a low operating voltage of ±3 V, high on/off ratio of 6.5  ×  10 5 , and a small subthreshold slope of about 100 mV dec −1 , which outperform reported flexible ferroelectric transistors, are demonstrated. The results make ferroelectric HZO a promising candidate for the next-generation of wearable, low-power, and nonvolatile memories with manufacturability and scalability.},

Herein, short-term temperature sensitivity of SOC decomposition (expressed as Q 10 ) from six depths within the top 1 m soil from 90 upland forest sites (540 soil samples) across China is reported. Results show that Q 10 significantly increases with soil depth, suggesting that deep SOC is more vulnerable to loss with rising temperature in comparison to shallow SOC. Climate is the primary regulator of shallow soil Q 10 but its relative influence declines with depth; in contrast, soil C quality has a minor influence on Q 10 in shallow soil but increases its influence with depth. When considering the depth-dependent Q 10 variations, results further show that using the thermal response of shallow soil layer for the whole soil profile, as is usually done in model predictions, would significantly underestimate soil C-climate feedbacks. The results highlight that Earth system models need to consider multilayer soil C dynamics and their controls to improve prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The gap in understanding how underlying chemical dynamics impact the functionality of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) leads to the controversy about the origin of many phenomena associated with ion migration in MHPs. In particular, the debate regarding the impact of ion migration on current–voltage ( I – V ) hysteresis of MHPs devices has lasted for many years, where the difficulty lies in directly uncovering the chemical dynamics, as well as identifying and separating the impact of specific ions. In this work, using a newly developed time-resolved time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry CH 3 NH 3 + and I − migrations in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 are directly observed, revealing hysteretic CH 3 NH 3 + and I − migrations. Additionally, hysteretic CH 3 NH 3 + migration is illumination-dependent. Correlating these results with the I – V characterization, this work uncovers that CH 3 NH 3 + redistribution can induce a remanent field leading to a spontaneous current in the device. It unveils that the CH 3 NH 3 + migration is responsible for the illumination-associated I – V hysteresis in MHPs. Hysteretic ion migration has not been uncovered and the contribution of any ions (e.g., CH 3 NH 3 + ) has not been specified before. Such insightful and detailed information has up to now been missing, which is critical to improving MHPs photovoltaic performance and developing MHPs-based memristors and synaptic devices.},

Fundamentally, delivery mode has enormous impacts on the immunomodulatory effects, altering the spatiotemporal distribution of nanovaccine residence and dendritic cell–T cell interaction in lymph nodes, and finally affecting subsequent T cell-mediated immune performance. As a result, the gel-confined delivery mode offers the best therapeutic performance in multiple tumor models. When extending evaluation to examine how the various delivery modes impact the performance of liposome-based nanovaccines, similar trends in intralymph node distribution and antitumor effect are observed. This work provides a strong empirical foundation that nanovaccine researchers should position delivery mode near the top of their considerations for the experimental design, which should speed up nanovaccine development and facilitate efficient selection of appropriate delivery modes in the clinic.},

However, the heritability of a substantial proportion of cancers remains unexplained, which may result from rare deleterious mutations hidden in a myriad of nonsense genetic variations. This poses a great challenge to the understanding of the pathology and thus the rational design of effective treatments for affected patients. Here, whole genome sequencing is employed in a representative case in which one monozygotic twin is discordant for lung inflammatory myofibroblastoma to disclose rare tumor-related mutations. A missense single nucleotide variation rs61955126 T&gt;C in the lysine methyltransferase SETD8 (accession: NM_020382, SETD8 C302R ) is exposed. It is shown that SETD8 is vital for genomic integrity by promoting faithful DNA replication, and its C302R mutation downregulates the p53/p21 pathway. Importantly, the SETD8 C302R mutation significantly increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to WEE1 inhibition. Given that WEE1 inhibitors have shown great promise for clinical approval, these results impart a potential therapeutic approach using WEE1 inhibitor for cancer patients carrying the same mutation, and indicate that genome sequencing and genetic functional studies can be integrated into individualized therapies.},

In this work, a double negative differential resistance (D-NDR) characteristic of a hybrid 2D vdW/organic tunneling device consisting of a hafnium disulfide/pentacene heterojunction and a 3D pentacene resistor is reported. This D-NDR phenomenon is achieved by precisely controlling an NDR peak voltage with the pentacene resistor and then integrating two distinct NDR devices in parallel. Then, the operation of a controllable-gain amplifier configured with the D-NDR device and an n-channel transistor is demonstrated using the Cadence Spectre simulation platform. The proposed D-NDR device technology based on a hybrid 2D vdW/organic heterostructure provides a scientific foundation for various circuit applications that require the NDR phenomenon.},

  abstract     = {Spoof surface plasmons (SSPs) play crucial roles in terahertz (THz) near-field photonics. However, both high-efficiency excitation and wavefront engineering of SSPs remain great challenges, which hinder their wide applications in practice. Here, a scheme is proposed to simultaneously achieve these two goals efficiently using a single ultracompact device. First, it is shown that a gradient meta-coupler constructed by high-efficiency Pancharatnam–Berry (PB) meta-atoms can convert circularly polarized (CP) THz beams into SSPs with absolute efficiency up to 60%. Encoding a parabolic phase profile into the meta-coupler based on the PB mechanism, it is demonstrated that the device can covert CP beams into SSPs with focusing or defocusing wavefronts, dictated by the chirality of the incident wave. Finally, two distinct chirality-dependent phase distributions are encoded into the meta-coupler design by combining the PB and resonance phase mechanisms, and it is demonstrated that the resulting meta-device can achieve SSP excitations with chirality-delinked bifunctional wavefront engineering. THz near-field experiments are performed to characterize all three devices, in excellent agreement with full-wave simulations. The results pave the road to realize ultracompact devices integrating different functionalities on near-field manipulations, which can find many applications (e.g., optical sensing, imaging, on-chip photonics, etc.) in different frequency domains.},

  abstract     = {It has been reported that Cavin1 deficiency causes lipodystrophy in both humans and mice by affecting lipid metabolism. The ablation of Cavin1 in rodents also causes a significant deviation from Mendelian ratio at weaning in a background-dependent manner, suggesting the presence of undiscovered functions of Cavin1. In the current study, the results show that Cavin1 deficiency causes neonatal death in C57BL/6J mice by dampening the storage and mobilization of glycogen in the liver, which leads to lethal neonatal hypoglycemia. Further investigation by electron microscopy reveals that Cavin1 deficiency impairs the fenestration in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and impacts the permeability of endothelial barrier in the liver. Mechanistically, Cavin1 deficiency inhibits the RhoA-Rho-associated protein kinase 2-LIM domain kinase-Cofilin signaling pathway and suppresses the dynamics of the cytoskeleton, and eventually causes the reduction of fenestrae in LSECs. In addition, the defect of fenestration in LSECs caused by Cavin1 deficiency can be rescued by treatment with the F-actin depolymerization reagent latrunculin A. In summary, the current study reveals a novel function of Cavin1 on fenestrae formation in LSECs and liver glycogen metabolism, which provide an explanation for the neonatal death of Cavin1 null mice and a potential mechanism for metabolic disorders in patients with Cavin1 mutation.},

Despite recent development in affinity-based CTCs isolation, it remains challenging to achieve efficient capture toward CTCs with dynamic surface expression. Enlightened by the synergistic effect insideimmune synapses, the development of a nanointerface engineered with topology-defined anisotropic aptamers programmed by DNA scaffold (DNA nanosynapse), for accurate CTCs isolation, is herein reported. As compared to isotropic aptamers, the DNA nanosynapse exhibits enhanced anchoring on the cell membrane with both high and low epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression. This nanointerface enables accurate capture toward CTCs of heterogeneous EpCAM, without dramatically proportional change inside the mixture of diverse phenotypes. By applying this nanoplatform, CTCs detection as well as downstream analysis for measuring disease status can be achieved in clinical samples from breast cancer patients.},

  abstract     = {Mounting evidence is revealing that heavy metals can incur disordered bone homeostasis, leading to the development of degenerative bone diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disk disease, and osteomalacia. Meanwhile, heavy metal-induced anemia has been found to be intertwined with degenerative bone diseases. However, the relationship and interplay among these adverse outcomes remain elusive. Thus, it is of importance to shed light on the modes of action (MOAs) and adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) responsible for degenerative bone diseases and anemia under exposure to heavy metals. In the current Review, the epidemiological and experimental findings are recapitulated to interrogate the contributions of heavy metals to degenerative bone disease development which may be attributable dependently and independently to anemia. A few likely mechanisms are postulated for anemia-independent degenerative bone diseases, including dysregulated osteogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, imbalanced bone formation and resorption, and disturbed homeostasis of essential trace elements. By contrast, remodeled bone microarchitecture, inhibited erythropoietin production, and disordered iron homeostasis are speculated to account for anemia-associated degenerative bone disorders upon heavy metal exposure. Together, this Review aims to elaborate available literature to fill in the knowledge gaps in understanding the detrimental effects of heavy metals on bone cells and bone homeostasis through different perspectives.},

  abstract     = {Singularities in optics famously describe a broad range of intriguing phenomena, from vortices and caustics to field divergences near point charges. The diverging fields created by point charges are conventionally seen as a mathematical peculiarity that is neither needed nor related to the description of electromagnetic beams and pulses, and other effects in modern optics. This work disrupts this viewpoint by shifting point charges into the complex plane, and showing that their singularities then give rise to propagating, divergence-free wavepackets. Specifically, point charges moving in complex space-time trajectories are shown to map existing wavepackets to corresponding complex trajectories. Tailoring the complex trajectories in this “complex charge paradigm” leads to the discovery and design of new wavepacket families, as well as unprecedented electromagnetic phenomena, such as the combination of both nondiffracting behavior and abruptly-varying behavior in a single wavepacket. As an example, the abruptly focusing X-wave–a propagation-invariant X-wave-like wavepacket with prechosen self-disruptions that enhance its peak intensity by over 200 times–is presented. This work envisions a unified method that captures all existing wavepackets as corresponding complex trajectories, creating a new design tool in modern optics and paving the way to further discoveries of electromagnetic modes and waveshaping applications.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) remains the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, and no effective treatment is available yet. Metal-ion-triggered aggregates of amyloid-beta (A β ) peptide and acetylcholine imbalance are reported to be possible factors in AD pathogenesis. Thus, a combination therapy that can not only inhibit and reduce A β aggregation but also simultaneously regulate acetylcholine imbalance that can serve as a potential treatment for AD is needed. Here, clioquinol (metal-ion chelating agent) and donepezil (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor) co-encapsulated human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles (dcHGT NPs) are designed, which are modified with transcriptional activator protein (TAT) and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1). The GM1 lipid and TAT peptide endow this drug delivery nanosystem with high brain entry efficiency and long-term retention capabilities through intranasal administration. It is found that dcHGT NPs can significantly inhibit and eliminate A β aggregation, relieve acetylcholine-related inflammation in microglial cells, and protect primary neurons from A β oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. The alleviation of A β -related inflammation and AChE-inhibited effect further synergistically adjust acetylcholine imbalance. It is further demonstrated that dcHGT NPs reduce A β deposition, ameliorate neuron morphological changes, rescue memory deficits, and greatly improve acetylcholine regulation ability in vivo. This multifunctional synergetic nanosystem can be a new candidate to achieve highly efficient combination therapy for AD.},

  abstract     = {Morphological stability is crucially important for the long-term stability of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Many high-efficiency PSCs suffer from metastable morphology, resulting in severe device degradation. Here, a series of copolymers is developed by manipulating the content of chlorinated benzodithiophene-4,8-dione (T1-Cl) via a random copolymerization approach. It is found that all the copolymers can self-assemble into a fibril nanostructure in films. By altering the T1-Cl content, the polymer crystallinity and fibril width can be effectively controlled. When blended with several nonfullerene acceptors, such as TTPTT-4F, O-INIC3, EH-INIC3, and Y6, the optimized fibril interpenetrating morphology can not only favor charge transport, but also inhibit the unfavorable molecular diffusion and aggregation in active layers, leading to excellent morphological stability. The work demonstrates the importance of optimization of fibril network morphology in realizing high-efficiency and ambient-stable PSCs, and also provides new insights into the effect of chemical structure on the fibril network morphology and photovoltaic performance of PSCs.},

In this work, dropout neuronal units are developed based on stochastic volatile memristive devices of Ag/Ta 2 O 5 :Ag/Pt. The memristive neural network using the dropout neuronal units effectively solves the problem of overfitting and mitigates the negative effects of the nonideality of memristive synapses, eventually achieves a classification accuracy comparable to the theoretical limit. The stochastic and volatile switching performances of the Ag/Ta 2 O 5 :Ag/Pt device are attributed to the stochastical rupture of the Ag filament under high electrical stress in the Ta 2 O 5 layer, according to the TEM observation and the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, organoid technology has developed as a primary research tool in basic biological and clinical research. The reliance on poorly defined animal-derived extracellular matrix, however, severely limits its application in regenerative and translational medicine. Here, a well-defined, synthetic biomimetic matrix based on polyisocyanide (PIC) hydrogels that support efficient and reproducible formation of mammary gland organoids (MGOs) in vitro is presented. Only decorated with the adhesive peptide RGD for cell binding, PIC hydrogels allow MGO formation from mammary fragments or from purified single mammary epithelial cells. The cystic organoids maintain their capacity to branch for over two months, which is a fundamental and complex feature during mammary gland development. It is found that small variations in the 3D matrix give rise to large changes in the MGO: the ratio of the main cell types in the MGO is controlled by the cell–gel interactions via the cell binding peptide density, whereas gel stiffness controls colony formation efficiency, which is indicative of the progenitor density. Simple hydrogel modifications will allow for future introduction and customization of new biophysical and biochemical parameters, making the PIC platform an ideal matrix for in depth studies into organ development and for application in disease models.},

  abstract     = {Surfaces with tunable liquid adhesion have aroused great attention in past years. However, it remains challenging to endow a surface with the capability of droplet recognition and transportation. Here, a bioinspired surface, termed as TMAS, is presented that is inspired by isotropic lotus leaves and anisotropic butterfly wings. The surface is prepared by simply growing a triangular micropillar array on the pre-stretched thin poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) film. The regulation of mechanical stress in the PDMS film allows the fine tuning of structural parameters of the micropillar array reversibly, which results in the instantaneous, in situ switching between isotropic and various degrees of anisotropic droplet adhesions, and between strong adhesion and directional sliding of water droplets. TMAS can thus be used for robust droplet transportation and recognition of acids, bases, and their pH strengths. The results here could inspire the design of robust sensor techniques.},

This device reduces the errors faced by current technologies in approximating the dose profile in a patient&#39;s body, is sensitive for doses relevant to radiation treatment procedures, and robust when incorporated into conformal large-area electronics.

However, inherently accompanying the cross-polarized components, the copolarized output components have not been attempted in parallel in existing works. Here, a general method is proposed to construct phase-modulated metasurfaces for implementing functionalities separately in co- and cross-polarized output fields under circularly polarized (CP) incidence, which is impossible to achieve with solely a geometric phase. By introducing a propagation phase as an additional degree of freedom, the electromagnetic (EM) energy carried by co- and cross-polarized transmitted fields can be fully phase-modulated with independent wavefronts. Under one CP incidence, a metasurface for separate functionalities with controllable energy repartition is verified by simulations and proof-of-principle microwave experiments. A variety of applications can be readily expected in spin-selective optics, spin-Hall metasurfaces, and multitasked metasurfaces operating in both reflective and transmissive modes.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogels are excellent mimetics of mammalian extracellular matrices and have found widespread use in tissue engineering. Nanoporosity of monolithic bulk hydrogels, however, limits mass transport of key biomolecules. Microgels used in 3D bioprinting achieve both custom shape and vastly improved permissivity to an array of cell functions, however spherical-microbead-based bioinks are challenging to upscale, are inherently isotropic, and require secondary crosslinking. Here, bioinks based on high-aspect-ratio hydrogel microstrands are introduced to overcome these limitations. Pre-crosslinked, bulk hydrogels are deconstructed into microstrands by sizing through a grid with apertures of 40–100 µm. The microstrands are moldable and form a porous, entangled structure, stable in aqueous medium without further crosslinking. Entangled microstrands have rheological properties characteristic of excellent bioinks for extrusion bioprinting. Furthermore, individual microstrands align during extrusion and facilitate the alignment of myotubes. Cells can be placed either inside or outside the hydrogel phase with &gt;90% viability. Chondrocytes co-printed with the microstrands deposit abundant extracellular matrix, resulting in a modulus increase from 2.7 to 780.2 kPa after 6 weeks of culture. This powerful approach to deconstruct bulk hydrogels into advanced bioinks is both scalable and versatile, representing an important toolbox for 3D bioprinting of architected hydrogels.},

Herein, artificial synthetic internalizing receptors are engineered that function in mammalian cells in 2D and in 3D and afford targeted, specific intracellular drug delivery with nanomolar potency in the most challenging cell type, namely primary, donor-derived T cells. Receptor design comprises a lipid bilayer anchor for receptor integration into cell membrane and a small xenobiotic molecule as a recognition ligand. Artificial receptors are successfully targeted by the corresponding antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) and exhibit efficient cargo cell entry with ensuing intracellular effects. Receptor integration into cells is fast and robust and affords targeted cell entry in under 2 h. Through a combination of the receptor design and the use of ADC, combined benefits previously made available by chimeric artificial receptors (performance in T cells) and the chemical counterpart (robustness and simplicity) in a single functional platform is achieved. Artificial synthetic receptors are poised to facilitate the maturation of engineered cells as tools of biotechnology and biomedicine.},

These reprogrammed activities are now recognized as the hallmarks of cancer, which not only provide cancer cells with unrestricted proliferative and metastatic potentials, but also strengthen their resistance against stress conditions and therapeutic challenges. Although recent progress in nanomedicine has largely promoted the developments of various therapeutic modalities, such as photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, nanocatalytic therapy, tumor-starving/suffocating therapy, etc., the therapeutic efficacies of nanomedicines are still not high enough to achieve satisfactory tumor-suppressing effects. Therefore, researchers are obliged to look back to the essence of cancer cell biology, such as metabolism, for tailoring a proper therapeutic regimen. In this work, the characteristic metabolic pathways of cancer cells, such as aerobic respiration, glycolysis, autophagy, glutaminolysis, etc. are reviewed, to summarize the very recent advances in the smart design of nanomedicines that can regulate tumor metabolism for enhancing conventional therapeutic modalities. The underlying chemistry of these nanomedicines by which tumor metabolism is harnessed, is also discussed in a comprehensive manner. It is expected that by harnessing tumor metabolism cancer nanotherapeutics will be substantially improved in the future.},

Here, the synthesis of Mn 2+ /Yb 3+ codoped CsPbCl 3 NCs through a hot-injection technique is reported. The resulting NCs show a unique triple-wavelength emission covering ultraviolet/blue, visible, and near-infrared regions. By optimizing the dopant concentrations, the total photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of the codoped NCs can reach ≈125.3% due to quantum cutting effects. Mechanism studies reveal the efficient energy transfer processes from host NCs to Mn 2+ and Yb 3+ dopant ions, as well as a possible inter-dopant energy transfer from Mn 2+ to Yb 3+ ion centers. Owing to the high PL QYs and minimal reabsorption loss, the codoped perovskite NCs are demonstrated to be used as efficient emitters in luminescent solar concentrators, with greatly enhanced external optical efficiency compared to that of using solely Mn 2+ doped CsPbCl 3 NCs. This study presents a new model system for enriching doping chemistry studies and future applications of perovskite NCs.},

In this study, the aggregation and toxicity of amyloid beta (A β ), the pathogenic peptide associated with Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), seeded by FapC amyloid fragments (FapCS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that colonizes the gut microbiome through infections are examined. FapCS display favorable binding with A β and a catalytic capacity in seeding the peptide amyloidosis. Upon seeding, twisted A β fibrils assume a much-shortened periodicity approximating that of FapC fibrils, accompanied by a 37% sharp rise in the fibrillar diameter, compared with the control. The robust seeding capacity for A β by FapCS and the biofilm fragments derived from P. aeruginosa entail abnormal behavior pathology and immunohistology, as well as impaired cognitive function of zebrafish. Together, the data offer the first concrete evidence of structural integration and inheritance in peptide cross-seeding, a crucial knowledge gap in understanding the pathological correlations between different amyloid diseases. The catalytic role of infectious bacteria in promoting A β amyloidosis may be exploited as a potential therapeutic target, while the altered mesoscopic signatures of A β fibrils may serve as a prototype for molecular assembly and a biomarker for screening bacterial infections in AD.},

The conserved pyrabactin resistance/pyrabactin resistance-like/regulatory component of ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) perceives ABA and triggers a cascade of signaling events. A thorough knowledge of the sequential steps of ABA signaling will be necessary for the development of chemicals that control plant stress responses. The core components of the ABA signaling pathway have been identified with adequate characterization. The information available concerning ABA biosynthesis, transport, perception, and metabolism has enabled detailed functional studies on how the protective ability of ABA in plants might be modified to increase plant resistance to stress. Some of the significant contributions to chemical manipulation include ABA biosynthesis inhibitors, and ABA receptor agonists and antagonists. Chemical manipulation of key control points in ABA signaling is important for abiotic and biotic stress management in agriculture. However, a comprehensive review of the current knowledge of chemical manipulation of ABA signaling is lacking. Here, a thorough analysis of recent reports on small-molecule modulation of ABA signaling is provided.

  abstract     = {Acclimatable colors in response to environmental stimuli, which are naturally endowed with some living things, can provide an opportunity for humans to recognize hazardous substances without taking empirical risks. Despite efforts to create artificial responsive colors, realistic applications in everyday life require an immediate/distinct colorimetric realization with wide chromatic selectivity. A dynamically responsive virus (M-13 phage)-based changeable coloring strategy is presented with a highly lossy resonant promoter (HLRP). An ultrathin M-13 phage layer for rapid response to external stimuli displays colorimetric behavior, even in its subtle swelling with strong resonances on HLRP, which is modeled using the complex effective refractive index. Optimal designs of HLRP for several material combinations allow selective chromatic responsivity from the corresponding wide color palette without modification of the dynamic responsive layer. As a practical demonstration, the spatially designed colorimetric indicator, which is insensitive/sensitive to external stimuli, provides an intuitive perception of environmental changes with hidden/revealed patterns. Furthermore, the proposed colorimetric sensor is tested by exposure to various volatile organic chemicals and endocrine disrupting chemicals for versatile detectability, and is fabricated in a wafer-scale sample for large-area scalability.},

  abstract     = {Resistance to radiotherapy is frequently encountered in clinic, leading to poor prognosis of cancer patients. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the development of radioresistance due to their functions in regulating the expression of target genes at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Exploring key lncRNAs and elucidating the mechanisms contributing to radioresistance are crucial for the development of effective strategies to reverse radioresistance, which however remains challenging. Here, actin filament-associated protein 1 antisense RNA1 (lncAFAP1-AS1) is identified as a key factor in inducing radioresistance of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) via activating the Wnt/ β -catenin signaling pathway. Considering the generation of a high concentration of reduction agent glutathione (GSH) under radiation, a reduction-responsive nanoparticle (NP) platform is engineered for effective lncAFAP1-AS1 siRNA (siAFAP1-AS1) delivery. Systemic delivery of siAFAP1-AS1 with the reduction-responsive NPs can synergistically reverse radioresistance by silencing lncAFAP1-AS1 expression and scavenging intracellular GSH, leading to a dramatically enhanced radiotherapy effect in both xenograft and metastatic TNBC tumor models. The findings indicate that lncAFAP1-AS1 can be used to predict the outcome of TNBC radiotherapy and combination of systemic siAFAP1-AS1 delivery with radiotherapy can be applied for the treatment of recurrent TNBC patients.},

Herein, a pH-triggered charge and size dual switchable nanocage co-loaded with abemaciclib and IMD-0354 (PA/PI-ND) is reported, exhibiting a novel triple-interlocked combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy. The charge reversal polymer NGR-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly( l -lysine)-dimethylmaleic anhydride (NGR-PEG-PLL-DMA, ND) in PA/PI-ND promotes the pH-triggered charge reversal from negative to positive and size reduction from about 180 to 10 nm in an acidic tumor microenvironment, which greatly enhances cellular uptake and tumor tissue deep penetration. With the PA/PI-ND triple-interlocked combination therapy, the chemotherapeutic effect is enhanced by the action of abemaciclib to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, together with the reduction in cyclin D levels caused by IMD-0354. The dual anti-tumor promoting immunotherapy is achieved by abemaciclib selectively inhibiting the proliferation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and by IMD-0354 promoting tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) repolarization from an M2 to M1 phenotype. Furthermore, PA/PI-ND has improved anti-tumor efficiency resulting from the third synergistic effect provided by chemoimmunotherapy. Taken together, PA/PI-ND is a promising strategy to guide the design of future drug delivery carriers and cancer combination therapy.},

  abstract     = {Embryo transfer (ET) is a decisive step in the in vitro fertilization process. In most cases, the embryo is transferred to the uterus after several days of in vitro culture. Although studies have identified the beneficial effects of ET on proper embryo development in the earlier stages, this strategy is compromised by the necessity to transfer early embryos (zygotes) back to the fallopian tube instead of the uterus, which requires a more invasive, laparoscopic procedure, termed zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT). Magnetic micromotors offer the possibility to mitigate such surgical interventions, as they have the potential to transport and deliver cellular cargo such as zygotes through the uterus and fallopian tube noninvasively, actuated by an externally applied rotating magnetic field. This study presents the capture, transport, and release of bovine and murine zygotes using two types of magnetic micropropellers, helix and spiral. Although helices represent an established micromotor architecture, spirals surpass them in terms of motion performance and with their ability to reliably capture and secure the cargo during both motion and transfer between different environments. Herein, this is demonstrated with murine oocytes/zygotes as the cargo; this is the first step toward the application of noninvasive, magnetic micromotor-assisted ZIFT.},

Despite much progress in this regard, there still remains challenges in dynamic liquid droplet manipulation with fast response, no loss and anti-contamination. Herein, a strategy to achieve dynamic droplet manipulation and transportation on the electric field adaptive superhydrophobic elastomer surface is demonstrated. The superhydrophobic elastomer surface is fabricated by combining the micro/nanostructured clusters of hydrophobic TiO 2 nanoparticles with the elastomer film, on which the micro/nanostructure can be dynamically and reversibly tuned by electric field due to the electric field adaptive deformation of elastomer film. Accordingly, fast and reversible transition of wetting state between Cassie state and Wenzel state and tunable adhesion on the surface via electric field induced morphology transformation can be obtained. Moreover, the motion states of the surface droplets can be controlled dynamically and precisely, such as jumping and pinning, catching and releasing, and controllable liquid transfer without loss and contamination. Thus this work would open the avenue for dynamic liquid manipulation and transportation, and gear up the broad application prospects in liquid transfer, selective separation, anti-fog, anti-ice, microfluidics devices, etc.},

  abstract     = {Influenza poses a severe threat to global health. Despite the whole inactivated virus (WIV)-based nasal vaccine being a promising strategy for influenza protection, the mucosal barrier is still a bottleneck of the nasal vaccine. Here, a catalytic mucosal adjuvant strategy for an influenza WIV nasal vaccine based on chitosan (CS) functionalized iron oxide nanozyme (IONzyme) is developed. The results reveal that CS-IONzyme increases antigen adhesion to nasal mucosa by 30-fold compared to H1N1 WIV alone. Next, CS-IONzyme facilitates H1N1 WIV to enhance CCL20-driven submucosal dendritic cell (DC) recruitment and transepithelial dendrite(TED) formation for viral uptake via the toll-like receptor(TLR) 2/4-dependent pathway. Moreover, IONzyme with enhanced peroxidase (POD)-like activity by CS modification catalyzes a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent DC maturation, which further enhances the migration of H1N1 WIV-loaded DCs into the draining lymph nodes for antigen presentation. Finally, CS-IONzyme-based nasal vaccine triggers an 8.9-fold increase of IgA-mucosal adaptive immunity in mice, which provides a 100% protection against influenza, while only a 30% protection by H1N1 WIV alone. This work provides an antiviral alternative for designing nasal vaccines based on IONzyme to combat influenza infection.},

However, the severe volume change associated with the repeated lithiation and delithiation processes hampers the mechanical/electrical integrity of Si anodes and hence reduces the battery&#39;s cycle-life. To address this issue, sequence-defined peptoids are designed and fabricated with two tailored functional groups, “  OH” and “  COOH”, as cross-linkable polymeric binders for Si anodes of LIBs. Experimental results show that both the capacity and stability of such peptoids-bound Si anodes can be significantly improved due to the decreased cracks of Si nanoparticles. Particularly, the 15-mer peptoid binder in Si anode can result in a much higher reversible capacity (ca. 3110 mAh g −1 ) after 500 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 compared to other reported binders in literature. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is the functional groups presented on the side chains of peptoids that facilitate the formation of Si−O binding efficiency and robustness, and then maintain the integrity of the Si anode. The sequence-designed polymers can act as a new platform for understanding the interactions between binders and Si anode materials, and promote the realization of high-performance batteries.},

Herein, a free-standing Co 3 Fe 7 nanoalloy and Co 5.47 N encapsulated in 3D nitrogen-doped carbon foam (Co 3 Fe 7 @Co 5.47 N/NCF) is prepared as an additive-free and integrated air cathode for flexible Al-air batteries in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes.

The high ORR performance is also supported by in - situ electrochemical Raman spectra and density functional theory calculation. Furthermore, the fabricated Al-air battery displays good flexibility and delivers a power density of 199.6 mW cm −2 , and the binder-free and integrated cathode shows better discharge performance than the traditionally slurry casting cathode.

Here, lipid-wrapped polymer nanoparticles (NPs) are applied as a virus-mimicking model to characterize the effect of core stiffness on NP uptake and intracellular fate triggered by GM3-CD169 binding in macrophages. GM3-functionalized lipid-wrapped NPs are assembled with poly(lactic- co -glycolic) acid (PLGA) as well as with low and high molecular weight polylactic acid (PLA lMW and PLA hMW ) cores. The NPs have an average diameter of 146 ± 17 nm and comparable surface properties defined by the self-assembled lipid layer. Due to differences in the glass transition temperature, the Young&#39;s modulus ( E ) differs substantially under physiological conditions between PLGA ( E PLGA = 60 ± 32 MPa), PLA lMW ( E PLA lMW = 86 ± 25 MPa), and PLA hMW ( E PLA hMW = 1.41 ± 0.67 GPa) NPs. Only the stiff GM3-presenting PLA hMW NPs but not the softer PLGA or PLA lMW NPs avoid a lysosomal pathway and localize in tetraspanin (CD9)-positive compartments that resemble VCCs. These observations suggest that GM3-CD169-induced sequestration of NPs in nonlysosomal compartments is not entirely determined by ligand–receptor interactions but also depends on core stiffness.},

  abstract     = {Metastatic peritoneal carcinoma (mPC) is a deadly disease without effective treatment. To improve treatment of this disease, a recently developed hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has emerged as the standard of care. However, the efficacy of this approach is limited by inefficient drug penetration and rapidly developed drug resistance. Herein, a nanotechnology approach is reported that is designed to improve drug delivery to mPC and to augment the efficacy of HIPEC through delivery of chemoimmunotherapy. First, the drug delivery efficiency of HIPEC is determined and it is found that chemotherapy agents cannot be efficiently delivered to large tumors nodules. To overcome the delivery hurdle, genetically engineered exosomes-thermosensitive liposomes hybrid NPs, or gETL NPs, are then synthesized, and it is demonstrated that the NPs after intravenous administration efficiently penetrates into mPC tumors and releases payloads at the hypothermia condition of HIPEC. Last, it is shown that, when granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and docetaxel are co-delivered, gETL NPs effectively inhibit tumor development and the efficacy is enhanced when HIPEC is co-administered. The study provides a strategy to improve drug delivery to mPCs and offers a promising approach to improve treatment of the disease through combination of locoregional delivery of HIPEC and systemic delivery of chemoimmunotherapy via gETL NPs.},

  abstract     = {While the utility of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in cancer screening and early detection have recently been investigated by testing genetic and epigenetic alterations, here, an original approach by examining cfDNA quantitative and structural features is developed. First, the potential of cfDNA quantitative and structural parameters is independently demonstrated in cell culture, murine, and human plasma models. Subsequently, these variables are evaluated in a large retrospective cohort of 289 healthy individuals and 983 patients with various cancer types; after age resampling, this evaluation is done independently and the variables are combined using a machine learning approach. Implementation of a decision tree prediction model for the detection and classification of healthy and cancer patients shows unprecedented performance for 0, I, and II colorectal cancer stages (specificity, 0.89 and sensitivity, 0.72). Consequently, the methodological proof of concept of using both quantitative and structural biomarkers, and classification with a machine learning method are highlighted, as an efficient strategy for cancer screening. It is foreseen that the classification rate may even be improved by the addition of such biomarkers to fragmentomics, methylation, or the detection of genetic alterations. The optimization of such a multianalyte strategy with this machine learning method is therefore warranted.},

  abstract     = {Fabricating flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity in a broad pressure range is still a challenge. Herein, a flexible pressure sensor with engineered microstructures on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film is designed. The high performance of the sensor derives from its unique pyramid-wall-grid microstructure (PWGM). A square array of dome-topped pyramids and crossed strengthening walls on the film forms a multiheight hierarchical microstructure. Two pieces of PWGM flexible PDMS film, stacked face-to-face, form a piezoresistive sensor endowed with ultrahigh sensitivity across a very broad pressure range. The sensitivity of the device is as high as 383 665.9 and 269 662.9 kPa −1 in the pressure ranges 0–1.6 and 1.6–6 kPa, respectively. In the higher pressure range of 6.1–11 kPa, the sensitivity is 48 689.1 kPa −1 , and even in the very high pressure range of 11–56 kPa, it stays at 1266.8 kPa −1 . The pressure sensor possesses excellent bending and torsional strain detection properties, is mechanically durable, and has potential applications in wearable biosensing for healthcare. In addition, 2 × 2 and 4 × 4 sensor arrays are prepared and characterized, suggesting the possibility of manufacturing a flexible tactile sensor.},

  abstract     = {As a cause of postoperative complications and early hepatic failure after liver transplantation, liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) still has no effective treatment during clinical administration. Although the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for liver IRI has been previously shown, the underlying mechanisms are not completely clear. It is accepted that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are newly uncovered messengers for intercellular communication. Herein, it is reported that umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) improve liver IRI in mice through their secreted EVs. It is also visualized that UC-MSC-EVs mainly concentrate in liver after 6 h of reperfusion. Furthermore, UC-MSC-EVs are found to significantly modulate the membranous expression of CD154 of intrahepatic CD4+ T cells, which is an initiation of inflammatory response in liver and can aggravate liver IRI. Mechanistically, protein mass spectrum analysis is performed and it is revealed that Chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 2 (CCT2) enriches in UC-MSC-EVs, which regulates the calcium channels to affect Ca 2+ influx and suppress CD154 synthesis in CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, these results highlight the therapeutic potential of UC-MSC-EVs in attenuating liver IRI. This finding suggests that CCT2 from UC-MSC-EVs can modulate CD154 expression of intrahepatic CD4+ T cells during liver IRI through the Ca 2+ -calcineurin-NFAT1 signaling pathway.},

  abstract     = {SnS, is a promising anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs), however, undergoes poor cyclic lifespan due to its huge volume changes and bad electroconductivity. Here, a modified CVD method is used to directly grow graphene-like carbon film on the surface of SnS nanosheet arrays which are supported by Co-, N-modified porous carbon fibers (CCF@SnS@G). In the strategy, the SnS nanosheet arrays confined into the integrated carbon matrix containing porous carbon fibers and graphene-like carbon film, perform a greatly improved electrochemical performance. In situ TEM experiments reveal that the vertical graphene-like carbon film can not only protect the SnS nanosheet from destruction well and enhance the conductivity, but also transforms SnS nanosheet into ultrafine nanoparticles to promote the electrochemical kinetics. Systematic electrochemical investigations exhibit that the CCF@SnS@G electrode delivers a stable reversible capacity of 529 mAh g −1 at a high current density of 5 A g −1 for LIBs and 541.4 mAh g −1 at 2 A g −1 for SIBs, suggesting its good potential for anode electrodes.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular diseases remain a significant global burden with 1-in-3 of all deaths attributable to the consequences of the disease. The main cause is blocked arteries which often remain undetected. Implantable medical devices (IMDs) such as stents and grafts are often used to reopen vessels but over time these too will re-block. A vascular biosensor is developed that can report on cellularity and is amenable to being mounted on a stent or graft for remote reporting. Moreover, the device is designed to also receive currents that can induce a controlled form of cell death, apoptosis. A combined diagnostic and therapeutic biosensor would be transformational for the treatment of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and central line access. In this work, a cell sensing and cell apoptosing system based on the same interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) is developed. It is shown that the device is scalable and that by miniaturizing the IDEs, the detection sensitivity is increased. Apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells is monitored using continuous impedance measurements at a frequency of 10 kHz and rates of cell death are tracked using fluorescent dyes and live cell imaging.},

ZIKV infection of pregnant women may cause a spectrum of abnormalities in children. In the studies in Brazil, a large cohort of children with perinatal exposure to ZIKV is followed, and a spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities is identified. In parallel, it is demonstrated that infection of the mouse neonatal brain by a contemporary ZIKV strain instead of an Asian ancestral strain can cause microcephaly and various abnormal neurological functions. These include defects in social interaction and depression, impaired learning and memory, in addition to severe motor defects, which are present in adult mice as well as in the prospective cohort of children. Importantly, although mouse brains infected later after birth do not have apparent abnormal brain structure, those mice still show significant impairments of visual cortical functions, circuit organization, and experience-dependent plasticity. Thus, the study suggests that special attention should be paid to all children born to ZIKV infected mothers for screening of abnormal behaviors and sensory function during childhood.},

Bacteria evolve various strategies to persist and survive in epithelial cells, a front-line barrier of host tissues counteracting invasion; however, it remains unclear how bacteria hijack cellular responses to promote cytoplasmic survival under antibiotic therapy. Here, it is demonstrated that extracellular bacteria show invasive behavior and survive in epithelial cells in both in vivo and in vitro models, to increase antibiotic tolerance. In turn, sublethal levels of antibiotics increase bacterial invasion through promoting the production of bacterial virulence factors. Furthermore, antibiotic treatments interrupt lysosomal acidification in autophagy due to the internalized bacteria, using Bacillus cereus and ciprofloxacin as a model. In addition, it is found that sublethal levels of ciprofloxacin cause mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation to impair lysosomal vascular tape ATPase (V-ATPase) to further promote bacterial persistence. Collectively, these results highlight the potential of host cells mediated antibiotic tolerance, which markedly compromises antibiotic efficacy and worsens the outcomes of infection.},

  abstract     = {To meet the growing demand for global electrical energy storage, high-energy-density electrode materials are required for Li-ion batteries. To overcome the limit of the theoretical energy density in conventional electrode materials based solely on the transition metal redox reaction, the oxygen redox reaction in electrode materials has become an essential component because it can further increase the energy density by providing additional available electrons. However, the increase in the contribution of the oxygen redox reaction in a material is still limited due to the lack of understanding its controlled parameters. Here, it is first proposed that Li-transition metals (TMs) inter-diffusion between the phases in Li-rich materials can be a key parameter for controlling the oxygen redox reaction in Li-rich materials. The resulting Li-rich materials can achieve fully exploited oxygen redox reaction and thereby can deliver the highest reversible capacity leading to the highest energy density, ≈1100 Wh kg −1 among Co-free Li-rich materials. The strategy of controlling Li/transition metals (TMs) inter-diffusion between the phases in Li-rich materials will provide feasible way for further achieving high-energy-density electrode materials via enhancing the oxygen redox reaction for high-performance Li-ion batteries.},

However, because many are bactericidal, traditional in vivo platforms are limited in their capacity to discover and mass produce novel lanthipeptides as bacterial organisms are often critical components in these systems. Herein, the development of a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) platform that enables rapid genome mining, screening, and guided overproduction of lanthipeptides in vivo is described. For proof-of-concept studies, a type I lanthipeptide, nisin, is selected. Four novel lanthipeptides with antibacterial activity are identified among all nisin analogs in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database in a single day. Further, the CFPS platform is coupled with a screening assay for anti-gram-negative bacteria growth, resulting in the identification of a potent nisin mutant, M5. The titers of nisin and the nisin analog are found to be improved with CFPS platform guidance. Owing to the similarities in biosynthesis, the CFPS platform is broadly applicable to other lanthipeptides, thereby providing a universal method for lanthipeptide discovery and overproduction.},

The S-RuP@NPSC with low Ru loading of 0.8 wt% with abundant active catalytic sites possesses high utilization of Ru, the mass catalytic activity is 22.88 times than 20 wt% Pt/C with the overpotential of 250 mV. Density functional theory calculation confirms that the surface Ru (−0.18 eV) and P (0.05 eV) are catalytic active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the according charge redistribution of Ru is regulated by S and P with reverse electronegativity and electron–donor property to induce a synergistically enhanced reactivity toward the HER. This work provides a rational method to regulate the bonding and charge distribution of Ru-based electrocatalysts by reacting macromolecules with multielement of C/N/S/P with Ru.},

In operando engineering of microstructure during extraction is an ideal protocol to develop advanced Si-based materials. A template-free electrochemical preparation of silicon nanotubes (Si-NT) is herein achieved by co-electrolysis of SiO 2 and AgCl in molten NaCl–CaCl 2 at 850 °C. The in situ electrodeposited Ag facilitates the generation of a liquid Ag–Si intermediate, triggering a liquid–solid mechanism to direct the growth of Si-NT. An automatic separation of Ag from Si then occurs in the following cooling process, resulting in Ag deposits on the Ni current collector and recycling of Ag. Such a facile and smart preparation of Si-NT from affordable silica guarantees an enhanced current efficiency of 74%, a decreased energy consumption of 12.1 kW h kg Si −1 , and enhanced lithium-storage capability of the electrolytic Si-NT. An in situ coating of Ag over the Si-NT can also be fulfilled by simply introducing soluble AgCl in the melts. The present study provides a template-free preparation and an in situ surface modification of Si-NT.},

This method is versatile, with the ability to print a range of dimensions, multimaterial, and multifunctional 3D structures. It is also a very affordable technique in prototyping.

Technical manufacture requirements of parallel applied electric fields and polarization are theoretically incompatible with intrinsically orthogonal orientations in naturally occurring shear modes. Herein, inspired by the philosophy of building metamaterial from identical unit cells, an artificial prototype device with distinctive patterned electrodes and arrayed piezoceramic subunits is designed and fabricated, which is proved to perfectly generate synthetic face shear deformation. At the same drive voltage, an enhanced shear-type displacement output by over an order of magnitude is observed beyond previous d 15 -mode bulk elements.

  abstract     = {Molecular doping allows enhancement and precise control of electrical properties of organic semiconductors, and is thus of central technological relevance for organic (opto-) electronics. Beyond single-component molecular electron acceptors and donors, organic salts have recently emerged as a promising class of dopants. However, the pertinent fundamental understanding of doping mechanisms and doping capabilities is limited. Here, the unique capabilities of the salt consisting of a borinium cation (Mes 2 B + ; Mes: mesitylene) and the tetrakis(penta-fluorophenyl)borate anion [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] − is demonstrated as p-type dopant for polymer semiconductors. With a range of experimental methods, the doping mechanism is identified to comprise electron transfer from the polymer to Mes 2 B + , and the positive charge on the polymer is stabilized by [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] − . Notably, the former salt cation leaves during processing and is not present in films. The anion [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] − even enables the stabilization of polarons and bipolarons in poly(3-hexylthiophene), not yet achieved with other molecular dopants. From doping studies with high ionization energy polymer semiconductors, the effective electron affinity of Mes 2 B + [B(C 6 F 5 ) 4 ] − is estimated to be an impressive 5.9 eV. This significantly extends the parameter space for doping of polymer semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Glucose-oxidase (GOx)-mediated starvation by consuming intracellular glucose has aroused extensive exploration as an advanced approach for tumor treatment. However, this reaction of catalytic oxidation by GOx is highly dependent on the on-site oxygen content, and thus starvation therapy often suffers unexpected anticancer outcomes due to the intrinsic tumorous hypoxia. Herein, porous platinum nanospheres (pPts), incorporated with GOx molecules (PtGs), are synthesized to enable synergistic cancer therapy. In this system, GOx can effectively catalyze the oxidation of glucose to generate H 2 O 2 , while pPt triggers the decomposition of both endogenous and exogenous H 2 O 2 to produce considerable content of O 2 to facilitate the glucose consumption by GOx. Meanwhile, pPt induces remarkable content of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) under an alternating electric field, leading to cellular oxidative stress injury and promotes apoptosis following the mechanism of electrodynamic therapy (EDT). In consequence, the PtG nanocomposite exhibits significant anticancer effect both in vitro and in vivo. This study has therefore demonstrated a fascinating therapeutic platform enabling oxygen-inductive starvation/EDT synergistic strategy for effective tumor treatment.},

In this context, bipolar electrodes (BEs) are capable of improving the specific power, simplifying cell components, and reducing manufacturing costs for rechargeable batteries. By focusing on the fundamentals and applications of BEs in rechargeable batteries, the rational utilization of BEs from an academic perspective is considered. The progress and challenges of BEs are discussed and summarized in detail.

Here, a microbial system is developed for the production of high-added-value N -heterocycles directly from glucose. Based on a retrosynthetic analysis, eleven genes are selected, systematically modulated, and overexpressed in three Escherichia coli strains to construct an artificial pathway to produce 5-methyl-2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid, a key intermediate in the production of the important pharmaceuticals Glipizide and Acipimox. Via one-pot tandem collaborations, the designed microbes remarkably realize high-level production of 5-methyl-2-pyrazinecarboxylic acid (6.2 ± 0.1 g L −1 ) and its precursor 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (7.9 ± 0.7 g L −1 ). This study is the first application of cooperative microbes for the total biosynthesis of functionalized N -heterocycles and provides new insight into integrating bioretrosynthetic principles with synthetic biology to perform complex syntheses.},

Both the color and heat of the device are easily controlled through electrical resistance variation induced by applied mechanical strain. The resulting monolithic device exhibits substantial changes in optical reflectance and temperature with durability, rapid response, high stretchability, and linear sensitivity. The approach enables a low-expertise route to fabricating dynamic interactive thermotherapeutic e-skins that can be used to effectively rehabilitate injured connective tissues as well as to prevent skin burns by simultaneously accommodating stretching, providing heat, and exhibiting a color change.},

MOF NPs are used as vehicles to encapsulate camptothecin (CPT), and the hybridization by Au NPs greatly improves the stability of the nanomedicine in a physiological environment. Triggered by the high concentration of phosphate inside the cancer cells, Au/FeMOF@CPT NPs effectively collapse after internalization, resulting in the complete drug release and activation of the cascade catalytic reactions. The intracellular glucose can be oxidized by Au NPs to produce hydrogen dioxide, which is further utilized as chemical fuel for the Fenton reaction, thus realizing the synergistic anticancer efficacy. Benefitting from the enhanced permeability and retention effect and sophisticated fabrications, the blood circulation time and tumor accumulation of Au/FeMOF@CPT NPs are significantly increased. In vivo results demonstrate that the combination of chemotherapy and chemodynamic therapy effectively suppresses the tumor growth, meantime the systemic toxicity of this nanomedicine is greatly avoided.},

The surface of catheter is modified with anti-EpCAM antibody and the interior is filled with black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs). CTCs in the peripheral blood are captured by the catheter continually with the aid of circulation. The captured CTCs are used for downstream analyses or in vivo eliminated by the near-infrared (NIR) photothermal effect of BPNSs. A capture efficiency of 2.1% is obtained during the 5 min of treatment, and 100% of the captured CTCs are killed by following NIR light irradiation in both an in vitro closed-loop circulation system and an in vivo rabbit model.

Bio-inspired growth factor delivery utilizing the native growth factor signaling roles of the extracellular matrix proteoglycans has the potential to overcome many of the drawbacks of angiogenic therapy. In this study, the potential of the recombinantly expressed domain V (rDV) of human perlecan is investigated as a means of promoting growth factor signaling toward enhanced angiogenesis and vascularization of implanted biomaterials. rDV is found to promote angiogenesis in established in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis assays by potentiating endogenous growth factor signaling via its glycosaminoglycan chains. Further, rDV is found to potentiate fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling at low concentrations that in the absence of rDV are not biologically active. Finally, rDV immobilized on 3D porous silk fibroin biomaterials promotes enhanced vascular ingrowth and integration of the implanted scaffolds with the surrounding tissue. Together, these studies demonstrate the important role of this biologically active perlecan fragment and its potential in the treatment of ischemia in both native and bioengineered tissues.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) has become a predominant cancer worldwide. To understand the process of carcinogenesis, a short hairpin RNA library screening is employed to search for candidate genes that promote proliferation in the CRC cell line HT29. The candidate genes overlap with differentially expressed genes in 32 CRC tumor tissues in the GEO dataset GSE8671. The seventh-ranked testis expressed 10 (TEX10) is upregulated in CRC and its knockdown decreases cell proliferation. The TEX10 high-expression group exhibits worse overall survival ( P = 0.003) and progression-free survival ( P = 0.001) than the TEX10 low-expression group. TEX10 depletion decreases the growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Gene set enrichment analysis indicates that the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway is significantly enriched in the genes downregulated by TEX10 knockdown. Mechanistically, TEX10 interacts with RELA and increases its nuclear localization. TEX10 promotes RELA occupancy at gene promoters and regulates the expression of a subset of RELA-targeted genes, including TNFAIP8 , SAT1 , and IL6ST . Taken together, this study identifies that TEX10 promotes the proliferation of CRC cells in an RELA-dependent manner. In addition, high TEX10 expression is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients.},

In this work, CO 2 -based, hyperbranched poly(alkynoate)s (hb-PAs) with high molecular weights and degrees of branching are facilely prepared under atmospheric pressure in only 3 h. Because hb-PAs possess two types of ethynyl groups with different reactivities, they can undergo site-selective, three-step functionalizations with nearly 100% conversion in each step. Taking advantage of this unique feature, functional hb-PAs with versatile properties are constructed that could be selectively tailored to contain hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains in their branched chains, on their periphery, or both via tandem polymerizations. Hyperbranched polyprodrug amphiphiles with high drug loading content (44.3 wt%) are also generated, along with an artificial light-harvesting system with high energy transfer efficiency (up to 92%) and white-light-emitting polymers.

Here, a tumor-targeting and light-responsive-penetrable nanoplatform (Apt/PDGs ^ s@pMOF) is developed to elicit intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and reeducate immunosuppressive microenvironment simultaneously. In particular, porphyrinic metal–organic framework (pMOF)–based photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) to promote CTLs intratumoral infiltration and hot “immune-cold” tumor. Upon being triggered by PDT, the nearly 10 nm adsorbed drug-loaded dendrimer de-shields from the nanoplatform and spreads into the deeper tumor, eliminating MDSCs and reversing immunosuppression, eventually reinforcing immune response. Meanwhile, the designed nanoplatform also has a systemic MDSC inhibition effect and moderate improvement of overall antitumor immune responses, resulting in effective suppression of distal tumors within less significant immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) induced.},

Flexible pressure sensors with reliable performance are highly desired yet challenging to construct to meet the requirements of practical applications in daily activities and even harsh environments, such as high temperatures. This work describes a highly sensitive and reliable capacitive pressure sensor based on flexible ceramic nanofibrous networks with high structural elasticity, which minimizes performance degradation commonly seen in polymer-based sensors because of the viscoelastic behavior of polymers. Such ceramic pressure sensors exhibit high sensitivity (≈4.4 kPa −1 ), ultralow limit of detection (&lt;0.8 Pa), fast response speed (&lt;16 ms) as well as low fatigue over 50 000 loading/unloading cycles. The high stability is attributed to the excellent mechanical stability of the ceramic nanofibrous network. By employing textile-based electrodes, a fully breathable and wearable ceramic pressure sensor is demonstrated for real-time health monitoring and motion detection. Owing to the high-temperature resistance of ceramics, the ceramic nanofibrous network sensor can function properly at temperatures up to 370 °C, showing great promise for harsh environment applications.},

  abstract     = {A light-inspired hydroxyapatite (Hap)/nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) modified graphene oxide (GO) heterojunction film is developed, which shows a promoted separation of interfacial electrons and holes and an inhibited recombination efficiency via hole depletion. The metabolism of bacteria on this film is significantly inhibited under light irradiation, due to the enhanced photocatalytic and photothermal effects. In addition, the electron transfer from the plasmonic membrane to the GO/NCD/Hap film further inhibits the adenosine triphosphate process of bacteria, thus leading to the synergetic antibacterial efficacy. Meanwhile, the electron transfer between film and cell membrane induces the Ca 2+ flow after irradiation, which can promote the migration and proliferation of cells and alkaline phosphatase enhancement, thus favoring the tissue reconstruction. An in vivo test discloses that the vascular injury repair is achieved through the Ca 2+ -activated PLC γ 1/ERK pathway, identified by the enhanced CD31 expression. Moreover, the increased CD4 + /CD8 + lymphocytes are ameliorative by activating the PI3K/P-AKT pathway. Consequently, the electron transfer boosts the synergic photodynamic and photothermal therapeutic effects for bacterial infection by Ca 2+ flow for immunotherapy. This mild phototherapy approach with GO/NCDs/Hap, which can simultaneously repair injured vessels and relieve inflammation reactions, will increase the clinical application of noninvasive phototherapy in the near future.},

  abstract     = {Stem cells have emerged as a potential therapy for a range of neural insults, but their application in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is still limited and the mechanisms underlying the cognitive benefits of stem cells remain to be elucidated. Here, the effects of clinical-grade human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) on the recovery of cognitive ability in SAMP8 mice, a senescence-accelerated mouse model of AD is explored. A functional assay identifies that the core functional factor hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secreted from hUC-MSCs plays critical roles in hUC-MSC-modulated recovery of damaged neural cells by down-regulating hyperphosphorylated tau, reversing spine loss, and promoting synaptic plasticity in an AD cell model. Mechanistically, structural and functional recovery, as well as cognitive enhancements elicited by exposure to hUC-MSCs, are at least partially mediated by HGF in the AD hippocampus through the activation of the cMet-AKT-GSK3 β signaling pathway. Taken together, these data strongly implicate HGF in mediating hUC-MSC-induced improvements in functional recovery in AD models.},

Additionally, significant inhibition of back reactions, especially the oxidation of sulfide ions during the photocatalytic water oxidation catalysis, is an arduous task that requires an efficient photogenerated hole transfer dynamics. Here, a ternary dumbbell-shaped catalyst based on RuO 2 /CdS/MoS 2 with spatially separated catalytic sites is developed to achieve simultaneous production of hydrogen and oxygen under simulated solar-light without any sacrificial agents. Particularly, MoS 2 nanosheets anchored on the two ends of CdS nanowires are identified as a reduction cocatalyst to accelerate hydrogen evolution, while RuO 2 nanoparticles as an oxidation cocatalyst are deposited onto the sidewalls of CdS nanowires to facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics. The density functional theory simulations and ultrafast spectroscopic results reveal that photogenerated electrons and holes directionally migrate to MoS 2 and RuO 2 catalytic sites, respectively, thus achieving efficient charge carrier separation. The design of ternary dumbbell structure guarantees metal sulfides against photocorrosion and thus extends their range in solar water splitting.},

However, anticancer treatment is largely affected by the pre-existing hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME), which not only causes the resistance of the tumors to photodynamic therapy (PDT), but also promotes tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Here, a continuous O 2 self-enriched nanoplatform is constructed for multimodal imaging-guided synergistic phototherapy based on octahedral gold nanoshells (GNSs), which are constructed by a more facile and straightforward one-step method using platinum (Pt) nanozyme-decorated metal–organic frameworks (MOF) as the inner template. The Pt-decorated MOF@GNSs (PtMGs) are further functionalized with human serum albumin-chelated gadolinium (HSA-Gd, HGd) and loaded with indocyanine green (ICG) (ICG-PtMGs@HGd) to achieve a synergistic PDT/PTT effect and fluorescence (FL)/multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The Pt-decorated nanoplatform endows remarkable catalase-like behavior and facilitates the continuous decomposition of the endogenous H 2 O 2 into O 2 to enhance the PDT effect under hypoxic TME. HSA modification enhances the biocompatibility and tumor-targeting ability of the nanocomposites. This TME-responsive and O 2 self-supplement nanoparticle holds great potential as a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform for the multimodal imaging-guided synergistic phototherapy of solid tumors.},

  abstract     = {Promoting tumor angiogenesis effectively and specifically to resolve tumor-associated hypoperfusion holds promise for improving pancreatic cancer therapy. Herein, a doxorubicin (DOX) loaded smart liposome, MC-T-DOX, is constructed, that carries appropriately low-density cilengitide, an α v β 3 integrin-specific Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-mimetic cyclic peptide, via a membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) cleavable peptide. After being administered systemically in a hypoperfused pancreatic cancer mouse model at a low dose of cilengitide, the proangiogenic activity of MC-T-DOX is specifically “turned on” in tumor vessels through cleavage by MT1-MMP on tumor endothelial cells to release cilengitide. This locally released cilengitide increases tumor blood perfusion, thereby improving the accumulation and distribution of MC-T-DOX in the tumor site. The loaded-DOX then displays enhanced penetration and increased cellular uptake upon heat-triggered release from MC-T-DOX in the tumor interstitium, contributing to the improved tumor therapy efficacy. Therefore, the strategy of combining the modulation of tumor vascular promotion with smart nanodrug delivery represents a promising approach to improving drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of hypoperfused tumors.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are promising materials for diverse applications including displays, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells due to their intriguing properties such as tunable bandgap, high photoluminescence quantum yield, high absorbance, and narrow emission peaks. Despite the prosperous achievements over the past several years, PQDs face severe challenges in terms of stability under different circumstances. Currently, researchers have overcome part of the stability problem, making PQDs sustainable in water, oxygen, and polar solvents for long-term use. However, halide PQDs are easily degraded under continuous irradiation, which significantly limits their potential for conventional applications. In this study, an oleic acid/oleylamine (traditional surface ligands)-free method to fabricate perovskite quantum dot papers (PQDP) is developed by adding cellulose nanocrystals as long-chain binding ligands that stabilize the PQD structure. As a result, the relative photoluminescence intensity of PQDP remains over ≈90% under continuous ultraviolet (UV, 16 W) irradiation for 2 months, showing negligible photodegradation. This proposed method paves the way for the fabrication of ultrastable PQDs and the future development of related applications.},

Accordingly, the need for evaluating piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties has also increased. The piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties are evaluated macroscopically using laser interferometers and polarization–electric field loop measurements. However, as the research focus is shifted from bulk to nanosized materials, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques have been suggested as an alternative approach for evaluating piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. In this Progress Report, the recent progress on the nanoscale evaluation of piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of diverse materials using SPM-based methods is summarized. Among the SPM techniques, the focus is on recent studies that are related to piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy; further, the utilization of these two modes to understand piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties at the nanoscale level is discussed. This work can provide guidelines for evaluating the piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of materials based on SPM techniques.},

  abstract     = {Bonding geometry engineering of metal–oxygen octahedra is a facile way of tailoring various functional properties of transition metal oxides. Several approaches, including epitaxial strain, thickness, and stoichiometry control, have been proposed to efficiently tune the rotation and tilt of the octahedra, but these approaches are inevitably accompanied by unnecessary structural modifications such as changes in thin-film lattice parameters. In this study, a method to selectively engineer the octahedral bonding geometries is proposed, while maintaining other parameters that might implicitly influence the functional properties. A concept of octahedral tilt propagation engineering is developed using atomically designed SrRuO 3 /SrTiO 3 (SRO/STO) superlattices. In particular, the propagation of RuO 6 octahedral tilt within the SRO layers having identical thicknesses is systematically controlled by varying the thickness of adjacent STO layers. This leads to a substantial modification in the electromagnetic properties of the SRO layer, significantly enhancing the magnetic moment of Ru. This approach provides a method to selectively manipulate the bonding geometry of strongly correlated oxides, thereby enabling a better understanding and greater controllability of their functional properties.},

Guided by theoretical calculation, phosphate groups are used to induce the construction of ultrathin Co phthalocyanine/g-C 3 N 4 heterojunctions (CoPc/P-CN, ≈4 nm) via strengthened H-bonding interfacial connection, achieving an unprecedented 14-time photoactivity improvement for UV–vis aerobic 2,4-dichlorophenol degradation compared to bulk CN by promoted activation of O 2 . It is validated that more • O 2 − radicals are produced through the improved photoreduction of O 2 by accelerated photoelectron transfer from CN to the ligand of CoPc and then to the abundant single Co–N 4 (II) catalytic sites, as endowed by the matched dimension, intimate interface even at the molecular level, and high CoPc dispersion of resulted heterojunctions. Interestingly, CoPc/P-CN also exhibits outstanding photoactivities in the aerobic oxidation of aromatic alcohols. This work showcases a feasible route to realize efficient photocatalytic O 2 activation by exploiting the potential of ultrathin metal phthalocyanine (MPc) assemblies with abundant single-atom sites. More importantly, a universal facile strategy of H-bonding-dominating construction of MPc-involved heterojunctions is successfully established.},

  abstract     = {Memory devices have been advanced so much, but still it is highly required to find stable and reliable materials with low-power consumption. Halide perovskites (HPs) have been recently adopted for memory application since they have advantages of fast switching based on ionic motion in crystal structure. However, HPs also suffer from poor stability, so it is necessary to improve the stability of HPs. In this regard, combined first-principles screening and experimental verification are performed to design HPs that have high environmental stability and low-operating voltage for memory devices. First-principles screening identifies 2D layered AB 2 X 5 structure as the best candidate switching layer for memory devices, because it has lower formation energy and defect formation energy than 3D ABX 3 or other layered structures (A 3 B 2 X 7 , A 2 BX 4 ). To verify results, all-inorganic 2D layered CsPb 2 Br 5 is synthesized and used in memory devices. The memory devices that use CsPb 2 Br 5 show much better stability and lower operating voltages than devices that use CsPbBr 3 . These findings are expected to provide new opportunity to design materials for reliable device applications based on calculation, screening, and experimental verification.},

  abstract     = {Simultaneously achieving high efficiency and high durability in perovskite solar cells is a critical step toward the commercialization of this technology. Inverted perovskite photovoltaic (IP-PV) cells incorporating robust and low levelized-cost-of-energy (LCOE) buffer layers are supposed to be a promising solution to this target. However, insufficient inventory of materials for back-electrode buffers substantially limits the development of IP-PV. Herein, a composite consisting of 1D cation-doped TiO 2 brookite nanorod (NR) embedded by 0D fullerene is investigated as a top modification buffer for IP-PV. The cathode buffer is constructed by introducing fullerene to fill the interstitial space of the TiO 2 NR matrix. Meanwhile, cations of transition metal Co or Fe are doped into the TiO 2 NR to further tune the electronic property. Such a top buffer exhibits multifold advantages, including improved film uniformity, enhanced electron extraction and transfer ability, better energy level matching with perovskite, and stronger moisture resistance. Correspondingly, the resultant IP-PV displays an efficiency exceeding 22% with a 22-fold prolonged working lifetime. The strategy not only provides an essential addition to the material inventory for top electron buffers by introducing the 0D:1D composite concept, but also opens a new avenue to optimize perovskite PVs with desirable properties.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal liquid crystals (LCs) formed by nanoparticles hold great promise for creating new structures and topologies. However, achieving highly ordered hierarchical architectures and stable topological configurations is extremely challenging, mainly due to the liquid-like fluidity of colloidal LCs in nature. Herein, an innovative synchronous nanofluidic rectification (SNR) technique for generating ultralong graphene oxide (GO) liquid crystal (GOLC) fibers with hierarchical core-skin architectures is presented, in which the GO sheet assemblies and hydrogel skin formation are synchronous. The SNR technique conceptually follows two design principles: horizontal polymer-flow promotes the rapid planar alignment of GO sheets and drives the chiral-reversing of cholesteric GOLCs, and in situ formed hydrogel skin affords some protection against environmental impact to maintain stable topological configurations. Importantly, the dried fibers retain the smooth surface and ordered internal structures, achieving high mechanical strength and flexibility. The linear and circular polarization potential of GOLC fibers are demonstrated for optical sensing and recognition. This work may open an avenue toward the scalable manufacture of uniform and robust, yet highly anisotropic, fiber-shaped functional materials with complex internal architectures.},

However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these natural structures have posed daunting challenges on their production, characterization, evaluation, and applications. While there have been various types of synthetic skeletons that could mimic some biological aspects of polysaccharides, a safer and more easily accessed system is still desired to avoid the unnatural components and difficulties in modifying the structures. In this work, conveniently accessible self-assembling glycopeptide conjugates are developed, where the natural O-glycosidic linkages and phosphoryl modifications assist the self-assembly and concurrently reduce the risk of toxicity. The generated nanoparticles in aqueous solution offer a multivalent display of structurally controllable carbohydrates as mimics of polysaccharides, among which a mannosylated version exhibits immunostimulatory effects in both cellular assays and vaccination of mice. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of this glycopeptide conjugate-derived platform in exploiting the intriguing properties of carbohydrates in a more structurally maneuverable fashion.},

Herein, an interesting P2-type Mn-based compound exhibits a distinct two-phase behavior preserving a high-potential anionic redox (≈4.2 V vs Na + /Na) even during the subsequent cycling. Through a systematic series of experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations, the anionic redox reaction originating from O 2p-electron and the reversible unmixing of Na-rich and Na-poor phases are confirmed in detail. In light of the combined study, a critical role of the anion-redox-induced two-phase reaction in the positive-negative point of view is demonstrated, suggesting a rational design principle considering the phase separation and lattice mismatch. Furthermore, these results provide an exciting approach for utilizing the high-voltage feature in Mn-based layered cathode materials that are charge-compensated by an anionic redox reaction.},

Medical biohybrid microswimmers suffer from low manufacturing yields, which would significantly limit their potential applications. In the present study, a biohybrid design strategy is reported, where a thin and soft uniform coating layer is noncovalently assembled around a motile microorganism. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a single-cell green alga) is used in the design as a biological model microorganism along with polymer–nanoparticle matrix as the synthetic component, reaching a manufacturing efficiency of ≈90%. Natural biopolymer chitosan is used as a binder to efficiently coat the cell wall of the microalgae with nanoparticles. The soft surface coating does not impair the viability and phototactic ability of the microalgae, and allows further engineering to accommodate biomedical cargo molecules. Furthermore, by conjugating the nanoparticles embedded in the thin coating with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin by a photocleavable linker, on-demand delivery of drugs to tumor cells is reported as a proof-of-concept biomedical demonstration. The high-throughput strategy can pave the way for the next-generation generation microrobotic swarms for future medical active cargo delivery tasks.},

Inspired by the idea of ordered structures with functional units, a much simpler nanostep piezoelectric actuator consisting of (2 × 2) arrayed, cofired multilayer piezoceramic actuation units is developed, which operates in an artificially generated quasi shear mode (AGQSM) that is missing in natural piezoelectric ceramics. Under only one-phase square-wave voltage drive, the actuator can produce a stable, continual nanostep motion in two ways at nonresonant frequencies, and the obtained minimum step displacement is as low as 7 nm in open control, indicating its potential application as a precise finger or knife actuator in surgical robots.

Suitability of the method for multimaterial integration allows to tailor the device architecture for the long-term maintenance of healthy human stem-cell derived neurons and astrocytes, spanning at least 40 days. Leveraging fast-prototyping capabilities at both micro and macroscale, a proof-of-principle human in vitro model of the nigrostriatal pathway is created.

The mesoscale morphology changes are correlated with the decay of the short-circuit current J sc and the evolution of crystalline grain sizes is codependent with the decay of open-circuit voltage V oc . Without additive, the loss in J sc dominates the degradation, whereas with solvent additive (DIO and CBA) the loss in V oc rules the degradation.

In this study, Gd 3+ and chlorin e6 loaded single-walled carbon nanohorns (Gd-Ce6@SWNHs) are developed, and it is demonstrated that they are a strong immune adjuvant, and have high tumor targeting and penetration efficiency. Then, three in vivo mouse cancer models are established, and it is found that sequential PDT and PTT using Gd-Ce6@SWNHs synergistically promotes systemic antitumor immune responses, where PTT stimulates dendritic cells (DCs) to secrete IL-6 and TNF- α , while PDT triggers upregulation of IFN- γ and CD80. Moreover, migration of Gd-Ce6@SWNHs from the targeted tumors to tumor-draining lymph nodes sustainably activates the DCs to generate a durable immune response, which eventually eliminates the distant metastases without using additional therapeutics. Gd-Ce6@SWNHs intervened phototherapies also generate durable and long-term memory immune responses to tolerate and prevent cancer rechallenge. Therefore, this study demonstrates that sequential PDT and PTT using Gd-Ce6@SWNHs under moderate conditions elicits cooperative and long-lasting antitumor immune responses, which are promising for the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic cancers.},

Intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) has been shown to reduce amygdala activity but to increase amygdala–prefrontal cortex connectivity during exposure to threatening stimuli suggesting that it may act as an important modulator of emotion regulation. The present randomized, between-subject, placebo-controlled pharmacological study combines the intranasal administration of OXT with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an explicit emotion regulation paradigm in 65 healthy male participants to investigate the modulatory effects of OXT on both bottom-up and top-down emotion regulation. OXT attenuates the activation in the posterior insular cortex and amygdala during anticipation of top-down regulation of predictable threat stimuli in participants with high trait anxiety. In contrast, OXT enhances amygdala activity during the bottom-up anticipation of unpredictable threat stimuli in participants with low trait anxiety. OXT may facilitate top-down goal-directed attention by attenuating amygdala activity in high anxiety individuals, while promoting bottom-up attention/vigilance to unexpected threats by enhancing amygdala activity in low anxiety individuals. OXT may thus have the potential to promote an adaptive balance between bottom-up and top-down attention systems depending on an individual&#39;s trait anxiety level.},

Relatively rare attention has been paid to hydrophobic interaction compared with hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction of NAs. However, hydrophobic interaction shows some unique properties, such as high tunability for application interest, minimal effect on NA functionality, and sensitivity to external stimuli. Therefore, the widespread use of hydrophobic interaction has promoted the evolution of NA-based biomaterials in higher-order self-assembly, drug/gene-delivery systems, and stimuli-responsive systems. Herein, the recent progress of NA-based biomaterials whose fabrications or properties are highly determined by hydrophobic interactions is summarized. 1) The hydrophobic interaction of NA itself comes from the accumulation of base-stacking forces, by which the NAs with certain base compositions and chain lengths show properties similar to thermal-responsive polymers. 2) In conjugation with hydrophobic molecules, NA amphiphiles show interesting self-assembly structures with unique properties in many new biosensing and therapeutic strategies. 3) The working-mechanisms of some NA-based complex materials are also dependent on hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, in recent attempts, NA amphiphiles have been applied in organizing macroscopic self-assembly of DNA origami and controlling the cell–cell interactions.},

  abstract     = {The construction and control of high-order coupled vortices are a significant challenge for promoting the application of magnetic vortices. Thus far, only double-coupled vortices have been produced and modulated in some ferromagnetic nanostructures. Here, an effective approach is provided to obtain a high-order coupled vortex structure by using a chiral nanostructure. Double-vortex, triple-vortex, and n -vortex chains can be successfully constructed using structured Fe 4 N nanostrips and bias nanomagnets. The designed chiral nanostructure cannot only control the transport and hybridization of vortices but also modulate the domain walls of the vortex chain for spin wave (SW) propagation. At the exciting frequency of 1.2 GHz, the SW propagates along the domain walls formed in the vortex chain. Upon increasing the frequency to 5.0 GHz, the SW gradually spreads from the domain walls into domains. This technique will present a new perspective for the design and application of magnetic vortex-based devices.},

Herein, introducing a micro-canonical picture that maps the finite-bias quantum transport process to a drain-to-source or multi-electrode optical excitation, the multi-space constrained-search density functional theory (MS-DFT) formalism for first-principles electronic structure and quantum transport calculations is developed. Performing MS-DFT calculations for the benzenedithiolate single-molecule junction, it is shown that MS-DFT and standard DFT-NEGF calculations produce practically equivalent electronic and transmission data. Importantly, the variational convergence of “nonequilibrium total energy” within MS-DFT is demonstrated, which should have significant implications for in operando studies of nanoscale devices. Establishing a viable alternative to the Landauer viewpoint, the developed formalism should provide valuable atomistic information in the development of next-generation nanodevices.},

This article reports a compatible strategy to enhance the efficiency of planar n–i–p Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells through Sb 2 Se 3 surface modification and an architecture with oriented 1D van der Waals material, trigonal selenium (t-Se). A seed layer assisted successive close spaced sublimation (CSS) is developed to fabricate highly crystalline Sb 2 Se 3 absorbers. It is found that the Sb 2 Se 3 absorber exhibits a Se-deficient surface and negative surface band bending. Reactive Se is innovatively introduced to compensate the surface Se deficiency and form an (101) oriented 1D t-Se interlayer. The p-type t-Se layer promotes a favored band alignment and band bending at the Sb 2 Se 3 /t-Se interface, and functionally works as a surface passivation and hole transport material, which significantly suppresses interface recombination and enhances carrier extraction efficiency. An efficiency of 7.45% is obtained in a planar Sb 2 Se 3 solar cell in superstrate n–i–p configuration, which is the highest efficiency for planar Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells prepared by CSS. The all-inorganic Sb 2 Se 3 solar cell with t-Se shows superb stability, retaining ≈98% of the initial efficiency after 40 days storage in open air without encapsulation.},

Here, it is reported that heteroatom codoping offers a promising solution to the above challenge. As a proof of concept, N,P-codoped mesoporous carbon is prepared by annealing phytic-acid-functionalized ZIF-8 in NH 3 . In CO 2 -saturated 0.5 m NaHCO 3 , the catalyst enables CO 2 reduction to CO with great selectivity close to 100% and large CO partial current density (≈8 mA cm −2 ), which are, to the best of knowledge, superior to all other relevant competitors. Theoretical simulations show that the improved activity and selectivity are stemmed from the enhanced surface adsorption of *COOH and *CO intermediates as a result of the synergy of N and P codoping.},

  abstract     = {Metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer death worldwide, and effective therapeutic strategies are lacking. The aim of this work is to identify the key drivers in tumor metastasis and screen therapeutics for treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Gene Ontology analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) gene expression datasets of ESCC patients with or without lympy metastasis identifies that TGF β 2 is highly enriched in the pathways essential for tumor metastasis and upregulates in the metastatic ESCC tumors. High TGF β 2 expression in ESCC correlates with metastasis and patient survival, and functionally contributes to tumor metastasis via activating extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling. By screening of a library consisting of 429 bioactive compounds, imperatorin is verified as a novel TGF β 2 inhibitor, with robustly suppressive effect on tumor metastasis in multiple mice models. Mechanistically, direct binding of imperatorin and CREB1 inhibits phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of CREB1, and its interaction with TGF β 2 promoter, represses TGF β 2 expression and fibroblasts-secreted CCL2, and then inactivates ERK signaling to block cancer invasion and abrogates the paracrine effects of fibroblasts on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Overall, the findings suggest the use of TGF β 2 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in ESCC, and supports the potential of imperatorin as a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer metastasis.},

Protein replacement therapies using recombinant proteins or enzymes represent the only approved treatment. Combinatorial antibodies have shown great promise as a new class of therapeutic molecules because they act as “mechanism-based antibodies” with both agonist and antagonist activities. Using leptin, a key hormone in energy metabolism, as an example, a function-guided approach is developed to select combinatorial antibodies with high potency and full agonist activity that substitute natural growth factors in vivo. The identified antibody shows identical biochemical properties and cellular profiles as leptin, and rescues leptin-deficiency in ob/ob mice. Remarkably, the antibody activates leptin receptors that are otherwise nonfunctional because of mutations (L372A and A409E). Combinatorial antibodies have significant advantages over recombinant proteins for chronical usage in terms of immunological tolerance and biological stability.},

Somatic evolution and genetic instability result in intra-tumor cell heterogeneity. Various models have been developed to analyze the interactions between different types of tumor cells.

However, their catalytic activities are hampered by charge recombination at deep level defects, which constitutes the critical challenge to practical applications of these oxide photocatalysts. To address the challenge, a strategy is proposed here that includes creating shallow-level defects above the deep-level defects and thermal activating the migration of trapped electrons out of the deep-level defects via these shallow defects. A simple and scalable solution plasma processing (SPP) technique is developed to process the presynthesized yellow TiO 2 with numerous oxygen vacancies (Ov), which incorporates hydrogen dopants into the TiO 2 lattice and creates shallow-level defects above deep level of Ov, meanwhile retaining the original visible absorption of the colored TiO 2 . At elevated temperature, the SPP-treated TiO 2 exhibits a 300 times higher conversion rate for CO 2 reduction under solar light irradiation and a 7.5 times higher removal rate of acetaldehyde under UV light irradiation, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to enhance the photoactivity of colored wide-bandgap oxides for energy and environmental applications.},

  abstract     = {The combined treatment with nanoparticles and autophagy inhibitors, such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), is extensively explored for cancer therapy. However, the toxicity of autophagy inhibitors and their unselective for tumoricidal autophagy have seriously hindered the application of the combined treatment. In this study, a carboxy-functional iron oxide nanoparticle (Fe 2 O 3 @DMSA) is designed and identified to significantly exert an antitumor effect without adding CQ or HCQ. Further investigation indicates that the effective inhibition effect of Fe 2 O 3 @DMSA alone on hepatoma growth is triggered by inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes to enhance tumoricidal autophagy, which is induced by intracellular iron-retention-induced sustained reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, in two hepatoma-bearing mouse models, Fe 2 O 3 @DMSA alone effectively suppresses the growth of tumors without obvious toxic side effects. These studies offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Primary cilia are shown to have membrane swelling, also known as ciliary bulbs. However, the role of these structures and their physiological relevance remains unknown. Here, it is reported that a ciliary bulb has extracellular vesicle (EV)-like characteristics. The ciliary extracellular-like vesicle (cELV) has a unique dynamic movement and can be released by mechanical fluid force. To better identify the cELV, differential multidimensional proteomic analyses are performed on the cELV. A database of 172 cELV proteins is generated, and all that examined are confirmed to be in the cELV. Repressing the expression of these proteins in vitro and in vivo inhibits cELV formation. In addition to the randomized heart looping, hydrocephalus, and cystic kidney in fish, compensated heart contractility is observed in both fish and mouse models. Specifically, low circulation of cELV results in hypotension with compensated heart function, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and arrhythmogenic characteristics, which result in a high mortality rate in mice. Furthermore, the overall ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output are significantly decreased in mice lacking cELV. It is thus proposed that the cELV as a nanocompartment within a primary cilium plays an important role in cardiovascular functions.},

Despite the recent development of functional neural probes, a flexible biocompatible probe unit that allows for long-term simultaneous stimulation and signaling is still an important task. Here, a category of flexible tiny multimaterial fiber probes (&lt;0.3 g) is described in which the metal electrodes are regularly embedded inside a biocompatible polymer fiber with a double-clad optical waveguide by thermal drawing. Significantly, this arrangement enables great improvement in mechanical properties, achieves high optical transmission (&gt;90%), and effectively minimizes the impedance (by up to one order of magnitude) of the probe. This ability allows to realize long-term (at least 10 weeks) simultaneous optical stimulation and neural recording at the single-cell level in behaving mice with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 30 dB) that is more than 6 times that of the benchmark probe such as an all-polymer fiber.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and low-cost production of high-quality aluminum nitride (AlN) films during heteroepitaxy is the key for the development of deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs). Here, the quasi-2D growth of high-quality AlN film with low strain and low dislocation density on graphene (Gr) is presented and a high-performance 272 nm DUV-LED is demonstrated. Guided by first-principles calculations, it is found that AlN grown on Gr prefers lateral growth both energetically and kinetically, thereby resulting in a Gr-driven quasi-2D growth mode. The strong lateral growth mode enables most of dislocations to annihilate each other at the AlN/Gr interface, and therefore the AlN epilayer can quickly coalesce and flatten the nanopatterned sapphire substrate. Based on the high quality and low strain of AlN film grown on Gr, the as-fabricated 272 nm DUV-LED shows a 22% enhancement of output power than that with low-temperature AlN buffer, following a negligible wavelength shift under high current. This facile strategy opens a pathway to drastically improve the performance of DUV-LEDs.},

  abstract     = {Collective cellular behavior in confluent monolayers supports physiological and pathological processes of epithelial development, regeneration, and carcinogenesis. Here, the attainment of a mature and static tissue configuration or the local reactivation of cell motility involve a dynamic regulation of the junctions established between neighboring cells. Tricellular junctions (tTJs), established at vertexes where three cells meet, are ideally located to control cellular shape and coordinate multicellular movements. However, their function in epithelial tissue dynamic remains poorly defined. To investigate the role of tTJs establishment and maturation in the jamming and unjamming transitions of epithelial monolayers, a semi-automatic image-processing pipeline is developed and validated enabling the unbiased and spatially resolved determination of the tTJ maturity state based on the localization of fluorescent reporters. The software resolves the variation of tTJ maturity accompanying collective transitions during tissue maturation, wound healing, and upon the adaptation to osmolarity changes. Altogether, this work establishes junctional maturity at tricellular contacts as a novel biological descriptor of collective responses in epithelial monolayers.},

However, more clinically relevant evaluation conducted under pathological condition is less known. Here, the immunogenicity and bio–nano interactions of porous silicon nanoparticles (PSi NPs) are evaluated in an acute liver inflammation mice model. Interestingly, a new mechanism in which PSi NPs can remit the hepatocellular damage and inflammation activation in a surface dependent manner through protein corona formation, which perturbs the inflammation by capturing the pro-inflammatory signaling proteins that are inordinately excreted or exposed under pathological condition, is found. This signal sequestration further attenuates the nuclear factor κ B pathway activation and cytokines production from macrophages. Hence, the study proposes a potential mechanism for elucidating the altered immunogenicity of nanomaterials under pathological conditions, which might further offer insights to establish harmonized standards for assessing the biosafety of biomaterials in a disease-specific or personalized manner.},

A significant influence of the angles between oriented cell walls and the incident EM wave electric field direction on the EMI shielding performance is revealed, providing an intriguing microstructure design strategy. MXene “bricks” bonded by CNF “mortars” of the nacre-like cell walls induce high mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and interfacial polarization, yielding the resultant MXene/CNF aerogels an ultrahigh EMI shielding performance. The EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the aerogels reaches 74.6 or 35.5 dB at a density of merely 8.0 or 1.5 mg cm –3 , respectively.

Using the relatively high-efficiency poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PCE11):phenyl-C61-butyric acid-methyl-ester acceptor (PCBM) blend systems, it is demonstrated that by means of straight-forward thermal analysis, vapor-phase-infiltration imaging, and transient-absorption spectroscopy, various blend compositions and processing methodologies can be rapidly screened, information on promising combinations can be obtained, reliability issues with respect to reproducibility of thin-film formation can be identified, and insights into how processing aids, such as nucleating agents, affect structure formation, can be gained.},

  abstract     = {One-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures have already been used for a variety of optoelectronic applications. Metal halide perovskites have emerged in recent years as promising high-performance optoelectronic materials, but reports on 1D nanorods (NRs) of all-inorganic halide perovskites are still scarce. This work demonstrates a synthetic strategy toward cesium-based inorganic perovskite NRs by exploiting composition-controlled crystal phase engineering. It is accomplished for Cd-rich mixed-cation CsPb 1- x Cd x Br 3 nanocrystals, where the initial 1D hexagonal perovskite phase drives the growth of the 1D NRs, as supported by first-principles calculations. The band gaps of the resulting NRs are tunable by varying the Cd-content, and the highly uniform CsPb 0.08 Cd 0.92 Br 3 NRs (with an average length of 84 nm and width of 16 nm) exhibit a true blue-color emission centered at 460 nm, with a high quantum yield of 48%. Moreover, this work also demonstrates the tunability of the Fermi levels in the films made of CsPb 1- x Cd x Br 3 alloyed nanocrystals, where samples with highest Cd content show an increase of the electron concentration and a related increase in the conductivity.},

  abstract     = {Metal oxide nanoparticles have emerged as exceptionally potent biomedical sensors and actuators due to their unique physicochemical features. Despite fascinating achievements, the current limited understanding of the molecular interplay between nanoparticles and the surrounding tissue remains a major obstacle in the rationalized development of nanomedicines, which is reflected in their poor clinical approval rate. This work reports on the nanoscopic characterization of inorganic nanoparticles in tissue by the example of complex metal oxide nanoparticle hybrids consisting of crystalline cerium oxide and the biodegradable ceramic bioglass. A validated analytical method based on semiquantitative X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry is used to assess nanoparticle biodistribution following intravenous and topical application. Then, a correlative multiscale analytical cascade based on a combination of microscopy and spectroscopy techniques shows that the topically applied hybrid nanoparticles remain at the initial site and are preferentially taken up into macrophages, form apatite on their surface, and lead to increased accumulation of lipids in their surroundings. Taken together, this work displays how modern analytical techniques can be harnessed to gain unprecedented insights into the biodistribution and biotransformation of complex inorganic nanoparticles. Such nanoscopic characterization is imperative for the rationalized engineering of safe and efficacious nanoparticle-based systems.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of interest for optoelectronic applications owing to their tunable properties and ease of processing. Large-diameter CQDs offer optical response in the infrared (IR), beyond the bandgap of c-Si and perovskites. The absorption coefficient of IR CQDs (≈10 4 cm −1 ) entails the need for micrometer-thick films to maximize the absorption of IR light. This exceeds the thickness compatible with the efficient extraction of photogenerated carriers, a fact that limits device performance. Here, CQD bulk heterojunction solids are demonstrated that, with extended carrier transport length, enable efficient IR light harvesting. An in-solution doping strategy for large-diameter CQDs is devised that addresses the complex interplay between (100) facets and doping agents, enabling to control CQD doping, energetic configuration, and size homogeneity. The hetero-offset between n -type CQDs and p -type CQDs is manipulated to drive the transfer of electrons and holes into distinct carrier extraction pathways. This enables to form active layers exceeding thicknesses of 700 nm without compromising open-circuit voltage and fill factor. As a result, &gt;90% charge extraction efficiency across the ultraviolet to IR range (350–1400 nm) is documented.},

Recent wearable devices have been used to monitor stress levels via electrodermal activities on the skin. Although many biosensors provide adequate sensing performance, they still rely on uncomfortable, partially flexible systems with rigid electronics. These devices are mounted on either fingers or palms, which hinders a continuous signal monitoring. A fully-integrated, stretchable, wireless skin-conformal bioelectronic (referred to as “SKINTRONICS”) is introduced here that integrates soft, multi-layered, nanomembrane sensors and electronics for continuous and portable stress monitoring in daily life. The all-in-one SKINTRONICS is ultrathin, highly soft, and lightweight, which overall offers an ergonomic and conformal lamination on the skin. Stretchable nanomembrane electrodes and a digital temperature sensor enable highly sensitive monitoring of galvanic skin response (GSR) and temperature. A set of comprehensive signal processing, computational modeling, and experimental study provides key aspects of device design, fabrication, and optimal placing location. Simultaneous comparison with two commercial stress monitors captures the enhanced performance of SKINTRONICS in long-term wearability, minimal noise, and skin compatibility. In vivo demonstration of continuous stress monitoring in daily life reveals the unique capability of the soft device as a real-world applicable stress monitor.},

Here, the anisotropic morphologies of APBs (i.e., linear and saw-toothed APBs) in the nanoscale are investigated. The experimental and computational results show that despite their anisotropic nanoscale morphologies, all APBs adopt a predominantly chalcogen-oriented dense structure to maintain the energetically most stable atomic configuration. Moreover, the effect of the nanoscale morphology of an APB on electron transport from two-probe field effect transistor measurements is investigated. A saw-toothed APB has a considerably lower electron mobility than a linear APB, indicating that kinks between facets are the main factors of scattering. The observations contribute to the systematical understanding of the faceted APBs and its impact on electrical transport behavior and it could potentially extend the applications of 2D materials through defect engineering to achieve the desired properties.},

Here, a facile and highly scalable technique for the rational design of reconfigurable arrays of cells is reported. Specifically, microdroplets of cell suspensions are assembled using stretchable surface-chemical patterns which, following incubation, yield ordered arrays of cells. The microdroplets are generated using a microfluidic-based aerosol spray nozzle that enables control of the volume/size of the droplets delivered to the surface. Assembly of the cell-loaded microdroplets is achieved via mechanically induced coalescence using substrates with engineered surface-wettability patterns based on extracellular matrices. Robust cell proliferation inside the patterned areas is demonstrated using standard culture techniques. By combining the scalability of aerosol-based delivery and microdroplet surface assembly with user-defined chemical patterns of controlled functionality, the technique reported here provides an innovative methodology for the scalable generation of large-area cell arrays with flexible geometries and tunable resolution.},

  abstract     = {Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a top-priority pathogen globally and polymyxins are a last-line therapy. Polymyxin dependence in A. baumannii (i.e., nonculturable on agar without polymyxins) is a unique and highly-resistant phenotype with a significant potential to cause treatment failure in patients. The present study discovers that a polymyxin-dependent A. baumannii strain possesses mutations in both lpxC (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis) and katG (reactive oxygen species scavenging) genes. Correlative multiomics analyses show a significantly remodeled cell envelope and remarkably abundant phosphatidylglycerol in the outer membrane (OM). Molecular dynamics simulations and quantitative membrane lipidomics reveal that polymyxin-dependent growth emerges only when the lipopolysaccharide-deficient OM distinctively remodels with ≥ 35% phosphatidylglycerol, and with “patch” binding on the OM by the rigid polymyxin molecules containing strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Rather than damaging the OM, polymyxins bind to the phosphatidylglycerol-rich OM and strengthen the membrane integrity, thereby protecting bacteria from external reactive oxygen species. Dependent growth is observed exclusively with polymyxin analogues, indicating a critical role of the specific amino acid sequence of polymyxins in forming unique structures for patch-binding to bacterial OM. Polymyxin dependence is a novel antibiotic resistance mechanism and the current findings highlight the risk of ‘invisible’ polymyxin-dependent isolates in the evolution of resistance.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular electron transfer (EET) denotes the process of microbial respiration with electron transfer to extracellular acceptors and has been exploited in a range of microbial electrochemical systems (MESs). To further understand EET and to optimize the performance of MESs, a better understanding of the dynamics at the microscale is needed. However, the real-time monitoring of EET at high spatiotemporal resolution would require sophisticated signal amplification. To amplify local EET signals, a miniaturized bioelectronic device, the so-called organic microbial electrochemical transistor (OMECT), is developed, which includes Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 integrated onto organic electrochemical transistors comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) combined with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Bacteria are attached to the gate of the transistor by a chronoamperometric method and the successful attachment is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Monitoring EET with the OMECT configuration is achieved due to the inherent amplification of the transistor, revealing fast time-responses to lactate. The limits of detection when using microfabricated gates as charge collectors are also investigated. The work is a first step toward understanding and monitoring EET in highly confined spaces via microfabricated organic electronic devices, and it can be of importance to study exoelectrogens in microenvironments, such as those of the human microbiome.},

However, carbonaceous materials with graphite-layers structure usually suffer from poor cycle life and inferior stability, not to mention freestanding and flexible PIBs. Here, a freestanding and flexible 3D hybrid architecture by introducing carbon dots on the reduced graphene oxide surface (CDs@rGO) is synthesized as high performance PIBs anode. The CDs@rGO paper has efficient electron and ion transfer channels due to its unique structure, thus enhancing reaction kinetics. In addition, the CDs provide abundant defects and oxygen-containing functional groups, which can improve the electrochemical performance. This freestanding and flexible anode exhibits the high capacity of 310 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 , ultra-long cycle life (840 cycles with a capacity of 244 mAh g −1 at 200 mA g −1 ), and excellent rate performance (undergo six consecutive currents changing from 100 to 500 mA g −1 , high capacity 185 mAh g −1 at 500 mA g −1 ), outperforming many existing carbonaceous PIB anodes. The results may provide a starting point for high-performance freestanding and flexible PIBs and promote the rapid development of next-generation flexible batteries.},

  abstract     = {The liver is a highly regenerative organ. While mature hepatocytes under homeostatic conditions are largely quiescent, upon injury, they rapidly enter the cell cycle to recover the damaged tissue. In rodents, a variety of injury models have provided important insights into the molecular underpinnings that govern the proliferative activation of quiescent hepatocytes. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of human hepatocyte regeneration and experimental methods to expand primary human hepatocytes (PHH). Here, a 3D spheroid model of PHH is established to study hepatocyte regeneration and integrative time-lapse multi-omics analyses show that upon isolation from the native liver PHH acquire a regenerative phenotype, as seen in vivo upon partial hepatectomy. However, proliferation is limited. By analyzing global promoter motif activities, it is predicted that activation of Wnt/ β -catenin and inhibition of p53 signaling are critical factors required for human hepatocyte proliferation. Functional validations reveal that activation of Wnt signaling through external cues alone is sufficient to inhibit p53 and its proliferative senescence-inducing target PAI1 (SERPINE1) and drive proliferation of &gt;50% of all PHH. A scalable 3D culture model is established to study the molecular and cellular biology of human hepatocyte regeneration. By using this model, an essential role of Wnt/ β -catenin signaling during human hepatocyte regeneration is identified.},

  abstract     = {Achieving an ideal morphology is an imperative avenue for enhancing key parameters toward high-performing organic solar cells (OSCs). Among a myriad of morphological-control methods, the strategy of incorporating a third component with structural similarity and crystallinity difference to construct ternary OSCs has emerged as an effective approach to regulate morphology. A nematic liquid-crystalline benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodamine (BTR) molecule, which possesses the same alkylthio-thienyl-substituted benzo moiety but obviously stronger crystallinity compared to classical medium-bandgap polymeric donor PM6, is employed as a third component to construct ternary OSCs based on a PM6:BTR:Y6 system. The doping of BTR (5 wt%) is found to be enough to improve the OSC morphology—significantly enhancing the crystallinity of the photoactive layer while slightly reducing the donor/acceptor phase separation scale simultaneously. Rarely is such a morphology evolution reported. It positively affects the electronic properties of the device—prolongs the carrier lifetime, shortens the photocurrent decay time, facilitates exciton dissociation, charge transport, and collection, and ultimately boosts the power conversion efficiency from 15.7% to 16.6%. This result demonstrates that the successful synergy of liquid-crystalline small-molecule and polymeric donors delicately adjusts the active-layer morphology and refines device performance, which brings vibrancy to the OSC research field.},

  abstract     = {Wearable photonics offer a promising platform to complement the thriving complex wearable electronics system by providing high-speed data transmission channels and robust optical sensing paths. Regarding the realization of photonic computation and tunable (de)multiplexing functions based on system-level integration of abundant photonic modulators, it is challenging to reduce the overwhelming power consumption in traditional current-based silicon photonic modulators. This issue is addressed by integrating voltage-based aluminum nitride (AlN) modulator and textile triboelectric nanogenerator (T-TENG) on a wearable platform to form a nano-energy-nano-system (NENS). The T-TENG transduces the mechanical stimulations into electrical signals based on the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction. The self-generated high-voltage from the T-TENG is applied to the AlN modulator and boosts its modulation efficiency regardless of AlN&#39;s moderate Pockels effect. Complementarily, the AlN modulator&#39;s capacitive nature enables the open-circuit operation mode of T-TENG, providing the integrated NENS with continuous force sensing capability which is notably uninfluenced by operation speeds. Furthermore, a physical model is proposed to describe the coupled AlN modulator/T-TENG system. With the enhanced photonic modulation and the open-circuit operation mode enabled by synergies between the AlN modulator and the T-TENG, optical Morse code transmission and continuous human motion monitoring are demonstrated for practical wearable applications.},

The prostate cancer (PC) cells derived from different cancer metastasis sites show heterogeneity in mechanical response. This heterogeneity mediates two distinct metastasis patterns. High stiffness promotes individual cell migration and proliferation by inducing Yes-associated protein and tafazzin (YAP/TAZ) nuclear localization in bone metastasis-derived cells, whereas low stiffness promotes cell migration and proliferation by inducing lymphatic metastasis-derived cells to form clusters characterized by high expression of CD44.

Currently employed mainstream modalities using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in diagnosis and treatment are limited by a lack of specificity and potential issues associated with systemic toxicity. Light-mediated nanotheranostics offers a relatively non-invasive alternative for cancer diagnosis and treatment by using AuNPs of specific shapes and sizes that absorb near infrared (NIR) light, inducing plasmon resonance for enhanced tumor detection and generating localized heat for tumor ablation. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in the field of nanotheranostics, however the main biological and translational barriers to nanotheranostics leading to a new paradigm in anti-cancer nanomedicine stem from the molecular complexities of cancer and an incomplete mechanistic understanding of utilization of Au-NPs in living systems. This work provides a comprehensive overview on the biological, physical and translational barriers facing the development of nanotheranostics.

Here, contribution of BMP-2 signaling and extracellular mechanical cues to the osteogenic commitment of C2C12 cells is investigated. It is revealed that these two distinct pathways are integrated at the transcriptional level to provide multifactorial control of cell differentiation. The activation of osteogenic genes requires the cooperation of BMP-2 pathway-associated Smad1/5/8 heteromeric complexes and mechanosensitive YAP/TAZ translocation. It is further demonstrated that the Smad complexes remain bound onto and active on target genes, even after BMP-2 removal, suggesting that they act as a “molecular memory unit.” Thus, synergistic stimulation with BMP-2 and mechanical cues drives osteogenic differentiation in a programmable fashion.},

  abstract     = {Control of blood microflow is crucial for the prevention and therapy of blood disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases and their complications. Conventional control strategies generally implant exogenous synthetic materials into blood vessels as labeling markers or actuating sources, which are invasive and incompatible with biological systems. Here, a label-free, noninvasive, and biocompatible device constructed from natural red blood cells (RBCs) for controlling blood microflow in vivo is reported. The RBCs, optically manipulated, arranged, and rotated using scanning optical tweezers, can function as an optofluidic switch for targeted switching, directional enrichment, dynamic redirecting, and rotary actuation of blood microflow inside zebrafish. The regulation precision of the switch is determined to be at the single-cell level, and the response time is measured as ≈200 ms using a streamline tracking method. This in vivo optofluidic switch may provide a biofriendly device for exploring blood microenvironments in a noncontact and noninvasive manner.},

Thanks to the hydrophobic microenvironment of the cyclodextrin cavity and the shielding effect on oxygen molecules, the anthraquinone group, as the guest molecule, can rapidly produce 9,10-anthracenediol (QH 2 ) with strong fluorescence by photoreduction. Interestingly, the generated anthracenediol group is still sensitive to oxygen and can be converted to anthraquinone by oxygen. Significantly, aqueous solution of AQ- β -CD supermolecular polymer is used as emitting ink, which decrypts the information by ultraviolet light and encrypts the information in the air.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating active materials into metamaterials is expected to yield exciting advancements in the unprecedented versatility of dynamically controlling optical properties, which sheds new light on the future optoelectronics. The exploration of emerging semiconductors into terahertz (THz) meta-atoms potentially allows achieving ultrafast nanodevices driven by various applications, such as biomedical sensing/imaging, ultrawide-band communications and security scanners. However, ultrafast optical switching of THz radiation is currently limited to a single level of tuning speed, which is a main hurdle to achieve multifunctionalities. Here, a hybrid metadevice which can realize the pump-wavelength controlled ultrafast switching response by the functionalization of double photoactive layers is demonstrated experimentally. A whole cycle of electromagnetically induced transparency switching with a half-recovery state changes from 0.78 ns to 8.8 ps as pump wavelength varies from near infrared to near ultraviolet regions. The observed pump-color selective switching speed changing from nanosecond scale to picosecond scale is ascribed to the wavelength-dependent penetration length of Ge and the contrasting defect states between noncrystalline Ge and epitaxial Si layers. It is believed that the schemes regarding pump-color controllable ultrafast switching behavior introduced here can inspire more innovations across the field of ultrafast photonics and can boost the reconfigurable metamaterial applications.},

  abstract     = {Trivalent lanthanide (Ln 3+ )-doped hollow upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) usually exhibit unique optical performance that cannot be realized in their solid counterparts, and thus have been receiving tremendous interest from their fundamentals to diverse applications. However, all currently available Ln 3+ -doped UCNCs are solid in appearance, the preparation of hollow UCNCs remains nearly untouched hitherto. Herein, a class of UCNCs based on Yb 3+ /Er 3+ -doped tetralithium zirconium octafluoride (Li 4 ZrF 8 :Yb/Er) featuring 2D layered crystal lattice is reported, which makes the fabrication of hollow UCNCs with a peasecod-like shape possible after Ln 3+ doping. By employing the first-principle calculations, the unique peasecod-like hollow nanoarchitecture primarily associated with the hetero-valence Yb 3+ /Er 3+ doping into the 2D layered crystal lattice of Li 4 ZrF 8 matrix is revealed. Benefiting from this hollow nanoarchitecture, the resulting Li 4 ZrF 8 :Yb/Er UCNCs exhibit an abnormal green upconversion luminescence in terms of the population ratio between two thermally coupled states ( 2 H 11/2 and 4 S 3/2 ) of Er 3+ relative to their solid Li 2 ZrF 6 :Yb/Er counterparts, thereby allowing to prepare the first family of hollow Ln 3+ -doped UCNCs as supersensitive luminescent nanothermometer with almost the widest temperature sensing range (123–800 K). These findings described here unambiguously pave a new way to fabricate hollow Ln 3+ -doped UCNCs for numerous applications.},

Also, a comprehensive evaluation of the neurobiological basis and generalizability of the end-to-end machine learning system should be given the highest priority. For this reason, a deep learning model (3D attention network, 3DAN) that can simultaneously capture candidate imaging biomarkers with an attention mechanism module and advance the diagnosis of AD based on structural magnetic resonance imaging is proposed. The generalizability and reproducibility are evaluated using cross-validation on in-house, multicenter ( n = 716), and public ( n = 1116) databases with an accuracy up to 92%. Significant associations between the classification output and clinical characteristics of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a middle stage of dementia) groups provide solid neurobiological support for the 3DAN model. The effectiveness of the 3DAN model is further validated by its good performance in predicting the MCI subjects who progress to AD with an accuracy of 72%. Collectively, the findings highlight the potential for structural brain imaging to provide a generalizable, and neuroscientifically interpretable imaging biomarker that can support clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD.},

Based on surflex-docking computation, α -GalCer-diol, with added hydroxyl groups in the acyl chain, is designed and synthesized. Structural analyses reveal stronger affinity between α -GalCer-diol and cluster of differentiation 1d (CD1d), leading to enhanced antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) and self-activation, as reflected by tight binding of the T-cell receptor (TCR)/KRN7000/CD1d ternary complex and elevated production of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interferon- γ (IFN- γ ). Consequently, invariant natural killer T cells (iNKTs) are activated and exhibit an improved Th1-type cytokine profile ex vivo and in vivo. Different from KRN7000, α -GalCer-diol markedly boosts the expansion of the CD11b + subpopulation and enhances IFN- γ content in CD11b + cells. These reinforced Th1-type responses collectively endow α -GalCer-diol more robust antitumor activity in a xenograft animal model using B16-F10 melanoma cells. Together, the data demonstrate a new mechanism through which α -GalCer-diol induces stronger Th1-type responses by stimulating CD11b + leukocyte expansion and DC-conducted CD1d-restricted and TCR-mediated iNKT activation. Hence, this study may facilitate the development of novel Th1 priming agonists.},

  abstract     = {Lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT) occurs in response to nutritional signals and helps to regulate lipid turnover/adiposity in animals. However, the causal relationships and the mechanisms controlling WAT morphology are not clear. In this report, Vanin-1, a pantetheinase, is shown to be a novel determinant for lipolysis and adiposity. The expression of Vanin-1 in the abdominal WAT is positively correlated with lipolysis both in mice and in humans. Mice with global Vanin-1 deficiency exhibit adipocyte hypertrophy and impaired lipolysis. Use of a nanosystem comprising P3-peptide, chitosan oligosaccharide lactate, and polyethylene glycol that controls Vanin-1 expression in the abdominal WAT shows that WAT-specific Vanin-1 knockdown blocks fasting-induced lipolysis and prevents WAT loss. However, WAT-specific Vanin-1 mRNA restoration rescues impaired lipolysis and improves glucose/insulin intolerance in diabetic db/db mice. Mechanistically, Vanin-1 induces PPAR γ activity and subsequently facilitates its activation on the proximal promoters of lipolytic genes. Thus, an essential role of Vanin-1 in the regulation of lipolysis and adiposity is revealed, and a functional RNA delivering strategy for specific intervention of Vanin-1 expression in WAT is shown. These findings provide a promising approach to treat metabolic diseases caused by dysregulation of Vanin-1 and lipolysis.},

  abstract     = {RNA helicase DDX21 plays vital roles in ribosomal RNA biogenesis, transcription, and the regulation of host innate immunity during virus infection. How DDX21 recognizes and unwinds RNA and how DDX21 interacts with virus remain poorly understood. Here, crystal structures of human DDX21 determined in three distinct states are reported, including the apo-state, the AMPPNP plus single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) bound pre-hydrolysis state, and the ADP-bound post-hydrolysis state, revealing an open to closed conformational change upon RNA binding and unwinding. The core of the RNA unwinding machinery of DDX21 includes one wedge helix, one sensor motif V and the DEVD box, which links the binding pockets of ATP and ssRNA. The mutant D339H/E340G dramatically increases RNA binding activity. Moreover, Hill coefficient analysis reveals that DDX21 unwinds double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in a cooperative manner. Besides, the nonstructural (NS1) protein of influenza A inhibits the ATPase and unwinding activity of DDX21 via small RNAs, which cooperatively assemble with DDX21 and NS1. The structures illustrate the dynamic process of ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding for RNA helicases, and the RNA modulated interaction between NS1 and DDX21 generates a fresh perspective toward the virus–host interface. It would benefit in developing therapeutics to combat the influenza virus infection.},

  abstract     = {Post-translational modification of proteins by N -linked glycosylation is crucial for many life processes. However, the exact contribution of N -glycosylation to mammalian female reproduction remains largely undefined. Here, DPAGT1, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of protein N -glycosylation, is identified to be indispensable for oocyte development in mice. Dpagt1 missense mutation (c. 497A&gt;G; p. Asp166Gly) causes female subfertility without grossly affecting other functions. Mutant females ovulate fewer eggs owing to defective development of growing follicles. Mutant oocytes have a thin and fragile zona pellucida (ZP) due to the reduction in glycosylation of ZP proteins, and display poor developmental competence after fertilization in vitro. Moreover, completion of the first meiosis is accelerated in mutant oocytes, which is coincident with the elevation of aneuploidy. Mechanistically, transcriptomic analysis reveals the downregulation of a number of transcripts essential for oocyte meiotic progression and preimplantation development (e.g., Pttgt1 , Esco2 , Orc6 , and Npm2 ) in mutant oocytes, which could account for the defects observed. Furthermore, conditional knockout of Dpagt1 in oocytes recapitulates the phenotypes observed in Dpagt1 mutant females, and causes complete infertility. Taken together, these data indicate that protein N -glycosylation in oocytes is essential for female fertility in mammals by specific control of oocyte development.},

  abstract     = {This work summarizes recent developments in polymer solar cells (PSCs) prepared by a chlorination strategy. The intrinsic property of chlorine atoms, the progress of chlorinated polymers and small molecules, and the synergistic effect of chlorination with other methods to elevate solar conversions are discussed. Halogenation of donor–acceptor (D–A) materials is an effective method to improve the performance of PSCs, which mainly affects the push–pull of electrons between donor and acceptor units due to their strong electron-withdrawing capabilities. Although chlorine is less electronegative than fluorine, it can form very strong noncovalent interactions, such as Cl···S and Cl··· π interactions, because its empty 3d orbits can help to accept the electron pairs or π electrons. This synergistic effect of electronegativity together with the empty 3d orbits of chlorine atoms leads to increased intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and a much stronger capability to down-shift the molecular energy levels. This work is intended to support a better understanding of the chlorination strategy to modify the material properties, and thus improve the performance of solar devices. Eventually, it will provide the research community with a clearer pathway to choose proper substitution methods according to different situations for high and stable solar energy conversion.},

Here, a set of phototunable and photoreconfigurable electronic and photonic devices composed of reconfigurable arithmetic circuits and programmable coding metamaterials at terahertz frequencies, empowered by a diffractive optics platform using naturally extracted silk proteins, is reported. These protein-based diffract optics are precisely manufactured into special microstructures for phase modulation of incident light and can be programmed to degrade at controlled rates. This allows spatial and temporal transformation of the incident light into desired intensity profiles to modulate the electrical properties of multiple photosensitive elements/components within the device simultaneously or discretely. Thus, the optoelectronic functionality of fabricated devices can be tailored to specific applications. Therefore, the approach makes it possible to efficiently fabricate tunable, reconfigurable transient electronic and photonic devices and systems.},

They are prepared by conjugating linear and cross-linked poly(carboxylate ester) (PCE) with poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG 2000 )-modified nitroxides (PROXYL), respectively. Both mORCAs form self-assembled aggregates in an aqueous phase and PROXYL is protected inside a hydrophobic core to achieve great resistance to reduction in the physiological environment, and they have low toxicity. Since cross-linked PCE-mPEG-Ppa-PROXYL possess a branched architecture, its self-assembled aggregate is more stable and compact with a greater particle size. Cross-linked PCE-mPEG-Ppa-PROXYL outperform the linear one in the following aspects: 1) its longitudinal relaxivity ( r 1 = 0.79 m m −1 s −1 ) is higher than that of the linear one ( r 1 = 0.64 m m −1 s −1 ) and both excel the best mORCA reported so far ( r 1 = 0.42 m m −1 s −1 ); 2) its blood retention time (≈48 h) is longer than that of its linear counterpart (≈10 h); 3) cross-linked PCE-mPEG-Ppa-PROXYL provided better MR imaging contrast resolution in normal organs (liver and kidney) and tumor of mice than the linear one. Overall, cross-linked PCE-mPEG-Ppa-PROXYL may have great potential to be a novel metal-free macromolecular contrast agent for MR imaging.},

Ru-NBD is nonluminescent due to the quenching of Ru(II) complex emission by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from Ru(II) center to NBD and the quenching of NBD emission through 4-substitution with “O” ether bond. Ru-NBD is capable of reacting with Cys/Hcy to form long-lived red-emitting Ru-OH and short-lived green-emitting NBD-NR, while reacting with GSH to produce Ru-OH and nonemissive NBD-SR. The long lifetime emission of Ru(II) complex allows elimination of short lifetime background and NBD-NR fluorescence for total biothiols detection (“bird” one) by time-gated luminescence (TGL) analysis, and the remarkable difference in luminescence color response allows discrimination GSH and Cys/Hcy (“bird” two) through steady-state luminescence analysis. Ru-NBD features high sensitivity and selectivity, rapid luminescence response, and low cytotoxicity, which enables it to be used as the probe for luminescence and background-free TGL detection and visualization of biothiols in live cells, zebrafish, and mice. The successful development of this probe is anticipated to contribute to the future biological studies of biothiols roles in various diseases.},

A magnetic field created by a permanent magnet induces instability on a mother droplet, which divides into two daughter droplets in less than 0.1 s. During the splitting process, the droplet undergoes a Plateau–Rayleigh-like instability, which is investigated using high-speed imaging. The dynamics of the resulting satellite droplet formation is shown to depend on the roughness of the supporting surface. Further increasing the field results in additional splitting events and self-assembly of microdroplet populations, which can be magnetically actuated. The effects of magnetization and interfacial tension are systematically investigated by varying magnetic nanoparticles and surfactant concentrations, and a variety of outcomes from labyrinthine patterns to discrete droplets are observed. As the splitting process depends on interfacial tension, the droplet splitting can be used as a measure for interfacial tension as low as 0.1 mN m −1 . Finally, a population-based digital microfluidics concept based on the self-assembled microdroplets is presented.},

With great energy harvesting and human motion sensing capabilities, the glove using the superhydrophobic textile realizes a low-cost and self-powered interface for gesture recognition. By leveraging machine learning technology, various gesture recognition tasks are done in real time by using gestures to achieve highly accurate virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) controls including gun shooting, baseball pitching, and flower arrangement, with minimized effect from sweat during operation.},

  abstract     = {Conventional intercalation compounds for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) suffer from rapid capacity fading and are even unable to charge–discharge with temperature decline, owing to the sluggish kinetics and solvation/desolvation process. In this work, a high-performance rechargeable battery at ultralow temperature is developed by employing a nanosized Ni-based Prussian blue (NiHCF) cathode. The battery delivers a high capacity retention of 89% (low temperature of −50 °C) and 82% (ultralow temperature of −70 °C) compared with that at +25 °C. Various characterizations and electrochemical investigations, including operando Fourier transform infrared spectra, in situ X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry response, and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique are carried out to detect the structural stability and electrochemical behavior at different temperatures. It turns out that the pseudocapacitive behavior drives the desolvation process at the interface, while fast diffusion in the bulk electrode accelerates the movement of Li + from the interface to the bulk materials. The unique synergistic features of intercalation pseudocapacitance at the electrolyte/electrode interface and high diffusion coefficient in the bulk electrode enables the NiHCF cathode with excellent low temperature performance. These findings offer a new direction for the design of LIBs operated at low temperature.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging branch of energy conversion technologies, the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) pioneers a brand-new path to effectively harness varieties of mechanical energies for the purpose of powering and/or sensing. Since its invention in 2012, the TENG has experienced a booming and revolutionary development in every respect, ranging from materials synthesis and modification, architecture design to performance optimization, power management, and application exploration. In comparison to the organic solar cell and organic light-emitting diodes, TENG is a unique technique that opens the venue of using polymer materials (PMs) for harvesting mechanical energy. So far, by virtue of superior charge transfer and capturing capabilities during friction, various kinds of PMs have been developed and used as triboelectric materials in order to achieve high-performance TENGs. Here, this work focuses on the utilization and development of PMs for the TENGs technology and first gives a summary of main PMs that are frequently adopted in currently reported energy-harvesting TENGs. Second, several kinds of PMs used lately in a few novel TENGs for special or specific energy-harvesting circumstances are introduced and highlighted. Finally, the perspectives on and challenges in developing high-performance PMs toward TENGs technology are conceived and expected to be instructive to future research.},

However, the reliability of the battery systems always suffers from the serious challenge of the large Zn dendrite formation and “dead Zn,” thus bringing out the inferior cycling stability, and even cell shorting. Herein, a dendrite-free organic anode, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) polymerized on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (PTCDI/rGO) utilized in ZIBs is reported. Moreover, the theoretical calculations prove the reason for the low redox potential. Due to the protons and zinc ions coparticipant phase transfer mechanism and the high charge transfer capability, the PTCDI/rGO electrode provides superior rate capability (121 mA h g −1 at 5000 mA g −1 , retaining the 95% capacity of that compared with 50 mA g −1 ) and a long cycling life span (96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 3000 mA g −1 ). In addition, the proton coparticipation energy storage mechanism of active materials is elucidated by various ex-situ methods.},

However, it is difficult to develop GTPases inhibitors due to a lack of well-characterized binding pockets for compounds. Here, through molecular dynamics simulation of the RhoA protein, a groove around cysteine 107 (Cys107) that is relatively well-conserved within the Rho family is discovered. Using a combined strategy, the novel inhibitor DC-Rhoin is discovered, which disrupts interaction of Rho proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Crystallographic studies reveal that the covalent binding of DC-Rhoin to the Cys107 residue stabilizes and captures a novel allosteric pocket. Moreover, the derivative compound DC-Rhoin04 inhibits the migration and invasion of cancer cells, through targeting this allosteric pocket of RhoA. The study reveals a novel allosteric regulatory site within the Rho family, which can be exploited for anti-metastasis drug development, and also provides a novel strategy for inhibitor discovery toward “undruggable” protein targets.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are responsible for resistance to chemotherapy, high degree of metastasis, and poor prognosis, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The CD24 low CD44 high and high aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) cell subpopulation (CD24 low CD44 high ALDH1 + ) exhibit very high tumor initiating capacity. In the current study, the upregulated genes are analyzed in both CD24 low CD44 high and ALDH1 + cell populations at single-cell resolution, and a highly expressed membrane protein, SGCE, is identified in both BCSC populations. Further results show that SGCE depletion reduces BCSC self-renewal, chemoresistance, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, partially through affecting the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). For the underlying mechanism, SGCE functions as a sponge molecule for the interaction between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its E3 ubiquitination ligase (c-Cbl), and thus inhibits EGFR lysosomal degradation to stabilize the EGFR protein. SGCE knockdown promotes sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), providing new clues for deciphering the current failure of targeting EGFR in clinical trials and highlighting a novel candidate for BCSC stemness regulation.},

  abstract     = {Waterborne viruses frequently cause disease outbreaks and existing strategies to remove such viral pathogens often involve harsh or energy-consuming water treatment processes. Here, a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly approach is reported to achieve highly selective disinfection of specific viruses with living engineered biofilm materials. As a proof-of-concept, Escherichia coli biofilm matrix protein CsgA was initially genetically fused with the influenza-virus-binding peptide (C5). The resultant engineered living biofilms could correspondingly capture virus particles directly from aqueous solutions, disinfecting samples to a level below the limit-of-detection for a qPCR-based detection assay. By exploiting the surface-adherence properties of biofilms, it is further shown that polypropylene filler materials colonized by the CsgA-C5 biofilms can be utilized to disinfect river water samples with influenza titers as high as 1 × 10 7 PFU L −1 . Additionally, a suicide gene circuit is designed and applied in the engineered strain that strictly limits the growth of bacterial, therefore providing a viable route to reduce potential risks confronted with the use of genetically modified organisms. The study thus illustrates that engineered biofilms can be harvested for the disinfection of pathogens from environmental water samples in a controlled manner and highlights the unique biology-only properties of living substances for material applications.},

  abstract     = {The development of gene delivery has attracted increasing attention, especially when the introduction and application of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system appears promising for gene therapy. However, ensuring biosafety and high gene editing efficiency at the same time poses a great challenge for its in vivo applications. Herein, a pardaxin peptide (PAR)-modified cationic liposome (PAR-Lipo) is developed. The results are indicative that significantly enhanced gene editing efficiency can be obtained through the mediation of PAR-Lipos compared to non-Lipos (non-PAR-modified liposomes) and Lipofectamine 2000, owing to its protection toward carried nucleotide by the prevention of lysosomal capture, prolongation of retention time in cells through the accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and more importantly, facilitation of the nuclear access via an ER-nucleus route. Accumulation of PAR-Lipos in the ER may improve the binding of Cas9 and sgRNA, thus further contributing to the eventually enhanced gene editing efficiency. Given their high biosafety, PAR-Lipos are used to mediate the knockout of the oncogene CDC6 in vivo, which results in significant tumor growth inhibition. This work may provide a useful reference for enhancing the delivery of gene editing systems, thus improving the potential for their future clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Integrated sensor–actuators with exciting functionalities, such as action self-sensing, position self-sensing, posture self-sensing, or active sensing, are promising for applications in biomedical device, human–machine interaction, intelligent self-protection devices, and humanoid robots. Despite recent progress, it remains challenging to achieve a macroscopical integrated sensor–actuator in a material system with microstructures. To address this critical challenge, a 4D printing bioinspired microstructure strategy is reported to design a high-performance integrated sensor–actuator capable of simultaneous actuation and sensation. Decoupled thermal stimulation and strain sensation is achieved by combining nanocarbon black/polylactic acid composites with bioinspired gradient microgap structures. As a result, printed integrated sensor–actuators can actively touch objects triggered by thermal stimulation and self-sense the touching state through the resistance change. It is anticipated that the basic design principle underlying this behavior can be used to develop integrated sensor–actuators of various shapes and functionalities to meet desirable applications.},

Hierarchy is achieved by fabricating fibers with pores only on the surface of the fiber, or pores only inside the fiber with a closed surface, or pores that are homogeneously distributed in both the volume and surface of the nanofiber. For the fabrication of hierarchically porous nanofibers, guidelines are formulated. A detailed experimental and simulation study of the influence of different porosities on the electrical output of piezoelectric nanogenerators is presented. It is shown that bulk porosity significantly increases the power output of the comprising nanogenerator, whereas surface porosity deteriorates electrical performance. Finite element method simulations attribute the better performance to increased volumetric strain in bulk porous nanofibers.},

  abstract     = {Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a fatal blood cancer with high patient mortality. Daunorubicin and cytarabine are first-line chemotherapy for AML, with bone marrow transplantation in most cases. Recently, cancer immunotherapy has been challenged in AML and leukemia-niche myeloid cells are promising targets for the AML immunotherapy. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) is an antioxidative and cytoprotective enzyme inducing chemo-resistant AML and has been focused as an immune checkpoint molecule in tumor microenvironments. Herein, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle (hNP) is loaded with tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a HO1-inhibitor, and non-covalently modified with an engineered antibody for leukemic cell-targeted delivery. HO1-inhibiting T-hNP (T-hNP/SnMP) enhances chemo-sensitivity in human leukemia cells. In a human AML-bearing orthotopic mouse model, intravenously injected T-hNP not only actively targets to human leukemia cells but passively targets to CD11b+ myeloid cells in a bone marrow niche. The T-hNP/SnMP enhances the chemo-therapeutic effect of daunorubicin and boosts immune response by reprogramming bone marrow myeloid cells resulting from the recruitment of the monocyte-lineage and induction of inflammatory genes. The ex vivo study demonstrates an enhanced immune response of HO1-inhibited bone marrow CD11b+ myeloid cells against apoptotic leukemia cells. Collectively, HO1-inhibiting dual cell-targeted T-hNP/SnMP has a strong potential as a novel therapeutic in AML.},

  abstract     = {Minimizing the interaction of nanomedicines with the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) is a critical challenge for their clinical translation. Conjugating polyethylene glycol (PEG) to nanomedicines is regarded as an effective approach to reducing the sequestration of nanomedicines by the MPS. However, recent concerns about the immunogenicity of PEG highlight the demand of alternative low-fouling polymers as innovative coating materials for nanoparticles. Herein, a highly hydrophilic sulfoxide-containing polymer—poly(2-(methylsulfinyl)ethyl acrylate) (PMSEA)—is used for the surface coating of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). It is found that the PMSEA polymer coated IONPs have a more hydrophilic surface than their PEGylated counterparts, and demonstrate remarkably reduced macrophage cellular uptake and much less association with human plasma proteins. In vivo study of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics further reveals a much-extended blood circulation (≈2.5 times longer in terms of elimination half-life t 1/2 ) and reduced accumulation (approximately two times less) in the organs such as the liver and spleen for IONPs coated by PMSEA than those by PEG. It is envisaged that the highly hydrophilic sulfoxide-containing polymers have huge potential to be employed as an advantageous alternative to PEG for the surface functionalization of a variety of nanoparticles for long circulation and improved delivery.},

  abstract     = {Hollow spheres are charming objects in nature. In this work, an unexpected deflation–inflation asymmetric growth (DIAG) strategy is reported, generating hollow nanoparticles with tailored concave geometry for interface catalysis. Starting from aminophenol-formaldehyde (APF) nanospheres where the interior crosslinking degree is low, fully deflated nanobowls are obtained after etching by acetone. Due to APF etching and repolymerization reactions occuring asymmetrically within a single particle, an autonomous inflation process is observed similar to a deflated basketball that inflates back to a “normal” ball, which is rare at the nanoscale. A nucleophilic addition reaction between acetone and APF is elucidated to explain the chemistry origin of the DIAG process. Interestingly, the deflated APF hollow spheres enable preferential immobilization of lipase in the concave domain, which facilitates the stabilization of Pickering emulsion droplets for enhanced enzymatic catalysis at the oil–water interface. The study provides new understandings in the designable synthesis of hollow nanoparticles and paves the way toward a wide range of applications of asymmetric architectures.},

This in vitro platform can emulate both a targeted immune response to tissue-specific damage, and holistic proinflammatory immune response to proinflammatory compound exposure. The targeted response features fluorescently labeled THP-1 monocytes selectively infiltrating into an amiodarone-damaged cardiac module and changes in contractile force measurements without immune-activated damage to the other organ modules. In contrast to the targeted immune response, general proinflammatory treatment of immune human-on-a-chip systems with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon- γ (IFN- γ ) causes nonselective damage to cells in all three-organ compartments. Biomarker analysis indicates upregulation of the proinflammation cytokines TNF- α , IL-6, IL-10, MIP-1, MCP-1, and RANTES in response to LPS + IFN- γ treatment indicative of the M1 macrophage phenotype, whereas amiodarone treatment only leads to an increase in the restorative cytokine IL-6 which is a marker for the M2 phenotype. This system can be used as an alternative to humanized animal models to determine direct immunological effects of biological therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and gene therapies, and the indirect effects caused by cytokine release from target tissues in response to a drug&#39;s pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) profile.},

As a proof of concept, seedless growth of silica nanorod arrays on a variety of hydrophilic substrates such as pristine and oxide-modified glass, metal sheets, Si wafers, and biaxially oriented polypropylene film are demonstrated. Also, the silica nanorod arrays can be used as a new platform for the fabrication of catalysts for photothermal CO 2 hydrogenation and the reduction of 4-nitrophenol reactions.

  abstract     = {Utilization of lithium (Li) metal anode in solid-state batteries (SSBs) with sulfide solid-state electrolyte (SSE) is hindered by the instable Li/SSE interface. A general solution to solve this problem is to place an expensive indium (In) foil between the SSE and Li, while it decreases the output voltage and thus the energy density of the battery. In this work, an alternative strategy is demonstrated to boost the cycling performances of SSB by wrapping a graphene oxide (GO) layer on the anode. According to density functional theory results, initial deposition of a thin Li layer on the defective GO sheets leads to the formation of a dipole structure, due to the electron-withdrawing ability of GO acting on Li. By incorporating GO sheets in a nanocomposite of copper-cuprous oxide-GO (Cu-Cu 2 O-GO, CCG), a composite Li anode enables a high coulombic efficiency above 99.5% over 120 cycles for an SSB using Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 SSE and LiCoO 2 cathode, and the sulfide SSE is not chemically decomposed after cycling. The highest occupied molecule orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gap of this Li/GO dipole structure likely stretches over those of Li and sulfide SSE, enabling stabilized Li/SSE interface that can replace the expensive In layer as Li protective structure in SSBs.},

Here, a single-cell study involving 17 432 600 immune cells of 39 matched HCC (T), nontumor (N), and leading-edge (L) specimens by mass cytometry is conducted. The tumor-associated CD4/CD8 double-positive T (DPT) cells are found enriched in L regions with synergetic expression of PD-1/HLA-DR/ICOS/CD45RO and exhibit a higher level of IFN- γ , TNF- α , and PD-1 upon stimulation. The enrichment of DPT and PD-1 + DPT in L regions indicates favorable prognosis. These tumor-associated DPT cells with similar phenotype are also verified in other tumors and HCC animal models. Single-cell RNA-seq further characterizes the molecular features of DPT cells and uncovers 11 clusters with different cytotoxicity, exhaustion, and activation scores. TCR-based trajectory analysis reveals that tumor-associated DPT clusters share separated ancestries with local CD4 + or CD8 + SPT cells rather than CD3 + PBMC cells. TCR clones with frequency above 10 are mainly found coexisting in DPT and CD8 + SPT cells. Specifically, PD-1 high DPT cluster (TDPT_10) shares the same ancestry with exhausted CD8 + SPT cluster (TCD8T_2) and shows higher expression similarity and closer pathological location to PD-1 + CD8 + than PD-1 + CD4 + T cells. Together, this study systematically characterizes the unique distribution of PD-1 + DPTs in HCC and puts forward new insights for the function and origin of tumor-associated DPT cells.},

Overexpression, knockdown, small interfering RNA, and inhibitors are used to examine the role of MLH1 and HER-2 downstream signaling and apoptotic targets in CTX sensitivity. Reduced MLH1 expression is correlated with unfavorable prognosis in cetuximab-treated patients. MLH1 loss decreases CTX sensitivity through Her-2/PI3K/AKT signaling and apoptosis resistance in culture and in xenografts, while MLH1 overexpression increases CTX sensitivity. Blocking Her-2 signaling increases CTX sensitivity of microsatellite instability CRC in vitro and in vivo.

  abstract     = {Under photon excitation, 2D materials experience cascading energy transfer from electrons to optical phonons (OPs) and acoustic phonons (APs). Despite few modeling works, it remains a long-history open problem to distinguish the OP and AP temperatures, not to mention characterizing their energy coupling factor ( G ). Here, the temperatures of longitudinal/transverse optical (LO/TO) phonons, flexural optical (ZO) phonons, and APs are distinguished by constructing steady and nanosecond (ns) interphonon branch energy transport states and simultaneously probing them using nanosecond energy transport state-resolved Raman spectroscopy. Δ T OP −AP is measured to take more than 30% of the Raman-probed temperature rise. A breakthrough is made on measuring the intrinsic in-plane thermal conductivity of suspended nm MoS 2 and MoSe 2 by completely excluding the interphonon cascading energy transfer effect, rewriting the Raman-based thermal conductivity measurement of 2D materials. G OP↔AP for MoS 2 , MoSe 2 , and graphene paper (GP) are characterized. For MoS 2 and MoSe 2 , G OP↔AP is in the order of 10 15 and 10 14 W m −3 K −1 and G ZO↔AP is much smaller than G LO/TO↔AP . Under ns laser excitation, G OP↔AP is significantly increased, probably due to the reduced phonon scattering time by the significantly increased hot carrier population. For GP, G LO/TO↔AP is 0.549 × 10 16 W m −3 K −1 , agreeing well with the value of 0.41 × 10 16 W m −3 K −1 by first-principles modeling.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) show promise for use in energy storage. However, the development of ZIBs has been plagued by the limited cathode candidates, which usually show low capacity or poor cycling performance. Here, a reversible Zn//(Na,Mn)V 8 O 20 · n H 2 O system is reported, the introduction of manganese (Mn) ions in NaV 8 O 20 to form (Na,Mn)V 8 O 20 exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance with a capacity of 377 mA h g −1 at a current density of 0.1 A g −1 . Through experimental and theoretical results, it is discovered that the outstanding performance of (Na,Mn)V 8 O 20 · n H 2 O is ascribed to the Mn 2+ /Mn 3+ -induced high electrical conductivity and Na + -induced fast migration of Zn 2+ . Other cathode materials derived from (Na,Mn)V 8 O 20 · n H 2 O by substituting Mn with Fe, Co, Ni, Ca, and K are explored to confirm the unique advantages of transition metal ions. With an increase in Mn content in NaV 8 O 20 , (Na 0.33 ,Mn 0.65 )V 8 O 20 · n H 2 O can deliver a reversible capacity of 150 mA h g −1 and a capacity retention of 99% after 1000 cycles, which may open new opportunities for the development of high-performance aqueous ZIBs.},

  abstract     = {The soft millirobot is a promising candidate for emerging applications in various in-vivo/vitro biomedical settings. Despite recent success in its design and actuation, the absence of sensing ability makes it still far from being a reality. Here, a radio frequency identification (RFID) based battery-less soft millirobot that can move, sense, and communicate remotely by coupling the magnetic and piezoelectric effects is reported. This design integrates the robot actuation and power generation units within a thin multilayer film (&lt;0.5 mm), i.e., a lower magnetic composite limb decorated with multiple feet imparts locomotion and a flexible piezoceramic composite film recovers energy simultaneously. Under a trigger of external magnetic guidance, the millirobot can achieve remote locomotion, environment monitoring, and wireless communication with no requirement of any on-board battery or external wired power supply. Furthermore, this robot demonstrates the sensing capability in measuring environment temperature and contact interface by two different sensing models, i.e., carried-on and build-in sensing mode, respectively. This research represents a remarkable advance in the emerging area of untethered soft robotics, benefiting a broad spectrum of promising applications, such as in-body monitoring, diagnosis, and drug delivery.},

In this study, ninhydrin chemistry is explored for reversible postsynthetic modification of gRNA molecules.

  abstract     = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely investigated as potential biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis of cancer. Developing an miRNA detection platform with high specificity, sensitivity, and exploitability is always necessary. Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is an electrogenerated chemiluminescence technology that greatly decreases background noise and improves detection sensitivity. The development of a paper-based ECL biosensor further makes ECL suitable for point-of-care detection. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas13a as high-fidelity, efficient, and programmable CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guided RNase has brought a next-generation biosensing technology. However, existing CRISPR/Cas13a based detection often faces a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. In this research, a CRISPR/Cas13a powered portable ECL chip (PECL-CRISPR) is constructed. Wherein target miRNA activates Cas13a to cleave a well-designed preprimer, and triggers the subsequent exponential amplification and ECL detection. Under optimized conditions, a limit-of-detection of 1 × 10 −15 m for miR-17 is achieved. Through rationally designing the crRNA, the platform can provide single nucleotide resolution to dramatically distinguish miRNA target from its highly homologous family members. Moreover, the introduction of “light-switch” molecule [Ru(phen) 2 dppz] 2+ allows the platform to avoid tedious electrode modification and washing processes, thereby simplifying the experimental procedure and lower testing cost. Analysis results of miRNA from tumor cells also demonstrate the PECL-CRISPR platform holds a promising potential for molecular diagnosis.},

It is aimed to explore a new biomarker and devise a marker-dependent theranostic pair for ATC. Flow cytometry is used to determine tissue factor (TF) expression in thyroid cancer cell lines. ALT-836, a TF-specific monoclonal antibody, is radiolabeled with 64 Cu to develop 64 Cu-NOTA-ALT-836. The diagnostic utility is assessed by immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) imaging in ATC models. To facilitate total surgical removal of orthotopic ATCs, a near-infrared fluorescent imaging probe IRDye 800CW-ALT-836 is designed. As the therapeutic component, 131 I-ALT-836 is further developed and the radioimmunotherapy (RIT) efficacy of this agent is interrogated in orthotopic ATC models. The results demonstrate that TF is highly expressed on the ATC cell line THJ-16T. 64 Cu-NOTA-ALT-836 immunoPET imaging clearly delineates both subcutaneous and orthotopic ATCs, with a peak tumor uptake of 19.93 ± 2.17% ID per g ( n = 3) and 37.20 ± 1.71% ID per g ( n = 3), respectively. Fluorescent imaging with IRDye 800CW-ALT-836 facilitates the total resection of orthotopic ATCs. Moreover, 131 I-ALT-836 RIT prolongs the survival of ATC-bearing mice. Taken together, TF is a promising marker for ATC and successive use of 64 Cu-NOTA-ALT-836 and 131 I-ALT-836 can realize precise management of ATC.},

Many in silico predictive models have been developed for predicting the off-target activities; however, few are capable of predicting the off-target activities with insertions or deletions between guide RNA and target DNA sequence pair. In order to fill this gap, a recurrent convolutional network named CRISPR-Net is developed for scoring the gRNA-target pairs with mismatches and indels; and a machine-learning based model named CRISPR-Net-Aggregate is also developed for aggregating the scores as the consensus off-target score for each potential guide RNA. It is demonstrated that CRISPR-Net achieves competitive performance on CIRCLE-Seq and GUIDE-seq datasets with indels and mismatches, outperforming the state-of-the-art off-target prediction methods on two independent mismatch-only datasets. The CRISPR-Net-Aggregate also surpasses a competing method on the aggregation task. Moreover, a two-stage sensitivity analysis is introduced to visualize the CRISPR-Net prediction on the gRNA-target pair of interest, demonstrating how implicit knowledge encoded in CRISPR-Net contributes to the accurate off-target activity quantification.

Few attempts have been made to develop virtual screening strategies for discovering small molecules targeting mature miRNAs. Mature miRNAs and their specific target mRNA can form unique functional loops during argonaute (AGO)-mediated miRNA–mRNA interactions, which may serve as potential targets for small-molecule drug discovery. Thus, a loop-based and AGO-incorporated virtual screening model is constructed for targeting the loops. The previously published studies have found that miR-214 can target ATF4 to inhibit osteoblastic bone formation, whereas miR-214 can target TRAF3 to promote osteoclast activity. By using the virtual model, the top ten candidate small molecules targeting miR-214-ATF4 mRNA interactions and top ten candidate small molecules targeting miR-214-TRAF3 mRNA interactions are selected, respectively. Based on both in vitro and in vivo data, one small molecule can target miR-214-ATF4 mRNA to promote ATF4 protein expression and enhance osteogenic potential, whereas one small molecule can target miR-214-TRAF3 mRNA to promote TRAF3 protein expression and inhibit osteoclast activity.

The effective manipulation of spin dynamics is a critical request to realize spin field-effect transistor (FET). In this work, the dependence of the spin relaxation time on external strain-induced polarization electric field is investigated in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) by time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy. Owing to the almost canceled two different spin–orbit coupling (SOC), the spin relaxation time as long as 311 ps in the MQWs is obtained at room temperature, being much longer than that in bulk GaN. Furthermore, upon applying an external uniaxial strain, the spin relaxation time decreases sensitively, which originates from the breaking of the SU (2) symmetry. The extracted ratio of the SOC coefficients shows a linear dependence on the external strain, confirming the essential role of the polarization electric field. This effective manipulation of the spin relaxation time sheds light on GaN-based nonballistic spin FET working at room temperature.},

More importantly, rational understanding of the reasons why two isomeric polymer HTMs ( PPE1 and PPE2 ) with almost identical photophysical properties, hole-transporting ability, and surface wettability deliver so distinctly different device performance under similar device fabrication conditions is manifested. PPE2 is found to improve the quality of perovskite films cast on top with larger grain sizes and more oriented crystallization.

In this study, a REM electrochromic device based on CuSn alloy is developed, which offers highly reversible switching between transparent, greyish-blue, and mirror states via reversible electrodeposition and dissolution. The alloying element, Sn acts as an electrochemical mediator, which facilitates the electrodeposition and dissolution of Cu. The CuSn-based REM device shows superior cycling stability for 2400 cycles (transmittance mode) and 1000 cycles (reflectance mode). The electrodeposited CuSn alloy film is resistant to surface oxidation in ambient air, with a 2.9% difference in reflectance at 2000 nm after 3 days. In addition, the alloy film exhibits excellent NIR reflectance property with thermal modulation of 18.5 °C at a high temperature of 180 °C.

  abstract     = {The remarkable optoelectronic properties and considerable performance of the organo lead-halide perovskites (PVKs) in various optoelectronic applications grasp tremendous scientific attention. However, the existence of the toxic lead in these compounds is threatening human health and remains a major concern in the way of their commercialization. To address this issue, numerous nontoxic alternatives have been reported. Among these alternatives, bismuth-based PVKs have emerged as a promising substitute because of similar optoelectronic properties and extended environmental stability. This work communicates briefly about the possible lead-alternatives and explores bismuth-based perovskites comprehensively, in terms of their structures, optoelectronic properties, and applications. A brief description of lead-toxification is provided and the possible Pb-alternatives from the periodic table are scrutinized. Then, the classification and crystal structures of various Bi-based perovskites are elaborated on. Detailed optoelectronic properties of Bi-based perovskites are also described and their optoelectronic applications are abridged. The overall photovoltaic applications along with device characteristics (i.e., V OC , J SC , fill factor, FF, and power conversion efficiency, PCE), fabrication method, device architecture, and operational stability are also summarized. Finally, a conclusion is drawn where a brief outlook highlights the challenges that hamper the future progress of Bi-based optoelectronic devices and suggestions for future directions are provided.},

The optimized organic-synthetic enzyme cascade for preparing this bioactive and commercial molecule with pharmaceutical relevance on a gram per L scale is designed based on its biosynthetic pathway starting from cheap and readily accessible linolenic acid. Toward this end, a recombinant biocatalyst system has been prepared for carrying out the most critical two key steps in a tailored manner, thus avoiding sensitive intermediate decomposition. Furthermore, cis -(+)-12-OPDA is successfully modified via a cross-alkene metathesis reaction with conversions of up to &gt;99%, leading to a compound library of new cis -(+)-12-OPDA derivatives with different substitution pattern of the side chain at the 2-position.

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged recently as promising candidates for next generation photovoltaics and have reached power conversion efficiencies of 25.2%. Among the various methods to advance solar cell technologies, the implementation of nanoparticles with plasmonic effects is an alternative way for photon and charge carrier management. Surface plasmons at the interfaces or surfaces of sophisticated metal nanostructures are able to interact with electromagnetic radiation. The properties of surface plasmons can be tuned specifically by controlling the shape, size, and dielectric environment of the metal nanostructures. Thus, incorporating metallic nanostructures in solar cells is reported as a possible strategy to explore the enhancement of energy conversion efficiency mainly in semi-transparent solar cells. One particularly interesting option is PSCs with plasmonic structures enable thinner photovoltaic absorber layers without compromising their thickness while maintaining a high light harvest. In this Review, the effects of plasmonic nanostructures in electron transport material, perovskite absorbers, the hole transport material, as well as enhancement of effective refractive index of the medium and the resulting solar cell performance are presented. Aside from providing general considerations and a review of plasmonic nanostructures, the current efforts to introduce these plasmonic structures into semi-transparent solar cells are outlined.},

N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification of RNA represents an additional layer of gene regulation. Here, it is reported that peripheral nerve injury increases the expression of the m 6 A demethylase fat-mass and obesity-associated proteins (FTO) in the injured DRG via the activation of Runx1, a transcription factor that binds to the Fto gene promoter. Mimicking this increase erases m 6 A in euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 ( Ehmt2 ) mRNA (encoding the histone methyltransferase G9a) and elevates the level of G9a in DRG and leads to neuropathic pain symptoms. Conversely, blocking this increase reverses a loss of m 6 A sites in Ehmt2 mRNA and destabilizes the nerve injury-induced G9a upregulation in the injured DRG and alleviates nerve injury-associated pain hypersensitivities. FTO contributes to neuropathic pain likely through stabilizing nerve injury-induced upregulation of G9a, a neuropathic pain initiator, in primary sensory neurons.},

  abstract     = {The Legionella pneumophila effector MavC is a transglutaminase that carries out atypical ubiquitination of the host ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugation enzyme UBE2N by catalyzing the formation of an isopeptide bond between Gln40 Ub and Lys92 UBE2N , which leads to inhibition of signaling in the NF-κB pathway. In the absence of UBE2N, MavC deamidates Ub at Gln40 or catalyzes self-ubiquitination. However, the mechanisms underlying these enzymatic activities of MavC are poorly understood at the molecular level. This study reports the structure of the MavC–UBE2N–Ub ternary complex representing a snapshot of MavC-catalyzed crosslinking of UBE2N and Ub, which reveals the way by which UBE2N–Ub binds to the Insertion and Tail domains of MavC. Based on the structural and experimental data, the catalytic mechanism for the deamidase and transglutaminase activities of MavC is proposed. Finally, by comparing the structures of MavC and MvcA, the homologous protein that reverses MavC-induced UBE2N ubiquitination, several essential regions and two key residues (Trp255 MavC and Phe268 MvcA ) responsible for their respective enzymatic activities are identified. The results provide insights into the mechanisms for substrate recognition and ubiquitination mediated by MavC as well as explanations for the opposite activity of MavC and MvcA in terms of regulation of UBE2N ubiquitination.},

Herein, a rapid microwave-annealing process (MAP) is reported to replace the traditional hotplate annealing process (HAP) and the processing period of perovskite is reduced to less than 1 min. Benefiting from the penetrability and simultaneity of microwave irradiation, the MAP method can effectively eliminate miscellaneous phases and thus achieve &gt;1 µm large-size crystal grains in perovskite films. These MAP treated perovskite films exhibit pure crystalline phase, long charge-carrier lifetime, and low defect density, which can substantially improve the PSC efficiency without requiring an additional enhancer/passivation layer. The inverted planar PSCs present enhanced power conversion efficiency from 18.33% (HAP) to 21.59% (MAP) and good stability of &gt;1000 h lifetime without encapsulation under ambient conditions. In addition, MAP can be applied to a large-size (10 cm × 10 cm) perovskite film fabrication as well as a broader tolerance in environmental temperature and precursor concentration, making it a reliable method for repeatably practical fabrication of perovskite photovoltaics.},

The obtained uniform MMP microspheres have a well-defined structure consisting of magnetic core, silica middle layer and mesoporous PDA shell, uniform mesopores of 11.9 nm, high specific surface areas (235.6 m 2 g −1 ) and rich functional groups. They show fast magnetic separation speed and superior performance in selective adsorption of Cyt.C from complex biosample solutions. Moreover, they can be in situ converted into core–shell magnetic mesoporous carbon (MMC) for efficient in-pore immobilization of ultrafine Au nanoparticles for high-efficiency catalytic epoxidation of styrene with high conversion (88.6%) and selectivity (90.1%) toward styrene oxide.},

  abstract     = {The manifestation of acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor patient outcomes, with treatment options limited to hydration or renal replacement therapies. The onset of AKI is often associated with a surfeit of reactive oxygen species. Here, it is shown that selenium-doped carbon quantum dots (SeCQDs) have broad-spectrum antioxidant properties and prominent renal accumulation in both healthy and AKI mice. Due to these properties, SeCQDs treat or prevent two clinically relevant cases of AKI induced in murine models by either rhabdomyolysis or cisplatin using only 1 or 50 µg per mouse, respectively. The attenuation of AKI in both models is confirmed by blood serum measurements, kidney tissue staining, and relevant biomarkers. The therapeutic efficacy of SeCQDs exceeds amifostine, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration that also acts by scavenging free radicals. The findings indicate that SeCQDs show great potential as a treatment option for AKI and possibly other ROS-related diseases.},

  abstract     = {Biofilms are chief culprits of most intractable infections and pose great threats to human health. Conventional antibiotic therapies are hypodynamic to biofilms due to their strong drug resistance, closely related with biofilm hypoxia. A new strategy for enhanced antibiotic therapy by relieving biofilm hypoxia is reported here. A two-step sequential delivery strategy is fabricated using perfluorohexane (PFH)-loaded liposomes (lip) as oxygen (O 2 ) carriers (denoted as lip@PFH@O 2 ) and commercial antibiotics. The results indicate that the two-step sequential treatment exhibits much lower minimum bactericidal concentrations than the antibiotic treatment alone. In this design, the lip@PFH@O 2 holds positively charged surface for better biofilm penetration. After penetrating into biofilm, oxygen can be released from lip@PFH@O 2 by inches, which greatly relieves biofilm hypoxia. With the relief of hypoxia, the quorum sensing and the drug efflux pumps of bacteria are suppressed by restraining related gene expression, leading to the reduced antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the in vivo experimental results also demonstrate that lip@PFH@O 2 can effectively relieve biofilm hypoxia and enhance therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. As a proof-of-concept, this research provides an innovative strategy for enhanced antibiotic therapy by relieving hypoxia, which may hold a bright future in combating biofilm-associated infections.},

For quality checks to provide the most value, they must be capable of screening individual particles in 3D and at high throughput.

This work describes a preparation method and high-throughput scanning procedure for the 3D characterization of powder samples in minutes using nano-CT by full-filed transmission X-ray microscopy with zone-plate focusing optics. This is demonstrated on various particle morphologies from two next-generation lithium-ion battery cathodes: LiNi 0.8 Mn 0.1 Co 0.1 O 2 and LiNi 0.6 Mn 0.2 Co 0.2 O 2 ; namely, NMC811 and NMC622.

Herein, a vertically transported graphene oxide (V-GO) with the combination of high ion selectivity and ultrafast ion permeation is reported, whose permeation is three orders of magnitude higher than the extensively studied horizontally transported GO (H-GO). By mixing artificial seawater and river water, an unprecedented high output power density of 10.6 W m −2 is obtained, outperforming all existing materials. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal the mechanism of the ultrafast transport in V-GO results from the quick entering of ions and the large accessible area as well as the apparent short diffusion paths in V-GO.

  abstract     = {Wake-up circuits in smart microsystems make huge contributions to energy conservation of electronic networks in unmanned areas, which still require higher pressure-triggering sensitivity and lower power consumption. In this work, a bionic triboelectric nanogenerator (bTENG) is developed to serve as a self-powered motion sensor in the wake-up circuit, which captures slight mechanical disturbances and overcomes the drawback of conventional self-powered motion sensors in the wake-up circuit that the circuit can only be triggered when a considerable pressure is applied on the sensor. The bTENG mimics the structure of plants and the addition of the leaf-shaped tentacle structures can increase the electrical outputs by four times, which largely extends the detection range of the wake-up circuit. The bTENG can detect both noncontact and contact mechanical disturbances; and voltages generated from both situations can trigger the wake-up system. Moreover, the specially designed circuit that is compatible with the bTENG can help more accurately control the wake-up system and prolong the battery life of the electronic networks to 12.4 times. An intrusion detection system is established in the wake-up circuit to distinguish human motion and judge the scene. This work opens new horizons for wake-up technologies, and provides new routes for persistent sensing.},

Gallium-based liquid metals combine metallic and fluidic properties at room temperature. Unlike mercury, which is toxic and has a finite vapor pressure, gallium possesses low toxicity and effectively zero vapor pressure at room temperature, which makes it amenable to many applications. A variety of fabrication methods produce liquid metal particles with variable sizes, ranging from nm to mm (which is the upper limit set by the capillary length). The liquid nature of gallium enables fabrication methods—such as microfluidics and sonication—that are not possible with solid materials. Gallium-based liquid metal particles possess several notable attributes, including a metal–metal oxide (liquid–solid) core–shell structure as well as the ability to self-heal, merge, and change shape. They also have unusual phase behavior that depends on the size of the particles. The particles have no known commercial applications, but they show promise for drug delivery, soft electronics, microfluidics, catalysis, batteries, energy harvesting, and composites. Existing challenges and future opportunities are discussed herein.},

Here, a simple, pumpless, close-loop, easy-to-replicate, and miniaturized flow device is introduced to concurrently expose 3D engineered vascular smooth muscle tissues to high-velocity pulsatile flow versus low-velocity disturbed flow conditions. Two flow regimes are distinguished, one that promotes elastin and impairs collagen I assembly, while the other impairs elastin and promotes collagen assembly. This latter extracellular matrix (ECM) composition shares characteristics with aneurysmal or atherosclerotic tissue phenotypes, thus recapitulating crucial hallmarks of flow-induced tissue morphogenesis in vessel walls. It is shown that the mRNA levels of ECM of collagens and elastin are not affected by the differential flow conditions. Instead, the differential gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) is flow-dependent, and thus drives the alterations in ECM composition. In further support, treatment with doxycycline, an MMP inhibitor and a clinically used drug to treat vascular diseases, halts the effect of low-velocity flow on the ECM remodeling. This illustrates how the platform can be exploited for drug efficacy studies by providing crucial mechanistic insights into how different therapeutic interventions may affect tissue growth and ECM assembly.},

However, while n-type Mg 2 (Si,Ge,Sn) materials show excellent thermoelectric performance, the corresponding p-type solid solutions are still inferior, mainly due to less favorable properties of the valence bands compared to the conduction bands. Here, Li doped Mg 2 Ge with a thermoelectric figure of merit zT of 0.5 at 700 K is reported, which is four times higher than that of p-type Mg 2 Si and double than that of p-type Mg 2 Sn. The reason for the excellent properties is an unusual temperature dependence of Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity compared to a standard highly doped semiconductor. The properties cannot be captured assuming a rigid band structure but well reproduced assuming two parabolic valence bands with a strong temperature dependent interband separation. According to the analysis, the difference in energy between the two bands decrease with temperature, leading to a band convergence at around 650 K and finally to an inversion of the band positions. The finding of a combination of a light and a heavy band that are non-rigid with temperature can pave the way for further optimization of p-type Mg 2 (Si,Ge,Sn).},

  abstract     = {Narrow bandgap semiconductor-based photodetectors often suffer from high room-temperature noise and are therefore operated at low temperatures. Here, a hybrid poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): HgTe quantum dot (QD) phototransistor is reported, which exhibits high sensitivity and fast photodetection up to 2400 nm wavelength range at room temperature. The active layer of the phototransistor consists of HgTe QDs well dispersed in a P3HT matrix. Fourier-transform infrared spectra confirm that chemical grafting between P3HT and HgTe QDs is realized after undergoing prolonged coblend stirring and a ligand exchange process. Thanks to the shifting of the charge transport into the P3HT and the partial passivation of the surface traps of HgTe QDs in the blend, the P3HT: HgTe QD hybrid phototransistor shows significantly improved gate-voltage tuning, 15 times faster response, and ≈80% reduction in the noise level compared to a pristine HgTe QD control device. More than 10 11 Jones specific detectivity (estimated from the noise spectral density measured at 1 kHz) is achieved at room temperature, and the response time (measured at 22 mW cm −2 illumination intensity) of the device is less than 1.5 µs. That is comparable to commercial epitaxially grown IR photodetectors operated in the same wavelength range.},

Very recently, various strategies including on-surface synthesis are developed to address these issues and many higher novel PCHs are constructed. Therefore, it is necessary to review these advances. Here, the recent synthetic approach, basic physicochemical properties, single-crystal packing behaviors, and potential applications of the linearly fused PCHs (higher than hexacene), including acenes or π-extended acenes with fused six-membered benzenoid rings and other four-membered, five-membered or even seven-membered and eight-membered fused compounds, are summarized.},

  abstract     = {For high-energy lithium–sulfur batteries, the poor volumetric energy density is a bottleneck as compared with lithium–ion batteries, due to the low density of both the sulfur active material and sulfur host. Herein, in order to enhance the volumetric energy density of sulfur cathode, a universal approach is proposed to fabricate a compact sulfur cathode with dense materials as sulfur host, instead of the old-fashioned lightweight carbon nanomaterials. Based on this strategy, heavy lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 ), with a high theoretical density of up to 6.5 g cm −3 , is introduced as sulfur host. Meanwhile, the La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 host also acts as an efficient electrocatalyst to accelerate the diffusion, adsorption, and redox dynamics of lithium polysulfides in the charge–discharge processes. As a result, such S/La 0.8 Sr 0.2 MnO 3 cathode presents high gravimetric/volumetric capacity and outstanding cycling stability. Moreover, an ultra-high volumetric energy density of 2727 Wh L −1 -cathode is achieved based on the densification effect with higher density (1.69 g cm −3 ), which is competitive to the Ni-rich oxide cathode (1800–2160 Wh L −1 ) of lithium–ion batteries. The current study opens up a path for constructing high volumetric capacity sulfur cathode with heavy and catalytic host toward practical applications of lithium–sulfur batteries.},

  abstract     = {The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a critical process in the electrolysis of water. Recently, much effort has been dedicated to developing low-cost, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalysts. Transition metal phosphides are investigated intensively due to their high electronic conductivity and optimized absorption energy of intermediates in acid electrolytes. However, the low stability of metal phosphide materials in air and during electrocatalytic processes causes a decay of performance and hinders the discovery of specific active sites. The HER in alkaline media is more intricate, which requires further delicate design due to the Volmer steps. In this work, phosphorus-modified monoclinic β -CoMoO 4 is developed as a low-cost, efficient, and stable HER electrocatalyst for the electrolysis of water in alkaline media. The optimized catalyst shows a small overpotential of 94 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm −2 for the HER with high stability in KOH electrolyte, and an overpotential of 197 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm −2 . Combined computational and in situ spectroscopic techniques show P is present as a surface phosphate ion; that electron holes localize on the surface ions and both (P  O 1− ) and Co 3+  OH − are prospective surface active sites for the HER.},

  abstract     = {Crystals do eventually melt if they are heated to their characteristic melting point. However, this is practically only the case for high-temperature stable crystals, whereas low-temperature metastable crystals generally transform, before melting, into a more stable solid during heating. Here, it is illustrated that low-temperature crystals can, however, be melted via fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC), even in metallic systems where nucleation and growth kinetics are rapid. For a Au–Si eutectic alloy, various metastable and stable solid states, i.e., (Au–α), (Au–β), γ, and (Au–Si), which form under well-controlled conditions and melt at high heating rates by preventing the metastable-to-stable solid phase transition, are isolated. It is demonstrated that Au 81.4 Si 18.6 can fully melt at various temperatures, i.e., 294 °C, 312 °C, 352 °C, and 363 °C, with differing melting enthalpies ranging from 6.52 to 9.83 kJ mol −1 . The melting and crystallization paths of the metastable solids are determined by constructing an energy−temperature diagram. This approach advances the general understanding of nucleation in metallic and other systems, and is expected to contribute to the detailed understanding of thermophysical phenomena that occur at spatially reduced dimensions and/or short time scales, for example in thin-film deposition, nanomaterials production, or additive manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Iron homeostasis is essential for maintaining cellular function in a wide range of cell types. However, whether iron affects the thermogenic properties of adipocytes is currently unknown. Using integrative analyses of multi-omics data, transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) is identified as a candidate for regulating thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. Furthermore, it is shown that mice lacking Tfr1 specifically in adipocytes have impaired thermogenesis, increased insulin resistance, and low-grade inflammation accompanied by iron deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, the cold treatment in beige adipocytes selectively stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α), upregulating the Tfr1 gene, and thermogenic adipocyte-specific Hif1α deletion reduces thermogenic gene expression in beige fat without altering core body temperature. Notably, Tfr1 deficiency in interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) leads to the transdifferentiation of brown preadipocytes into white adipocytes and muscle cells; in contrast, long-term exposure to a low-iron diet fails to phenocopy the transdifferentiation effect found in Tfr1 -deficient mice. Moreover, mice lacking transmembrane serine protease 6 (Tmprss6) develop iron deficiency in both inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and iBAT, and have impaired cold-induced beige adipocyte formation and brown fat thermogenesis. Taken together, these findings indicate that Tfr1 plays an essential role in thermogenic adipocytes via both iron-dependent and iron-independent mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Safety assessment of graphene-based materials (GBMs) including graphene oxide (GO) is essential for their safe use across many sectors of society. In particular, the link between specific material properties and biological effects needs to be further elucidated. Here, the effects of lateral dimensions of GO sheets in acute and chronic pulmonary responses after single intranasal instillation in mice are compared. Micrometer-sized GO induces stronger pulmonary inflammation than nanometer-sized GO, despite reduced translocation to the lungs. Genome-wide RNA sequencing also reveals distinct size-dependent effects of GO, in agreement with the histopathological results. Although large GO, but not the smallest GO, triggers the formation of granulomas that persists for up to 90 days, no pulmonary fibrosis is observed. These latter results can be partly explained by Raman imaging, which evidences the progressive biotransformation of GO into less graphitic structures. The findings demonstrate that lateral dimensions play a fundamental role in the pulmonary response to GO, and suggest that airborne exposure to micrometer-sized GO should be avoided in the production plant or applications, where aerosolized dispersions are likely to occur. These results are important toward the implementation of a safer-by-design approach for GBM products and applications, for the benefit of workers and end-users.},

However, the ability to prepare reconfigurable and reusable devices endowing multiple detection capabilities is an unresolved challenge. Herein, a microfluidic-based method that allows an extraordinary spatial control over the localization of multiple active SERS substrates in a single microfluidic channel is presented. It is shown that this technology provides for exquisite control over analyte transport to specific detection points, while avoiding cross-contamination; a feature that enables the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes within the same microfluidic channel. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the SERS substrates can be rationally designed in a straightforward manner and that they allow for the detection of single molecules (at concentrations as low as 10 −14 m ). Finally, it is shown that rapid etching and reconstruction of SERS substrates provides for reconfigurable and reusable operation.},

COFs, while intriguing due to crystallinity, tunability, and porosity, tend to have low apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and little is explored on atomistic structure–performance correlation. Here, adopting triphenylbenzene knots and phenyl linkers as a proof of concept, three structurally related COFs with different linkages are constructed to achieve a tunable COF platform and probe the effect of the linkage chemistry on PHE. Cyano-substituted alkene-linked COF (COF–alkene) yields a stable 2330 µmol h −1 g −1 PHE rate, much superior to imine- and imide-linked counterparts (&lt;40 µmol h −1 g −1 ) under visible light irradiation. Impressively, COF–alkene achieves an AQE of 6.7% at 420 nm. Combined femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculation disclose the critical role of cyano-substituted alkene linkages toward high efficiency of charge separation and transfer in the presence of sacrificial electron donors—the decisive key to the superior PHE performance. Such alkene linkages can also be extended to design a series of high-performance polymeric photocatalysts, highlighting a general design idea for efficient PHE.},

As confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffractions and Raman measurements, the resultant dense in-grain dislocations induce lattice strain fluctuations for broadening the phonon dispersion, leading to an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity of ≈0. 4 W m-K −1 . Band structure calculations reveal the convergence of valence bands due to monotelluride-alloying.

An efficient strategy to boost the energy and power density of lithium-ion batteries is to increase the Ni content in the cathode materials. However, a higher Ni content in the cathode materials gives rise to safety issues. Herein, thermal expansion and oxygen vacancies are proposed as new critical factors that affect the thermal stability of charged Ni-rich cathode materials based on a systematic synchrotron-based X-ray study of Li 0.33 Ni 0.5+ x Co 0.2 Mn 0.3- x O 2 ( x = 0, 0.1, 0.2) cathode materials during a heating process. Charged cathode materials with higher Ni contents show larger thermal expansion, which accelerates transition metal migration to the Li layers. Oxygen vacancies are formed and accumulate mainly around Ni ions until the layered-to-spinel phase transition begins. The oxygen vacancies also facilitate transition metal migration to the Li layers. Thermal expansion and the presence of oxygen vacancies decrease the energy barrier for cation migration and facilitate the phase transitions in charged cathode materials during the heating process. These results provide valuable guidance for developing new cathode materials with improved safety characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Highly persistent incidence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens constitutes a global burden for public health. An alternative strategy to alleviate such a crisis is to identify promising compounds to restore antibiotics activity against MDR bacteria. It is reported that the antidiabetic drug metformin exhibits the potentiation effect on tetracycline antibiotics, particularly doxycycline and minocycline, against MDR S. aureus , E. faecalis , E. coli , and S. enteritidis . Mechanistic studies demonstrate that metformin promotes intracellular accumulation of doxycycline in tetracycline-resistant E. coli . In addition, metformin boosts the immune response and alleviates the inflammatory responses in vitro. Last, metformin fully restores the activity of doxycycline in three animal infection models. Collectively, these results reveal the potential of metformin as a novel tetracyclines adjuvant to circumvent MDR bacterial pathogens and to improve the treatment outcome of recalcitrant infections.},

Herein, an ultrathin poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (UT-PEDOT:PSS) hole transporter layer is prepared by a water stripping method, and the UT-PEDOT:PSS can enhance η c and LEE simultaneously in Pero-LEDs, mostly due to the improved carrier mobility, more matched energy level alignment, and reduced photon loss. More importantly, the performance enhancement from UT-PEDOT:PSS is quite universal and applicable in different kinds of Pero-LEDs. As a result, the EQEs of Pero-LEDs based on 3D, quasi-3D, and quasi-2D perovskites obtain enhancements of 42%, 87%, and 111%, and the corresponding maximum EQE reaches 17.6%, 15.0%, and 6.8%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are rare cancer cells that are postulated to be responsible for cancer relapse and metastasis. However, CSCs are difficult to isolate and poorly understood. Here, a bioinspired approach for label-free isolation and culture of CSCs, by microencapsulating one cancer cell in the nanoliter-scale hydrogel core of each prehatching embryo-like core–shell microcapsule, is reported. Only a small percentage of the individually microencapsulated cancer cells can proliferate into a cell colony. Gene and protein expression analyses indicate high stemness of the cells in the colonies. Importantly, the colony cells are capable of cross-tissue multilineage (e.g., endothelial, cardiac, neural, and osteogenic) differentiation, which is not observed for “CSCs” isolated using other contemporary approaches. Further studies demonstrate the colony cells are highly tumorigenic, metastatic, and drug resistant. These data show the colony cells obtained with the bioinspired one-cell-culture approach are truly CSCs. Significantly, multiple pathways are identified to upregulate in the CSCs and enrichment of genes related to the pathways is correlated with significantly decreased survival of breast cancer patients. Collectively, this study may provide a valuable method for isolating and culturing CSCs, to facilitate the understanding of cancer biology and etiology and the development of effective CSC-targeted cancer therapies.},

  abstract     = {Radioluminescent materials (scintillators) are widely applied in medical imaging, nondestructive testing, security inspection, nuclear and radiation industries, and scientific research. Recently, all-inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystal (NC) scintillators have attracted great attention due to their facile solution processability and ultrasensitive X-ray detection, which allows for large area and flexible X-ray imaging. However, the light yield of these perovskite NCs is relatively low because of the strong self-absorption that reduces the light out-coupling efficiency. Here, NCs with self-trapped excitons emission are demonstrated to be sensitive, reabsorption-free scintillators. Highly luminescent and stable Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs with a photoluminescence quantum yields of 73.7%, which is a new record for blue emission lead-free perovskite or perovskite-like NCs, is produced with the assistance of InI 3 . The PL peak of the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs locates at 445 nm that matches with the response peak of a silicon photomultiplier. Thus, Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs are demonstrated as efficient scintillators with zero self-absorption and extremely high light yield (≈79 279 photons per MeV). Both Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NC colloidal solution and film exhibit strong radioluminescence under X-ray irradiation. The potential application of Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 NCs as reabsorption-free, low cost, large area, and flexible scintillators is demonstrated by a prototype X-ray imaging with a high spatial resolution.},

Here, a precise microfluidic assay in single-cell profile is developed for the screening of TRP channel modulators. The geometrically optimized microchip is designed for both trapping single cells and utilizing passive pumping for sequential media replacement with low shear stress. The microfluidic chip exhibits superior performance in screening, repeatable compound administration, and improved reproducibility. Using this screening platform, the false-positive and negative rate of the commonly used Ca 2+ imaging is reduced from 76.2% to 4.8% and four coumarin derivatives isolated from Murraya species that inhibit TRP channels are identified. One coumarin derivative B-304 reverses TRPA1-mediated inflammatory pain in vivo. Taken together, the data demonstrate that the established microfluidic assay in single-cell profile could be used for the screening of TRP channel modulators that may have therapeutic potential for the channelopathies.},

Herein, an unusual crystal phase transition of UCNs to a hexagonal apatite phase in the presence of SiO 2 nanoparticles is reported with the enhancements of 130-fold green luminescence and 52-fold luminance as compared to that of the SiO 2 -free counterpart. By rationally combining this strategy with an additive color mixing method using a mask-less flow lithography technique, single to multiple luminescence color transition, scalable labeling systems with hidden letters-, and multi-luminescence colored microparticles are demonstrated for a UCNs luminescence color change-based high temperature labeling system.},

However, building high-fidelity organoids in a reproducible and high-throughput manner remains challenging. Here, a droplet microfluidic system is developed for controllable fabrication of hybrid hydrogel capsules, which allows for massive 3D culture and formation of functional and uniform islet organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this all-in-water microfluidic system, an array of droplets is utilized as templates for one-step fabrication of binary capsules relying on interfacial complexation of oppositely charged Na-alginate (NaA) and chitosan (CS). The produced hybrid capsules exhibit high uniformity, and are biocompatible, stable, and permeable. The established system enables capsule production, 3D culture, and self-organizing formation of human islet organoids in a continuous process by encapsulating pancreatic endocrine cells from hiPSCs. The generated islet organoids contain islet-specific α- and β-like cells with high expression of pancreatic hormone specific genes and proteins. Moreover, they exhibit sensitive glucose-stimulated insulin secretion function, demonstrating the capability of these binary capsules to engineer human organoids from hiPSCs. The proposed system is scalable, easy-to-operate, and stable, which can offer a robust platform for advancing human organoids research and translational applications.},

Here, a new type of 3D nanocomposite film consisting of an ultrathin (≈60 nm) Al 2 O 3 nanoshell inserted between the elastomers in a periodic 3D nanonetwork is proposed. Regardless of the stretching direction, numerous light-scattering nanogaps (corresponding to the porosity of up to ≈37.4 vol%) form at the interfaces of Al 2 O 3 and the elastomers under stretching. This results in the gradual modulation of transmission from ≈90% to 16% at visible wavelengths and does not degrade with repeated stretching/releasing over more than 10 000 cycles. The underlying physics is precisely predicted by finite element analysis of the unit cells. As a proof of concept, a mobile-app-enabled smart window device for Internet of Things applications is realized using the proposed 3D nanocomposite with successful expansion to the 3 × 3 in. scale.},

With the emerging interest in biophotovoltaics, extracting electricity from photosynthetic organisms remains challenging because of the low electron-transition rate and photon collection efficiency due to membrane shielding. In this study, the concept of “photosynthetic resonator” to amplify biological nanoelectricity through the confinement of living microalgae ( Chlorella sp.) in an optical micro/nanocavity is demonstrated. Strong energy coupling between the Fabry–Perot cavity mode and photosynthetic resonance offers the potential of exploiting optical resonators to amplify photocurrent generation as well as energy harvesting. Biomimetic models and living photosynthesis are explored in which the power is increased by almost 600% and 200%, respectively. Systematic studies of photosystem fluorescence and photocurrent are simultaneously carried out. Finally, an optofluidic-based photosynthetic device is developed. It is envisaged that the key innovations proposed in this study can provide comprehensive insights in biological-energy sciences, suggesting a new avenue to amplify electrochemical signals using an optical cavity. Promising applications include photocatalysis, photoelectrochemistry, biofuel devices, and sustainable optoelectronics.},

  abstract     = {Protein quantification techniques such as immunoassays have been improved considerably, but they have several limitations, including time-consuming procedures, low sensitivity, and extrinsic detection. Because direct surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can detect intrinsic signals of proteins, it can be used as an effective detection method. However, owing to the complexity and reliability of SERS signals, SERS is rarely adopted for quantification without a purified target protein. This study reports an efficient and effective direct SERS-based immunoassay (SERSIA) technique for protein quantification and imaging. SERSIA relies on the uniform coating of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on a target-protein-immobilized substrate by simple centrifugation. As centrifugation induces close contact between the GNPs and target proteins, the intrinsic signals of the target protein can be detected. For quantification, the protein levels in a cell lysate are estimated using similarity analysis between antibody-only and protein-conjugated samples. This method reliably estimates the protein level at a sub-picomolar detection limit. Furthermore, this method enables quantitative imaging of immobilized protein at a micrometer range. Because this technique is fast, sensitive, and requires only one type of antibody, this approach can be a useful method to detect proteins in biological samples.},

  abstract     = {Arsenic (As) is a widespread metalloid contaminant, and its internal exposure is demonstrated to cause serious detrimental health problems. Albeit considerable studies are performed to interrogate the molecular mechanisms responsible for As-induced toxicities, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood yet, especially at the epigenetic regulation level. In the present study, it is identified that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1) alleviates As-induced G2/M phase arrest in human liver cells. Intensive mechanistic investigations illustrate that UCA1 interacts with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and accelerates the latter&#39;s protein turnover rate under normal and As-exposure conditions. The phosphorylation of EZH2 at the Thr-487 site by cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is responsible for As-induced EZH2 protein degradation, and UCA1 enhances this process through increasing the interaction between CDK1 and EZH2. As a consequence, the cell cycle regulator nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFATc2), a downstream target of EZH2, is upregulated to resist As-blocked cell cycle progress and cytotoxicity. In conclusion, the findings decipher a novel prosurvival signaling pathway underlying As toxicity from the perspective of epigenetic regulation: UCA1 facilitates the ubiquitination of EZH2 to upregulate NFATc2 and further antagonizes As-induced cell cycle arrest.},

  abstract     = {Percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary artery disease treatment often results in pathological vascular injury, characterized by P-selectin overexpression. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) therapeutic efficacy remains elusive due to poor ADSCs targeting and retention in injured vessels. Here, conjugated P-selectin binding peptide (PBP) to polyethylene glycol-conjugated phospholipid derivative (DMPE-PEG) linkers (DMPE-PEG-PBP; DPP) are used to facilitate the modification of PBP onto ADSCs cell surfaces via hydrophobic interactions between DMPE-PEG and the phospholipid bilayer. DPP modification neither has influence on ADSCs proliferation nor apoptosis/paracrine factor gene expression. A total of 5 × 10 −6 m DPP-modified ADSCs (DPP-ADSCs) strongly binds to P-selectin-displaying activated platelets and endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro and to wire-injured rat femoral arteries when administered by intra-arterial injection. Targeted binding of ADSCs shields injury sites from platelet and leukocyte adhesion, thereby decreasing inflammation at injury sites. Furthermore, targeted binding of ADSCs recovers injured ECs functionality and reduces platelet-initiated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) chemotactic migration. Targeted binding of DPP-human ADSCs to balloon-injured human femoral arteries is also demonstrated in ex vivo experiments. Overall, DPP-ADSCs promote vascular repair, inhibit neointimal hyperplasia, increase endothelium functionality, and maintain normal VSMCs alignment, supporting preclinical noninvasive utilization of DPP-ADSCs for vascular injury.},

Another important aspect of this work is to present recent results and highlight the excellent functional and structural properties of the resulting gFRP materials with a view to their future applications.

  abstract     = {Macrophages play a central role in orchestrating immune responses to foreign materials, which are often responsible for the failure of implanted medical devices. Material topography is known to influence macrophage attachment and phenotype, providing opportunities for the rational design of “immune-instructive” topographies to modulate macrophage function and thus foreign body responses to biomaterials. However, no generalizable understanding of the inter-relationship between topography and cell response exists. A high throughput screening approach is therefore utilized to investigate the relationship between topography and human monocyte–derived macrophage attachment and phenotype, using a diverse library of 2176 micropatterns generated by an algorithm. This reveals that micropillars 5–10 µm in diameter play a dominant role in driving macrophage attachment compared to the many other topographies screened, an observation that aligns with studies of the interaction of macrophages with particles. Combining the pillar size with the micropillar density is found to be key in modulation of cell phenotype from pro to anti-inflammatory states. Machine learning is used to successfully build a model that correlates cell attachment and phenotype with a selection of descriptors, illustrating that materials can potentially be designed to modulate inflammatory responses for future applications in the fight against foreign body rejection of medical devices.},

  abstract     = {Programmable metasurfaces allow dynamic and real-time control of electromagnetic (EM) waves in subwavelength resolution, holding extraordinary potentials to establish meta-systems. Achieving independent and real-time controls of orthogonally-polarized EM waves via the programmable metasurface is attractive for many applications, but remains considerably challenging. Here, a polarization-controlled dual-programmable metasurface (PDPM) with modular control circuits is proposed, which enables a dibit encoding capability in modifying the phase profiles of x - and y -polarized waves individually. The constructed extended interface circuit is able to extend the number of control interfaces from a field programmable gate array by orders of magnitude and also possesses memory function, which enhance hugely the rewritability, scalability, reliability, and stability of PDPM. As a proof-of-concept, a wave-based exclusive-OR logic gate platform for spin control of circularly-polarized waves, a fixed-frequency wide-angle dual-beam scanning system, and a dual-polarized shared-aperture antenna are demonstrated using a single PDPM. The proposed PDPM opens up avenues for realizing more advanced and integrated multifunctional devices and systems that have two independent polarization-controlled signal channels, which may find many applications in future-oriented intelligent communication, imaging, and computing technologies.},

However, the mechanisms behind the reaction pathways and phase transformation are still unclear. Moreover, the effects of designed nanostructure on the electrochemical behaviors are rarely reported. Herein, a hydrangea-like CuS microsphere is prepared via a facile synthetic method and displays significantly enhanced rate and cycle performance. Unlike the traditional intercalation and conversion reactions, an irreversible amorphization process is evidenced and elucidated with the help of in situ high-resolution synchrotron radiation diffraction analyses, and transmission electron microscopy. The oriented (006) crystal plane growth of the primary CuS nanosheets provide more channels and adsorption sites for Na ions intercalation and the resultant low overpotential is beneficial for the amorphous Cu-S cluster, which is consistent with the density functional theory calculation. This study can offer new insights into the correlation between the atomic-scale phase transformation and macro-scale nanostructure design and open a new principle for the electrode materials&#39; design.},

The main barrier of commercial use of OSCs is the poor stability of devices. Herein, the factors limiting the stability of OSCs are summarized. The limiting stability factors are oxygen, water, irradiation, heating, metastable morphology, diffusion of electrodes and buffer layers materials, and mechanical stress. The recent progress in strategies to increase the stability of OSCs is surveyed, such as material design, device engineering of active layers, employing inverted geometry, optimizing buffer layers, using stable electrodes and encapsulation materials. The International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability guidelines are also discussed. The potential research strategies to achieve the required device stability and efficiency are highlighted, rendering possible pathways to facilitate the viable commercialization of OSCs.},

  abstract     = {The formation of the soluble polysulfides (Na 2 S n , 4 ≤ n ≤ 8) causes poor cycling performance for room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT Na–S) batteries. Moreover, the formation of insoluble polysulfides (Na 2 S n , 2 ≤ n &lt; 4) can slow down the reaction kinetics and terminate the discharge reaction before it reaches the final product. In this work, coffee residue derived activated ultramicroporous coffee carbon (ACC) material loading with small sulfur molecules (S 2–4 ) as cathode material for RT Na–S batteries is reported. The first principle calculations indicate the space confinement of the slit ultramicropores can effectively suppress the formation of polysulfides (Na 2 S n , 2 ≤ n ≤ 8). Combining with in situ UV/vis spectroscopy measurements, one-step reaction RT Na–S batteries with Na 2 S as the only and final discharge product without polysulfides formation are demonstrated. As a result, the ultramicroporous carbon loaded with 40 wt% sulfur delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1492 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C (1 C = 1675 mA g −1 ). When cycled at 1 C rate, the carbon–sulfur composite electrode exhibits almost no capacity fading after 2000 cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency, revealing excellent cycling stability and reversibility. The superb cycling stability and rate performance demonstrate ultramicropore confinement can be an effective strategy to develop high performance cathode for RT Na–S batteries.},

Today, it is possible to infer cancer progression and treatment efficacy by determining the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the patient&#39;s blood at multiple time points; further valuable information about CTC phenotypes remains inaccessible. In this article, a microfluidic method for integrated capture, isolation, and analysis of membrane markers as well as quantification of proteins secreted by single CTCs and CTC clusters is introduced. CTCs are isolated from whole blood with extraordinary efficiencies above 95% using dedicated trapping structures that allow co-capture of functionalized magnetic beads to assess protein secretion. The patform is tested with multiple breast cancer cell lines spiked into human blood and mouse-model-derived CTCs. In addition to immunostaining, the secretion level of granulocyte growth stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is shown to be involved in neutrophil recruitment, is quantified The bead-based assay provides a limit of detection of 1.5 ng mL −1 or less than 3700 molecules per cell. Employing barcoded magnetic beads, this platform can be adapted for multiplexed analysis and can enable comprehensive functional CTC profiling in the future.},

While nanotechnology has developed a plethora of nanocarriers for drug transport, their ability to unequivocally identify cells of interest remains moderate. Viruses are the ideal nanosized carriers as they are able to address their embedded nucleic acids with high specificity to their host cells. Here, it is reported that particles endowed with a virus-like ability to identify cells by three consecutive checks have a superior ability to recognize mesangial cells (MCs) in vivo compared to conventional nanoparticles. Mimicking the initial viral attachment followed by a stepwise target cell recognition process leads to a 5- to 15-fold higher accumulation in the kidney mesangium and extensive cell uptake compared to particles lacking one or both of the viral traits. These results highlight the relevance that the viral cell identification process has on specificity and its application on the targeting strategies of nanomaterials. More so, these findings pave the way for transporting drugs into the mesangium, a tissue that is pivotal in the development of diabetic nephropathy and for which currently no efficient pharmacotherapy exists.},

Current constraints demand a variety of controllable components to carry out several operations inside microchambers and microreactors. In this context, brand-new nanophotonic approaches can significantly enhance existing capabilities providing unique functionalities via finely tuned light−matter interactions. A concept is proposed, featuring dual on-chip functionality: boosted optically driven diffusion and nanoparticle sorting. High-index dielectric nanoantennae is specially designed to ensure strongly enhanced spin−orbit angular momentum transfer from a laser beam to the scattered field. Hence, subwavelength optical nanovortices emerge driving spiral motion of plasmonic nanoparticles via the interplay between curl−spin optical forces and radiation pressure. The nanovortex size is an order of magnitude smaller than that provided by conventional beam-based approaches. The nanoparticles mediate nanoconfined fluid motion enabling moving-part-free nanomixing inside a microchamber. Moreover, exploiting the nontrivial size dependence of the curled optical forces makes it possible to achieve precise nanoscale sorting of gold nanoparticles, demanded for on-chip separation and filtering. Altogether, a versatile platform is introduced for further miniaturization of moving-part-free, optically driven microfluidic chips for fast chemical analysis, emulsion preparation, or chemical gradient generation with light-controlled navigation of nanoparticles, viruses or biomolecules.},

The experimental and theoretical results show that the addition of the CsBr buffer layer optimizes the interface between the perovskite absorber layer and the NiO x hole transport layer, reduces interface defects and traps, and enhances the hole extraction/transfer. The experimental results show that the power conversion efficiency of optimal device reaches up to 19.7% which is significantly higher than the efficiency of the device without the CsBr buffer layer.

Herein, in situ growth of high-quality all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr 3 ) single crystal arrays (PeSCAs) on cubic zinc oxide (c-ZnO) is reported, which is used as an inorganic electron transport layer in optoelectronic devices, via a facile spin-coating method. The PeSCAs consist of rectangular thin microplatelets of 6–10 µm in length and 2–3 µm in width. The deposited c-ZnO enables the formation of phase-pure and highly crystallized cubic perovskites via an epitaxial lattice coherence of (100) CsPbBr3 ∥(100) c-ZnO , which is further confirmed by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering. The PeSCAs demonstrate a significant structural stability of 26 days with a 9 days excellent photoluminescence stability in ambient environment, which is much superior to the perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs). The high crystallinity of the PeSCAs allows for a lower density of trap states, longer carrier lifetimes, and narrower energetic disorder for excitons, which leads to a faster diffusion rate than PeNCs. These results unravel the possibility of creating the interface toward c-ZnO heterogeneous layer, which is a major step for the realization of a better integration of perovskites and charge carrier transport layers.},

  abstract     = {Charge and thermal transport in a crystal is carried by free electrons and phonons (quantized lattice vibration), the two most fundamental quasiparticles. Above the Debye temperature of the crystal, phonon-mediated thermal conductivity ( κ L ) is typically limited by mutual scattering of phonons, which results in κ L decreasing with inverse temperature, whereas free electrons play a negligible role in κ L . Here, an unusual case in charge-density-wave tantalum disulfide (1T-TaS 2 ) is reported, in which κ L is limited instead by phonon scattering with free electrons, resulting in a temperature-independent κ L . In this system, the conventional phonon–phonon scattering is alleviated by its uniquely structured phonon dispersions, while unusually strong electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling arises from its Fermi surface strongly nested at wavevectors in which phonons exhibit Kohn anomalies. The unusual temperature dependence of thermal conduction is found as a consequence of these effects. The finding reveals new physics of thermal conduction, offers a unique platform to probe e-ph interactions, and provides potential ways to control heat flow in materials with free charge carriers. The temperature-independent thermal conductivity may also find thermal management application as a special thermal interface material between two systems when the heat conduction between them needs to be maintained at a constant level.},

Flexible pressure sensors often apply a microstructured or porous active material to improve their sensitivity and response speed. However, the microstructures or small pores will result in high haze and low transparency of the device, and thus it is challenging to balance the sensitivity and transparency simultaneously in flexible pressure sensors or electronic skins. Here, for a capacitive-type sensor that consists of a porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film sandwiched between two transparent electrodes, the challenge is addressed by filling the pores with ionic liquid that has the same refractive index with PVDF, and the transmittance of the film dramatically boosts from 0 to 94.8% in the visible range. Apart from optical matching, the ionic liquid also significantly improves the signal intensity as well as the sensitivity due to the formation of an electric double layer at the dielectric-electrode interfaces, and improves the toughness and stretchability of the active material benefiting from a plasticization effect. Such transparent and flexible sensors will be useful in smart windows, invisible bands, and so forth.},

Herein, core–shell structured nanospheres of NiFe x Sn@NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (denoted as NiFe x Sn-A) are prepared as active OER catalysts by a facile electrochemical strategy, which includes electrodeposition of NiFe x Sn alloy nanospheres on carbon cloth (CC) and following anodization. The alloy core of NiFe x Sn could promote charge transfer, and the amorphous shell of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide is defect-rich and nanoporous due to the selective electrochemical etching of Sn in alkaline medium. The optimized catalyst of NiFe 0.5 Sn-A displays a remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential of 260 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm −2 , a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec −1 , a high turnover frequency of 0.194 s −1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, and a robust durability. Further characterizations indicate that the superior OER performance of the core–shell structured NiFe 0.5 Sn-A nanospheres might originate from abundant active sites and small charge transfer resistance. This work brings a new perspective to the design and synthesis of core–shell structured nanospheres for electrocatalysis through a facile electrochemical strategy.},

  abstract     = {Reliable monitoring of metabolites in biofluids is critical for diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of various diseases. Although widely used, existing enzymatic metabolite assays face challenges in clinical practice primarily due to the susceptibility of enzyme activity to external conditions and the low sensitivity of sensing strategies. Inspired by the micro/nanoscale confined catalytic environment in living cells, the coencapsulation of oxidoreductase and metal nanoparticles within the nanopores of macroporous silica foams to fabricate all-in-one bio-nanoreactors is reported herein for use in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based metabolic assays. The enhancement of catalytical activity and stability of enzyme against high temperatures, long-time storage or proteolytic agents are demonstrated. The nanoreactors recognize and catalyze oxidation of the metabolite, and provide ratiometric SERS response in the presence of the enzymatic by-product H 2 O 2 , enabling sensitive metabolite quantification in a “sample in and answer out” manner. The nanoreactor makes any oxidoreductase-responsible metabolite a candidate for quantitative SERS sensing, as shown for glucose and lactate. Glucose levels of patients with bacterial infection are accurately analyzed with only 20 µL of cerebrospinal fluids, indicating the potential application of the nanoreactor in vitro clinical testing.},

  abstract     = {Germline polymorphisms are linked with differential survival outcomes in cancers but are not well studied in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, a two-phase association study is conducted to discover germline polymorphisms that are associated with the prognosis of NPC. The discovery phase includes two consecutive hospital cohorts of patients with NPC from Southern China. Exome-wide genotypes at 246 173 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are determined, followed by survival analysis for each SNP under Cox proportional hazard regression model. Candidate SNP is replicated in another two independent cohorts from Southern China and Singapore. Meta-analysis of all samples ( n = 5553) confirms that the presence of rs1131636-T, located in the 3′-UTR of RPA1 , confers an inferior overall survival (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.20–1.47, P = 6.31 × 10 −8 ). Bioinformatics and biological assays show that rs1131636 has regulatory effects on upstream RPA1 . Functional studies further demonstrate that RPA1 promotes the growth, invasion, migration, and radioresistance of NPC cells. Additionally, miR-1253 is identified as a suppressor for RPA1 expression, likely through regulation of its binding affinity to rs1131636 locus. Collectively, these findings provide a promising biomarker aiding in stratifying patients with poor survival, as well as a potential drug target for NPC.},

  abstract     = {Slab photonic crystals (PhCs) are photonic structures used in many modern optical technologies. Fabrication of these components is costly and usually involves eco-unfriendly methods, requiring modern nanofabrication techniques and cleanroom facilities. This work describes that diatom microalgae evolved elaborate and highly reproducible slab PhCs in the girdle, a part of their silicon dioxide exoskeletons. Under natural conditions in water, the girdle of the centric diatom Coscinodiscus granii shows a well-defined optical pseudogap for modes in the near-infrared (NIR). This pseudogap shows dispersion toward the visible spectral range when light is incident at larger angles, eventually facilitating in-plane propagation for modes in the green spectral range. The optical features can be modulated with refractive index contrast. The unit cell period, a critical factor controlling the pseudogap, is highly preserved within individuals of a long-term cultivated inbred line and between at least four different C. granii cell culture strains tested in this study. Other diatoms present similar unit cell morphologies with various periods. Diatoms thereby offer a wide range of PhC structures, reproducible and equipped with well-defined properties, possibly covering the entire UV-vis–NIR spectral range. Diatoms therefore offer an alternative as cost-effective and environmentally friendly produced photonic materials.},

  abstract     = {Owing to their high robustness and conductivity, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes are considered as a promising material class for electrochemical catalysis, energy conversion, and storage applications. Nevertheless, conventional hazardous fluoride-based synthesis routes and the intense intralayer bonding restrict the development of MXenes. Herein, a fluoride-free, facile, and rapid method for synthesizing self-assembled 1D architecture from an MXene-based compound is reported. The MXene nanowire (NW) not only provides a robust connection to the flexible substrate but also effectively increases the electrochemically active surface area. The kinetics-favorable structure yields a boosted performance for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction and the intake of the zinc ion. The 1D NW based on MXene compound maintains high stability in a quite low overpotential of 236 mV for 24 h without detachment from the substrate and manifests an exceptional high-power density of 420 W kg −1 over 150 cycles as a flexible aqueous zinc ion battery. This work paves a novel and non-toxic synthesis method for the 1D nanofiber structure from MXene composition and demonstrates its multifunctional applications for energy conversion and storage.},

  abstract     = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease, and the mechanisms underpinning its pathogenesis have not been completely established. Transmembrane member 16A (TMEM16A), a component of the Ca 2+ -activated chloride channel (CaCC), has recently been implicated in metabolic events. Herein, TMEM16A is shown to be responsible for CaCC activation in hepatocytes and is increased in liver tissues of mice and patients with NAFLD. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of TMEM16A in mice ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity, hepatic glucose metabolic disorder, steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. In contrast, hepatocyte-specific TMEM16A transgenic mice exhibit the opposite phenotype. Mechanistically, hepatocyte TMEM16A interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) to induce its degradation, suppressing the formation of the VAMP3/syntaxin 4 and VAMP3/synaptosome-associated protein 23 complexes. This leads to the impairment of hepatic glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) translocation and glucose uptake. Notably, VAMP3 overexpression restrains the functions of hepatocyte TMEM16A in blocking GLUT2 translocation and promoting lipid deposition, insulin resistance, and inflammation. In contrast, VAMP3 knockdown reverses the beneficial effects of TMEM16A downregulation. This study demonstrates a role for TMEM16A in NAFLD and suggests that inhibition of hepatic TMEM16A or disruption of TMEM16A/VAMP3 interaction may provide a new potential therapeutic strategy for NAFLD.},

  abstract     = {Numerous mechanisms have been proposed for polymerization to provide qualitative and quantitative prediction of how monomers spatially and temporally arrange into the polymeric chains. However, less is known about this process at the molecular level because the ultrafast chemical reaction is inaccessible for any form of microscope so far. Here, to address this unmet challenge, a stimulated Raman scattering microscope based on collinear multiple beams (COMB-SRS) is demonstrated, which allows label-free molecular imaging of polymer synthesis in action at speed of 2000 frames per second. The field of view of the developed 2 kHz SRS microscope is 30 × 28 µm 2 with 50 × 46 pixels and 7 µs dwell time. By catching up the speed of chemical reaction, COMB-SRS is able to quantitatively visualize the ultrafast dynamics of molecular vibrations with submicron spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. The propagating polymer waves driven by reaction rate and persistent UV initiation are observed in situ. This methodology is expected to permit the development of novel functional polymers, controllable photoresists, 3D printing, and other new polymerization technologies.},

Herein, auger electrons (AEs) emitted from radionuclide 125 ( 125 I) are used in situ to construct active sites in a nanocatalyst (TiO 2 ) and the application of this method is further extended to cancer catalytic internal radiotherapy (CIRT). The obtained 125 I-TiO 2 nanoparticles first construct superficial Ti 3+ active sites via the reaction between Ti 4+ and AEs. Then Ti 3+ stretches and weakens the O  H bond of the absorbed H 2 O, thus enhancing the radiolysis of H 2 O molecules and generating hydroxyl radicals (•OH). All in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate a good CIRT performance. These findings will broaden the application of radionuclides and introduce new perspectives to nanomedicine.},

As such, there is an urgent need to find alternatives. Many studies have examined tin-based PSCs. However, pure tin-based perovskites are easily oxidized in the air or just in glovebox with an ultrasmall amount of oxygen. Such a characteristic makes their performance and stability less ideal compared with those of lead-based perovskites. Herein, how to address the instability of tin-based perovskites is introduced in detail. First, the crystalline structure, optical properties, and sources of instability of tin-based perovskites are summarized. Next, the preparation methods of tin-based perovskite are discussed. Then, various measures for solving the instability problem are explained using four strategies: additive engineering, deoxidizer, partial substitution, and reduced dimensions. Finally, the challenges and prospects are laid out to help researchers develop highly efficient and stable tin-based perovskites in the future.},

Plasma technology derived ROS diminish tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Varying the feed gas mixture modifies the composition of ROS. Conditions rich in atomic oxygen correlate with killing activity and elevate intratumoral immune-infiltrates of CD8 + cytotoxic T-cells and dendritic cells. T-cells from secondary lymphoid organs of these mice stimulated with B16 melanoma cells ex vivo show higher activation levels as well. This correlates with immunogenic cancer cell death and higher calreticulin and heat-shock protein 90 expressions induced by gas plasma treatment in melanoma cells. To test the immunogenicity of gas plasma treated melanoma cells, 50% of mice vaccinated with these cells are protected from tumor growth compared to 1/6 and 5/6 mice negative control (mitomycin C) and positive control (mitoxantrone), respectively.

These SMNP vectors are then employed for CRISPR/Cas9 knockin of RS1/GFP genes into the mouse Rosa26 safe-harbor site in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo study involves intravitreally injecting the two SMNP vectors into the mouse eyes, followed by repeated ocular imaging by fundus camera and optical coherence tomography, and pathological and molecular analyses of the harvested retina tissues. Mice ocular organs retain their anatomical integrity, a single-copy 3.0-kb RS1/GFP gene is precisely integrated into the Rosa26 site in the retinas, and the integrated RS1/GFP gene is expressed in the retinas, demonstrating CRISPR/Cas9 knockin of RS1/GFP gene.},

Herein, recent advances in thermal transport of halide perovskites and their potentials and challenges for thermoelectrics are reviewed. An overview of the phonon behavior in halide perovskites, as well as the compositional dependency is analyzed. Understanding thermal transport and knowing the thermal conductivity value is crucial for creating effective heat dissipation schemes and determining other thermal-related properties like thermo-optic coefficients, hot-carrier cooling, and thermoelectric efficiency. Recent works on halide perovskite-based thermoelectrics together with theoretical predictions for their future viability are highlighted. Also, progress on modulating halide perovskite-based thermoelectric properties using light and chemical doping is discussed. Finally, strategies to overcome the limiting factors in halide perovskite thermoelectrics and their prospects are emphasized.},

In this study, the VD rats exhibit a progressive cognitive impairment, as well as a time-related increasing in hippocampal neural stem cells (H-NSCs) senescence, lost and neurogenesis decline. Then, embryonic stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (ESC-sEVs) are intravenously injected into VD rats. ESC-sEVs treatment significantly alleviates H-NSCs senescence, recovers compromised proliferation and neuron differentiation capacity, and reverses cognitive impairment. By microarray analysis and RT-qPCR it is identified that several miRNAs including miR-17-5p, miR-18a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-29a-3p, and let-7a-5p, that can inhibit mTORC1 activation, exist in ESC-sEVs. ESC-sEVs rejuvenate H-NSCs senescence partly by transferring these miRNAs to inhibit mTORC1 activation, promote transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation and lysosome resumption. Taken together, these data indicate that H-NSCs senescence cause cell depletion, neurogenesis reduction, and cognitive impairment in VD. ESC-sEVs treatment ameliorates H-NSCs senescence by inhibiting mTORC1 activation, and promoting TFEB nuclear translocation and lysosome resumption, thereby reversing senescence-related neurogenesis dysfunction and cognitive impairment in VD. The application of ESC-sEVs may be a novel cell-free therapeutic tool for patients with VD, as well as other aging-related diseases.},

Accompanied with the first dimethyl sulfoxide sublimation process, the subsequent sublimation of GA before 150 °C in the FA 0.85 MA 0.15 PbI 3 perovskite film can artfully regulate the perovskite crystallinity without any residual after annealing. The improved film formation upon GA modification induced by the strong interaction between GA and Pb 2+ delivers a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 21.32%. In order to investigate the role of volatility in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), nonvolatile thioglycolic acid (HSCH 2 COOH, TGA) with a similar structure to GA is utilized as an additive reference. Large perovskite grains are obtained by TGA modification but with obvious pinholes, which directly leads to an increased defect density accompanied by a decline in PCE. Encouragingly, the champion PCE achieved for GA-based PSC device (21.32%) is almost 13% or 20% higher than those of the control device or TGA-based device. In addition, GA-modified PSCs exhibit the best stability in light-, thermal-, and humidity-based tests due to the improved film formation.},

  abstract     = {Conventional therapies for late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) have limited effects because of chemoresistance, recurrence, and metastasis. The “hidden” proteins/peptides encoded by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be a novel resource bank for therapeutic options for patients with cancer. Here, lncRNA LOC90024 is discovered to encode a small 130-amino acid protein that interacts with several splicing regulators, such as serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3), to regulate mRNA splicing, and the protein thus is named “Splicing Regulatory Small Protein” (SRSP). SRSP, but not LOC90024 lncRNA itself, promotes CRC tumorigenesis and progression, while silencing of SRSP suppresses CRC tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, SRSP increases the binding of SRSF3 to exon 3 of transcription factor Sp4 , resulting in the inclusion of Sp4 exon 3 to induce the formation of the “cancerous” long Sp4 isoform (L-Sp4 protein) and inhibit the formation of the “noncancerous” short Sp4 isoform (S-Sp4 peptide), which lacks the transactivation domain. The upregulated SRSP level is positively associated with malignant phenotypes and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Collectively, the findings uncover that a lncRNA-encoded small protein SRSP induces “cancerous” Sp4 splicing variant formation and may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with CRC.},

A potentially effective approach to improve the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy would be to exploit the benefits of nanotechnology. This report highlights the current limitations of CAR-T immunotherapy and pinpoints potential opportunities and tremendous advantages of using nanotechnology to 1) introduce CAR transgene cassettes into primary T cells, 2) stimulate T cell expansion and persistence, 3) improve T cell trafficking, 4) stimulate the intrinsic T cell activity, 5) reprogram the immunosuppressive cellular and vascular microenvironments, and 6) monitor the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy.

  abstract     = {The development of antimicrobial drug resistance among pathogenic bacteria and fungi is one of the most significant health issues of the 21st century. Recently, advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of nanomaterials, particularly metals that exhibit antimicrobial properties. These metal nanomaterials have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional antimicrobial therapies. In this review, a broad overview of metal nanomaterials, their synthesis, properties, and interactions with pathogenic micro-organisms is first provided. Secondly, the range of nanomaterials that demonstrate passive antimicrobial properties are outlined and in-depth analysis and comparison of stimuli-responsive antimicrobial nanomaterials are provided, which represent the next generation of microbiocidal nanomaterials. The stimulus applied to activate such nanomaterials includes light (including photocatalytic and photothermal) and magnetic fields, which can induce magnetic hyperthermia and kinetically driven magnetic activation. Broadly, this review aims to summarize the currently available research and provide future scope for the development of metal nanomaterial-based antimicrobial technologies, particularly those that can be activated through externally applied stimuli.},

This gives rise to its prominent physical properties which promises the onset of novel physical phenomena and applications. Here, the in-plane electronic correlations are explored, and new mid-infrared plasmon excitations in 1T′ phase monolayer WSe 2 and MoS 2 are observed using optical spectroscopies. Based on an extensive first-principles study which analyzes the charge dynamics across multiple axes of the atomic-layered systems, the collective charge excitations are found to disperse only along the direction perpendicular to the chains. Further analysis reveals that the interchain long-range coupling is responsible for the coherent 1D charge dynamics and the spin–orbit coupling affects the plasmon frequency. Detailed investigation of these charge collective modes in 2D-chained systems offers opportunities for novel device applications and has implications for the underlying mechanism that governs superconductivity in 2D TMD systems.},

However, a molecular crystal formed by an aromatic polynitrogen similar to a carbon system has not been found yet. Herein, a new form of stable all-nitrogen molecular crystals consisting of only bispentazole N 10 molecules with exceedingly high energy density is predicted. The crystal structures and the conformation of N 10 molecules are strongly correlated, both depending on the applied external pressure. These molecular crystals can be recovered upon the release of the pressure. The first-principles molecular dynamics simulations reveal that these all-nitrogen materials decompose at temperatures much higher than room temperature. The decompositions always start from breaking off N 2 molecules from the nitrogen ring and can release a large amount of energy. These new polynitrogens are aromatic and are more stable than all the other polynitrogen crystals reported previously, providing a new green strategy to get all-nitrogen, nonpolluting high energy density materials without introducing any metal or other guest stabilizer.},

  abstract     = {Sub-nanometric particles (SNPs) of atomic cluster sizes have shown great promise in many fields such as full atom-to-atom utilization, but their precise production and stabilization at high mass loadings remain a great challenge. As a solution to overcome this challenge, a strategy allowing synthesis and preservation of SNPs at high mass loadings within multishell hollow metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is demonstrated. First, alternating water-decomposable and water-stable MOFs are stacked in succession to build multilayer MOFs. Next, using controlled hydrogen bonding affinity, isolated water molecules are selectively sieved through the hydrophobic nanocages of water-stable MOFs and transferred one by one to water-decomposable MOFs. The transmission of water molecules via controlled hydrogen bonding affinity through the water-stable MOF layers is a key step to realize SNPs from various types of alternating water-decomposable and water-stable layers. This process transforms multilayer MOFs into SNP-embedded multishell hollow MOFs. Additionally, the multishell stabilizes SNPs by π-backbonding allowing high conductivity to be achieved via the hopping mechanism, and hollow interspaces minimize transport resistance. These features, as demonstrated using SNP-embedded multishell hollow MOFs with up to five shells, lead to high electrochemical performances including high volumetric capacities and low overpotentials in Li–O 2 batteries.},

  abstract     = {Rhenium dichalcogenides (ReX 2 , X = S or Se) are catalysts that have great promise for the photoenhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (PE-HER) because of their unique physiochemical properties. However, the catalytic performance is still restricted by their low concentration of electrocatalytic activity sites and poor injection of hot electrons. Herein, dual-enhancement in ReSe 2 nanosheets (NSs) with high concentration of active sites and efficient use of hot electrons is simultaneously achieved with moderate Mo doping. Contributions from exposed catalytically active sites, improved electrical conductivity, and enhanced solar spectral response are systematically investigated. Superior PE-HER catalytical performance is obtained in Re 0.94 Mo 0.06 Se 2 , which has more catalytically active sites and optimized band structure than other Re 1− x Mo x Se 2 samples. Here, it is demonstrated that only doping can reduce the overpotential (η 10 ) from 239 to 174 mV at −10 mA cm −2 (Δ1η 10 = 65 mV). Then, η 10 is further improved to 137 mV under simulated AM 1.5 sun illumination (Δ2η 10 = 37 mV). The total improvement (Δη 10 ) toward PE-HER is 102 mV (Δ1η 10 + Δ2η 10 = 102 mV) in optimal Re 0.94 Mo 0.06 Se 2 . This work presents a new perspective for researching high-efficiency photoenhanced HER ReSe 2 -based electrocatalysts and other layered transition metal dichalcogenides.},

  abstract     = {The 2D conductive metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are expected to be an ideal electrocatalyst due to their high utilization of metal atoms. Exploring a new conjugated ligand with extra active metallic center can further boost the structural advantages of conductive MOFs. In this work, hexaiminohexaazatrinaphthalene (HAHATN) is employed as a conjugated ligand to construct bimetallic sited conductive MOFs (M2 3 (M1 3 ∙HAHATN) 2 ) with an extra M–N 2 moiety. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 2D conjugated framework renders M2 3 (M1 3 ∙HAHATN) 2 a high electric conductivity with narrow bandgap (0.19 eV) for electron transfer and a favorable in-plane porous structure (2.7 nm) for mass transfer. Moreover, the metal atom at the extra M–N 2 moiety has a higher unsaturation degree than that at M–N 4 linkage, resulting in a stronger ability to donate electrons for enhancing electroactivity. These characteristics endow the new conductive MOFs with an enhanced electroactivity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis. Among the series of M2 3 (M1 3 ∙HAHATN) 2 MOF, Ni 3 (Ni 3 ∙HAHATN) 2 nanosheets with the optimal structure exhibit a small overpotential of 115 mV at 10 mA cm −2 , low Tafel slope of (45.6 mV dec −1 ), and promising electrocatalytic stability for HER.

  abstract     = {The concept of bromination for organic solar cells has received little attention. However, the electron withdrawing ability and noncovalent interactions of bromine are similar to those of fluorine and chlorine atoms. A tetra-brominated non-fullerene acceptor, designated as BTIC-4Br, has been recently developed by introducing bromine atoms onto the end-capping group of 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene) malononitrile and displayed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12%. To further improve its photovoltaic performance, the acceptor is optimized either by introducing a longer alkyl chain to the core or by modulating the numbers of bromine substituents. After changing each end-group to a single bromine, the BTIC-2Br- m -based devices exhibit an outstanding PCE of 16.11% with an elevated open-circuit voltage of V oc = 0.88 V, one of the highest PCEs reported among brominated non-fullerene acceptors. This significant improvement can be attributed to the higher light harvesting efficiency, optimized morphology, and higher exciton quenching efficiencies of the di-brominated acceptor. These results demonstrate that the substitution of bromine onto the terminal group of non-fullerene acceptors results in high-efficiency organic semiconductors, and promotes the use of the halogen-substituted strategy for polymer solar cell applications.},

  abstract     = {The rate of lung cancer has gradually increased in recent years, with an average annual increase of 15%. Afatinib (AFT) plays a key role in preventing non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) growth and spread. To increase the efficiency of drug loading and NSCLC cell tracking, near infrared-persistent luminescence nanomaterials (NIR PLNs), a silica shell-assisted synthetic route for mono-dispersal, are developed and used in the nanovehicle. After optimizing their physical and chemical properties, the NIR PLNs are able to absorb light energy and emit NIR luminescence for several hours. In this research, NIR PLNs are functionalized for drug-carrying capabilities. Effective accumulation of target drugs, such as AFT, using PLN nanomaterials can lead to unique anticancer therapeutic benefits (AFT-PLN). To minimize side effects and increase drug accumulation, nanomaterials with targeting abilities are used instead of simple drugs to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Thus, the specific targeting aptamer, MAGE-A3 (MAp) is identified, and the PLN to increase its targeting ability (AFT-PLN@MAp) accordingly modified. The advancement of nanoscale techniques in the field of lung cancer is urgently needed; this research presents a plausible diagnostic strategy and a novel method for therapeutic administration.},

  abstract     = {Designer self-assembling peptides form the entangled nanofiber networks in hydrogels by ionic-complementary self-assembly. This type of hydrogel has realistic biological and physiochemical properties to serve as biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) for biomedical applications. The advantages and benefits are distinct from natural hydrogels and other synthetic or semisynthetic hydrogels. Designer peptides provide diverse alternatives of main building blocks to form various functional nanostructures. The entangled nanofiber networks permit essential compositional complexity and heterogeneity of engineering cell microenvironments in comparison with other hydrogels, which may reconstruct the tumor microenvironments (TMEs) in 3D cell cultures and tissue-specific modeling in vitro. Either ovarian cancer progression or recurrence and relapse are involved in the multifaceted TMEs in addition to mesothelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, immune cells, adipocytes, and the ECM. Based on the progress in common hydrogel products, this work focuses on the diverse designer self-assembling peptide hydrogels for instructive cell constructs in tissue-specific modeling and the precise oncology remodeling for ovarian cancer, which are issued by several research aspects in a 3D context. The advantages and significance of designer peptide hydrogels are discussed, and some common approaches and coming challenges are also addressed in current complex tumor diseases.},

  abstract     = {The development of science and technology often drew lessons from natural phenomena. Herein, inspired by drying-driven curling of apple peels, hydrogel-based micro-scaled hollow tubules (MHTs) are proposed for biomimicking microvessels, which promote microcirculation and improve the survival of random skin flaps. MHTs with various pipeline structures are fabricated using hydrogel in corresponding shapes, such as Y-branches, anastomosis rings, and triangle loops. Adjustable diameters can be achieved by altering the concentration and cross-linking time of the hydrogel. Based on this rationale, biomimetic microvessels with diameters of 50–500 µm are cultivated in vitro by coculture of MHTs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In vivo studies show their excellent performance to promote microcirculation and improve the survival of random skin flaps. In conclusion, the present work proposes and validifies a biomimetic 3D self-forming method for the fabrication of biomimetic vessels and microvascular scaffolds with high biocompatibility and stability based on hydrogel materials, such as gelatin and hyaluronic acid.},

A small molecule ZY-444 (( N 4 -((5-(4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)-2-thiophenyl)methyl)- N 2 -isobutyl-2,4-pyrimidinediamine) is discovered to inhibit cancer cell proliferation specifically, having potent efficacies against tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. ZY-444 binds to cellular pyruvate carboxylase (PC), a key anaplerotic enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and inactivates its catalytic activity. PC inhibition suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis through inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin/Snail signaling pathway. Lower PC expression in patient tumors is correlated with significant survival benefits. Comparative profiles of PC expression in cancer versus normal tissues implicate the tumor selectivity of ZY-444. Overall, ZY-444 holds promise therapeutically as an anti-cancer metabolism agent.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary dynamics of tumor-associated neoantigens carry information about drug sensitivity and resistance to the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). However, the spectrum of somatic mutations is highly heterogeneous among patients, making it difficult to track neoantigens by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing using “one size fits all” commercial gene panels. Thus, individually customized panels (ICPs) are needed to track neoantigen evolution comprehensively during ICB treatment. Dominant neoantigens are predicted from whole exome sequencing data for treatment-naïve tumor tissues. Panels targeting predicted neoantigens are used for personalized ctDNA sequencing. Analyzing ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer, ICPs are effective for tracking most predicted dominant neoantigens (80–100%) in serial peripheral blood samples, and to detect substantially more genes (18–30) than the capacity of current commercial gene panels. A more than 50% decrease in ctDNA concentration after eight weeks of ICB administration is associated with favorable progression-free survival. Furthermore, at the individual level, the magnitude of the early ctDNA response is correlated with the subsequent change in tumor burden. The application of ICP-based ctDNA sequencing is expected to improve the understanding of ICB-driven tumor evolution and to provide personalized management strategies that optimize the clinical benefits of immunotherapies.},

However, most of the existing 4D printed products only focus on the variation of physical geometries, regardless of controllable changes of their properties, as well as practical functionality. Here, a material combination concept is proposed to construct 4D printed devices whose property and functionality can controllably vary. The 4D printed devices consist of conductive and magnetic parts, enabling the integrated devices to show a piezoelectric property even neither part is piezoelectric individually. Consequently, the functionality of the devices is endowed to transfer mechanical to electrical energy based on the electromagnetic introduction principle. The working mechanism of 4D printed devices is explained by a numerical simulation method using Comsol software, facilitating further optimization of their properties by regulating diverse parameters. Due to the self-powered, quick-responding, and sensitive properties, the 4D printed magnetoelectric device could work as pressure sensors to warn illegal invasion. This work opens a new manufacturing method of flexible magnetoelectric devices and provides a new material combination concept for the property-changed and functionality-changed 4D printing.},

While total pore volume in sulfur cathodes affects AE/S and performance, it is shown here that pore morphology, size, connectivity, and fill factor all matter. Compared to conventional thermally dried sulfur cathodes that usually render “open lakes” and closed pores, a freeze-dried and compressed (FDS-C) sulfur cathode is developed with a canal-capillary pore structure, which exhibits high mean performance and greatly reduces cell-to-cell variation, even at high sulfur loading (14.2 mg cm −2 ) and ultralean electrolyte condition (AE/S = 1.2 µL mg −1 ). Interestingly, as AE/S is swept from 2 to 1.2 µL mg −1 , the electrode pores go from fully flooded to semi-flooded, and the coin cell still maintains function until (AE/S) min ≈ 1.2 µL mg −1 is reached. When scaled up to Ah-level pouch cells, the full-cell energy density can reach 481 Wh kg −1 as its E/S ≈ AE/S ratio can be reduced to 1.2 µL mg −1 , proving high-performance pouch cells can actually be working in the ultralean, semi-flooded regime.},

Ferromagnetic order is manifested using magnetic force microscopy up to 360 K, while retaining high on/off current ratio of ≈10 5 at 0.1% V-doping concentration. The V-substitution to W sites keeps a V–V separation distance of 5 nm without V–V aggregation, scrutinized by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy.

However, the development of the Sn-based PSCs is seriously hampered by the critical issues of poor stability and low power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the facile oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ and poor film formability of the perovskite films. Herein, a synthetic strategy is developed for the fabrication of methylammonium tin iodide (MASnI 3 ) film via ion exchange/insertion reactions between solid-state SnF 2 and gaseous methylammonium iodide. In this way, the nucleation and crystallization of MASnI 3 can be well controlled, and a highly uniform pinhole-free MASnI 3 perovskite film is obtained. More importantly, the detrimental oxidation can be effectively suppressed in the resulting MASnI 3 film due to the presence of a large amount of remaining SnF 2 . This high-quality perovskite film enables the realization of a PCE of 7.78%, which is among the highest values reported for the MASnI 3 -based solar cells. Moreover, the MASnI 3 solar cells exhibit high reproducibility and good stability. This method provides new opportunities for the fabrication of low-cost and lead-free tin-based halide perovskite solar cells.},

Knowledge of the molecular biology and genetics of glioblastoma has increased significantly in the past few years, giving rise to classification methods that can help in management and stratification of glioblastoma patients. However, glioblastoma remains an incurable disease. Glioblastoma cells have acquired genetic and metabolic adaptations in order to sustain tumor growth and progression, including changes in energetic metabolism, invasive capacity, migration, and angiogenesis, that make it very difficult to find suitable therapeutic targets and to develop effective drugs. The current standard of care for glioblastoma patients is surgery followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide.

  abstract     = {The ability of natural killer (NK) cells to mediate potent antitumor immunity in clinical adoptive transfer settings relies, in large part, on their ability to retain cytotoxic function following cryopreservation. To avoid potential systemic toxicities associated with infusions of NK cells into patients in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), interest in alternative cryoprotective agents (CPAs) with improved safety profiles has grown. Despite the development of various sugars, amino acids, polyols, and polyampholytes as cryoprotectants, their ability to promote protection from intracellular cryodamage is limited because they mostly act outside of the cell. Though ways to shuttle cryoprotectants intracellularly exist, NK cells&#39; high aversity to manipulation and freezing has meant they are highly understudied as targets for the development of new cryopreservation approaches. Here, the first example of a safe and efficient platform for the intracellular delivery of non-DMSO CPAs to NK cells is presented. Biocompatible chitosan-based nanoparticles are engineered to mediate the efficient DMSO-free cryopreservation of NK cells. NK cells cryopreserved in this way retain potent cytotoxic, degranulation, and cytokine production functions against tumor targets. This not only represents the first example of delivering nanoparticles to NK cells, but illustrates the clinical potential in manufacturing safer allogeneic adoptive immunotherapies “off the shelf.”},

Here, a series of high-quality intermediate compounds are prepared and it is shown that they consist of DMAI/DMAPbI x . Further characterization of the products show that the main component of this system is still CsPbI 3 . Most of the dimethylammonium (DMA + ) organic component is lost during annealing. Only an ultrasmall amount of DMA + is doped into the CsPbI 3 and its structure is stabilized. Meanwhile, excessive DMA + forms Lewis acid–base adducts and interactions with Pb 2+ on the CsPbI 3 surface. This process passivates the CsPbI 3 film and decreases the recombination rate. Finally, CsPbI 3 film is fabricated with high crystalline, uniform morphology, and excellent stability. Its corresponding PSC exhibits stable property and improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 17.3%.},

  abstract     = {Global multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are spreading rapidly and causing a great threat to human health due to the abuse of antibiotics. Determining how to resensitize MDR bacteria to conventional inefficient antibiotics is of extreme urgency. Here, a low-temperature photothermal treatment (PTT, 45 °C) is utilized with red phosphorus nanoparticles to resensitize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to conventional aminoglycoside antibiotics. The antibacterial mechanism is studied by the proteomic technique and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which proves that the aminoglycoside antibiotics against MRSA can be selectively potentiated by low-temperature PTT. The catalytic activity of 2-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH (2″))—a modifying enzyme—is demonstrated to be obviously inhibited via detecting the consumption of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the catalytic reaction. It is also found that the active site of aspartic acid (ASP) residues in APH (2″) is thermally unstable from the results of molecular dynamics simulation. Its catalytic ability is inhibited by preventing the deprotonating procedure for the target  OH of gentamycin. The combined therapy also exhibits great biocompatibility and successfully treats MRSA infections in vivo. This low-temperature PTT strategy has the potential to be an exogenous-modifying enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of MDR bacterial infection.},

  abstract     = {Clean surgical margins in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) are essential for preventing recurrence. Intraoperative pathologic diagnostic methods, such as frozen section analysis and imprint cytology, have been recognized as crucial tools in BCS. However, the complexity and time-consuming nature of these pathologic procedures still inhibit their broader applicability worldwide. To address this situation, two issues should be considered: 1) the development of nonpathologic intraoperative diagnosis methods that have better sensitivity, specificity, speed, and cost; and 2) the promotion of new imaging algorithms to standardize data for analyzing positive margins, as represented by artificial intelligence (AI), without the need for judgment by well-trained pathologists. Researchers have attempted to develop new methods or techniques; several have recently emerged for real-time intraoperative management of breast margins in live tissues. These methods include conventional imaging, spectroscopy, tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, microscopy, fluorescent probes, and multimodal imaging techniques. This work summarizes the traditional pathologic and newly developed techniques and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Taking into consideration the recent advances in analyzing pathologic data from breast cancer tissue with AI, the combined use of new technologies with AI algorithms is proposed, and future directions for real-time intraoperative margin assessment in BCS are discussed.},

Current stimuli approaches (light, chemical, and temperature) require transparent windows and specific systems, or are subject to the tolerant temperature of batteries, hampering their widespread applications. Herein, a fast and reversible on-demand switching of batteries, which is realized by incorporating a magnetic control component, is reported. The component is capable of undergoing a reversible transition between electrical conduction and insulation over 500 cycles, showing superior cycling stability. Batteries with this component internally incorporated can retain excellent electrochemical performance in a wide potential window at normal conditions. More importantly, this approach can manage the operation of batteries in light of human requirements. The battery can shut down within 0.11 s of applying a magnetic field and rapidly resume a normal battery function under the magnetic field, showing an excellent response speed. Notably, this on-demand switching behavior in batteries can be repeated over 25 times, excelling most reported switching batteries. The design combines fast and repeatable characteristics without sacrificing electrochemical performance, providing possibilities in advancing the development of smart electronics.},

The precision oligomers are specifically designed to be encrypted upon heating as a result of the random reshuffling of the TAD-indole covalent bonds within the backbone, thereby resulting in the scrambling of the encoded information. The encrypted pin code can eventually be decrypted following a second heating step that enables the macromolecular pin code to be deciphered using 1D electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The herein introduced concept of encryption/decryption represents a key advancement compared with current strategies that typically use uncontrolled degradation to erase and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to analyze, decipher, and read-out chemically encrypted information.

Here, transmembrane pH gradient poly(isoprene)- block -poly(ethylene glycol) (PI- b -PEG) polymersomes are investigated for the topical removal of TMA. PI- b -PEG amphiphiles of varying chain length are synthesized and evaluated for their ability to form vesicular structures in aqueous media. The optimization of the PI/PEG ratio of transmembrane pH gradient polymersomes allows for the rapid and efficient capture of TMA both in solution and after incorporation into a topical hydrogel matrix at the pH of the skin. A subsequent double blind olfactory study reveals a significant decrease in perceived odor intensity after application of the polymersome-based formulation on artificial skin substrates that has been incubated in TMA-containing medium.

Here, a new automated tool based on microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) image data sets known as computer-assisted cardiac cavity tracking (CACCT) is presented, which can detect the connections between cardiac cavities and identify complicated cardiac malformations in mouse hearts automatically. With CACCT, researchers, even those without expert training or diagnostic experience of CHD, can identify complicated cardiac malformations in mice conveniently and precisely, including transposition of the great arteries, double-outlet right ventricle and atypical ventricular septal defect, whose accuracy is equivalent to senior fetal cardiologists.

Nanointegration of NIR CDs and peroxalate (P-CDs) through the bridging effect of amphiphilic triblock copolymer can serve as turn-on probes for the detection and imaging of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Considering high efficiency and large penetration depth of NIR photons, the P-CDs are employed in bioimaging H 2 O 2 in vitro and in vivo, and the detection limit can reach 5 × 10 −9 m , among the best reported of CDs-based sensors. Moreover, imaging of inflammatory H 2 O 2 in a mouse model of peritonitis is achieved by employing the P-CDs as sensors.

They have attracted widespread attention in homogeneous catalysis. Due to the challenges associated with their aggregation, precipitation, and degradation under operational conditions and to extend their scope of applications, various strategies of depositing POMs on heterogeneous substrates have been developed. Recent ground-breaking developments in the materials chemistry of supported POM composites are summarized and links between molecular-level understanding of POM-support interactions and macroscopic effects including new or optimized reactivities, improved stability, and novel function are established. Current limitations and future challenges in studying these complex composite materials are highlighted, and cutting-edge experimental and theoretical methods that will lead to an improved understanding of synergisms between POM and support material from the molecular through to the nano- and micrometer level are discussed. Future development in this fast-moving field is explored and emerging fields of research in POM heterogenization are identified.},

  abstract     = {Although the energy consumption of reported neuromorphic computing devices inspired by biological systems has become lower than traditional memory, it still remains greater than bio-synapses (≈10 fJ per spike). Herein, a flexible MoS 2 -based heterosynapse is designed with two modulation modes, an electronic mode and a photoexcited mode. A one-step mechanical exfoliation method on flexible substrate and low-temperature atomic layer deposition process compatible with flexible electronics are developed for fabricating wearable heterosynapses. With a pre-spike of 100 ns, the synaptic device exhibits ultralow energy consumption of 18.3 aJ per spike in long-term potentiation and 28.9 aJ per spike in long-term depression. The ultrafast speed and ultralow power consumption provide a path for a neuromorphic computing system owning more excellent processing ability than the human brain. By adding optical modulation, a modulatory synapse is constructed to dynamically control correlations between pre- and post-synapses and realize complex global neuromodulations. The novel wearable heterosynapse expands the accessible range of synaptic weights (ratio of facilitation ≈228%), providing an insight into the application of wearable 2D highly efficient neuromorphic computing architectures.},

Barcoding beads are key components for these technologies. What is limiting today are barcoding beads that are easy to fabricate, can efficiently deliver primers into drops, and thus achieve high detection efficiency. Here, this work reports an approach to fabricate dissolvable polyacrylamide beads, by crosslinking acrylamide with disulfide bridges that can be cleaved with dithiothreitol. The beads can be rapidly dissolved in drops and release DNA barcode primers. The dissolvable beads are easy to synthesize, and the primer cost for the beads is significantly lower than that for the previous barcoding beads. Furthermore, the dissolvable beads can be loaded into drops with &gt;95% loading efficiency of a single bead per drop and the dissolution of beads does not influence reverse transcription or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in drops. Based on this approach, the dissolvable beads are used for single cell RNA and protein analysis.},

  abstract     = {The past decade has seen the materialization of immune checkpoint blockade as an emerging approach to cancer treatment. However, the overall response and patient survival are still modest. Various efforts to study the “cancer immunogram” have highlighted complex biology that necessitates a multipronged approach. This includes increasing the antigenicity of the tumor, strengthening the immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, removing the immunosuppressive mechanisms, and reducing immune cell exhaustion. The coordination of these approaches, as well as the ability to enhance them through delivery, is evaluated. Due to their success in multiple preclinical models, external-stimuli-responsive nanoparticles have received tremendous attention. Several studies report success in distantly located tumor regression, metastases, and reoccurrence in preclinical mouse models. However, clinical translation in this space remains low. Herein, the recent advancement in external-stimuli-responsive nanoconstruct-synergized immune checkpoint blockade is summarized, offering an industry perspective on the limitations of current academic innovations and discussing challenges in translation from a technical, manufacturing, and regulatory perspective. These limitations and challenges will need to be addressed to establish external-stimuli-based therapeutic strategies for patients.},

Herein, an image-based machine learning approach to systematically screen chemically modified myo -inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) analogues is utilized, which enables the identification of a highly active divalent inositol phosphate molecule. To date, this is the first molecule shown to completely inhibit the crystallization process in the nanomolar range, reduce crystal–cell interactions, thereby preventing CaOx-induced transcriptomic changes, and decrease renal CaOx deposition and kidney injury in a mouse model of hyperoxaluria. In conclusion, IP6 analogues based on such a scaffold may represent a new treatment option for CaOx nephropathies.},

However, only a subset of cancer patients responds to current immunotherapy because of low immunogenicity of the tumor cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, host–guest prodrug nanovectors are reported for active tumor targeting and combating immune tolerance in tumors. The prodrug nanovectors are designed by integrating hyaluronic acid (HA) and reduction-labile heterodimer of Pheophorbide A (PPa) and NLG919 into the supramolecular nanocomplexes, where PPa and NLG919 act as a photosensitizer and potent inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), respectively. Meanwhile, HA is employed to achieve active tumor targeting by recognizing CD44 overexpressed on the surface of tumor cell membranes. Near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation triggers the release of reactive oxygen species to provoke antitumor immunogenicity and intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Meanwhile, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM) is reversed by NLG919-mediated IDO-1 inhibition. Combination of photodynamic immunotherapy and IDO-1 blockade efficiently eradicates CT26 colorectal tumors in the immunocompetent mice. The host–guest nanoplatform capable of eliciting effective antitumor immunity by inactivating inhibitory immune response can be applied to other immune modulators for improved cancer immunotherapy.},

Ultrathin nanofibrous sheaths stented with biodegrading elastomer present opening channels and reduced material residue, enabling fast cell recruitment and host remodeling, while incorporating peptides offering developmental cues are challenging. In this study, a recombinant human thymosin β4 dimer (DTβ4) that contains two complete Tβ4 molecules is produced. The adult perivascular adipose is found as the dominant source of vascular progenitors which, when stimulated by the DTβ4-loaded nanofibrous sheath, enables 100% patency rates, near-complete structural as well as adequate functional regeneration of artery, and effectively ameliorates aging-induced defective regeneration. As compared with Tβ4, DTβ4 exhibits durable regenerative activity including recruiting more progenitors for endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, when incorporated into the ultrathin polycaprolactone sheath. Moreover, the DTβ4-loaded interface promotes smooth muscle cells differentiation, mainly through promoting M2 macrophage polarization and chemokines. Incorporating artificial DTβ4 into ultrathin sheaths of fast degrading vascular grafts creates an effective interface for sufficient muscular remodeling thus offering a robust tool for vessel replacement.},

  abstract     = {The non-covalent affinity of photoresponsive molecules to biotargets represents an attractive tool for achieving effective cell photo-stimulation. Here, an amphiphilic azobenzene that preferentially dwells within the plasma membrane is studied. In particular, its isomerization dynamics in different media is investigated. It is found that in molecular aggregates formed in water, the isomerization reaction is hindered, while radiative deactivation is favored. However, once protected by a lipid shell, the photochromic molecule reacquires its ultrafast photoisomerization capacity. This behavior is explained considering collective excited states that may form in aggregates, locking the conformational dynamics and redistributing the oscillator strength. By applying the pump probe technique in different media, an isomerization time in the order of 10 ps is identified and the deactivation in the aggregate in water is also characterized. Finally, it is demonstrated that the reversible modulation of membrane potential of HEK293 cells via illumination with visible light can be indeed related to the recovered trans→cis photoreaction in lipid membrane. These data fully account for the recently reported experiments in neurons, showing that the amphiphilic azobenzenes, once partitioned in the cell membrane, are effective light actuators for the modification of the electrical state of the membrane.},

The Rec. 2020 requires Commission Internationale de l&#39;Eclairage coordinates of (0.708, 0.292) for red emitters, but present-day perovskite devices only achieve (0.71, 0.28). Here, lead-free PeLEDs are reported with color coordinates of (0.706, 0.294)—the highest purity reported among red PeLEDs. The variation of the emission spectrum is also evaluated as a function of temperature and applied potential, finding that emission redshifts by &lt;3 nm under low temperature and by &lt;0.3 nm V −1 with operating voltage. The prominent oxidation pathway of Sn is identified and this is suppressed with the aid of H 3 PO 2 . This strategy prevents the oxidation of the constituent precursors, through both its moderate reducing properties and through its forming complexes with the perovskite that increase the energetic barrier toward Sn oxidation. The H 3 PO 2 additionally seeds crystal growth during film formation, improving film quality. PeLEDs are reported with an EQE of 0.3% and a brightness of 70 cd m −2 ; this is the record among reported red-emitting, lead-free PeLEDs.},

Here, to address these issues, m-xylylenediamine (MXDA) is firstly introduced into tissue clearing and used to develop a rapid, highly efficient aqueous clearing method with robust lipophilic dyes compatibility, termed MXDA-based Aqueous Clearing System (MACS). MACS can render whole adult brains highly transparent within 2.5 days and is also applicable for other intact organs. Meanwhile, MACS possesses ideal compatibility with multiple probes, especially for lipophilic dyes. MACS achieves 3D imaging of the intact neural structures labeled by various techniques. Combining MACS with DiI labeling, MACS allows reconstruction of the detailed vascular structures of various organs and generates 3D pathology of glomeruli tufts in healthy and diabetic kidneys. Therefore, MACS provides a useful method for 3D mapping of intact tissues and is expected to facilitate morphological, physiological, and pathological studies of various organs.},

However, because of high thermal emittance (&gt;95%), these carbon-based materials always cause huge energy loss that hinders the solar-thermal conversion efficiency tremendously. In this study, a reduced graphene oxide–based spectrally selective absorber (rGO-SSA) is demonstrated, which possesses a recorded low thermal emittance (≈4%) and high solar absorptance (α solar ≈ 0.92) by easily regulating the reduction level of inner 2D graphene sheets. Compared to conventional carbon-based black materials, thermal emittance of this rGO-SSA is largely reduced by ≈95.8% and the cutoff wavelength of rGO-SSA is broadband-tunable that can range from 1.1 to 3.2 µm. More importantly, this simply sol-gel coated rGO-SSA has high temperature tolerance at 800 °C for 96 h that is hardly achieved by other cermet-based or photonic-based SSAs. Based on this rGO-SSA, ultrafast solar steam escape (0.94 mg cm −2 s −1 ) under concentrated solar irradiance is achieved directly.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, red phosphor plays a key role in improving the lighting quality and color rendering index of phosphor-converted white light emitting diodes (w-LEDs). However, the development of thermally stable and highly efficient red phosphor is still a pivotal challenge. Herein, a new strategy to design antithermal-quenching red emission in Eu 3+ , Mn 4+ -codoped phosphors is proposed. The photoluminescence intensity of Mg 3 Y 2(1− y ) Ge 3 O 12 : y Eu 3+ , Mn 4+ (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) phosphors continuously enhances with rising temperature from 298 to 523 K based on Eu 3+ → Mn 4+ energy transfer. For Mg 3 Eu 2 Ge 3 O 12 :Mn 4+ sample, the integrated intensity at 523 K remarkably reaches 120% of that at 298 K. Interestingly, through codoping Eu 3+ and Mn 4+ in Mg 3 Y 2 Ge 3 O 12 , the photoluminescence color is controllably tuned from orangish-red (610 nm) to deep-red (660 nm) light by changing Eu 3+ concentration. The fabricated w-LEDs exhibit superior warm white light with low corrected color temperature (CCT = 4848 K) and high color rendering index ( R a = 96.2), indicating the promising red component for w-LED applications. Based on the abnormal increase in antistokes peaks of Mn 4+ with temperatures, Mg 3 Eu 2 Ge 3 O 12 :Mn 4+ phosphor also presents a potential application in optical thermometry sensors. This work initiates a new insight to construct thermally stable and spectra-tunable red phosphors for various optical applications.},

  abstract     = {Electronics allowing for visible light to pass through are attractive, where a key challenge is to make the core functional units transparent. Here, it is shown that transparent electronics can be constructed by epitaxial growth of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) on single-layer graphene (SLG) to give a desirable transparency of 95.7% to 550 nm visible light and an electrical conductivity of 4.0 × 10 4 S m −1 . Through lattice and symmetry match, collective alignment of MOF pores and dense packing of MOFs vertically on SLG are achieved, as directly visualized by electron microscopy. These MOF-on-SLG constructs are capable of room-temperature recognition of gas molecules at the ppb level with a linear range from 10 to 10 8 ppb, providing real-time gas monitoring function in transparent electronics. The corresponding devices can be fabricated on flexible substrates with large size, 3 × 5 cm, and afford continuous folding for more than 200 times without losing conductivity or transparency.},

  abstract     = {Emerging memory devices, that can provide programmable information recording with tunable resistive switching under external stimuli, hold great potential for applications in data storage, logic circuits, and artificial synapses. Realization of multifunctional manipulation within individual memory devices is particularly important in the More-than-Moore era, yet remains a challenge. Here, both rewritable and nonerasable memory are demonstrated in a single stimuli-responsive polymer diode, based on a nanohole-nanowrinkle bi-interfacial structure. Such synergic nanostructure is constructed from interfacing a nanowrinkled bottom graphene electrode and top polymer matrix with nanoholes; and it can be easily prepared by spin coating, which is a low-cost and high-yield production method. Furthermore, the resulting device, with ternary and low-power operation under varied external stimuli, can enable both reversible and irreversible biomimetic pressure recognition memories using a device-to-system framework. This work offers both a general guideline to fabricate multifunctional memory devices via interfacial nanostructure engineering and a smart information storage basis for future artificial intelligence.},

Through decoration of immunogens on multivalent nanoparticles, designed nanovaccines can elicit improved humoral immunity. However, significant practical and monetary challenges in large-scale production of nanovaccines have impeded their widespread clinical translation. Here, an alternative approach is illustrated integrating computational protein modeling and adaptive electroporation-mediated synthetic DNA delivery, thus enabling direct in vivo production of nanovaccines. DNA-launched nanoparticles are demonstrated displaying an HIV immunogen spontaneously self-assembled in vivo. DNA-launched nanovaccines induce stronger humoral responses than their monomeric counterparts in both mice and guinea pigs, and uniquely elicit CD8+ effector T-cell immunity as compared to recombinant protein nanovaccines. Improvements in vaccine responses recapitulate when DNA-launched nanovaccines with alternative scaffolds and decorated antigen are designed and evaluated. Finally, evaluation of functional immune responses induced by DLnanovaccines demonstrates that, in comparison to control mice or mice immunized with DNA-encoded hemagglutinin monomer, mice immunized with a DNA-launched hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccine fully survive a lethal influenza challenge, and have substantially lower viral load, weight loss, and influenza-induced lung pathology. Additional study of these next-generation in vivo-produced nanovaccines may offer advantages for immunization against multiple disease targets.},

  abstract     = {Physical or chemical crosslinking of polymeric micelles has emerged as a straightforward approach to overcome the intrinsic instability of assemblies. However, the crosslinking process may compromise the responsivity of nanosystems and result in inefficient release of payloads. To address this dilemma, a crosslinking induced reassembly (CIRA) strategy is reported here to simultaneously increase the kinetic and thermodynamic stability and redox-responsivity of polymeric micelles. It is found that the click crosslinking of a model multiblock polyurethane at the micellar interface induces microphase separation between the soft and hard segments. The aggregation of hard domains gathers liable disulfide linkages around the interlayer of micelles, which could facilitate the attack of reducing agents and act as an intelligent on-off switch for high stability and triggered release. As a result, the CIRA approach enables an enhanced tumor targeting, improved biodistribution and excellent therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This work provides a facile and versatile platform for controlled delivery applications.},

Given the promise of stem cell therapeutics, a method to uniformly enhance stem cell function, in particular trophic factor release, can prove transformative in improving efficacy and increasing feasibility by reducing the total number of cells required. Herein, a click-chemistry powered 3D, single-cell encapsulation method aimed at synthesizing a polymeric coating with the optimal thickness around neural progenitor cells is introduced. Polymer encapsulation of neural stem cells significantly increases the release of neurotrophic factors such as VEGF and CNTF. Cell encapsulation with a soft extracellular polymer upregulates the ADCY8-cAMP pathway, suggesting a mechanism for the increase in paracrine factors.

This study indicates that mitochondrial granules are initiated by transporting calcium and phosphorus clusters from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria based on detailed observations of the continuous process of mouse parietal bone development as well as in vitro biomineralization in bone-forming cells. Nanosized biomineral precursors (≈30 nm in diameter), which originate from mitochondrial granules, initiate intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen as early as embryonic day 14.5. Both in vivo and in vitro studies further reveal that formation of mitochondrial granules is induced by the ER. Elevated levels of intracellular calcium or phosphate ions, which can be induced by treatment with ionomycin and black phosphorus, respectively, accelerate formation of the calcium and phosphorus clusters on ER membranes and ultimately promote biomineralization. These findings provide a novel insight into biomineralization and bone formation.},

Then, the preclinical studies conducted at the low weight bearing sites of animals are introduced. The innovative strategies (for example, via designing Mg-containing hybrid systems) are discussed to address the limitations of Mg-based metals prior to their clinical applications at weight-bearing sites. Finally, the available clinical studies are summarized and the challenges and perspectives of Mg-based orthopedic implants are discussed. Taken together, the progress made on the development of Mg-based implants in basic, translational, and clinical research has laid down a foundation for developing a new era in the treatment of challenging and prevalent bone diseases.},

  abstract     = {Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are associated with clinical symptoms such as gastroenteritis, keratoconjunctivitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and encephalitis. In the absence of protective immunity, as in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients, HAdV infections can become lethal. Alarmingly, various outbreaks of highly pathogenic, pneumotropic HAdV types have been recently reported, causing severe and lethal respiratory diseases. Effective drugs for treatment of HAdV infections are still lacking. The repurposing of drugs approved for other indications is a valuable alternative for the development of new antiviral therapies and is less risky and costly than de novo development. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is approved for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here, it is shown that ATO is a potent inhibitor of HAdV. ATO treatment blocks virus expression and replication by reducing the number and integrity of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, important subnuclear structures for HAdV replication. Modification of HAdV proteins with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) is also key to HAdV replication. ATO reduces levels of viral SUMO-E2A protein, while increasing SUMO-PML, suggesting that ATO interferes with SUMOylation of proteins crucial for HAdV replication. It is concluded that ATO targets cellular processes key to HAdV replication and is relevant for the development of antiviral intervention strategies.},

  abstract     = {Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are the key transcription factors that allow cancer cells to survive hypoxia. HIF&#39;s stability is mainly controlled by von Hippel–Lindau (pVHL)-mediated ubiquitylation. Unlike sporadic clear-cell renal carcinomas, VHL mutation is rarely observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the regulatory mechanisms of pVHL-HIF signaling remain elusive. Here, it is shown that deubiquitylase ovarian tumor domain-containing 6B (OTUD6B) suppresses HCC metastasis through inhibiting the HIF activity. OTUD6B directly interacts with pVHL, decreases its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation to reduce HIF-1α accumulation in HCC cells under hypoxia. Surprisingly, OTUD6B limits the ubiquitylation of pVHL independent of its deubiquitylase activity. OTUD6B couples pVHL and elongin B/C to form more CBC VHL ligase complex, which protects pVHL from proteasomal degradation. Depletion of OTUD6B results in the dissociation of CBC VHL complex and the degradation of pVHL by Trp Asp repeat and suppressors of cytokine signaling box-containing protein 1 (WSB1). In human HCC tissues, the protein level of OTUD6B is positively correlated with pVHL, but negatively with HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor. Low expression of OTUD6B predicts poor patient survival. Furthermore, OTUD6B gene is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1α and upregulated upon hypoxia. These results indicate a previously unrecognized feedback loop consisting of OTUD6B, pVHL, and HIF-1α, and provide insights into the targeted hypoxic microenvironment for HCC therapy.},

During metazoan evolution, the nucleus has been optimized to allow physical deformability while protecting the genome under load. Aberrant nucleus mechanics can alter cell migration across narrow spaces in cancer metastasis and immune response and disrupt nucleus mechanosensitivity. Uncovering the mechanical roles of lamins and chromatin is imperative for understanding the implications of physiological forces on cells and nuclei. Lamin-knockout and -rescue fibroblasts and probed nucleus response to physiologically relevant stresses are generated. A minimal viscoelastic model is presented that captures dynamic resistance across different cell types, lamin composition, phosphorylation states, and chromatin condensation. The model is conserved at low and high loading and is validated by micropipette aspiration and nanoindentation rheology. A time scale emerges that separates between dominantly elastic and dominantly viscous regimes. While lamin-A and lamin-B1 contribute to nucleus stiffness, viscosity is specified mostly by lamin-A. Elastic and viscous association of lamin-B1 and lamin-A is supported by transcriptional and proteomic profiling analyses. Chromatin decondensation quantified by electron microscopy softens the nucleus unless lamin-A is expressed. A mechanical framework is provided for assessing nucleus response to applied forces in health and disease.},

  abstract     = {RNA sequencing has greatly facilitated gene expression studies but is weak in studying temporal RNA dynamics; this issue can be addressed by analyzing nascent RNAs. A famous method for nascent RNA analysis is metabolic labeling with noncanonic nucleoside followed by affinity purification, however, purification processes can always introduce biases into data analysis. Here, a chemical method for nascent RNA sequencing that avoids affinity purification based on acrylonitrile-mediated uridine-to-cytidine (U-to-C) conversion (AMUC-seq) via 4-thiouridine (s 4 U) cyanoethylation is presented. This method converts s 4 U base-pairing with guanine through the nucleophilic addition of s 4 U to acrylonitrile. The high reaction efficiency permits AMUC-seq directly and efficiently to recover nascent RNA information from total RNAs. AMUC-seq is validated by being used to detect mRNA half-lives and investigating the direct gene targets of a G-quadruplex stabilizer, which can be regarded as potential anticancer drug, in human cells. Thousands of direct gene targets of this drug are verified (these genes are significantly enriched in cancer such as SRC and HRAS ). AMUC-seq also confirms G-quadruplex stabilization that impacts RNA polyadenylation. These results show AMUC-seq is qualified for the study of temporal RNA dynamics, and it can be a promising strategy to study the therapeutic mechanism of transcription-modulating drugs.},

  abstract     = {Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are viable candidates for integration into on-chip nano-circuitry that allow access to high data bandwidths and low energy consumption. Metal–insulator–metal tunneling junctions (MIM-TJs) have recently been shown to excite and detect SPPs electrically; however, experimentally measured efficiencies and outcoupling mechanisms are not fully understood. It is shown that the MIM-TJ cavity SPP mode (MIM-SPP) can outcouple via three pathways to i) photons via scattering of MIM-SPP at the MIM–TJ interfaces, ii) SPPs at the metal–dielectric interfaces (bound-SPPs) by mode coupling through the electrodes, and iii) photons and bound-SPP modes by mode coupling at the MIM-TJ edges. It is also shown that, for Al-AlO x -Cr-Au MIM-TJs on glass, the MIM-SPP mode outcouples efficiently to bound-SPPs through either electrode (pathway 2); this outcoupling pathway can be selectively turned on and off by changing the respective electrode thickness. Outcoupling at the MIM-TJ edges (pathway 3) is efficient and sensitive to the edge topography, whereas most light emission originates from roughness-induced scattering of the MIM-SPP mode (pathway 1). Using an arbitrary roughness profile, it is demonstrated that various roughness facets can raise MIM-SPP outcoupling efficiencies to 0.62%. These results pave the way for understanding the topographical parameters needed to develop CMOS-compatible plasmonic circuitry elements.},

  abstract     = {Therapeutic systems to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) have received tremendous success in the research of tumor theranostics, but suffered daunting challenges in limited efficacy originating from low presence of reactants and reaction kinetics within cancer cells. Here, ferrous sulfide-embedded bovine serum albumin (FeS@BSA) nanoclusters, in an amorphous nature, are designed and synthesized via a self-assembly approach. In acidic conditions, the nanoclusters degrade and simultaneously release H 2 S gas and Fe 2+ ions. The in vitro study using Huh7 cancer cells reveals that Fe 2+ released from FeS@BSA nanoclusters induces the toxic hydroxyl radical (·OH) effectively via the Fenton reaction. More interestingly, H 2 S gas released intracellularly presents the specific suppression effect to catalase activity of cancer cells, resulting in the promoted presence of H 2 O 2 that facilitates the Fenton reaction of Fe 2+ and consequently promotes ROS induction within the cells remarkably. After intravenous administration, the nanoclusters accumulate in the tumors of mice via the enhanced permeability and retention effect and present strong magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals. The findings confirm this therapeutic system can enable superior anti-tumor performance with MRI guidance and negligible side effects. This study, therefore, offers an alternative gas-amplified ROS-based therapeutic platform for synergetic tumor treatment.},

Spiropyran (SP) mechanophores that change color and fluorescence under mechanical stimuli are functionalized at the interface between SiO 2 nanoparticles and polymers. Successful mechanical activation of SP at the interface is confirmed in both solution and solid states. Compared with SP-linked in bulk polymers, interfacial activation induces greater conversion of SP to its colored merocyanine form and also significantly decreases the activation threshold under tension. Experimental observations are supported by finite element simulation of the interfacial stress state. The interfacial force-focusing strategy opens a new way to control the reactivity of mechanophores and also potentially indicates interfacial damage in composite materials.},

However, it could lead to a more complicated situation in manipulating the bulk morphology. Achieving an ideal morphology that enhances the charge transport and light absorption simultaneously is an essential avenue to promote the device performance. Herein, two polymers with different lengths of side groups (P1 is based on phenyl side group and P2 is based on biphenyl side group) are adopted in the dual-acceptor ternary systems to evaluate the relationship between conjugated side group and crystalline behavior in the ternary system. The P1 ternary system delivers a greatly improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.06%, which could be attributed to the intense and broad photoresponse and improved charge transport originating from the improved crystallinity. Inversely, the P2 ternary device only exhibits a poor PCE of 8.97%, where the decreased device performance could mainly be ascribed to the disturbed molecular stacking of the components originating from the overlong conjugated side group. The results demonstrate a conjugated side group could greatly determine the device performance by tuning the crystallinity of components in ternary systems.},

  abstract     = {Molecular doping is often used in organic semiconductors to tune their (opto)electronic properties. Despite its versatility, however, its application in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) remains limited and restricted to p-type dopants. In an effort to control the charge transport within the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) of OPVs, the n-type dopant benzyl viologen (BV) is incorporated in a BHJ composed of the donor polymer PM6 and the small-molecule acceptor IT-4F. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells is found to increase from 13.2% to 14.4% upon addition of 0.004 wt% BV. Analysis of the photoactive materials and devices reveals that BV acts simultaneously as n-type dopant and microstructure modifier for the BHJ. Under optimal BV concentrations, these synergistic effects result in balanced hole and electron mobilities, higher absorption coefficients and increased charge-carrier density within the BHJ, while significantly extending the cells&#39; shelf-lifetime. The n-type doping strategy is applied to five additional BHJ systems, for which similarly remarkable performance improvements are obtained. OPVs of particular interest are based on the ternary PM6:Y6:PC 71 BM:BV(0.004 wt%) blend for which a maximum PCE of 17.1%, is obtained. The effectiveness of the n-doping strategy highlights electron transport in NFA-based OPVs as being a key issue.},

Here, a bioengineering approach is presented that strongly improves low-dose BMP-2-based bone regeneration by mobilizing healing-associated mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). Smart synthetic hydrogels are used to trap and study endogenous MPCs trafficking to bone defects. Hydrogel-trapped and prospectively isolated MPCs differentiate into multiple lineages in vitro and form bone in vivo. In vitro screenings reveal that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) strongly recruits prospective MPCs making it a promising candidate for the engineering of hydrogels that enrich endogenous MPCs in vivo. However, PDGF-BB inhibits BMP-2-mediated osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, smart two-way dynamic release hydrogels with fast-release of PDGF-BB and sustained delivery of BMP-2 beneficially promote the healing of bone defects. Collectively, it is shown that modulating the dynamics of endogenous progenitor cells in vivo by smart synthetic hydrogels significantly improves bone healing and holds great potential for other advanced applications in regenerative medicine.},

Here, a room temperature, solid-state sensor is presented consisting of nanostructured porous (78%) CuBr films. These are prepared by flame-aerosol deposition of CuO onto sensor substrates followed by dry reduction and bromination. Each step is monitored in situ through the film resistance affording excellent process control. Such porous CuBr films feature an order of magnitude higher NH 3 sensitivity and five times faster response times than conventional denser CuBr films. That way, rapid (within 2.2 min) sensing of even the lowest (e.g., 5 ppb) NH 3 concentrations at 90% relative humidity is attained with outstanding selectivity (30–260) over typical confounders including ethanol, acetone, H 2 , CH 4 , isoprene, acetic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, and CO, superior to state-of-the-art sensors. This sensor is ideal for hand-held and battery-driven devices or integration into wearable electronics as it does not require heating. From a broader perspective, the process opens exciting new avenues to also explore other bromides and classes of semiconductors (e.g., sulfides, nitrides, carbides) currently not accessible by flame-aerosol technology.},

Analyzing rare trophoblastic cells from Papanicolaou smears carrying the entire fetal genome provides an alternative method for noninvasive detection of monogenic diseases. However, intracellular labeling for identification of target cells can affect the quality of DNA in varying degrees. Here, a new approach is developed for nondestructive identification of rare fetal cells from abundant maternal cells based on endoplasmic reticulum staining and linear discriminant analysis (ER-LDA). Compared with traditional methods, ER-LDA has little effect on cell quality, allowing trophoblastic cells to be analyzed on the single-cell level. Using ER-LDA, high-purity of trophoblastic cells can be identified and isolated at single cell resolution from 60 pregnancies between 4 and 38 weeks of gestation. Pathogenic variants, including – SEA / deletion mutation and point mutations, in 11 fetuses at risk for α- or β-thalassemia can be accurately detected by this test. The detection platform can also be extended to analyze the mutational profiles of other monogenic diseases. This simple, low-cost, and noninvasive test can provide valuable fetal cells for fetal genotyping and holds promise for prenatal detection of monogenic diseases.},

Herein, the challenge of simultaneous low-thermal-budget heteroatom doping of GO and its reduction in ambient air is addressed through the synthesis of B-doped reduced GO (B@rGO) by flash irradiation of boric acid loaded onto a GO support with intense pulsed light (IPL). The effects of light power and number of shots on the in-depth sequential doping and reduction mechanisms are investigated by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and direct millisecond-scale temperature measurements (temperature &gt;1600 °C, &lt; 10-millisecond duration, ramping rate of 5.3 × 10 5 °C s −1 ). Single-flash IPL allows the large-scale synthesis of substantially doped B@rGO (≈3.60 at% B) to be realized with a thermal budget 10 6 -fold lower than that of conventional thermal methods, and the prepared material with abundant B active sites is employed for highly sensitive and selective room-temperature NO 2 sensing. Thus, this work showcases the great potential of optical annealing for millisecond-scale ultrafast reduction and heteroatom doping of GO in ambient air, which allows the tuning of multiple physicochemical GO properties.},

  abstract     = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy with high recurrence rates and low survival rates, remaining a disease of high unmet need. Cancer immunotherapy, which harnesses the potential of the immune system to attack tumors, has emerged as one of the most promising treatment options in recent years. As an important form of immunotherapy, dendritic cell (DC)–based vaccines have demonstrated the ability to induce an immune response, while clinical efficacy of DC vaccines remains unsubstantiated as long-term benefit is only reported in a restricted proportion of patients. Here, a biomimetic nanovaccine derived from DCs is developed through cell membrane coating nanotechnology. This nanovaccine, denoted “mini DC,” inherits the ability of antigen presentation and T cells&#39; stimulation from DCs and is shown to elicit enhanced activation of T cells both in vitro and in vivo. In a mouse model of ovarian cancer, mini DCs exhibit superior therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against cancer including delayed tumor growth and reduced tumor metastasis compared with DC vaccine. These findings suggest that mini DCs may serve as a facile and potent vaccine to boost anticancer immunotherapy.},

Manipulating the charge recombination pathway in semiconductors is highly desirable for improving the device performance. This study reports high-performance layered perovskites LEDs with benzyl ring as spacer where radiative recombination lifetime is longer, compared with much shorter alkyl chain spacer yields. Based on detailed optical and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, direct signature of charges localization is observed near the band edge in exchange with the shallow traps in benzyl organics containing layered perovskites. As a result, it boosts the photoluminescence intensity by 7.4 times compared to that made with the alkyl organics. As a demonstration, a bright LED made with the benzyl organics with current efficiency of 23.46 ± 1.52 cd A −1 is shown when the device emits at a high brightness of 6.6 ± 0.93 × 104 cd m −2 . The average EQE is 9.2% ± 1.43%, two orders of magnitude higher than the device made with alkyl organics. The study suggests that the choices of organic spacers provide a path toward the manipulation of charge recombination, essential for efficient optoelectronic device fabrications.},

Hitherto, numerous attempts are made to imitate the natural photosynthesis of plants by converting solar energy into chemical fuels which resembles the “Z-scheme” process. A recreation of this system is witnessed in artificial Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting to generate hydrogen (H 2 ). This work outlines the recent significant implication of the Z-scheme system in photocatalytic water splitting, particularly in the role of electron mediator and the key factors that improve the photocatalytic performance. The Review begins with the fundamental rationales in Z-scheme water splitting, followed by a survey on the development roadmap of three different generations of Z-scheme system: 1) PS-A/D-PS (first generation), 2) PS-C-PS (second generation), and 3) PS-PS (third generation). Focus is also placed on the scaling up of the “leaf-to-tree” challenge of Z-scheme water splitting system, which is also known as Z-scheme photocatalyst sheet. A detailed investigation of the Z-scheme system for achieving H 2 evolution from past to present accompanied with in-depth discussion on the key challenges in the area of Z-scheme photocatalytic water splitting are provided.},

The clinical translation of polydatin, a promising natural anti-fibrotic drug candidate with broad anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities, remains a major challenge due to its limited water solubility and tissue absorption. Herein, a polydatin-loaded micelle (PD-MC) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pH dual-sensitive block polymer PEG-P(PBEM- co -DPA) is developed. The micelle exerts great potential in improving the biocompatibility of polydatin and shows highly efficient liver-targeted drug release in response to the fibrotic microenvironment. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that PD-MC can significantly suppress inflammatory response and oxidative stress, reduce hepatocyte apoptosis, and avert activation of macrophages and hepatic stellate cells. More excitingly, the blank micelle itself promotes the hepatic ROS consumption at the pathologic site to provide anti-inflammatory benefits. These favorable therapeutic virtues of targeting multiple cell types endow PD-MC with remarkable efficacy with minimal side effects in liver fibrosis treatment. Thus, PD-MC holds great potential to push forward the clinical application of polydatin in pharmacotherapeutic approaches against liver fibrosis.},

However, this remains challenging because of the non-polarity and low reactivity of ethylene.

The SnO 2 sensor coated with the nanoscale catalytic Cr 2 O 3 overlayer exhibits rapid sensing kinetics, good stability, and an unprecedentedly high ethylene selectivity with exceptional gas response ( R a / R g − 1, where R a represents the resistance in air and R g represents the resistance in gas) of 16.8 at an ethylene concentration of 2.5 ppm at 350 °C. The sensing mechanism underlying the ultraselective and highly sensitive ethylene detection in the unique bilayer sensor is systematically investigated with regard to the location, configuration, and thickness of the catalytic Cr 2 O 3 overlayer. The mechanism involves the effective catalytic oxidation of interfering gases into less- or non-reactive species, without limiting the analyte gas transport. The sensor exhibits a promising potential for achieving a precise quantitative assessment of the ripening of five different fruits.},

Herein, the metabolic patterns of ACLF patients are analyzed. An in vitro model of ACLF is established using Chang liver cells under hyperammonemia and hypoxia. A randomized clinical trial (ChiCTR-OPC-15006839) is performed with patients receiving L -ornithine and L -aspartate (LOLA) daily intravenously (LOLA group) and trimetazidine (TMZ) tid orally (TMZ group) based on conventional treatment (control group). The primary end point is 90-day overall survival, and overall survival is the secondary end point. By analyzing metabolic profiles in liver tissue samples from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related ACLF patients and the controls, the metabolic characteristics of HBV-related ACLF patients are identified: inhibited glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and urea cycle, and enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glutamine anaplerosis. These effects are mainly attributed to hyperammonemia and hypoxia. Further in vitro study reveals that switching from FAO to glycolysis could improve hepatocyte survival in the hyperammonemic and hypoxic microenvironment. Importantly, this randomized clinical trial confirms that inhibiting FAO using TMZ improves the prognosis of patients with HBV-related ACLF. In conclusion, this study provides a practical strategy for targeting metabolic reprogramming using TMZ to improve the survival of patients with HBV-related ACLF.},

Here, the viability of methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr 3 ) single crystals as solution-processed Faraday rotators is demonstrated. Compared to terbium gallium garnet, the industry standard in the visible, it is found that MAPbBr 3 exhibits Verdet constants (i.e., strength of Faraday effect) of similar or greater magnitude (up to 2.5x higher), with lower temperature dependence. Due to its low trap absorption, it is calculated that an optical isolator made from MAPbBr 3 , with appropriate antireflection coatings, should reach ≈95% transmission and achieve 40 dB isolation for incoming powers of over 2 W. It is also shown that the Verdet constant of MAPbBr 3 can be calculated accurately from its dispersion in refractive index, allowing the possibility to predict similar effects in other perovskite materials.},

Super-enhancers (SEs) have been found to contribute to the continuous and robust oncogenic transcription. Here, histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) is profiled in PDAC cell lines to establish SE landscapes. Concurrently, it is also shown that PDAC is vulnerable to the perturbation of the SE complex using bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor, JQ1, synergized with cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) inhibitor, THZ1. Formulations of hydrophobic l-phenylalanine-poly (ester amide) nanoparticles (NPs) with high drug loading of JQ1 and THZ1 (J/T@8P4s) are further designed and developed. J/T@8P4s is assessed for size, encapsulation efficiency, morphology, drug release profiles, and drug uptake in vitro. Compared to conventional free drug formulation, the nanodelivery system dramatically reduces the hepatotoxicity while significantly enhancing the tumor inhibition effects and the bioavailability of incorporated JQ1 and THZ1 at equal doses in a Gemcitabine-resistant PDAC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the J/T@8P4s can be a promising therapeutic treatment against the PDAC via suppression of SE-associated oncogenic transcription, and provides a strategy utilizing NPs to assist the drug delivery targeting SEs.},

Here, a universal green synthesis method for the in situ growth of MOF nanocrystals within wood substrates is introduced. Nucleation sites for different types of MOFs are readily created by a sodium hydroxide treatment, which is demonstrated to be broadly applicable to different wood species. The resulting MOF/wood composite exhibits hierarchical porosity with 130 times larger specific surface area compared to native wood. Assessment of the CO 2 adsorption capacity demonstrates the efficient utilization of the MOF loading along with similar adsorption ability to that of pure MOF. Compression and tensile tests reveal superior mechanical properties, which surpass those obtained for polymer substrates. The functionalization strategy offers a stable, sustainable, and scalable platform for the fabrication of multifunctional MOF/wood-derived composites with potential applications in environmental- and energy-related fields.},

  abstract     = {The distribution and abundance of immune cells, particularly T-cell subsets, play pivotal roles in cancer immunology and therapy. T cells have many subsets with specific function and current methods are limited in estimating them, thus, a method for predicting comprehensive T-cell subsets is urgently needed in cancer immunology research. Here, Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI), a gene set signature-based method, is introduced for precisely estimating the abundance of 24 immune cell types including 18 T-cell subsets, from gene expression data. Performance evaluation on both the sequencing data with flow cytometry results and public expression data indicate that ImmuCellAI can estimate the abundance of immune cells with superior accuracy to other methods especially on many T-cell subsets. Application of ImmuCellAI to immunotherapy datasets reveals that the abundance of dendritic cells, cytotoxic T, and gamma delta T cells is significantly higher both in comparisons of on-treatment versus pre-treatment and responders versus non-responders. Meanwhile, an ImmuCellAI result-based model is built for predicting the immunotherapy response with high accuracy (area under curve 0.80–0.91). These results demonstrate the powerful and unique function of ImmuCellAI in tumor immune infiltration estimation and immunotherapy response prediction.},

Recently, gut microbiome alterations are implicated in these two mood disorders; however, little is known about the shared and distinct microbial characteristics in MDD versus BD. Here, using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, the microbial compositions of 165 subjects with MDD are compared with 217 BD, and 217 healthy controls (HCs). It is found that the microbial compositions are different between the three groups. Compared to HCs, MDD is characterized by altered covarying operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to the Bacteroidaceae family, and BD shows disturbed covarying OTUs belonging to Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae families. Furthermore, a signature of 26 OTUs is identified that can distinguish patients with MDD from those with BD or HCs, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.961 to 0.986 in discovery sets, and 0.702 to 0.741 in validation sets. Moreover, 4 of 26 microbial markers correlate with disease severity in MDD or BD. Together, distinct gut microbial compositions are identified in MDD compared to BD and HCs, and a novel marker panel is provided for distinguishing MDD from BD based on gut microbiome signatures.},

Herein, a structurally stable, macrovoid-containing, nickel-rich material is developed using an affordable, scalable, and one-pot coprecipitation method without using surfactants/etching agents/complex-ion forming agents. The strategically developed macrovoid-induced cathode via a self-organization process exhibits excellent full-cell rate capability, cycle life at discharge rate of 5 C, and structural stability even at the industrial electrode conditions, owing to the fast Li-ion diffusion, the internal macrovoid acting as “buffer zones” for stress relief, and highly stable nanostructure around the void during cycling. This strategy for nickel-rich cathodes can be viable for industries in the preparation of high-performance lithium-ion cells.},

Here, based on facile liquid-exfoliated FePS 3 nanosheets, a highly efficient NIR-II PTA with its photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 43.3% is demonstrated, which is among the highest reported levels in typical PTAs. More importantly, such Fe-based 2D nanosheets also show superior Fenton catalytic activity facilitated by their ultrahigh specific surface area, simultaneously enabling cancer chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Impressively, the efficiency of CDT could be further remarkably enhanced by its photothermal effect, leading to cancer synergistic PTT/CDT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies reveal a highly efficient tumor ablation under NIR-II light irradiation. This work provides a paradigm for cancer CDT and PTT in the NIR-II biowindow via a single 2D nanoplatform with desired therapeutic effect. Furthermore, with additional possibilities for magnetic resonance imaging, photoacoustic tomography, as well as drug loading, this Fe-based 2D material could potentially serve as a 2D “all-in-one” theranostic nanoplatform.},

  abstract     = {Here, transient supramolecular hydrogels that are formed through simple aging-induced seeded self-assembly of molecular gelators are reported. In the involved molecular self-assembly system, multicomponent gelators are formed from a mixture of precursor molecules and, typically, can spontaneously self-assemble into thermodynamically more stable hydrogels through a multilevel self-sorting process. In the present work, it is surprisingly found that one of the precursor molecules is capable of self-assembling into nano-sized aggregates upon a gentle aging treatment. Importantly, these tiny aggregates can serve as seeds to force the self-assembly of gelators along a kinetically controlled pathway, leading to transient hydrogels that eventually spontaneously convert into thermodynamically more stable hydrogels over time. Such an aging-induced seeded self-assembly process is not only a new route toward synthetic out-of-equilibrium supramolecular systems, but also suggests the necessity of reporting the age of self-assembling building block solutions in other self-assembly systems.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental physiologic and pathologic phenomena such as wound healing and cancer metastasis are typically associated with the migration of cells through adjacent extracellular matrix. In recent years, advances in biomimetic materials have supported the progress in 3D cell culture and provided biomedical tools for the development of models to study spheroid invasiveness. Despite this, the exceptional biochemical and biomechanical properties of human-derived materials are poorly explored. Human methacryloyl platelet lysates (PLMA)-based hydrogels are herein proposed as reliable 3D platforms to sustain in vivo-like cell invasion mechanisms. A systematic analysis of spheroid viability, size, and invasiveness is performed in three biomimetic materials: PLMA hydrogels at three different concentrations, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, and Matrigel. Results demonstrate that PLMA hydrogels perfectly support the recapitulation of the tumor invasion behavior of cancer cell lines (MG-63, SaOS-2, and A549) and human bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cell spheroids. The distinct invasiveness ability of each cell type is reflected in the PLMA hydrogels and, furthermore, different mechanical properties produce an altered invasive behavior. The herein presented human PLMA-based hydrogels could represent an opportunity to develop accurate cell invasiveness models and open up new possibilities for humanized and personalized high-throughput screening and validation of anticancer drugs.},

Herein, through-space charge transfer (TSCT) and through-bond charge transfer (TBCT) effects are skillfully incorporated, as well as the multi-(donor/acceptor) characteristic, into one molecule. The former allows this material to show small singlet–triplet energy splitting (Δ E ST ) and a high transition dipole moment. The latter, on the one hand, further lights up multichannel reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) to increase triplet exciton utilization via degenerating molecular orbitals. On the other hand, the nature of the molecular twisted structure effectively suppresses intermolecular packing to obtain high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in neat flims. Consequently, using this design strategy, T-CNDF-T- t Cz containing three donor and three acceptor units, successfully realizes a small Δ E ST (≈0.03 eV) and a high PLQY (≈0.76) at the same time; hence the nondoped solution-processed sky-blue TADF-OLED displays record-breaking efficiency among the solution process-based nondoped sky-blue OLEDs, with high brightness over 5200 cd m −2 and external quantum efficiency up to 21.0%.},

However, despite their frequency, there are no reliable methods for the early diagnosis of these complications. Since cfDNA is mainly derived from placental trophoblasts and maternal hematopoietic cells, it might have information for gene expression which can be used for disease prediction. Here, low coverage whole-genome sequencing on plasma DNA from 2,199 pregnancies is performed based on retrospective cohorts of 3,200 pregnant women. Read depth in the promoter regions is examined to define read-depth distribution patterns of promoters for pregnancy complications and controls. Using machine learning methods, classifiers for predicting pregnancy complications are developed. Using these classifiers, complications are successfully predicted with an accuracy of 80.3%, 78.9%, 72.1%, and 83.0% for MA, FGR, GDM, and PE, respectively. The findings suggest that promoter profiling of cfDNA may be used as a biological biomarker for predicting pregnancy complications at early gestational age.},

  abstract     = {Using direct conversion technology, normal adult somatic cells can be routinely switched from their original cell type into specific differentiated cell types by inducing the expression of differentiation-related transcription factors. In this study, normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) are directly converted into cardiomyocyte-like cells by drug and gene delivery using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) nanoparticles (CiCMC-NPs). CMC-based multifunctional nanogels containing specific cardiomyocyte-related genes are designed and fabricated, including GATA4 , MEF2C , and TBX5 (GMT). However, GMT alone is insufficient, at least in vitro, in human fibroblasts. Hence, to inhibit proliferation and to induce differentiation, 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) is conjugated to the hydroxyl group of CMC in CiCMC-NPs containing GMT; in addition, the CMC is coated with polyethylenimine. It is confirmed that the CiCMC-NPs have nanogel properties, and that they exhibit the characteristic effects of 5-AZA and GMT. When CiCMC-NPs-containing 5-AZA and GMT are introduced into NHDFs, cardiomyocyte differentiation is initiated. In the reprogrammed cells, the mature cardiac-specific markers cardiac troponin I and α-actinin are expressed at twofold to threefold higher levels than in NHDFs. Engineered cells transplanted into live hearts exhibit active pumping ability within 1 day. Histology and immunohistology of heart tissue confirm the presence of transplanted engineered NHDF cells at injection sites.},

  abstract     = {The breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) is a major tumor suppressor gene and is most frequently mutated in hereditary breast cancer. BRCA1 plays a critical role in many biological processes, especially maintaining genomic stability in the nucleus, yet its role in the cytoplasm remains elusive. Here, it is revealed that BRCA1 maintains a healthy mitochondrial network through regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including fission and fusion. BRCA1 deficiency causes dysfunctional mitochondrial dynamics through increased expression of mitofusin1/2. With mitochondrial stress, BRCA1 is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy mitochondrial network. Consequently, BRCA1 deficiency impairs stress-induced mitophagy through blocking ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission and triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which creates a tumor-associated microenvironment, thereby facilitating tumor proliferation and metastasis. It is further shown that inflammasome inhibition can prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. This study uncovers an important role of BRCA1 in regulating mitophagy and suggests a therapeutic approach for fighting this deadly disease.},

The branched polymeric PTX-Gd-based nanoparticles (BP-PTX-Gd NPs) demonstrate excellent biocompatibility, and high stability under physiological conditions, but they stimuli-responsively degrade and release PTX rapidly in a tumor microenvironment. The in vitro behavior of NPs labeled with fluorescent dyes is effectively monitored, and the NPs display high cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells similar to free PTX by impairing the function of microtubules, downregulating anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and upregulating the expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved-PARP, and p53 proteins. Great improvement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is demonstrated by these NPs, and MRI accurately maps the temporal change profile of the tumor volume after injection of NPs and the tumor treatment process is also closely correlated with the T 1 values measured from MRI, demonstrating the capability of providing real-time feedback to the chemotherapeutic treatment effectiveness. The imaging-guided chemotherapy to the 4T1 tumor in the mice model achieves an excellent anti-tumor effect. This stimuli-responsive polymeric nano-agent opens a new door for efficient breast cancer treatment under the guidance of fluorescence/MRI.},

However, owing to the two major drawbacks of hydrogels—air-drying and water-swelling—hydrogels developed thus far have yet to achieve most of their potential applications. Herein, a bioinspired, facile, and versatile method for fabricating hydrogels with high stability in both air and water is reported. This method includes the creation of a bioinspired homogeneous fusion layer of a hydrophobic polymer and oil in the outermost surface layer of the hydrogel via a double-hydrophobic-coating produced through quenching. As a proof-of-concept, this method is applied to a polyacrylamide hydrogel without compromising its mechanical properties. The coated hydrogel exhibits strong resistance to both drying in air and swelling in multiple aqueous environments. Furthermore, the versatility of this method is demonstrated using different types of hydrogels and oils. Because this method is easy to apply and is not dependent on hydrogel surface chemistry, it can significantly broaden the scope of next-generation hydrogels for real-world applications in both wet and dry environments.},

  abstract     = {Confronted with the rapid evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatment strategies for drug-resistant pathogens. Here, an unconventional approach is presented to restore the susceptibility of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to a broad spectrum of conventional antibiotics via photo-disassembly of functional membrane microdomains. The photo-disassembly of microdomains is based on effective photolysis of staphyloxanthin, the golden carotenoid pigment that gives its name. Upon pulsed laser treatment, cell membranes are found severely disorganized and malfunctioned to defense antibiotics, as unveiled by membrane permeabilization, membrane fluidification, and detachment of membrane protein, PBP2a. Consequently, the photolysis approach increases susceptibility and inhibits development of resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics including penicillins, quinolones, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, lipopeptides, and oxazolidinones. The synergistic therapy, without phototoxicity to the host, is effective in combating MRSA both in vitro and in vivo in a mice skin infection model. Collectively, this endogenous chromophore-targeted phototherapy concept paves a novel platform to revive conventional antibiotics to combat drug-resistant S. aureus infections as well as to screen new lead compounds.},

However, the sensing range limit and fabrication difficulties of current acoustic sensing technologies pose challenges in realizing compact subwavelength direction sensors. Here, a subwavelength directional sensor is demonstrated, which can detect the angle of an incident wave in a full angle range (0°∼360°). The directional sensing is realized with acoustic coupling of Helmholtz resonators each supporting a monopolar resonance, which are monitored by conventional microphones. When these resonators scatter sound into free-space acoustic modes, the scattered waves from each resonator interfere, resulting in a Fano-like resonance where the spectral responses of the constituent resonators are drastically different from each other. This work provides a critical understanding of resonant coupling as well as a viable solution for directional sensing.},

Inspired by nature, researchers have designed hybrid materials that possess properties beyond each of the components. Particularly, it remains a great challenge to realize site-specific anisotropy, which widely exists in natural materials and is responsible for unique mechanical properties as well as physiological behaviors. Herein, the spontaneous formation of aligned graphene oxide (GO) flakes in sodium alginate (SA) matrix with locally controlled orientation via a direct-ink-writing printing process is reported. The GO flakes are spontaneously aligned in the SA matrix by shear force when being extruded and then arranged horizontally after drying on the substrate, forming a brick-and-mortar structure that could anisotropically contract or expand upon activation by heat, light, or water. By designing the printing pathways directed by finite element analysis, the orientation of GO flakes in the composite is locally controlled, which could further guide the composite to transform into versatile architectures. Particularly, the transformation is reversible when water vapor is applied as one of the stimuli. As a proof of concept, complex morphing architectures are experimentally demonstrated, which are in good consistency with the simulation results.},

However, the mechanism of amyloid protein aggregation is still not well understood due to many challenges when studying the endogenous amyloid structures in neurons or in brain tissue. Available methods either require chemical processing of the sample or may affect the amyloid protein structure itself. Therefore, new approaches, which allow studying molecular structures directly in neurons, are urgently needed. A novel approach is tested, based on label-free optical photothermal infrared super-resolution microspectroscopy, to study AD-related amyloid protein aggregation directly in the neuron at sub-micrometer resolution. Using this approach, amyloid protein aggregates are detected at the subcellular level, along the neurites and strikingly, in dendritic spines, which has not been possible until now. Here, a polymorphic nature of amyloid structures that exist in AD transgenic neurons is reported. Based on the findings of this work, it is suggested that structural polymorphism of amyloid proteins that occur already in neurons may trigger different mechanisms of AD progression.},

Here, a strategy is reported to realize high-performance sodium-ion energy storage using battery-type anode and capacitor-type cathode materials. First, nitrogen-doped mesoporous titanium dioxide (NMTiO 2 ) structures are synthesized via the controlled pyrolysis of metal–organic frameworks. They exhibit interconnected open mesopores allowing fast ion transport and robust cycle stability with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, along with rich redox-reactive sites allowing high capacity even at a high rate of ≈90 C. Moreover, assembling the NMTiO 2 anode with the nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) cathode in an asymmetric full cell shows a high energy density exceeding its counterpart symmetric cell by more than threefold as well as robust cycle stability over 10 000 cycles. Additionally, it gives a high-power density close to 26 000 W kg −1 outperforming that of a conventional sodium-ion battery by several hundred fold, so that full cells can be charged within a few tens of seconds by the flexible photovoltaic charging and universal serial bus charging modules.},

  abstract     = {Lead-free halide double perovskites (HDPs) are promising candidates for high-performance solar cells because of their environmentally-friendly property and chemical stability in air. The power conversion efficiency of HDPs-based solar cells needs to be further improved before their commercialization in the market. It requires a thoughtful understanding of the correlation between their specific structure and property. Here, the structural and optical properties of an important HDP-based (NH 4 ) 2 SeBr 6 are investigated under high pressure. A dramatic piezochromism is found with the increase in pressure. Optical absorption spectra reveal the pressure-induced red-shift in bandgap with two distinct anomalies at 6.57 and 11.18 GPa, and the energy tunability reaches 360 meV within 20.02 GPa. Combined with structural characterizations, Raman and infrared spectra, and theoretical calculations using density functional theory, results reveal that, the first anomaly is caused by the formation of a Br-Br bond among the [SeBr 6 ] 2− octahedra, and the latter is attributed to a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition. These results provide a clear correlation between the chemical bonding and optical properties of (NH 4 ) 2 SeBr 6 . It is believed that the proposed strategy paves the way to optimize the optoelectronic properties of HDPs and further stimulate the development of next-generation clear energy based on HDPs solar cells.},

  abstract     = {It was recently recognized that cancer therapeutic efficacy may be greatly compromised by an intrinsic protective mechanism called autophagy, by which cancer cells survive in harsh conditions such as starvation. Here, a synergetic strategy is described for cancer treatment by suppressing such a protective mechanism for augmenting tumor-starvation therapy. The synergetic therapy is achieved by restraining glucose metabolism using an antiglycolytic agent to predispose cancer cells to severe energy deprivation; concurrently the downstream autophagic flux and compensatory energy supplies are blocked by the autophagy inhibitor black phosphorus nanosheet. Cancer cells fail to extract their own nutrient to feed themselves, finally succumbing to therapeutic interventions and starving to death. Both in vitro and in vivo results evidence the cooperative effect between the autophagy inhibitor and antiglycolytic agent, which leads to remarkable synergetic antineoplastic outcome. It is expected that such a combinational approach by concurrently blocking exogenous and endogenous nutrition supplies will be beneficial to the design of effective tumor-specific cancer therapies in the future.},

  abstract     = {MnO 2 is one of the most studied cathodes for aqueous neutral zinc-ion batteries. However, the diverse reported crystal structures of MnO 2 compared to δ-MnO 2 inevitably suffer a structural phase transition from tunneled to layered Zn-buserite during the initial cycles, which is not as kinetically direct as the conventional intercalation electrochemistry in layered materials and thus poses great challenges to the performance and multifunctionality of devices. Here, a binder-free δ-MnO 2 cathode is designed and a favorable “layered to layered” Zn 2+ storage mechanism is revealed systematically using such a “noninterferencing” electrode platform in combination with ab initio calculation. A flexible quasi-solid-state Zn–Mn battery with an electrodeposited flexible Zn anode is further assembled, exhibiting high energy density (35.11 mWh cm −3 ; 432.05 Wh kg −1 ), high power density (676.92 mW cm −3 ; 8.33 kW kg −1 ), extremely low self-discharge rate, and ultralong stability up to 10 000 cycles. Even with a relatively high δ-MnO 2 mass loading of 5 mg cm −2 , significant energy and power densities are still achieved. The device also works well over a broad temperature range (0–40 °C) and can efficiently power different types of small electronics. This work provides an opportunity to develop high-performance multivalent-ion batteries via the design of a kinetically favorable host structure.},

The shape gradient, together with hierarchical rough surface, allows these silk fiber microactuators to respond rapidly to humidity. The silk fiber microactuator can reach maximum rotation speed of 6179.3° s −1 in 4.8 s. Such a response speed (1030 rotations per minute) is comparable with the most advanced microactuators. Moreover, this microactuator generates 2.1 W kg −1 of average actuation power, which is twice higher than fiber actuators constructed by cocoon silks. The actuating powers of silk fiber microactuators can be precisely programmed by controlling the number of fibers used. Lastly, theory predicts the observed performance merits of silk fiber microactuators toward inspiring the rational design of water-induced microactuators.},

The recent discovery of higher-order photonic topological insulators opens an emergent horizon for 0D topological corner states. However, the previous realizations of higher-order topological insulators in electromagnetic-wave systems suffer from either a limited operational frequency range due to the lumped components involved or a bulky structure with a large footprint, which are unfavorable for achieving compact photonic devices. To overcome these limitations, a planar surface-wave photonic crystal realization of 2D higher-order topological insulators is hereby demonstrated experimentally. The surface-wave photonic crystals exhibit a very large bulk bandgap (a bandwidth of 28%) due to multiple Bragg scatterings and host 1D gapped edge states described by massive Dirac equations. The topology of those higher-dimensional photonic bands leads to the emergence of in-gap 0D corner states, which provide a route toward robust cavity modes for scalable compact photonic devices.},

Here, by combining the emerging development of bioelectronics, a smart flexible electronics-integrated wound dressing with a double-layer structure, the upper layer of which is polydimethylsiloxane-encapsulated flexible electronics integrated with a temperature sensor and ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diodes, and the lower layer of which is a UV-responsive antibacterial hydrogel, is designed. This dressing is expected to provide early infection diagnosis via real-time wound-temperature monitoring by the integrated sensor and on-demand infection treatment by the release of antibiotics from the hydrogel by in situ UV irradiation. The integrated system possesses good flexibility, excellent compatibility, and high monitoring sensitivity and durability. Animal experiment results demonstrate that the integrated system is capable of monitoring wound status in real time, detecting bacterial infection and providing effective treatment on the basis of need. This proof-of-concept research holds great promise in developing new strategies to significantly improve wound management and other pathological diagnoses and treatments.},

  abstract     = {Efficient electron transport layer–free perovskite solar cells (ETL-free PSCs) with cost-effective and simplified design can greatly promote the large area flexible application of PSCs. However, the absence of ETL usually leads to the mismatched indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite interface energy levels, which limits charge transfer and collection, and results in severe energy loss and poor device performance. To address this, a polar nonconjugated small-molecule modifier is introduced to lower the work function of ITO and optimize interface energy level alignment by virtue of an inherent dipole, as verified by photoemission spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy measurements. The resultant barrier-free ITO/perovskite contact favors efficient charge transfer and suppresses nonradiative recombination, endowing the device with enhanced open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, and fill factor, simultaneously. Accordingly, power conversion efficiency increases greatly from 12.81% to a record breaking 20.55%, comparable to state-of-the-art PSCs with a sophisticated ETL. Also, the stability is enhanced with decreased hysteresis effect due to interface defect passivation and inhibited interface charge accumulation. This work facilitates the further development of highly efficient, flexible, and recyclable ETL-free PSCs with simplified design and low cost by interface electronic structure engineering through facile electrode modification.},

Tuning the aerodynamic diameter by increasing the capsule shell thickness (from ≈100 to 200 nm in increments of ≈50 nm) through repeated film deposition on a sacrificial template allows precise control of capsule deposition in a human lung model, corresponding to a shift from the alveolar region to the bronchi as aerodynamic diameter increases.

  abstract     = {Developing cost-efficient large-scale uniform plasma jets represents a significant challenge for high performance in material processing and plasma medicine. Here, a V – I characteristic modulation approach is proposed to reduce the discharge power and increase the plasma scale and chemical activity in non-self-sustained atmospheric direct-current discharges. The electric field in discharge space is optimized to fundamentally empower simultaneously initiating all discharge cells far below Townsend breakdown potential and stably sustaining each plasma jet at low voltage. These strategies create a crucial step to fabricating a flexible and compact low-power large-scale uniform laminar plasma jet array (LPJA) with high activity in cheap argon. The mechanisms behind the discharge enhancement are revealed by combining V – I characteristic examination and a modulation model. Compared with conventional arrays, this LPJA possesses the widest size (90 mm) and raises its uniformity from 30% to 97%. Comparing different discharge modes shows that the LPJA scale is surprisingly increased nearly by 4 times with the discharge power reduced from 7.4 to 4.8 W. The methodology provides a highly cost-efficient roadmap to break through the bottleneck of restricting low-power discharge, large-gap discharge, large-scale discharge, parallel-multi-electrode discharge, and uniform discharge together. This advance will meet the urgent need for various plasma applications.},

  abstract     = {Emerging strategies involving nanomaterials with high-atomic-number elements have been widely developed for radiotherapy in recent years. However, the concern regarding their potential toxicity caused by long-term body retention still limits their further application. In this regard, rapidly clearable radiosensitizers are highly desired for practical cancer treatment. Thus, in this work, ultrasmall BiOI quantum dots (QDs) with efficient renal clearance characteristic and strong permeability inside solid tumor are designed to address this issue. Additionally, considering that injection methods have great influence on the biodistribution and radiotherapeutic efficacy of radiosensitizers, two common injection methods including intratumoral injection and intravenous injection are evaluated. The results exhibit that intratumoral injection can maximize the accumulation of radiosensitizers within a tumor compared to intravenous injection and further enhance radiotherapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the radiosensitizing effect of BiOI QDs is revealed, which is not only attributed to the radiation enhancement of high- Z elements but also is owed to the •OH production via catalyzing overexpressed H 2 O 2 within a tumor by BiOI QDs under X-ray irradiation. As a result, this work proposes a treatment paradigm to employ ultrasmall radiosensitizers integrated with local intratumoral injection to realize rapid clearance and high-efficiency radiosensitization for cancer therapy.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using metal electrodes have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic devices because of their high efficiency, low fabrication temperature, and low cost potential. However, the complicated and rigorous thermal deposition process of metal contact electrodes remains a challenging issue for reducing the energy pay-back period in commercial PSCs, as the ubiquitous one-time use of a contact electrode wastes limited resources and pollutes the environment. Here, a nanoporous Au film electrode fabricated by a simple dry transfer process is introduced to replace the thermally evaporated Au electrode in PSCs. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% is demonstrated in PSCs with the nanoporous Au film electrode. Moreover, the electrode is recycled more than 12 times to realize a further reduced fabrication cost of PSCs and noble metal materials consumption and to prevent environmental pollution. When the nanoporous Au electrode is applied to flexible PSCs, a PCE of 17.3% and superior bending durability of ≈98.5% after 1000 cycles of harsh bending tests are achieved. The nanoscale pores and the capability of the porous structure to impede crack generation and propagation enable the nanoporous Au electrode to be recycled and result in excellent bending durability.},

Among the known piezoelectric polymers, ferroelectric polymers represented by poly(vinylidene fluoride) and its copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride- co -trifluoroethylene) possess the best piezoelectric coefficients. However, the physical origin of negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficients occurring in the polymers remains elusive. To address this long-standing challenge, several theoretical models proposed over the past decades, which are controversial in nature, have been revisited and reviewed. It is concluded that negative longitudinal piezoelectric coefficients arise from the negative longitudinal electrostriction in the crystalline domain of the polymers, independent of amorphous and crystalline-amorphous interfacial regions. The crystalline origin of piezoelectricity offers unprecedented opportunities to improve electromechanical properties of polymers via structural engineering, i.e., design of morphotropic phase boundaries in ferroelectric polymers.},

Currently available culturing techniques utilize a 2D or 3D microenvironment for supporting the growth and proliferation of stem cells. However, these culture systems fail to fully reflect the supportive biological environment in which stem cells reside in vivo, which contain dynamic biophysical growth cues. Herein, a 4D programmable culture substrate with a self-morphing capability is presented as a means to enhance dynamic cell growth and induce differentiation of stem cells. To function as a model system, a 4D neural culture substrate is fabricated using a combination of printing and imprinting techniques keyed to the different biological features of neural stem cells (NSCs) at different differentiation stages. Results show the 4D culture substrate demonstrates a time-dependent self-morphing process that plays an essential role in regulating NSC behaviors in a spatiotemporal manner and enhances neural differentiation of NSCs along with significant axonal alignment. This study of a customized, dynamic substrate revolutionizes current stem cell therapies, and can further have a far-reaching impact on improving tissue regeneration and mimicking specific disease progression, as well as other impacts on materials and life science research.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are endogenous membrane-derived vesicles that shuttle bioactive molecules between glia and neurons, thereby promoting neuronal survival and plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS) and contributing to neurodegenerative conditions. Although EVs hold great potential as CNS theranostic nanocarriers, the specific molecular factors that regulate neuronal EV uptake and release are currently unknown. A combination of patch-clamp electrophysiology and pH-sensitive dye imaging is used to examine stimulus-evoked EV release in individual neurons in real time. Whereas spontaneous electrical activity and the application of a high-frequency stimulus induce a slow and prolonged fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane (PM) in a subset of cells, the neurotrophic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) greatly increases the rate of stimulus-evoked MVB-PM fusion events and, consequently, the abundance of EVs in the culture medium. Proteomic analysis of neuronal EVs demonstrates bFGF increases the abundance of the v-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3, cellubrevin) on EVs. Conversely, knocking-down VAMP3 in cultured neurons attenuates the effect of bFGF on EV release. The results determine the temporal characteristics of MVB-PM fusion in hippocampal neurons and reveal a new function for bFGF signaling in controlling neuronal EV release.},

  abstract     = {Controlling the growth behavior of organic semiconductors (OSCs) is essential because it determines their optoelectronic properties. In order to accomplish this, graphene templates with electronic-state tunability are used to affect the growth of OSCs by controlling the van der Waals interaction between OSC ad-molecules and graphene. However, in many graphene-molecule systems, the charge transfer between an ad-molecule and a graphene template causes another important interaction. This charge-transfer-induced interaction is never considered in the growth scheme of OSCs. Here, the effects of charge transfer on the formation of graphene–OSC heterostructures are investigated, using fullerene (C 60 ) as a model compound. By in situ electrical doping of a graphene template to suppress the charge transfer between C 60 ad-molecules and graphene, the layer-by-layer growth of a C 60 film on graphene can be achieved. Under this condition, the graphene–C 60 interface is free of Fermi-level pinning; thus, barristors fabricated on the graphene–C 60 interface show a nearly ideal Schottky–Mott limit with efficient modulation of the charge-injection barrier. Moreover, the optimized C 60 film exhibits a high field-effect electron mobility of 2.5 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . These results provide an efficient route to engineering highly efficient optoelectronic graphene–OSC hybrid material applications.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen (H 2 ) has a significant potential to enable the global energy transition from the current fossil-dominant system to a clean, sustainable, and low-carbon energy system. While presently global H 2 production is predominated by fossil-fuel feedstocks, for future widespread utilization it is of paramount importance to produce H 2 in a decarbonized manner. To this end, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been proposed to be a highly desirable approach with minimal negative impact on the environment. Both semiconductor light-absorbers and hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) catalysts are essential components of an efficient PEC cell. It is well documented that loading electrocatalysts on semiconductor photoelectrodes plays significant roles in accelerating the HER/OER kinetics, suppressing surface recombination, reducing overpotentials needed to accomplish HER/OER, and extending the operational lifetime of semiconductors. Herein, how electrocatalyst coupling influences the PEC performance of semiconductor photoelectrodes is outlined. The focus is then placed on the major strategies developed so far for semiconductor/electrocatalyst coupling, including a variety of dry processes and wet chemical approaches. This Review provides a comprehensive account of advanced methodologies adopted for semiconductor/electrocatalyst coupling and can serve as a guideline for the design of efficient and stable semiconductor photoelectrodes for use in water splitting.},

  abstract     = {Logic functions are the key backbone in electronic circuits for computing applications. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic gates, with both n-type and p-type channel transistors, have been to date the dominant building blocks of logic circuitry as they carry obvious advantages over other technologies. Important physical limits are however starting to arise, as the transistor-processing technology has begun to meet scaling-down difficulties. To address this issue, there is the crucial need for a next-generation electronics era based on new concepts and designs. In this respect, a single-type channel multigate MOS transistor (SMG-MOS) is introduced holding the two important aspects of processing adaptability and low static dissipation of CMOS. Furthermore, the SMG-MOS approach strongly reduces the footprint down to 40% or even less area needed for current CMOS logic function in the same processing technology node. Logic NAND, NOT, AND, NOR, and OR gates, which typically require a large number of CMOS transistors, can be realized by a single SMG-MOS transistor. Two functional examples of SMG-MOS are reported here with their analysis based both on simulations and experiments. The results strongly suggest that SMG-MOS can represent a facile approach to scale down complex integrated circuits, enabling design flexibility and production rates ramp-up.},

  abstract     = {Rapid energy-efficient movements are one of nature&#39;s greatest developments. Mechanisms like snap-buckling allow plants like the Venus flytrap to close the terminal lobes of their leaves at barely perceptible speed. Here, a soft balloon actuator is presented, which is inspired by such mechanical instabilities and creates safe, giant, and fast deformations. The basic design comprises two inflated elastomer membranes pneumatically coupled by a pressurized chamber of suitable volume. The high-speed actuation of a rubber balloon in a state close to the verge of mechanical instability is remotely triggered by a voltage-controlled dielectric elastomer membrane. This method spatially separates electrically active and passive parts, and thereby averts electrical breakdown resulting from the drastic thinning of an electroactive membrane during large expansion. Bistable operation with small and large volumes of the rubber balloon is demonstrated, achieving large volume changes of 1398% and a high-speed area change rate of 2600 cm 2 s −1 . The presented combination of fast response time with large deformation and safe handling are central aspects for a new generation of soft bio-inspired robots and can help pave the way for applications ranging from haptic displays to soft grippers and high-speed sorting machines.},

  abstract     = {Improving the quality of perovskite poly-crystalline film is essential for the performance of associated solar cells approaching their theoretical limit efficiency. Pinholes, unwanted defects, and nonperovskite phase can be easily generated during film formation, hampering device performance and stability. Here, a simple method is introduced to prepare perovskite film with excellent optoelectronic property by using acetic acid (Ac) as an antisolvent to control perovskite crystallization. Results from a variety of characterizations suggest that the small amount of Ac not only reduces the perovskite film roughness and residual PbI 2 but also generates a passivation effect from the electron-rich carbonyl group (CO) in Ac. The best devices produce a PCE of 22.0% for Cs 0.05 FA 0.80 MA 0.15 Pb(I 0.85 Br 0.15 ) 3 and 23.0% for Cs 0.05 FA 0.90 MA 0.05 Pb(I 0.95 Br 0.05 ) 3 on 0.159 cm 2 with negligible hysteresis. This further improves device stability producing a cell that maintained 96% of its initial efficiency after 2400 h storage in ambient environment (with controlled relative humidity (RH) &lt;30%) without any encapsulation.},

  abstract     = {Glioma initiating cells (GICs) function as the seed for the propagation and relapse of glioma. Designing a smart and efficient strategy to target the GICs and to suppress the multiple signaling pathways associated with stemness and chemoresistance is essential to achieving a cancer cure. Inspired by the metabolic difference in endocytosis between GICs, differentiated glioma cells, and normal cells, a tailored lipoprotein-like nanostructure is developed to amplify their internalization into GICs through receptor-stimulated macropinocytosis. As CXCR4 is highly expressed on GICs and glioma tumor sites, meanwhile, the activation of CXCR4 induces the receptor-stimulated macropinocytosis pathway in GICs, this CXCR4 receptor-stimulated lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (SLNP) achieves efficient accumulation in GICs in vitro and in vivo. By carrying microRNA-34a in the core, this tailored SLNP reduces sex-determining region Y-box 2 and Notch1 expression, powerfully inhibits GICs stemness and chemoresistance, and significantly prolongs the survival of GICs-bearing mice. Taken together, a tailored lipoprotein-based nanostructure realizes efficient GICs accumulation and therapeutic effect through receptor-stimulated macropinocytosis, providing a powerful nanoplatform for RNA interference drugs to combat glioma.},

  abstract     = {Diverse reproduction modes of bio-organisms open new intriguing opportunities for biochemistry-enabled materials. Herein, a new strategy is developed to explore biodirected structures for functional materials via controlling the reproduction mode. Yeast with sexual or asexual reproduction mode are employed in this work. They result in two different biodirected structures, from bowl-like hollow hemisphere to “bubble-in-sphere” (BIS) structure, for the VN x O y /C composites. Benefitting from the hierarchical structure, nanoscale particles and conductive biomass–derived carbon base, both VN x O y /C biocomposites achieve high power/energy density, good reliability, and excellent long-term cycling stability in aqueous Zn-ion batteries. Deep investigations further reveal that different biodirected structures greatly influence the electrochemical properties of biocomposites. The bowl-like structures with thin shells and folded double layers achieve larger surface area and more active sites, which ensure their faster kinetics and better high rate capability. The BIS structures with a more compact assembly and higher stack capability are favorable to the better energy storage. Therefore, this work not only introduces a new clue to boost biodirected structures for functional materials, but also propels the development of Zn-ion batteries in diverse applications.},

  abstract     = {Water electrolysis is an emerging energy conversion technology, which is significant for efficient hydrogen (H 2 ) production. Based on the high-activity transition metal ions and metal alloys of ultrastable bifunctional catalyst, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the key to achieving the energy conversion method by overall water splitting (OWS). This study reports that the Co-based coordination polymer (ZIF-67) anchoring on an indium–organic framework (InOF-1) composite (InOF-1@ZIF-67) is treated followed by carbonization and phosphorization to successfully obtain CoP nanoparticles–embedded carbon nanotubes and nitrogen-doped carbon materials (CoP-InNC@CNT). As HER and OER electrocatalysts, it is demonstrated that CoP-InNC@CNT simultaneously exhibit high HER performance (overpotential of 153 mV in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 and 159 mV in 1.0 m KOH) and OER performance (overpotential of 270 mV in 1.0 m KOH) activities to reach the current density of 10 mA cm −2 . In addition, these CoP-InNC@CNT rods, as a cathode and an anode, can display an excellent OWS performance with η 10 = 1.58 V and better stability, which shows the satisfying electrocatalyst for the OWS compared to control materials. This method ensures the tight and uniform growth of the fast nucleating and stable materials on substrate and can be further applied for practical electrochemical reactions.},

Herein, the NaCl template synthesis of individual nickel (Ni) SACs is reported, bonded to oxygen sites on graphene-like carbon (denoted as Ni-O-G SACs) with superior activity and stability for OER. A variety of characterizations unveil that the Ni-O-G SACs present 3D porous framework constructed by ultrathin graphene sheets, single Ni atoms, coordinating nickel atoms to oxygen. Consequently, the catalysts are active and robust for OER with extremely low overpotential of 224 mV at current density of 10 mA cm −2 , 42 mV dec −1 Tafel slope, oxygen production turn over frequency of 1.44 S −1 at 300 mV, and long-term durability without significant degradation for 50 h at exceptionally high current of 115 mA cm −1 , outperforming the state-of-the-art OER SACs. A theoretical simulation further reveals that the bonding between single nickel and oxygen sites results in the extraordinary boosting of OER performance of Ni-O-G SACs.

However, there are many challenges to overcome before the practical application of SCEs, including the low ionic conductivity less than 10 −3 S cm −1 at ambient temperature, poor interfacial stability, and high interfacial resistance, which greatly restrict the room temperature performance. Herein, the advances of SCEs applied in all-solid-state lithium batteries are presented, including the Li ion migration mechanism of SCEs, the strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of SCEs by various morphologies of ICEs, and construction methods of the low resistance and stable interfaces of SCEs with both cathode and anode. Finally, some typical applications of SCEs in lithium batteries are summarized and future development directions are prospected.

  abstract     = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the main cause of tumor development, metastasis, and relapse. CSCs are thus considered promising targets for cancer therapy. However, it is hard to eradicate CSCs due to their inherent plasticity and heterogeneity, and the underlying mechanism of the switch between non-CSCs and CSCs remains unclear. Here, it is shown that miR-135a combined with SMYD4 activates Nanog expression and induces the switch of non-CSCs into CSCs. The miR-135a level, once elevated, lowers the methylation level of the CG5 site in the Nanog promoter by directly targeting DNMT1. SMYD4 binds to the unmethylated Nanog promoter to activate Nanog expression in Nanog-negative tumor cells. The in vivo regulation of miR-135a levels could significantly affect both the CSCs proportion and tumor progression. These findings indicate that DNA methylation of the Nanog promoter modulates the switch of non-CSCs into CSCs under the control of the miRNA-135 level. In addition, the related pathways, miR-135a/DNMT1 and SMYD4, involved in these processes are potential targets for CSC-targeted therapy.},

A stable and uniform intermediate-state complex film is obtained by using tetramethylene sulfoxide (TMSO), which extends the annealing window to as long as 20 min, promotes the formation of a high-quality perovskite film with larger grains (over 400 nm) and spontaneously forms the surface texture to result in an improved fill factor and open-circuit voltage ( V oc ). Moreover, the superior surface texture significantly increases the long-wavelength response, leading to an improved short-circuit current density ( J sc ). As a result, the maximum PCE of 21.14% is achieved based on a simple planar cell structure without any interface passivation. Moreover, a large area module with active area of 6.75 cm 2 is assembled using the optimized TMSO process, showing efficiency as high as 16.57%.

Typical hip implants incorporate a cobalt alloy (Co–Cr–Mo) femoral head fixed on a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) femoral stem via a Morse taper junction. However, fretting and corrosion at this junction can cause release of wear particles and metal ions from the metallic implant, leading to local and systemic toxicity in patients. This study is a multiscale structural-chemical investigation, ranging from the micrometer down to the atomic scale, of the underlying mechanisms leading to metal ion release from such taper junctions. Correlative transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography reveals microstructural and compositional alterations in the subsurface of the titanium alloy subjected to in vitro gross-slip fretting against the cobalt alloy. Even though the cobalt alloy is comparatively more wear-resistant, changes in the titanium alloy promote tribocorrosion and subsequent degradation of the cobalt alloy. These observations regarding the concurrent occurrence of electrochemical and tribological phenomena are vital to further improve the design and performance of taper junctions in similar environments.},

Here, a dually protected, highly compressible, and freestanding anode is presented for sodium-ion batteries, where 3D carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge is decorated with homogeneously dispersed CoSe 2 nanoparticles (NPs) which are protected under carbon overcoat (CNT/CoSe 2 /C). The 3D CNT sponge delivers enough space for high mass loading while providing high mechanical strength and faster conduction pathway among the NPs. The outer amorphous carbon overcoat controls the formation of solid electrolyte interphase film by avoiding direct contact of CoSe 2 with electrolyte, accommodates large volume changes, and ultimately enhances the overall conductivity of cell and assists in transmitting electron to an external circuit. Moreover, the hybrid can be densified up to 11-fold without affecting its microstructure that results in ultrahigh areal mass loading of 17.4 mg cm −2 and an areal capacity of 7.03 mAh cm −2 along with a high gravimetric capacity of 531 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 . Thus, compact and smart devices can be realized by this new electrode design for heavy-duty commercial applications.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an upsurge in the study of novel and alternative energy storage devices beyond lithium-based systems due to the exponential increase in price of lithium. Sodium (Na) metal-based batteries can be a possible alternative to lithium-based batteries due to the similar electrochemical voltage of Na and Li together with the thousand times higher natural abundance of Na compared to Li. Though two different kinds of Na–O 2 batteries have been studied specifically based on electrolytes until now, very recently, a hybrid Na–air cell has shown distinctive advantage over nonaqueous cell systems. Hybrid Na–air batteries provide a fundamental advantage due to the formation of highly soluble discharge product (sodium hydroxide) which leads to low overpotentials for charge and discharge processes, high electrical energy efficiency, and good cyclic stability. Herein, the current status and challenges associated with hybrid Na–air batteries are reported. Also, a brief description of nonaqueous Na–O 2 batteries and its close competition with hybrid Na–air batteries are provided.},

Inspired by multitasking and mobile biological systems, an untethered soft transporter robot with controlled multidirectional locomotion with the ability of picking up, transporting, and delivering cargo driven entirely by blue light is created. The soft robot design is an ensemble of light-responsive liquid crystalline polymers that can harness motion either collectively or individually to obtain a high degree of motion control for the execution of advanced tasks in a dry environment. Through orchestrated motion of the device&#39;s “legs”, single displacement strides, which exceed 4 mm and can be taken in any direction, allow for locomotion around objects. Untethered cargo transportation is demonstrated by a pickup and release mechanism using the device&#39;s “arms”. This strategy demonstrates the constructive harnessing of orchestrated motion in assemblies of established actuators, performing complex functions, mimicking constructive behavior seen in nature.},

The obtained catalyst reveals an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 and good durability in alkaline electrolyte, which is comparable to the majority of Co-based OER catalysts. Specifically, the surface functionalization produces lots of Co-PO 4 species with oxygen vacancies which can trigger the surface self-reconstruction of pre-catalyst for a favorable OER reaction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Mo doping optimizes adsorption-free energy of *OOH formation and thus accelerates intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. Expanding on these explorations, a series of transition metal oxide pre-catalysts are obtained using this general design strategy. The work offers a fundamental understanding toward the correlation among surface-structure-activity for the pre-catalyst design.},

  abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) photon detection is of particular appealing for myriad applications, but it still lags behind efficient manipulation with electronics and photonics due to the lack of a suitable principle satisfying both high sensitivity and fast response at room temperature. Here, a new strategy is proposed to overcome these limitations by exploring the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect in an ultrashort (down to 30 nm) channel with black phosphorus as a photoactive material. The preferential flow of hot carriers is enabled by the asymmetric Cr/Au and Ti/Au metallization with the titled-angle evaporation technique. Most intriguingly, orders of magnitude field-enhancement beyond the skin-depth limit and photon absorption across a broadband frequency can be achieved. The PTE detector has excellent sensitivity of 297 V W −1 , noise equivalent power less than 58 pW/Hz 0.5 , and response time below 0.8 ms, which is superior to other thermal-based detectors at room temperature. A rigorous comparison with existing THz detectors, together with verification by further optical-pumping and imaging experiments, substantiates the importance of the localized field effect in the skin-depth limit. The results allow solid understanding on the role of PTE effect played in the THz photoresponse, opening up new opportunities for developing highly sensitive THz detectors for addressing targeted applications.},

Herein, two N -functionalized asymmetrical small molecule acceptors (SMAs), namely N7IT and N8IT are designed and synthesized, to explore the effect of N on reducing E loss with sulfur (S) as a comparison. N7IT-based OSCs achieve not only a higher PCE (13.8%), but also a much lower E loss (0.57 eV) than those of the analogue (a-IT)-based OSCs (PCE of 11.5% and E loss of 0.72 eV), which are mainly attributed to N7IT&#39;s significantly enhanced charge carrier density (promoting J SC ) and largely suppressed nonradiative E loss by over 0.1 eV (enhancing V OC ). In comparison, N8IT, with an extended π-conjugated length, shows relatively lower photovoltaic performance than N7IT (but higher than a-IT) due to the less favorable morphology caused by the excessively large dipole moment of the asymmetrical molecule. Finally, this work sheds light on the structure–property relationship of the N -functionalization, particularly on its effects on reducing the E loss , which could inspire the community to design and synthesize more N -functionalized SMAs.},

A general-purpose inverse design approach is presented using generative inverse design networks. This ML-based inverse design approach uses backpropagation to calculate the analytical gradients of an objective function with respect to design variables. This inverse design approach is capable of overcoming local minima traps by using backpropagation to provide rapid calculations of gradient information and running millions of optimizations with different initial values. Furthermore, an active learning strategy is adopted in the inverse design approach to improve the performance of candidate materials and reduce the amount of training data needed to do so. Compared to passive learning, the active learning strategy is capable of generating better designs and reducing the amount of training data by at least an order-of-magnitude in the case study on composite materials. The inverse design approach is compared with conventional gradient-based topology optimization and gradient-free genetic algorithms and the pros and cons of each method are discussed when applied to materials discovery and design problems.},

The impressive electrochemical performances can be ascribed to the super-stable porous structure, expanded interlayer space, and N/O dual-doping. More importantly, the NOHC can be prepared in large scale in a concise way, showing great potential for commercialization applications.

Although chemotherapy is widely used for clinical management of most tumors, it is often ineffective for BCBM. Therefore, alternative approaches for improved treatment of BCBM are in great demand. Here, an innovative gene therapy regimen is reported that is designed for effective treatment of BCBM. First, poly(lactone- co -β-amino ester) nanoparticles that are capable of efficient gene delivery are synthesized and are engineered for targeted delivery to BCBM through surface conjugation of AMD3100, which interacts with CXCR4 enriched in the tumor microenvironment. Next, an artificial gene, proMel , is designed for the expression of secretory promelittin protein, which has limited toxicity on its own but releases cytolytic melittin after activation by MMP-2 accumulated in tumors. It is demonstrated that delivery of the proMel via the AMD3100-conjugated nanoparticles effectively inhibits tumor progression in a BCBM mouse model. This study suggests a new direction to treat BCBM through targeted delivery of promelittin-mediated gene therapy.},

P-meso-derived endothelial cells, however, are found on all dECM preparations independent of tissue origin. Clearance of heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) from dECM abolishes induction of tissue-specific differentiation. It is concluded that HSPG-bound factors on adult tissue-derived ECM are essential and sufficient to induce tissue-specific specification of uncommitted fetal stage precursor cells.},

  abstract     = {The roles of mitochondrial dysfunction in carcinogenesis remain largely unknown. The effects of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)-dependent mitophagy on the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) are determined. The levels of the PINK1-dependent mitophagy markers PINK1 and parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase ( PARK2) in CD138 + plasma cells are reduced in patients with MM and correlate with clinical outcomes in myeloma patients. Moreover, the induction of PINK1-dependent mitophagy with carbonylcyanide- m -chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or salinomycin, or overexpression of PINK1 leads to inhibition of transwell migration, suppression of myeloma cell homing to calvarium, and decreased osteolytic bone lesions. Furthermore, genetic deletion of pink1 accelerates myeloma development in a spontaneous X-box binding protein-1 spliced isoform ( XBP-1s ) transgenic myeloma mouse model and in VK*MYC transplantable myeloma recipient mice. Additionally, treatment with salinomycin shows significant antimyeloma activities in vivo in murine myeloma xenograft models. Finally, the effects of PINK1-dependent mitophagy on myeloma pathogenesis are driven by the activation of the Mps one binder kinase activator (MOB1B)-mediated Hippo pathway and the subsequent downregulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) expression. These data provide direct evidence that PINK1-dependent mitophagy plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MM and is a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {Friction and wear remain the primary modes for energy dissipation in moving mechanical components. Superlubricity is highly desirable for energy saving and environmental benefits. Macroscale superlubricity was previously performed under special environments or on curved nanoscale surfaces. Nevertheless, macroscale superlubricity has not yet been demonstrated under ambient conditions on macroscale surfaces, except in humid air produced by purging water vapor into a tribometer chamber. In this study, a tribological system is fabricated using a graphene-coated plate (GCP), graphene-coated microsphere (GCS), and graphene-coated ball (GCB). The friction coefficient of 0.006 is achieved in air under 35 mN at a sliding speed of 0.2 mm s −1 for 1200 s in the developed GCB/GCS/GCP system. To the best of the knowledge, for the first time, macroscale superlubricity on macroscale surfaces under ambient conditions is reported. The mechanism of macroscale superlubricity is due to the combination of exfoliated graphene flakes and the swinging and sliding of the GCS, which is demonstrated by the experimental measurements, ab initio, and molecular dynamics simulations. These findings help to bridge macroscale superlubricity to real world applications, potentially dramatically contributing to energy savings and reducing the emission of carbon dioxide to the environment.},

  abstract     = {Near-infrared (NIR) light emitting diodes (LEDs) with the emission wavelength over 900 nm are useful in a wide range of optical applications. Narrow bandgap NIR emitters have been widely investigated using organic compounds and colloidal quantum dots. However, intrinsically low charge mobility and luminescence efficiency of these materials limit improvement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR LEDs, which is far from practical applications. Herein, a highly efficient NIR LED is demonstrated, which is based on an energy transfer from wide bandgap all inorganic perovskite (CsPbCl 3 ) to ytterbium ions (Yb 3+ ) as an NIR emitter doped in the perovskite crystalline film. High mobility of electrically excited carriers in the perovskite crystalline film provides a long carrier diffusion and enhances radiative recombination of an emission center due to minimized charge trapping losses, resulting in high EQE value in LEDs. The NIR emission of Yb 3+ at around 1000 nm is found to be sensitized by CsPbCl 3 thin film with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 60%. The LED based on Yb 3+ -doped CsPbCl 3 film exhibits a high EQE of 5.9% with a peak wavelength of 984 nm, achieved by high carrier transporting ability and effective sensitized emission property in the solid-film structure.},

Here, controllable nanometer-scale transistors with a channel length of ≈10 nm are fabricated via vertical channels by squeezing an ultrathin insulating spacer between the out-of-plane source and drain electrodes, and the feasibility of high-density and large-scale fabrication is demonstrated. A large on-current density of ≈70 µA µm −1 nm −1 at a source–drain voltage of 0.5 V and a high on/off ratio of ≈10 7 –10 9 are obtained in ultrashort 2D vertical channel FETs with monolayer MoS 2 synthesized through chemical vapor deposition.

The final goal is to engineer these components into transient implantable systems that directly interact with organs, tissues, and biofluids in real-time, retrieve clinical parameters, and provide therapeutic actions tailored to the disease and patient clinical evolution, and then biodegrade without the need for device-retrieving surgery that may cause tissue lesion or infection. Here, the major results achieved in bioresorbable technology are critically reviewed, with a bottom-up approach that starts from a rational analysis of dissolution chemistry and kinetics, and biocompatibility of bioresorbable materials, then moves to in vivo performance and stability of electrical and optical bioresorbable components, and eventually focuses on the integration of such components into bioresorbable systems for clinically relevant applications. Finally, the technology readiness levels (TRLs) achieved for the different bioresorbable devices and systems are assessed, hence the open challenges are analyzed and future directions for advancing the technology are envisaged.},

Here, this issue is investigated with an individual difference approach. Forty-five participants attended three sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments and one neuroimaging session. The results support the symmetric mechanism of left and right TPJ stimulation. First, the left and right TPJ stimulation effect are comparable in the group-level analysis. Second, the individual-level analysis reveals that a less right-lateralized TPJ is associated with a higher level of responsiveness. Participants could be classified into positive responders showing cognitive enhancement and negative responders showing cognitive impairment due to stimulation. The positive responders show weaker connectivity between bilateral TPJ and the medial prefrontal cortex, which mediates the prediction of offline responsiveness by the lateralization and the social-related trait. These findings call for a better characterization and predictive models for whom tDCS should be used for, and highlight the necessity and feasibility of prestimulation screening.},

TPN is a cell-permeant live-cell stain that has little effect on cell viability and integrity, enabling single-cell DNA/RNA analysis with improved efficiency compared with traditional antibody-based methods. Using TPN labeling, CTCs and CTC cluster are detected in the blood from patients with lung or liver cancer. The capability of TPN to identify rare tumor cells in the malignant pleural effusion samples is also demonstrated. Furthermore, RNA sequencing of single lung CTC identified by TPN is successfully performed. The findings presented here provide an antibody-free, low-cost, and nondisruptive approach for detection and genomic characterization of viable tumor cells based on a mitochondria-targeting AIE luminogen.

  abstract     = {Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) are compelling optical emitters to construct white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it remains a challenge to achieve large-scale and highly efficient single-component white-light-emissive CDs suitable for WLED applications. Herein, a low cost, fast processable, environmentally friendly, and one-step synthetic approach is developed for the preparation of gram-scale and highly efficient single-component white-light-emissive carbonized polymer dots (SW-CPDs). It is revealed that hybrid fluorescence/phosphorescence components cooperatively contribute to the emergence of white light emission. The SW-CPDs exhibit a record quantum yield (QY) of ≈41% for the white light emission observed in solid-state CD systems, while the QY of the phosphorescence is ≈23% under ambient conditions. Heavy doping of N and P elements as well as presence of covalently cross-linked polymer frameworks is suggested to account for the emergence of hybrid fluorescence/phosphorescence, which is supported by the experimental results and theoretical calculations. A WLED is fabricated by applying the SW-CPDs on an UV-LED chip, showing favorable white-light-emitting characteristics with a high luminous efficacy of 18.7 lm W −1 that is comparable to that of state-of-the-art WLEDs reported before.},

  abstract     = {It is widely acknowledged that splash impact can be suppressed by increasing the viscosity of the impinging drop. In this work, however, by imposing a highly viscous drop to a low-viscosity drop, it is demonstrated that the splash of the low-viscosity part of this Janus drop on superamphiphobic surfaces can be significantly promoted. The underlying mechanism is that the viscous stress exerted by the low-viscosity component drives the viscous component moving in the opposite direction, enhancing the spreading of the low-viscosity side and thereby its rim instability. The threshold velocity, above which splashing occurs, can be tuned by varying the viscosity ratio of the Janus drop. Moreover, the impact of the Janus drop can be employed to verify the mechanism of splash.},

  abstract     = {Organic compounds with active sites for lithiation can be used as electrode materials for lithium batteries. Their tunable structures allow a variety of materials to be made and investigated. Herein, a spectrum of dipyridyl polysulfides (Py 2 S x , 3 ≤ x ≤ 8) is prepared in electrolyte by a one-pot synthesis method from dipyridyl disulfide (Py 2 S 2 ) and elemental sulfur. It renders up to seven dipyridyl polysulfides (i.e., Py 2 S 3 , Py 2 S 4 , Py 2 S 5 , Py 2 S 6 , Py 2 S 7 , and Py 2 S 8 ) which show fully reversible electrochemical behavior in lithium batteries. In the discharge, the initial lithiation occurs at 2.45 V leading to the breakage of S α  S β bonds in Py 2 S x and formation of lithium 2-pyridinethiolate, in which lithium is coordinated in between N and S atoms. The left sulfur species act as elemental sulfur, showing two voltage plateaus at 2.3 and 2.1 V. The molecular dynamics simulations show the attraction between pyridyl groups and lithium polysulfides/sulfide via N···Li···S bonds, which enable good retention of soluble discharge products within electrodes and stable cycling performance. In the recharge, low-order Py 2 S x (e.g., Py 2 S 3 , Py 2 S 4 , and Py 2 S 5 ) remain as the charged products. The mixture catholyte exhibits superlong cycle life at 1C rate with 1200 cycles and 70.5% capacity retention.},

Certain viral and bacterial proteins are readily internalized in functional form through lipid raft-mediated/caveolar endocytosis, but mimicking this process with protein cargoes at therapeutically relevant concentrations is a great challenge. Targeting ganglioside GM1 in the caveolar pits triggers endocytosis. A pentapeptide sequence WYKYW is presented, which specifically captures the glycan moiety of GM1 ( K D = 24 n m ). The WYKYW-tag facilitates the GM1-dependent endocytosis of proteins in which the cargo-loaded caveosomes do not fuse with lysosomes. A structurally intact immunoglobulin G complex (580 kDa) is successfully delivered into live HeLa cells at extracellular concentrations ranging from 20 to 160 n m , and escape of the cargo proteins to the cytosol is observed. The short peptidic WYKYW-tag is an advantageous endocytosis routing sequence for lipid raft-mediated/caveolar cell delivery of therapeutic macromolecules, especially for cancer cells that overexpress GM1.},

In this work, a 3D network (Ni-NCFs) host composed by nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (NCFs) and Ni hollow spheres is synthesized by electrospinning. In this novel design, each Ni hollow unit not only can buffer the volume fluctuation of S during cycling, but also can improve the conductivity of the cathode along the carbon fibers. Meanwhile, the result reveals that a small amount of Ni is polarized during the sulfur-loading process forming a polar Ni  S bond. Furthermore, combining with the nitrogen-doped carbon fibers, the Ni-NCFs composite can effectively adsorb soluble polysulfide intermediate, which further facilitates the catalysis of the Ni unit for the redox of sodium polysulfide. In addition, the in situ Raman is employed to supervise the variation of polysulfide during the charging and discharging process. As expected, the freestanding S@Ni-NCFs cathode exhibits outstanding rate capability and excellent cycle performance.},

Here, with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, the uptake of 89 Zr-agrin is noninvasively and dynamically monitored. These data demonstrate the time–activity curve of drugs in the brain subregions and their spatial distribution in different organs after intrathecal administration. Furthermore, agrin treatment effectively inhibits BBB disruption by reducing the loss of tight-junctional proteins. Importantly, the infarct volume is reduced; the number of apoptotic neurons is decreased; and neurological function is improved in mouse I/R injury models. Thus, intrathecal injection of agrin provides the basis for a new strategy to research and develop protein drugs for reducing the aggravation of I/R injury.},

PBDT2T- b -N2200 shows a broad complementary absorption behavior owing to a wide-band gap donor (PBDT2T) present as a D-block and a narrow-band gap acceptor (N2200) present as an A-block. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with conjugated block copolymer (CBCP) are fabricated using a toluene solution and PSC created with an annealed film showing the highest power conversion efficiency of 6.43%, which is 2.4 times higher than that made with an annealed blend film of PBDT2T and N2200. Compared to the blend film, the PBDT2T- b -N2200 film exhibits a highly improved surface and internal morphology, as well as a faster photoluminescence decay lifetime, indicating a more efficient photoinduced electron transfer. In addition, the PBDT2T- b -N2200 film shows high crystallinity through an effective self-assembly of each block during thermal annealing and a predominant face-on chain orientation favorable to a vertical-type PSC. Moreover, the CBCP-based PSCs exhibit an excellent shelf-life time of over 1020 h owing to their morphological stability. From these results, a D–A block copolymer system is one of the efficient strategies to improve miscibility and morphological stability in all polymer blend systems.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia (NH 3 ) is a pivotal precursor in fertilizer production and a potential energy carrier. Currently, ammonia production worldwide relies on the traditional Haber–Bosch process, which consumes massive energy and has a large carbon footprint. Recently, electrochemical dinitrogen reduction to ammonia under ambient conditions has attracted considerable interest owing to its advantages of flexibility and environmental friendliness. However, the biggest challenge in dinitrogen electroreduction, i.e., the low efficiency and selectivity caused by poor specificity of electrocatalysts/electrolytic systems, still needs to be overcome. Although substantial progress has been made in recent years, acquiring most available electrocatalysts still relies on low efficiency trial-and-error methods. It is thus imperative to establish some critical guiding principles for nitrogen electroreduction toward a rational design and accelerated development of this field. Herein, a basic understanding of dinitrogen electroreduction processes and the inherent relationships between adsorbates and catalysts from fundamental theory are described, followed by an outline of the crucial principles for designing efficient electrocatalysts/electrocatalytic systems derived from a systematic evaluation of the latest significant achievements. Finally, the future research directions and prospects of this field are given, with a special emphasis on the opportunities available by following the guiding principles.},

Here, it is reported that monolayer (ML) dialkali-metal monoxides, in the well-known 2H-MoS 2 type lattice, host multiple symmetry-protected topological phases with emergent fermions, which can be effectively tuned by strain engineering. Based on first-principles calculations, it is found that in the equilibrium state, ML Na 2 O is a 2D double Weyl semimetal, while ML K 2 O is a 2D pseudospin-1 metal. These exotic topological states exhibit a range of fascinating effects, including universal optical absorbance, super Klein tunneling, and super collimation effect. By introducing biaxial or uniaxial strain, a series of quantum phase transitions between 2D double Weyl semimetal, 2D Dirac semimetal, 2D pseudospin-1 metal, and semiconductor phases can be realized. The results suggest monolayer dialkali-metal monoxides as a promising platform to explore fascinating physical phenomena associated with novel 2D emergent fermions.},

Here, these limitations are overcome and customizable cell mimic is achieved—molecular factories (MFs)—by supplementing giant plasma membrane vesicles derived from donor cells with nanometer-sized artificial organelles (AOs). MFs inherit the donor cell&#39;s natural cytoplasm and membrane, while the AOs house reactive components and provide cell-like architecture and functionality. It is demonstrated that reactions inside AOs take place in a close-to-nature environment due to the unprecedented level of complexity in the composition of the MFs. It is further demonstrated that in a zebrafish vertebrate animal model, these cell mimics show no apparent toxicity and retain their integrity and function. The unique advantages of highly varied composition, multicompartmentalized architecture, and preserved functionality in vivo open new biological avenues ranging from the study of biorelevant processes in robust cell-like environments to the production of specific bioactive compounds.},

The wild allotetraploid peanut species Arachis monticola ( A. monticola ) is an important and unique link from the wild diploid species to cultivated tetraploid species in the Arachis lineage. However, little is known about A. monticola and its role in the evolution and domestication of this important crop. A fully annotated sequence of ≈2.6 Gb A. monticola genome and comparative genomics of the Arachis species is reported. Genomic reconstruction of 17 wild diploids from AA, BB, EE, KK, and CC groups and 30 tetraploids demonstrates a monophyletic origin of A and B subgenomes in allotetraploid peanuts. The wild and cultivated tetraploids undergo asymmetric subgenome evolution, including homoeologous exchanges, homoeolog expression bias, and structural variation (SV), leading to subgenome functional divergence during peanut domestication. Significantly, SV-associated homoeologs tend to show expression bias and correlation with pod size increase from diploids to wild and cultivated tetraploids. Moreover, genomic analysis of disease resistance genes shows the unique alleles present in the wild peanut can be introduced into breeding programs to improve some resistance traits in the cultivated peanuts. These genomic resources are valuable for studying polyploid genome evolution, domestication, and improvement of peanut production and resistance.},

However, a major challenge to cryopreserving organs remains in the rewarming of large volumes (&gt;3 mL), where mechanical stress and ice formation during convective warming cause severe damage. Nanowarming technology presents a promising solution to rewarm organs rapidly and uniformly via inductive heating of magnetic nanoparticles (IONPs) preloaded by perfusion into the organ vasculature. This use requires the IONPs to be produced at scale, heat quickly, be nontoxic, remain stable in cryoprotective agents (CPAs), and be washed out easily after nanowarming. Nanowarming of cells and blood vessels using a mesoporous silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticle (msIONP) in VS55, a common CPA, has been previously demonstrated. However, production of msIONPs is a lengthy, multistep process and provides only mg Fe per batch. Here, a new microporous silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticle (sIONP) that can be produced in as little as 1 d while scaling up to 1.4 g Fe per batch is presented. sIONP high heating, biocompatibility, and stability in VS55 is also verified, and the ability to perfusion load and washout sIONPs from a rat kidney as evidenced by advanced imaging and ICP-OES is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Ultrathin metal–organic framework nanosheets (UMOFNs) deposited on graphene are highly attractive, however direct growth of UMOFNs on graphene with controlled orientations remains challenging. Here, a low-concentration-assisted heterogeneous nucleation strategy is reported for the direct growth of UMOFNs on reduced graphene oxides (rGO) surface with controllable orientations. This general strategy can be applied to construct various UMOFNs on rGO, including Co-ZIF, Ni-ZIF, Co, Cu-ZIF and Co, Fe-ZIF. When UMOFNs are mostly attached perpendicularly on rGO, a 3D foam-like hierarchical architecture (named UMOFNs@rGO-F) is formed with an open pore structure and excellent conductivity, showing excellent performance as electrode materials for Li-ion batteries and oxygen evolution. The contribution has provided a strategy for improving the electrochemical performance of MOFs in energy storage applications.},

Here, the regulation of hepatocellular CSC self-renewal is discovered by a circRNA, circ-MALAT1, which is produced by back-splicing of a long noncoding RNA, MALAT1. Circ-MALAT1 is highly expressed in CSCs from clinical hepatocellular carcinoma samples under the mediation of an RNA-binding protein, AUF1. Surprisingly, circMALAT1 functions as a brake in ribosomes to retard PAX5 mRNA translation and promote CSCs&#39; self-renewal by forming an unprecedented ternary complex with both ribosomes and mRNA. The discovered braking mechanism of a circRNA, termed mRNA braking, along with its more traditional role of miRNA sponging, uncovers a dual-faceted pattern of circRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation for maintaining a specific cell state.},

  abstract     = {The atomic or molecular assembly on 2D materials through the relatively weak van der Waals interaction is quite different from the conventional heteroepitaxy and may result in unique growth behaviors. Here, it is shown that straight 1D cyanide chains display universal epitaxy on hexagonal 2D materials. A universal oriented assembly of cyanide crystals (AgCN, AuCN, and Cu 0.5 Au 0.5 CN) is observed, where the chains are aligned along the three zigzag lattice directions of various 2D hexagonal crystals (graphene, h-BN, WS 2 , MoS 2 , WSe 2 , MoSe 2 , and MoTe 2 ). The potential energy landscape of the hexagonal lattice induces this preferred alignment of 1D chains along the zigzag lattice directions, regardless of the lattice parameter and surface elements as demonstrated by first-principles calculations and parameterized surface potential calculations. Furthermore, the oriented microwires can serve as crystal orientation markers, and stacking-angle-controlled vertical 2D heterostructures are successfully fabricated by using them as markers. The oriented van der Waals epitaxy can be generalized to any hexagonal 2D crystals and will serve as a unique growth process to form crystals with orientations along the zigzag directions by epitaxy.},

  abstract     = {Meiosis increases genetic diversity, yet the genome complement needs to be stable to ensure offspring viability. Both small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) and ubiquitin have been reported to participate in meiotic regulation, yet functions of the SUMO-ubiquitination crosstalk in meiosis remain unclear. Here, it is reported that a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, Slx8p, promotes accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, since the deletion of SLX8 leads to increased aneuploidy due to a defect in synaptonemal complex (SC) component degradation. Both the RING domain and SUMO interacting motifs of Slx8p are essential for meiotic progression and maintaining spore viability, and the expression of tetraubiquitin fused with SUMO partially rescues meiotic defects in the SLX8 -deletion strain. Furthermore, Slx5p-Slx8p can directly add ubiquitin to SUMOylated Zip1p and Ecm11p, and forced degradation of Ecm11p partially rescues the sporulation defects of the SLX8 deletion strain. These findings provide a mechanism for SC disassembly and reveal that the crosstalk between SUMOylation and ubiquitination facilitates accurate chromosome segregation by promoting SC component degradation during meiosis.},

However, p–n diodes, which are typical and versatile, are still limited by the material choice due to the fixed band structures. Here, the vanadium dopant concentration is modulated in monolayer WSe 2 via chemical vapor deposition to demonstrate tunable multifunctional quantum tunneling diodes by vertically stacking SnSe 2 layers at room temperature. This is implemented by substituting tungsten atoms with vanadium atoms in WSe 2 to provoke the p-type doping effect in order to efficiently modulate the Fermi level. The precise control of the vanadium doping concentration is the key to achieving the desired quantum tunneling diode behaviors by tuning the proper band alignment for charge transfer across the heterostructure. By constructing a p–n diode for p-type V-doped WSe 2 and heavily degenerate n-type SnSe 2 , the type-II band alignment at low V-doping concentration is clearly shown, which evolves into the type-III broken-gap alignment at heavy V-doping concentration to reveal a variety of diode behaviors such as forward diode, backward diode, negative differential resistance, and ohmic resistance.},

In addition, a first clinical study using ultrasound brain stimulation and first observations of long term effects are presented. Comprehensive feasibility, safety, and efficacy data are provided. They consist of simulation data, laboratory measurements with rat and human skulls and brains, in vivo modulations of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in healthy subjects (sham controlled) and clinical pilot data in 35 patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease acquired in a multicenter setting (including neuropsychological scores and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)). Preclinical results show large safety margins and dose dependent neuromodulation. Patient investigations reveal high treatment tolerability and no major side effects. Neuropsychological scores improve significantly after TPS treatment and improvement lasts up to three months and correlates with an upregulation of the memory network (fMRI data).

However, the practical application of Li-rich cathodes is extremely retarded by the sluggish electrode–electrolyte interface kinetics and structure instability. In this context, piezoelectric LiTaO 3 is employed to functionalize the surface of Li 1.2 Ni 0.17 Mn 0.56 Co 0.07 O 2 (LNMCO), aiming to boost the interfacial Li + transport process in LIBs. The results demonstrate that the 2 wt% LiTaO 3 -LNMCO electrode exhibits a stable capacity of 209.2 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C after 200 cycles and 172.4 mAh g −1 at 3 C. Further investigation reveals that such superior electrochemical performances of the LiTaO 3 modified electrode results from the additional driving force from the piezoelectric LiTaO 3 layer in promoting Li + diffusion at the interface, as well as the stabilized bulk structure of LNMCO. The supplemented LiTaO 3 layer on the LNMCO surface herein, sheds new light on the development of better Li-rich cathodes toward high energy density applications.},

However, it is still challenging for blue TADF emitters to simultaneously achieve high efficiency, high brightness, and low Commission Internationale de l&#39;Eclairage (CIE) y coordinate (CIE y ) value. Here, the design and synthesis of two new benzonitrile-based TADF emitters (namely 2,6-di(9 H -carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-bis(3,6-diphenyl-9 H -carbazol-9-yl)benzonitrile (2PhCz2CzBn) and 2,6-di(9 H -carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-bis(3,6-di- tert -butyl-9 H -carbazol-9-yl)benzonitrile (2tCz2CzBn)) with a symmetrical and rigid heterodonor configuration are reported. The TADF OLEDs doped with both the emitters can achieve a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20% and narrowband blue emission of 464 nm with a CIE y &lt; 0.2. Moreover, the incorporation of a terminal tert -butyl group can weaken the intermolecular π–π stacking in the nondoped TADF emitter, and thus significantly suppress self-aggregation-caused emission quenching for enhanced delayed fluorescence. A peak EQE of 21.6% is realized in the 2tCz2CzBn-based nondoped device with an extremely low turn-on voltage of 2.7 V, high color stability, a high brightness over 20 000 cd m −2 , a narrow full-width at half-maximum of 70 nm, and CIE color coordinates of (0.167, 0.248).},

  abstract     = {Controlling the selective one-to-one conjugation of RNA with nanoparticles is vital for future applications of RNA nanotechnology. Here, the monofunctionalization of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) with a single copy of RNA is developed for ultrasensitive microRNA-155 quantification using electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS). A single AuNP is conjugated with one copy of the packaging RNA (pRNA) three-way junction (RNA 3WJ). pRNA 3WJ containing one strand of the 3WJ is connected to a Sephadex G100 aptamer and a biotin group at each arm (SEPapt/3WJ/Bio) which is then immobilized to the Sephadex G100 resin. The resulting complex is connected to streptavidin-coated AuNP (STV/AuNP). Next, the STV/AuNP–Bio/3WJa is purified and reassembled with another 3WJ to form a single-labeled 3WJ/AuNP. Later, the monoconjugate is immobilized onto the AuNP-electrodeposited indium tin oxide coated substrate for detecting microRNA-155 based on EC-SERS. Application of an optimum potential of +0.2 V results in extraordinary amplification (≈7 times) of methylene blue (reporter) SERS signal compared to the normal SERS signal. As a result, a highly sensitive detection of 60 × 10 −18 m microRNA-155 in 1 h in serum based on monoconjugated AuNP/RNA is achieved. Thus, the monofunctionalization of RNA onto nanoparticle can provide a new methodology for biosensor construction and diverse RNA nanotechnology development.},

By tuning the number of F atoms in the acceptor molecules, the resulting complexes display a continuous down shift of the valence band maximum, conducting band minimum, and optical bandgap. The majority carriers convert from hole (DPTTA-F 1 TCNQ), balanced hole, and electron (DPTTA-F 2 TCNQ) to electron (DPTTA-F 4 TCNQ). This result shows that band engineering can be realized easily in the donor–acceptor complex systems by tuning the electron affinity of the acceptor. The bandgaps of these three complexes vary from 0.31 to 0.41 eV; this narrow bandgap feature is crucial for achieving high thermoelectric performance and the unintentional doping in DPTTA-F 4 TCNQ leads to the effective suppression of the bipolar cancelling effect on the Seebeck coefficient and the highest power factor.},

  abstract     = {Water remediation and development of carbon-neutral fuels are a priority for the evermore industrialized society. The answer to these challenges should be simple, sustainable, and inexpensive. Thus, biomimetic-inspired circular and holistic processes combing water remediation and biofuel production can be an appealing concept to deal with these global issues. A simple circular approach using helical Spirulina platensis microalgae as biotemplates to synthesize Ni@ZnO@ZnS photocatalysts for efficient solar water decontamination and bioethanol production during the recycling process is presented. Under solar irradiation, the Ni@ZnO@ZnS- Spirulina photocatalyst exhibits enhanced activity (mineralization efficiency &gt;99%) with minimal photocorrosion and excellent reusability. At the end of its effective lifetime for water remediation, the microalgae skeleton (mainly glycogen and glucose) of the photocatalyst is recycled to directly produce bioethanol by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process. An outstanding ethanol yield of 0.4 L kg −1 , which is similar to the highest yield obtained from oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms, is obtained. Thus, the entire process allows effective solar photocatalytic water remediation and bioethanol production at room temperature using simple and easily scalable procedures that simultaneously fixes carbon dioxide, thereby constituting a zero-carbon-emission circular process.},

  abstract     = {Electronic ratchets use a periodic potential with broken inversion symmetry to rectify undirected (electromagnetic, EM) forces and can in principle be a complement to conventional diode-based designs. Unfortunately, ratchet devices reported to date have low or undetermined power conversion efficiencies, hampering applicability. Combining experiments and numerical modeling, field-effect transistor-based ratchets are investigated in which the driving signal is coupled into the accumulation layer via interdigitated finger electrodes that are capacitively coupled to the field effect transistor channel region. The output current–voltage curves of these ratchets can have a fill factor &gt;&gt; 0.25 which is highly favorable for the power output. Experimentally, a maximum power conversion efficiency well over 10% at 5 MHz, which is the highest reported value for an electronic ratchet, is determined. Device simulations indicate this number can be increased further by increasing the device asymmetry. A scaling analysis shows that the frequency range of optimal performance can be scaled to the THz regime, and possibly beyond, while adhering to technologically realistic parameters. Concomitantly, the power output density increases from ≈4 W m −2 to ≈1 MW m −2 . Hence, this type of ratchet device can rectify high-frequency EM fields at reasonable efficiencies, potentially paving the way for actual use as energy harvester.},

Upon exposure to cultured cells or upon subcutaneous or intratumor injection, these protein materials secrete functional IB polypeptides, functionally mimicking the endocrine release of peptide hormones from secretory amyloid granules. Being appealing as delivery systems for prolonged protein drug release, the development of IBs toward clinical applications is, however, severely constrained by their bacterial origin and by the undefined and protein-to-protein, batch-to-batch variable composition. In this context, the de novo fabrication of artificial IBs (ArtIBs) by simple, cell-free physicochemical methods, using pure components at defined amounts is proposed here. By this, the resulting functional protein microparticles are intriguing, chemically defined biomimetic materials that replicate relevant functionalities of natural IBs, including mammalian cell penetration and local or remote release of functional ArtIB-forming protein. In default of severe regulatory issues, the concept of ArtIBs is proposed as a novel exploitable category of biomaterials for biotechnological and biomedical applications, resulting from simple fabrication and envisaging soft developmental routes to clinics.},

The enclosure modifies the frequency response of the microphone in a direction-dependent manner by giving each direction a characteristic signature. Thus, the information about the location and the audio content of sound sources can be experimentally reconstructed from the modulated mixed signals using a compressive sensing algorithm. Due to the low computational complexity of the proposed reconstruction algorithm, the designed system can also be applied in source identification and tracking. The effectiveness of the system in multiple real-life scenarios is evaluated through multiple random listening tests. The proposed metamaterial-based single-sensor listening system opens a new way of sound localization and separation, which can be applied to intelligent scene monitoring and robot audition.},

Here, a “learned integrated sensing pipeline” (LISP), including in an end-to-end fashion both physical and processing layers, is shown to enable joint learning of optimal measurement strategies and a matching processing algorithm, making use of a priori knowledge on task, scene, and measurement constraints. Numerical results demonstrate accuracy improvements around 15% for object recognition tasks with limited numbers of measurements, using dynamic metasurface apertures capable of transceiving programmable microwave patterns. Moreover, it is concluded that the optimal learned microwave patterns are nonintuitive, underlining the importance of the LISP paradigm in current sensorization trends.},

However, the in toto cellular mapping of neural circuits throughout an intact mouse brain remains highly challenging, requiring complicated mechanical stitching, and suffering from anisotropic resolution insufficient for high-quality reconstruction in 3D. Here, the use of a multiangle-resolved subvoxel selective plane illumination microscope (Mars-SPIM) is proposed to achieve high-throughput imaging of whole mouse brain at isotropic cellular resolution. This light-sheet imaging technique can computationally improve the spatial resolution over six times under a large field of view, eliminating the use of slow tile stitching. Furthermore, it can recover complete structural information of the sample from images subject to thick-tissue scattering/attenuation. With Mars-SPIM, a digital atlas of a cleared whole mouse brain (≈7 mm × 9.5 mm × 5 mm) can readily be obtained with an isotropic resolution of ≈2 µm (1 µm voxel) and a short acquisition time of 30 min. It provides an efficient way to implement system-level cellular analysis, such as the mapping of different neuron populations and tracing of long-distance neural projections over the entire brain. Mars-SPIM is thus well suited for high-throughput cell-profiling phenotyping of brain and other mammalian organs.},

The BDMS-based perovskites retain the structural and optical features of pristine perovskite, which results in the comparable photovoltaic performance. However, the fully alkylated aprotic nature of BDMS shows a much more pronounced effect on the increase in humidity stability, which emphasizes a generic electronic difference between protic ammonium and aprotic sulfonium cation.

  abstract     = {Many predators produce dormant offspring to escape harsh environmental conditions, but the evolutionary stability of this adaptation has not been fully explored. Like seed banks in plants, dormancy provides a stable competitive advantage when seasonal variations occur, because the persistence of dormant forms under harsh conditions compensates for the increased cost of producing dormant offspring. However, dormancy also exists in environments with minimal abiotic variation—an observation not accounted for by existing theory. Here it is demonstrated that dormancy can out-compete perennial activity under conditions of extensive prey density fluctuation caused by overpredation. It is shown that at a critical level of prey density fluctuations, dormancy becomes an evolutionarily stable strategy. This is interpreted as a manifestation of Parrondo&#39;s paradox: although neither the active nor dormant forms of a dormancy-capable predator can individually out-compete a perennially active predator, alternating between these two losing strategies can paradoxically result in a winning strategy. Parrondo&#39;s paradox may thus explain the widespread success of quiescent behavioral strategies such as dormancy, suggesting that dormancy emerges as a natural evolutionary response to the self-destructive tendencies of overpredation and related biological phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Plant root architecture dynamically adapts to various environmental conditions, such as salt-containing soil. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved among others also in these developmental adaptations, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, a novel branch of the ABA signaling pathway in Arabidopsis involving PYR/PYL/RCAR (abbreviated as PYLs) receptor-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex that acts in parallel to the canonical PYLs-protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) mechanism is identified. The PYLs-PP2A signaling modulates root gravitropism and lateral root formation through regulating phytohormone auxin transport. In optimal conditions, PYLs ABA receptor interacts with the catalytic subunits of PP2A, increasing their phosphatase activity and thus counteracting PINOID (PID) kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporters. By contrast, in salt and osmotic stress conditions, ABA binds to PYLs, inhibiting the PP2A activity, which leads to increased PIN phosphorylation and consequently modulated directional auxin transport leading to adapted root architecture. This work reveals an adaptive mechanism that may flexibly adjust plant root growth to withstand saline and osmotic stresses. It occurs via the cross-talk between the stress hormone ABA and the versatile developmental regulator auxin.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogels are widely used in tissue engineering owing to their high water retention and soft characteristics. It remains a challenge to develop hydrogels with tunable degradation rates, proper environmental responsiveness, and injectability. In this study, biodegradable difunctional polyurethane (DFPU) nanoparticle dispersions are synthesized from an eco-friendly waterborne process involving the use of glyoxal. Such DFPU is used to crosslink chitosan (CS). Schiff base linkages between DFPU and CS successfully produce self-healing hydrogels at room temperature. Moreover, cryogels are generated after being frozen at −20 °C. These gels are found to be sensitive to low pH and amine-containing molecules owing to the property of Schiff bases. Furthermore, the degradation rates can be adjusted by the type of the component oligodiols in DFPU. Rheological evaluation verifies the excellent self-healing properties (≈100% recovery after damage). Both the self-healing gels and cryogels are injectable (through 26-gauge and 18-gauge needles, respectively) and biocompatible. Rat implantation at 14 d shows the low immune responses of cryogels. The functionalized biodegradable polyurethane nanoparticles represent a new platform of crosslinkers for biomacromolecules such as chitosan through the dynamic Schiff reaction that may give rise to a wide variety of self-healing gels and cryogels for biomedical applications.},

  abstract     = {An improved understanding of the origin of the electrocatalytic activity is of importance to the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Here, an ambipolar single-crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ) semiconductor is employed as a model system where the conductance and carrier of WSe 2 can be individually tuned by external electric fields. The field-tuned electrochemical microcell is fabricated based on the single-crystal WSe 2 and the catalytic activity of the WSe 2 microcell is measured versus the external electric field. Results show that WSe 2 with electrons serving as the dominant carrier yields much higher activity than WSe 2 with holes serving as the dominant carrier even both systems exhibit similar conductance. The catalytic activity enhancement can be characterized by the Tafel slope decrease from 138 to 104 mV per decade, while the electron area concentration increases from 0.64 × 10 12 to 1.72 × 10 12 cm −2 . To further understand the underlying mechanism, the Gibbs free energy and charge distribution for adsorbed hydrogen on WSe 2 versus the area charge concentration is systematically computed, which is in line with experiments. This comprehensive study not only sheds light on the mechanism underlying the electrocatalysis processes, but also offers a strategy to achieve higher electrocatalytic activity.},

However, the mechanism of YAP1-regulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) in tumors is still largely unknown. Here, a YAP1 target gene, long intergenic noncoding RNA 00152 (LINC00152), which is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), is identified. The oncogenic functions of LINC00152 in CRC are demonstrated by a panel of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Further studies reveal the potential downstream mechanisms of LINC00152, which can act as a competing endogenous RNA sponging with miR-632 and miR-185-3p to regulate Fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) expression and thus promote the malignant proliferation and metastasis in CRC cells. Targeting the YAP1/LINC00152/FSCN1 axis inhibits the progression of CRC. This finding provides a new regulatory model of the “YAP1-lncRNA” in CRC, which gives rise to a new perspective, “YAP1/LINC00152/miR-632-miR-185-3p/FSCN1,” to explore the cancer-promoting mechanism of YAP1 involved in CRC.},

  abstract     = {Cell-derived microparticles, which are recognized as nanosized phospholipid bilayer membrane vesicles, have exhibited great potential to serve as drug delivery systems in cancer therapy. However, for the purpose of comprehensive therapy, microparticles decorated with multiple therapeutic components are needed, but effective engineering strategies are limited and still remain enormous challenges. Herein, Bi 2 Se 3 nanodots and doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) co-embedded tumor cell-derived microparticles (Bi 2 Se 3 /DOX@MPs) are successfully constructed through ultraviolet light irradiation-induced budding of parent cells which are preloaded with Bi 2 Se 3 nanodots and DOX via electroporation. The multifunctional microparticles are obtained with high controllability and drug-loading capacity without unfavorable membrane surface destruction, maintaining their excellent intrinsic biological behaviors. Through membrane fusion cellular internalization, Bi 2 Se 3 /DOX@MPs show enhanced cellular internalization and deepened tumor penetration, resulting in extreme cell damage in vitro without considering endosomal escape. Because of their distinguished photothermal performance and tumor homing target capability, Bi 2 Se 3 /DOX@MPs exhibit admirable dual-modal imaging capacity and outstanding tumor suppression effect. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, intravenous injection of Bi 2 Se 3 /DOX@MPs into H22 tumor-bearing mice results in remarkably synergistic antitumor efficacy by combining photothermal therapy with low-dose chemotherapy in vivo. Furthermore, the negligible hemolytic activity, considerable metabolizability, and low systemic toxicity of Bi 2 Se 3 /DOX@MPs imply their distinguished biocompatibility and great potential for tumor theranostics.},

  abstract     = {The carboxylation of hydrocarbons using CO 2 as a one-carbon building block is an attractive route for the synthesis of carboxylic acids and their derivatives. Until now, chemical carboxylation catalyzed by organometallic nucleophiles and reductants has been generally adopted particularly for the precise selectivity control of carboxylation sites. As another approach, electrochemical carboxylation has been attempted but these carboxylation reactions are limited to only a few pathways. In the case of styrene, dicarboxylation at the α- and β-positions is mostly observed with electrochemical carboxylation while site-selective hydrocarboxylations are hardly achieved. In this study, electrochemical β-selective hydrocarboxylation of styrene using CO 2 and water is developed, in which the site selectivity can be precisely controlled between β-hydrocarboxylation and dicarboxylation without the aid of homogeneous catalysts. In this platform, water is used as proton source in the β-hydrocarboxylation of styrene where its addition results in significant enhancement of the selectivity toward β-hydrocarboxylation. This work provides insights into new strategies for site-selectivity-controllable carboxylation with CO 2 using an electrochemical platform.},

Here, a pressure-driven 3D microfluidic chip is demonstrated with multiple logic Boolean functions. The presence and absence of fluid at the output of the gates represent the binary signals 1 and 0, respectively. Therefore, the logic gates do not require a specially functionalized liquid to operate. The chip is based on a multilevel of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based polymeric sheets with aligned microchannels while a flexible polyimide-based sheet with a cantilever-like structure is embedded to enable a one-directional flow of the liquid. Several Boolean logic functions are realized (AND, OR, and XOR) using different fluids in addition to a half adder digital microfluidic circuit. The outputs of the logic gates are designed to be at different heights within the 3D chip to enable different pressure drops. The results show that the logic gates are operational for a specific range of flow rates, which is dependent on the microchannel dimensions, surface roughness, and fluid viscosity and therefore on their hydraulic resistance. The demonstrated approach enables simple cascading of logic gates for large-scale microfluidic computing systems.},

The resultant MPNAs exhibit a typical core–shell heterostructure comprising aggregated OA-AuNPs as a plasmonic core surrounded by an assembled magnetic shell of OC-IONPs. Owing to the high loading of OA-AuNPs and reasonable spatial distribution of OC-IONPs, the resultant MPNAs exhibit highly retained magnetic–plasmonic activities simultaneously. Using the intrinsic dual functionality of MPNAs as a magnetic separator and a plasmonic signal transducer, it is demonstrated that the assembled MPNAs can achieve the simultaneous magnetic manipulation and optical detection on the lateral flow immunoassay platform after surface functionalization with recognition molecules. In conclusion, the core–shell-heterostructured MPNAs can serve as a nanoanalytical platform for the separation and concentration of target compounds from complex biological samples using magnetic properties and simultaneous optical sensing using plasmonic properties.},

  abstract     = {Strong optical excitation of plasmonic nanostructures may induce simultaneous interband and intraband electronic transitions. However, interaction mechanisms between interband, intraband, and plasmon-band processes have not been thoroughly understood. In particular, optical-heating-induced lattice expansion, which definitely leads to shift of the Fermi level, has not been taken into account in plasmonic studies. Here, it is shown that plasmonic bandedge shift is responsible for the optical modulation on the boundary between plasmonic electron oscillation and interband transitions via investigations on gold nanofilms and nanoparticles. Strong optical excitation induces transient depletion of the conduction band just below the Fermi level through intraband transitions, while the subsequent lattice heating induces transient thermal expansion and hence lowers the Fermi level. Both effects reduce the threshold for interband transitions and therefore push the plasmonic bandedge to the red. These discoveries introduce a first correlation between plasmonic response and optical excitation induced thermal expansion of lattices. The revealed Fermi-level adjustment mechanism allows alignment of electronic levels at the metal–semiconductor interfaces, which applies to all conductive materials and renders reliable physics for the design of plasmonic or optoelectronic devices.},

However, the poor ambient stability of black phosphorus limits its practical application, due to the chemical degradation of phosphorus atoms to phosphorus oxides in the presence of oxygen and/or water. Chemical functionalization is demonstrated as an efficient approach to enhance the ambient stability of BPNSs. Herein, various covalent strategies including radical addition, nitrene addition, nucleophilic substitution, and metal coordination are summarized. In addition, efficient noncovalent functionalization methods such as van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, and cation–π interactions are described in detail. Furthermore, the preparations, characterization, and diverse applications of functionalized BPNSs in various fields are recapped. The challenges faced and future directions for the chemical functionalization of BPNSs are also highlighted.},

  abstract     = {Clinical translation of cell-based products is hampered by their limited predictive in vivo performance. To overcome this hurdle, engineering strategies advocate to fabricate tissue products through processes that mimic development and regeneration, a strategy applicable for the healing of large bone defects, an unmet medical need. Natural fracture healing occurs through the formation of a cartilage intermediate, termed “soft callus,” which is transformed into bone following a process that recapitulates developmental events. The main contributors to the soft callus are cells derived from the periosteum, containing potent skeletal stem cells. Herein, cells derived from human periosteum are used for the scalable production of microspheroids that are differentiated into callus organoids. The organoids attain autonomy and exhibit the capacity to form ectopic bone microorgans in vivo. This potency is linked to specific gene signatures mimicking those found in developing and healing long bones. Furthermore, callus organoids spontaneously bioassemble in vitro into large engineered tissues able to heal murine critical-sized long bone defects. The regenerated bone exhibits similar morphological properties to those of native tibia. These callus organoids can be viewed as a living “bio-ink” allowing bottom-up manufacturing of multimodular tissues with complex geometric features and inbuilt quality attributes.},

These interface materials have demonstrated excellent performances in OSC devices. However, the limited resources, high-cost, and non-ecofriendly nature of petrochemical-based interface materials restrict their commercial applications. Here, a facile and effective approach to prepare cellulose and its derivatives as a cathode interface layer for OSCs with enhanced performance from rice straw of agroforestry residues is demonstrated. By employing this carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) into OSCs, a highly efficient inverted OSC is constructed, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.01% is realized using poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene))- alt -(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c: 4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione): 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1, 1-dicyanomethylene)-6/7-methyl)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d: 2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b: 5, 6-b′]dithiophene as the active layer, which shows over 9.4% improvement in PCE compared to that of a device without the CMC layer (PCE = 10.98%), especially the enhancement in short-circuit current. The improved current densities and PCEs are attributed to the reduced work function, enhanced absorption, and improved interfacial contact by using CMC and ZnO as co-interface. This approach of fabricating interface materials from biorenewable sources for OSCs is simple, scalable, and cost-effective, representing a promising direction for the development of smart interface and green electronics.},

Herein, the first in situ measurements of viscosity and density are reported across all the principal molten phases, relevant to their eventual crystalline structures. Bulk atomistic computer simulations confirm that thermophysical properties scale with the evolution of network substructures interpenetrating melts on the nanoscale. It is demonstrated that the glass transition temperature ( T g ) follows the eutectic profile of the liquidus temperature ( T m ), coinciding with the melting zone in cement production. The viscosity has been uniquely charted over 14 decades for each calcium-aluminate phase, projecting and justifying the different temperature zones used in cement manufacture. The fragile–strong phase transitions are revealed across all supercooled phases coinciding with heterogeneous nucleation close to 1.2 T g , where sintering and quenching occur in industrial-scale cement processing.},

However, there is a critical challenge in the pursuit of transparent windows that allow optical waves (wavelength of µm–nm) for transmitting while blocking microwave (wavelength of cm) in terms of absorbing electromagnetic energy, specifically for meeting the frequency requirement for the 5th generation (5G) mobile networks. For fundamentally establishing novel manipulatable microwave absorbing structures, here, new polymeric aqueous gels as both optically transparent materials and microwave absorbing materials are demonstrated, in which polar networks play significant roles in attenuating electromagnetic energy. By manipulating the hydrogen bonding networks, the resulting optically transparent solid-state gels are able to offer the capabilities for absorbing microwaves. Interestingly, such gels can be switched into an optically opaque state via converting the amorphous state into a polycrystal state when the temperature is decreased. Such ionic conductive gels can endow the assembled sandwich windows with effective microwave absorbing capability in the range of 15–40 GHz, covering a branch of 5G frequency bands. The results highlight a new strategy for using ionic conductive gels to design and fabricate manipulatable microwave stealth structures for various applications.},

Here, a film electrode based on dual-confined FeOOH QDs (FQDs) with superior pseudocapacitive behavior in a high-voltage ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte is put forward. In such a film electrode, FQDs are steadily dual-confined in a 2D heterogeneous nanospace supported by graphite carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) and Ti-MXene (Ti 3 C 2 ). Probing of potential-driven ion accumulation elucidates that strong adsorption occurs between the IL cation and the electrode surface with abundant active sites, providing sufficient redox reaction of FQDs in the film electrode. Furthermore, porous g-C 3 N 4 and conductive Ti 3 C 2 act as ion-accessible channels and charge-transfer pathways, respectively, endowing the FQDs-based film electrode with favorable electrochemical kinetics in the IL electrolyte. A high-voltage flexible SC (FSC) based on an ionogel electrolyte is fabricated, exhibiting a high energy density (77.12 mWh cm −3 ), a high power density, a remarkable rate capability, and long-term durability. Such an FSC can also be charged by harvesting sustainable energy and can effectively power various wearable and portable electronics.},

It is found that the catalytic activity of these oxides not only depends on the amounts of oxygen vacancies and metastable cations but also shows a significant influence from the local environment of the active sites, in particular, the symmetry of the oxygen vacancies. Based on the recent progress in the relevant fields, an “asymmetric oxygen vacancy site” is introduced, which indicates an oxygen vacancy with an asymmetric coordination of cations, making oxygen “easy come, easy go,” i.e., more reactive in redox reactions. The establishment of this new mechanism would shed light on the future investigation of the intrinsic active sites in oxide and oxide supported catalysts.},

A phototriggered thermogas-generating nanoreactor is designed via mesoporous silica layer coating on the surface of Nb 2 C MXene nanosheets, where the mesopores provide the reservoirs for NO donor (S-nitrosothiol (RSNO)), and the core of Nb 2 C produces heat shock upon second near-infrared biowindow (NIR-II) laser irradiation. The Nb 2 C–MSNs–SNO-enabled photonic thermogaseous therapy undergoes a sequential process of phototriggered heat production from the core of Nb 2 C and thermotriggered NO generation, together with photoacoustic-imaging (PAI) guidance and monitoring. The constructed Nb 2 C–MSNs–SNO nanoreactors exhibit high-NIR-induced photothermal effect, intense NIR-controlled NO release, and desirable PAI performance. Based on these unique theranostic properties of Nb 2 C–MSNs–SNO nanocomposites, sequential photonic thermogaseous therapy with limited systematic toxicity on efficiently suppressing tumor growth is achieved by PAI-guided NIR-controlled NO release as well as heat generation.

  abstract     = {The development of new materials for separating ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) from ethane (C 2 H 6 ) by adsorption is of great importance in the petrochemical industry, but remains very challenging owing to their close molecular sizes and physical properties. Using isoreticular chemistry in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) enables the precise design and construction of target materials with suitable aperture sizes and functional sites for gas separations. Herein, it is described that fine-tuning of pore size and π-complexation simultaneously in microporous copper(I)-chelated MOFs can remarkably boost the C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 adsorption selectivity. The judicious choice of organic linkers with a different number of carboxyl groups in the UiO-66 framework not only allows the fine tuning of the pore size but also immobilizes copper(I) ions onto the framework. The tailor-made adsorbent, Cu I @UiO-66-(COOH) 2 , thus possesses the optimal pore window size and chelated Cu(I) ions to form π-complexation with C 2 H 4 molecules. It can rapidly adsorb C 2 H 4 driven by the strong π-complexation interactions, while effectively reducing C 2 H 6 uptake due to the selective size-sieving. Therefore, this material exhibits an ultrahigh C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 selectivity (80.8), outperforming most previously described benchmark materials. The exceptional separation performance of Cu I @UiO-66-(COOH) 2 is validated by breakthrough experiments for 50/50 v/v C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 mixtures under ambient conditions.},

It is a promising strategy to couple highly active precious metals with transition metals as efficient electrocatalysts, which can not only effectively reduce the cost of the preparation procedure, but also greatly improve the performance of catalysts through a synergistic effect. Herein, Ru and Ni nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (RuNi-NCNFs) are synthesized via a simple electrospinning technology with a subsequent carbonization process. The as-formed RuNi-NCNFs represent excellent Pt-like electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both alkaline and acidic conditions. Furthermore, the RuNi-NCNFs also exhibit an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 290 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline electrolyte. Strikingly, owing to both the HER and OER performance, an electrolyzer with RuNi-NCNFs as both the anode and cathode catalysts requires only a cell voltage of 1.564 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in an alkaline medium, which is lower than the benchmark of Pt/C||RuO 2 electrodes.

The reflectance increases rapidly with decreasing photon energy indicating free-electron metallic behavior with a plasma edge in the visible spectral range at high temperatures. The reflectance spectra also suggest much longer electronic collision time (≥1 fs) than previously inferred, implying that metallic hydrogen at the conditions studied is not in the regime of saturated conductivity (Mott–Ioffe–Regel limit).

  abstract     = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive and memory loss. The vicious circle between dysfunctional microglia and amyloid-β (Aβ) is a crucial pathological event and accelerates the progression of AD. Herein, a zwitterionic poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB)-based nanoparticle (MCPZFS NP) with normalizing the dysfunctional microglia and Aβ recruitment is established for the treatment of AD. Compared with the neural polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based nanoparticles (MEPZFS NPs), the MCPZFS NPs significantly alleviate the priming of microglia by decreasing the level of proinflammatory mediators and promoting the secretion of BDNF. Most importantly, quite different from PEG, the PCB-based NPs exhibit the behavior to recruit Aβ into microglia, which significantly enhances the Aβ phagocytosis. Moreover, the Aβ degradation is changed from the conventional lysosomal/autophagy to the proteasomal pathway in the presence of MCPZFS NPs. After the treatment with MCPZFS NPs, the Aβ burden, neuron damages, memory deficits, and neuroinflammation of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice are significantly attenuated in the brain. Therefore, the PCB-based MCPZFS NPs have great potential to serve as an “Aβ cleaner” and provide a new insight into the therapeutic strategy for AD therapy.},

  abstract     = {The residual of malignant tumor cells and lack of bone-tissue integration are the two critical concerns of bone-tumor recurrence and surgical failure. In this work, the rational integration of 2D Ti 3 C 2 MXene is reported with 3D-printing bioactive glass (BG) scaffolds for achieving concurrent bone-tumor killing by photonic hyperthermia and bone-tissue regeneration by bioactive scaffolds. The designed composite scaffolds take the unique feature of high photothermal conversion of integrated 2D Ti 3 C 2 MXene for inducing bone-tumor ablation by near infrared-triggered photothermal hyperthermia, which has achieved the complete tumor eradication on in vivo bone-tumor xenografts. Importantly, the rational integration of 2D Ti 3 C 2 MXene is demonstrated to efficiently accelerate the in vivo growth of newborn bone tissue of the composite BG scaffolds. The dual functionality of bone-tumor killing and bone-tissue regeneration makes these Ti 3 C 2 MXene-integrated composite scaffolds highly promising for the treatment of bone tumors, which also substantially broadens the biomedical applications of 2D MXenes in tissue engineering, especially on the treatment of bone tumors.},

As-prepared Pt 3 In/C exhibits a mass activity of 0.71 mA mg −1 and a specific area activity of 0.91 mA cm −2 at 0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, which are 4.1 and 2.7 times the corresponding values of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The as-prepared ordered Pt 3 In/C catalyst is also remarkably stable with negligible activity and structural decay after 20 000 accelerated electrochemical durability cycles, due to its ordered structure. Density-functional-theory calculations demonstrate that ordered-Pt 3 In is more energetically favorable for ORR than the commercial Pt/C catalysts because ∆ G O is closer to the peak of the volcano plot after ordered incorporation of indium atoms.},

For the difficulties in observing the dynamic aggregation and oligomerization process of mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) in vivo, the evaluation of potential drugs at the molecular protein level is usually restricted. By combing lifetime-based fluorescence microscopies and biophysical tools, it is showcased that a designed amphiphilic peptide, which targets the mHtt at an early stage, can perturb the oligomer assembly process nanoscopically, suppress the amyloid property of mHtt, conformationally transform the oligomers and/or aggregates of mHtt, and ameliorate mHtt-induced neurological damage and aggregation in cell and HD mouse models. It is also found that this amphiphilic peptide is able to transport to the brain and rescue the memory deficit through intranasal administration, indicating its targeting specificity in vivo. In summary, a biophotonic platform is provided to investigate the oligomerization/aggregation process in detail that offers insight into the design and effect of a targeted therapeutic agent for Huntington&#39;s disease.},

So far, this volumetric change is limited to 40% and 100% for reversible and irreversible systems, respectively, thus restricting potential applications of this technology. A conjugated polymer that reversibly expands by about 300% upon addressing, relative to its previous contracted state, while the first irreversible actuation can achieve values ranging from 1000–10 000%, depending on the voltage applied is reported. From experimental and theoretical studies, it is found that this large and reversible volumetric switching is due to reorganization of the polymer during swelling as it transforms between a solid-state phase and a gel, while maintaining percolation for conductivity. The polymer is utilized as an electroactive cladding to reduce the void sizes of a porous carbon filter electrode by 85%.},

The present work explores the tunability of pH sensitivity by the synergy of surface charge and molecular dipole moment induced by interfacial proton interactions. This synergy is demonstrated on a silicon-nanoribbon field-effect transistor (SiNR-FET) by functionalizing the sensor surface with properly designed chromophore molecules. The chromophore molecules can interact with protons and lead to appreciable changes in interface dipole moment as well as in surface charge state. In addition, the dipole moment can be tuned not only by the substituent on the chromophore but also by the anion in the electrolyte interacting with the protonated chromophore. By designing surface molecules to enhance the surface dipole moment upon protonation, an above-Nernstian pH sensitivity is achieved on the SiNR-FET sensor. This finding may bring an innovative strategy for tailoring the sensitivity of the SiNR-FET-based pH sensor toward a wide range of applications.},

  abstract     = {Targeting T-cells against cancer cells is a direct means of treating cancer, and has already shown great responses in clinical treatment of B-cell malignancies. A simple way to redirect T-cells to cancer cells is by using multispecific antibody (MsAb) that contains different arms for specifically “grabbing” the T-cells and cancer cells; as such, the T-cells are activated upon target engagement and the killing begins. Here, a nucleic acid mediated protein–protein assembly (NAPPA) approach is implemented to construct a MsAb for T-cell engaging and tumor killing. Anti -CD19 and -CD3 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) are conjugated to different l -DNAs with sequences that form the Holliday junction, thus allowing spontaneous assembly of homogeneous protein–DNA oligomers containing two anti-CD19 and one anti-CD3 scFvs. The new MsAb shows strong efficacy in inducing Raji tumor cell cytotoxicity in the presence of T-cells with EC 50 ≈ 0.2 × 10 −9 m ; it also suppresses tumor growth in a Raji xenograft mouse model. The data indicates that MsAbs assembled from protein–DNA conjugates are effective macromolecules for directing T-cells for tumor killing. The modular nature of the NAPPA platform allows rapid generation of complex MsAbs from simple antibody fragments, while offering a general solution for preparing antibodies with high-order specificity.},

Using the developed technique and materials, high-precision and highly sensitive patient-specific wearable active or passive devices are fabricated for personalized health monitoring. The fabricated biosensors show low density and substantial flexibility because of 3D microcellular network-type interconnected conductive materials that are readily printed using an inkjet head. Using high-resolution 3D scanned body-shape data, on-demand personalized wearable sensors made of the 3D-printed soft and conductive materials are fabricated. These sensors successfully detect both actively changing body strain signals and passively changing signals such as electromyography (EMG), electrodermal activity (EDA), and electroencephalogram EEG. The accurately tailored subject-specific shape of the developed sensors exhibits higher sensitivity and faster real-time sensing performances in the monitoring of rapidly changing human body signals. The newly developed 3D printing technique and materials can be widely applied to various types of wearable, flexible, and light-weight biosensors for use in a variety of inexpensive on-demand and personalized point-of-care diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Accurate determination of the intrinsic electronic structure of thermoelectric materials is a prerequisite for utilizing an electronic band engineering strategy to improve their thermoelectric performance. Herein, with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), the intrinsic electronic structure of the 3D half-Heusler thermoelectric material ZrNiSn is revealed. An unexpectedly large intrinsic bandgap is directly observed by ARPES and is further confirmed by electrical and optical measurements and first-principles calculations. Moreover, a large anisotropic conduction band with an anisotropic factor of 6 is identified by ARPES and attributed to be one of the most important reasons leading to the high thermoelectric performance of ZrNiSn. These successful findings rely on the grown high-quality single crystals, which have fewer Ni interstitial defects and negligible in-gap states on the electronic structure. This work demonstrates a realistic paradigm to investigate the electronic structure of 3D solid materials by using ARPES and provides new insights into the intrinsic electronic structure of the half-Heusler system benefiting further optimization of thermoelectric performance.},

  abstract     = {Exploring cost-effective and high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of paramount importance for the advancement of H 2 production technology, yet remains a huge challenge. Herein, a simple electrospinning–pyrolysis strategy is developed to directly immobilize uniform Ni 3 Co nanoparticles into a hierarchical branched architecture constructed by in situ formed N-doped carbon-nanotube-grafted carbon nanofibers. The elaborate construction of such hybrid hierarchical architecture can effectively modulate the electronic structure of the active sites, enlarge the exposure of active sites, and facilitate the electron transfer and mass diffusion, favoring both the HER and OER. As a result, the optimized catalyst requires relatively low overpotentials of 114 and 243 mV for HER and OER, respectively, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm −2 in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. When employed as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the resultant catalyst shows a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm −2 , along with an impressive stability without noticeable attenuation even after 27 h. This work presents a successful demonstration in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of Ni-based bifunctional electrocatalysts by simultaneously considering modulation of electronic structure, hybridization with carbon substrate, and nanostructuring through a facile synthetic strategy, which provides a new avenue to the design of a rich variety of robust transition-metal-based electrocatalysts for large-scale water electrolysis.},

However, applying imaging modalities for the prognosis of RA remains challenging, because no tissue-specific guidelines are available to monitor the progressive course of RA. In this study, fluorometric imaging of RA is reported using bioengineered targeted agents of the blood vessel, bone, and cartilage in combination with the customized optical fluorescence imaging system. Separate but simultaneous tissue-specific images of synovitis, cartilage destruction, and bone resorption are obtained from a mouse model of RA, which allows quantification of the prognosis of diseases at each stage. Thus, the fluorometric imaging of RA by using tissue-specific contrast agents plays a key role in the systemic treatment of RA by monitoring structural damage and disease progression.},

However, it is very challenging to deliver miRNAs directly, which leads to inactivation, low transfection efficiency, and short half-life. Here, Agomir is loaded in hydrogel to construct a gene-hydrogel microenvironment for regulating the synthesis/catabolism balance of the tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) to treat degenerative diseases. Agomir is a cholesterol-, methylation-, and phosphorothioate-modified miRNA, which can mimic the function of miRNA to regulate the expression of the target gene. Agomir874 that mimics miRNA874 is synthesized to down regulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in nucleus pulposus (NP). At the same time, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel is synthesized through Ag-S coordination of 4-arm PEG-SH and silver ion solution, which has injectable, self-healing, antimicrobial, degradable, and superabsorbent properties and matches perfectly with the mechanism of intervertebral disk. By delivering Agomir-loaded PEG-hydrogel to a degenerative intervertebral disk, a gene-hydrogel microenvironment is constructed in situ, which reduces the expression of MMPs, regulates the synthesis/catabolism balance of ECM in the NP of the intervertebral disk, and improves the tissue microenvironment regeneration.},

In this work, a nonleaching antibacterial concept is demonstrated by fabricating 2D nanoflakes in situ on magnesium (Mg). Different from the conventional antibacterial mechanisms that depend on Mg 2+ release and pH increase, the nanoflakes exert mechanical tension onto the bacteria membranes to destroy microorganisms on contact and produce intracellular stress via physical interactions, which is also revealed by computational simulations. Moreover, the nanoflake layer decelerates the corrosion process resulting in mitigated Mg 2+ release, weaker alkalinity in the vicinity, and less hydrogen evolution, in turn inducing less inflammatory reactions and ensuring the biocompatibility as confirmed by the in vivo study. In this way, bacteria are killed by a mechanical process causing very little side effects. This work provides information and insights pertaining to the design of multifunctional biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Ruthenium complexes are promising photosensitizers (PSs), but their clinical applications have many limitations. Here, a multifunctional nano-platform PDA-Pt-CD@RuFc formed by platinum-decorated and cyclodextrin ( CD )-modified polydopamine ( PDA ) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with a ferrocene-appended ruthenium complex ( RuFc ) is reported. The NPs can successfully deliver RuFc to the tumor sites. The release of RuFc from the NPs can be triggered by low pH, photothermal heating, and H 2 O 2 . The combined photodynamic and photothermal therapy (PDT-PTT) mediated by PDA-Pt-CD@RuFc NPs can overcome the hypoxic environment of tumors from several aspects. First, the platinum NPs can catalyze H 2 O 2 to produce O 2 . Second, vasodilation caused by photothermal heating can sustain the oxygen supplement. Third, PDT exerted by RuFc can also occur through the non-oxygen-dependent Fenton reaction. Due to the presence of PDA , platinum NPs, and RuFc , the nanosystem can be used in multimodal imaging including photothermal, photoacoustic, and computed tomography imaging. The NPs can be excited by the near-infrared two-photon light source. Moreover, the combined treatment can improve the tumor microenvironments to obtain an optimized combined therapeutic effect. In summary, this study presents a tumor-microenvironment-adaptive strategy to optimize the potential of ruthenium complexes as PSs from multiple aspects.},

However, dissatisfactory device performance and high processing temperature impede their development for viable applications. Herein, a facile route is presented for tuning the energy levels and electrical properties of sol–gel-derived ZnO electron transport material (ETM) via the doping of a classical alkali metal carbonate Cs 2 CO 3 . Compared to bare ZnO, Cs 2 CO 3 -doped ZnO possesses more favorable interface energetics in contact with the CsPbI 2 Br perovskite layer, which can reduce the ohmic loss to a negligible level. The optimized PeSCs achieve an improved open-circuit voltage of 1.28 V, together with an increase in fill factor and short-circuit current. The optimized power conversion efficiencies of 16.42% and 14.82% are realized on rigid glass substrate and flexible plastic substrate, respectively. A high thermostability can be simultaneously obtained via defect passivation at the Cs 2 CO 3 -doped ZnO/CsPbI 2 Br interface, and 81% of the initial efficiency is retained after aging for 200 h at 85 °C.},

However, due to fiber-electrodes with compact internal microstructure and less porosity, MSCs usually display a low energy density. Here, an innovative microfluidic strategy is proposed to design ordered porous and anisotropic core–shell fibers based on nickel oxide arrays/graphene nanomaterials. Owing to the homogeneous microchannels reaction, the graphene core maintains a uniformly anisotropic porous structure, and the nickel oxide shell keeps steadily vertically aligned nanosheets. The MSC presents an ultrahigh energy density (120.3 µWh cm −2 ) and large specific capacitance (605.9 mF cm −2 ). This higher performance originates from the microfluidic-architected core–shell fiber with abundant ionic channels (plentiful micro-/mesopores), large specific-surface-area (425.6 m 2 g −1 ), higher electrical conductivity (176.6 S cm −1 ), and sufficient redox activity, facilitating ions with quicker diffusion and greater accumulation. Considering those outstanding properties, a wearable self-powered system, converting and storing solar energy into electric energy, is designed to light up displays. This microfluidic strategy offers an effective way to design new structural materials, which will advance the development of next-generation wearable/smart industries.},

Strong nucleophiles, such as oximes, have been used as therapeutic reactivators of cholinesterase-organophosphate complexes, but suffer from short half-lives and limited efficacy across the broad spectrum of organophosphate nerve agents. Cholinesterases have been used as long-lived therapeutic bioscavengers for unreacted organophosphates with limited success because they react with organophosphate nerve agents with one-to-one stoichiometries. The chemical power of nucleophilic reactivators is coupled to long-lived bioscavengers by designing and synthesizing cholinesterase-polymer-oxime conjugates using atom transfer radical polymerization and azide-alkyne “click” chemistry. Detailed kinetic studies show that butyrylcholinesterase-polymer-oxime activity is dependent on the electrostatic properties of the polymers and the amount of oxime within the conjugate. The covalent coupling of oxime-containing polymers to the surface of butyrylcholinesterase slows the rate of inactivation of paraoxon, a model nerve agent. Furthermore, when the enzyme is covalently inhibited by paraoxon, the covalently attached oxime induced inter- and intramolecular reactivation. Intramolecular reactivation will open the door to the generation of a new class of nerve agent scavengers that couple the speed and selectivity of biology to the ruggedness and simplicity of synthetic chemicals.},

Consistently, Raman spectroscopy reveals a systematic shift of the low-frequency Raman modes of rubrene to higher (lower) frequencies with compressive (tensile) strain, which is indicative of a reduction (enhancement) of thermal molecular disorder in the crystal with strain.

  abstract     = {Generation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) via cell expansion or cell reprogramming has been widely achieved by overexpression of transcription factors. Herein, it is reported that without introducing exogenous genes, mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into hemogenic cells based on lineage tracing analysis, which further develop into hematopoietic cells, by treatment of cocktails of chemical compounds. The chemical cocktails also reprogram differentiated hematopoietic cells back into HSPC-like cells. Most importantly, the chemical cocktails enabling hematopoietic reprogramming robustly promote HSPC proliferation ex vivo. The expanded HSPCs acquire enhanced capacity of hematopoietic reconstruction in vivo. Single-cell sequencing analysis verifies the expansion of HSPCs and the cell reprogramming toward potential generation of HSPCs at the same time by the chemical cocktail treatment. Thus, the proof-of-concept findings not only demonstrate that hematopoietic reprogramming can be achieved by chemical compounds but also provide a promising strategy for acquisition of HSPCs by chemical cocktail-enabled double effects.},

  abstract     = {Breast tumor initiating cells (BTICs) with ALDH + CD24 − CD44 + phenotype are the most tumorigenic and invasive cell population in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Here, it is found that a negative immune regulator interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL1R2) is upregulated in breast cancer (BC) tissues and especially in BTICs. BC patients with high IL1R2 expression have a poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival. High IL1R2 promotes BTIC self-renewal and BC cell proliferation and invasion. Mechanistically, IL1R2 is activated by IL1β, as demonstrated by the fact that IL1β induces the release of IL1R2 intracellular domain (icd-IL1R2) and icd-IL1R2 then interacts with the deubiquitinase USP15 at the UBL2 domain and promotes its activity, which finally induces BMI1 deubiquitination at lysine 81 and stabilizes BMI1 protein. In addition, IL1R2 neutralizing antibody can suppress the protein expression of both IL1R2 and BMI1, and significantly abrogates the promoting effect of IL1R2 on BTIC self-renewal and BC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. The current results indicate that blocking IL1R2 with neutralizing antibody provides a therapeutic approach to inhibit BC progression by targeting BTICs.},

  abstract     = {The bottom-up construction of synthetic cells with user-defined chemical organization holds considerable promise in the creation of bioinspired materials. Complex emulsions, droplet networks, and nested vesicles all represent platforms for the engineering of segregated chemistries with controlled communication, analogous to biological cells. Microfluidic manufacture of such droplet-based materials typically results in radial or axisymmetric structures. In contrast, biological cells frequently display chemical polarity or gradients, which enable the determination of directionality, and inform higher-order interactions. Here, a dual-material, 3D-printing methodology to produce microfluidic architectures that enable the construction of functional, asymmetric, hierarchical, emulsion-based artificial cellular chassis is developed. These materials incorporate droplet networks, lipid membranes, and nanoparticle components. Microfluidic 3D-channel arrangements enable symmetry-breaking and the spatial patterning of droplet hierarchies. This approach can produce internal gradients and hemispherically patterned, multilayered shells alongside chemical compartmentalization. Such organization enables incorporation of organic and inorganic components, including lipid bilayers, within the same entity. In this way, functional polarization, that imparts individual and collective directionality on the resulting artificial cells, is demonstrated. This approach enables exploitation of polarity and asymmetry, in conjunction with compartmentalized and networked chemistry, in single and higher-order organized structures, thereby increasing the palette of functionality in artificial cellular materials.},

  abstract     = {Assembling nanomaterials into hybrid structures provides a promising and flexible route to reach ultrahigh responsivity by introducing a trap-assisted gain ( G ) mechanism. However, the high-gain photodetectors benefitting from long carrier lifetime often possess slow response time ( t ) due to the inherent G – t tradeoff. Here, a light-driven junction field-effect transistor (LJFET), consisting of an n-type ZnO belt as the channel material and a p-type WSe 2 nanosheet as a photoactive gate material, to break the G – t tradeoff through decoupling the gain from carrier lifetime is reported. The photoactive gate material WSe 2 under illumination enables a conductive path for externally applied voltage, which modulates the depletion region within the ZnO channel efficiently. The gain and response time are separately determined by the field effect modulation and the switching speed of LJFET. As a result, a high responsivity of 4.83 × 10 3 A W −1 with a gain of ≈10 4 and a rapid response time of ≈10 µs are obtained simultaneously. The LJFET architecture offers a new approach to realize high-gain and fast-response photodetectors without the G – t tradeoff.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen redox catalysis, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is crucial in determining the electrochemical performance of energy conversion and storage devices such as fuel cells, metal–air batteries,and electrolyzers. The rational design of electrochemical catalysts replaces the traditional trial-and-error methods and thus promotes the R&amp;D process. Identifying descriptors that link structure and activity as well as selectivity of catalysts is the key for rational design. In the past few decades, two types of descriptors including bulk- and surface-based have been developed to probe the structure–property relationships. Correlating the current descriptors to one another will promote the understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry, triggering further development of more universal descriptors for the future design of electrocatalysts. Herein, the current benchmark activity descriptors for oxygen electrocatalysis as well as their applications are reviewed. Particular attention is paid to circumventing the scaling relationship of oxygen-containing intermediates. For hybrid materials, multiple descriptors will show stronger predictive power by considering more factors such as interface reconstruction, confinement effect, multisite adsorption, etc. Machine learning and high-throughput simulations can thus be crucial in assisting the discovery of new multiple descriptors and reaction mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The interaction of electrons with strong electromagnetic fields is fundamental to the ability to design high-quality radiation sources. At the core of all such sources is a tradeoff between compactness and higher output radiation intensities. Conventional photonic devices are limited in size by their operating wavelength, which helps compactness at the cost of a small interaction area. Here, plasmonic modes supported by multilayer graphene metamaterials are shown to provide a larger interaction area with the electron beam, while also tapping into the extreme confinement of graphene plasmons to generate high-frequency photons with relatively low-energy electrons available from tabletop sources. For 5 MeV electrons, a metamaterial of 50 layers and length 50 µm, and a beam current of 1.7 µA, it is, for instance, possible to generate X-rays of intensity 1.5 × 10 7 photons sr −1 s −1 1%BW, 580 times more than for a single-layer design. The frequency of the driving laser dynamically tunes the photon emission spectrum. This work demonstrates a unique free-electron light source, wherein the electron mean free path in a given material is longer than the device length, relaxing the requirements of complex electron beam systems and potentially paving the way to high-yield, compact, and tunable X-ray sources.},

However, such materials are extremely rare. Here, a room-temperature FMI is achieved in ultrathin La 0.9 Ba 0.1 MnO 3 films grown on SrTiO 3 substrates via an interface proximity effect. Detailed scanning transmission electron microscopy images clearly demonstrate that MnO 6 octahedral rotations in La 0.9 Ba 0.1 MnO 3 close to the interface are strongly suppressed. As determined from in situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, O K -edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory, the realization of the FMI state arises from a reduction of Mn e g bandwidth caused by the quenched MnO 6 octahedral rotations. The emerging FMI state in La 0.9 Ba 0.1 MnO 3 together with necessary coherent interface achieved with the perovskite substrate gives very high potential for future high performance electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Liquid-like materials are one family of promising thermoelectric materials discovered in the past years due to their advantanges of ultrahigh thermoelectric figure of merit ( zT ), low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, their practial applications are greatly limited by the low service stability from the Cu/Ag metal deposition under large current and/or temperature gradient. Both high zT for high efficiency and large critical voltage for good stability are required for liquid-like materials, but they are usually strongly correlated and hard to be tuned individually. Herein, based on the thermodynamic analysis, it is shown that such a correlation can be decoupled through doping immobile ions into the liquid-like sublattice. Taking Cu 2− δ S as an example, doping immobile Fe ions in Cu 1.90 S scarcely degrades the initial large critical voltage, but significantly enhances the zT to 1.5 at 1000 K by tuning the carrier concentration to the optimal range. Combining the low-cost and environmentally friendly features, these Fe-doped Cu 2− δ S-based compounds show great potential in civil applications. This study sheds light on the realization of both good stability and high performance for many other liquid-like thermoelectric materials that have not been considered for real applications before.},

As microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in osteogenesis and bone regeneration, it would be meaningful to elucidate the roles of miRNAs in the intracellular signaling cascade of topographical cue-induced osteogenic differentiation. In this study, the miRNA expression profile of the topographical feature-induced osteogenic differentiation group is different from that of the chemical-factors-induced osteogenic differentiation group. miR-193a-3p is sensitive to substrate topographical features and its downregulation enhances osteogenic differentiation only in the absence of osteogenesis−inducing medium. Also, substrate topographical features specifically activate a nonclassical osteogenetic pathway—the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that miR-193a-3p regulates the MAPK pathway by targeting the MAP3k3 gene. In conclusion, this data indicates that different osteogenic-lineage-related intracellular signaling cascades are triggered in BMSCs subjected to biophysical or chemical stimulation. Moreover, the miR-193a-3p-MAP3k3 signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the transduction of biophysical cues from the substrate to regulate the osteogenic lineage specification of BMSCs, and hence may be a promising molecular target for bone regenerative therapies.},

Here, TRIM14 is identified as a novel positive regulator of the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway. TRIM14 promotes noncanonical NF-κB activation by targeting p100/p52 in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a mechanistic study shows that TRIM14 recruits deubiquitinase USP14 to cleave the K63-linked ubiquitin chains of p100/p52 at multiple sites, thereby preventing p100/p52 from cargo receptor p62-mediated autophagic degradation. TRIM14 deficiency in mice significantly impairs noncanonical NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses as well as acute colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer development. Taken together, these findings establish the TRIM14-USP14 axis as a crucial checkpoint that controls noncanonical NF-κB signaling and highlight the crosstalk between autophagy and innate immunity.},

The EAC-NPs specifically target APCs and subsequently result in enhanced T cell responses and improved antitumor efficacy. Mechanistic studies reveal that the EAC-NPs enhance and prolong the presence of immune compounds in APCs, which ensure persistent antigen loading and stimulation, induce a rapid proliferation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and significantly increase the ratios of intratumoral CD4 + T/T reg and CD8 + T/T reg .

Here, a new approach to prepare a class of intermetallic hexagonal PtBi nanoplates with superior tolerance over chemical fuels for boosting oxygen reduction catalysis is reported. The time-dependent morphology studies reveal that the well-defined hexagonal PtBi nanoplates are transformed from a new reaction immediate (triangular/truncated triangular bismuth oxides nanoplates). Different from conventional Pt-based catalysts, the hexagonal PtBi nanoplates exhibit much improved tolerance over CH 3 OH, HCOOH, and CO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that the charge displacement resulting from Pt–Bi bonding is the main factor in enhancing the tolerance. The PtBi nanoplates also exhibit much higher ORR activity than all the reported PtBi nanoparticles. Considering their exceptional antipoisoning ability and high activity, these hexagonal nanoplates show great potential in the development of commercial fuel cells.},
