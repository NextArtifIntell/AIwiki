In this work, the discontinuity layout optimization (DLO) is utilized to simulate a stable blocky system structure under static and pseudostatic loading by considering soil–structure interaction effects. The program refers to the discretization of the system under consideration by utilizing the potential slip lines to connect nodes. Then, linear programming is applied to identify the critical layout. The DLO procedure is extended to mimic rotations in the approximate simulation of rotational and translational failures along boundaries, thus simulating the mechanism on the rotating block. The simulated failure mechanism and collapse load are consistent with the experimental observations and numerical modeling results. Furthermore, the procedure is applied to two potential practical applications: the stability analysis of a jointed rock slope and concrete masonry retaining wall. The results show that the DLO is a simple but scientific method for identifying the mechanism of the critical failure of blocky structures.},

  abstract     = {Contact detection significantly affects the computational efficiency of discrete element simulations, especially for irregularly shaped elements. The dilated polyhedron is constructed by the Minkowski sum of a dilated sphere and a core convex polyhedron. One of the greatest advantages of using the dilated polyhedron in contact detection lies in its ability to be solved by calculating the nearest distance between corresponding core polyhedra. The approximate envelope function (AEF) of a dilated polyhedron is formed by the weighted summation of the second-order dilated function of the polyhedral and spherical functions. The AEF can be used to represent the element in the optimization model for the contact center. Geometric calculations are then employed for the contact points on the core polyhedron, whereupon the contact detection is solved. The accuracy and stability of the proposed method by a 3-D Voronoi tessellation are validated using analytical solutions and previously published simulation results. The efficiency tests show that the speedup of the CPU-based multithread algorithm can reach 14 on a desktop. The direct shear test of the Voronoi shaped ballast is analyzed by this method. The shear stress under different vertical pressure is compared with previously published experimental and simulated results.},

The micro- and macro-scales of a composite material are integrated by introducing an adaptive microstructure representation. Then, the far and local fields are simultaneously computed using the equation of motion, which satisfies the boundary conditions between the two fields. Cohesive surface elements are dynamically inserted where and when needed, and the Park-Paulino-Roesler cohesive model is employed to approximate nonlinear fracture processes in a local field. A topology-based data structure is utilized to efficiently handle adjacency information during mesh modification events. The efficiency and validity of the proposed computational framework are demonstrated by checking the energy balances and comparing the results of the proposed computation with direct computations. Furthermore, the effects of microstructural properties, such as interfacial bonding strength and unit cell arrangement, on the dynamic fracture behavior are investigated. The computational results demonstrate that local crack patterns depend on the combination of microstructural properties such as unit cell arrangement and interfacial bonding strength; therefore, the microstructure of a material should be carefully considered for dynamic cohesive fracture investigations.},

A fully implicit scheme is developed using a hierarchical approximation of the boundary element matrix. Combined with an adequate block preconditioner, this allows to tackle large problems via the use of an iterative solver for the solution of the tangent system. Several two-dimensional examples of the initiation and growth of shear-bands and tensile fractures illustrate the capabilities and accuracy of this technique. The method does not exhibit any mesh dependency associated with localization provided that (i) the softening length-scale is resolved and (ii) the plane of localized deformations is discretized a priori using DD segments.},

A DEM-based method for predicting the wear evolution of structural boundary has been developed for computational efficiency. The structural boundary subjected to wear is represented by the spherical boundary elements in the DEM simulation in combination with the inside triangles and fitting curved surface in wear prediction. Wear prediction is performed through a series of evolution steps. In each evolution step, the collision energies by particles at structural boundary are collected via the DEM simulation and assigned to the boundary elements. Then, the volume losses of structural boundary are predicted across each relevant boundary element. Finally, the new geometry of structural boundary in response to wear is described by moving the boundary elements along the depths of wear individually. Through converting the contact detection between structural boundary and particles into between spherical boundary elements and particles, our method greatly reduces the computational cost in the DEM simulation. Through two numerical tests, our method has been verified to be an efficient and accurate method for the wear prediction of structural boundaries with different resolutions.},

It builds upon previous methods of applying POD to the angular dimension, with modifications to increase accuracy and solver stability. Previous methods used continuous global functions spanning the whole sphere. The new approach, discontinuous POD (DPOD), partitions the surface of the sphere into angular regions, each with an independent set of POD basis functions. Combined, these can approximate flux distributions which span the sphere using optimized basis functions for each angular region. In addition, a novel implementation of adaptive angular resolution known as adaptive discontinuous POD (ADPOD) is presented, which allows the number of DPOD basis functions to vary by angular octant and spatial element. DPOD and ADPOD are applied to two problems in order to demonstrate their benefits compared with POD. Both are shown to reduce the number of solver iterations required to find a solution and decrease the error in the angular flux.},

This element is free of shape functions and shear locking. The C 1 -continuity requirements of deflection and rotation functions are accomplished by a fourth-order differential quadrature (DQ)-based geometric mapping scheme, which facilitates the conversion of the displacement parameters at Gauss-Lobatto quadrature (GLQ) points into those at element nodes. The appropriate application of DQ rule to non-rectangular domains is proceeded by the natural-to-Cartesian geometric mapping technique. Using GLQ and DQ rules, we discretize the total potential energy functional of a generic micro-plate element into a function of nodal displacement parameters. Then, we adopt the principle of minimum potential energy to determine element stiffness matrix, mass matrix, and load vector. The efficacy of the present element is validated through several examples associated with the static bending and free vibration problems of rectangular, annular sectorial, and elliptical micro-plates. Finally, the developed element is applied to study the behavior of freely vibrating moderately thick micro-plates with irregular shapes. It is shown that our element has better convergence and adaptability than that of Bogner-Fox-Schmit (BFS) one, and strain gradient effects can cause a significant increase in vibration frequencies and a certain change in vibration mode shapes.},

The coupling strategy for these two methods is based on the consistent conditions with respect to displacement, velocity, and force, respectively, on the interface between fluid and solid parts, including the unified interpolation bounce-back scheme for curved boundaries, the Galilean invariant momentum exchange method for hydrodynamic forces, the force imposing strategy particularly for massive deformation, and the refilling algorithm for moving boundaries. There is no remeshing operation needed in the proposed LBMPM for both solid and fluid parts even when solid massive deformation and fluid complex flow are considered.

The proposed method makes use of slender structural elements for the plies, a compatible formulation with adaptive higher-order integration for the CEs, and the corotational formulation for geometrically nonlinear analysis.

  abstract     = {In virtue of their intrinsic integro-differential formulation of underlying physical behavior of materials, discontinuous computational methods are more beneficial over continuum-mechanics-based approaches for materials failure modeling and simulation. However, application of most discontinuous methods is limited to elastic/brittle materials, which is partially due to their formulations are based on force and displacement rather than stress and strain measures as are the cases for continuous approaches. In this article, we formulate a nonlocal maximum distortion energy criterion in the framework of a lattice particle model for modeling of elastoplastic materials. Similar to the maximum distortion energy criterion in continuum mechanics, the basic idea is to decompose the energy of a discrete material point into dilatational and distortional components, and plastic yielding of bonds associated with this material point is assumed to occur only when the distortional component reaches a critical value. However, the formulated yield criterion is nonlocal since the energy of a material point depends on the deformation of all the bonds associated with this material point. Formulation of equivalent strain hardening rules for the nonlocal yield model was also developed. Compared to theoretical and numerical solutions of several benchmark problems, the proposed formulation can accurately predict both the stress-strain curves and the deformation fields under monotonic loading and cyclic loading with different strain hardening cases.},

Inspired by a structure-preserving family of variational integrators, our new formulation relies on a discrete balance equation that establishes the dynamic equilibrium. From this point of departure, we first derive an “exact” discrete-continuous nonlinear optimization problem that works directly with data sets. We then develop this formulation further into an “approximate” nonlinear optimization problem that relies on a general constitutive model. This underlying model can be identified from a data set in an offline phase. To showcase the advantages of our framework, we specialize our methodology to the case of a geometrically exact beam formulation that makes use of all elements of our approach. We investigate three numerical examples of increasing difficulty that demonstrate the excellent computational behavior of the proposed framework and motivate future research in this direction.},

A key feature of the method is a greedy algorithm repeatedly scanning the training set, a fine discretization of the parameter domain, to identify the next dimension of the parameter-induced solution manifold along which we expand the surrogate solution space. Although successfully applied to problems with fairly high parametric dimensions, the challenge is that this scanning cost dominates the offline cost due to it being proportional to the cardinality of the training set which is exponential with respect to the parameter dimension. In this work, we review three recent attempts in effectively delaying this curse of dimensionality, and propose two new hybrid strategies through successive refinement and multilevel maximization of the error estimate over the training set. All five offline-enhanced methods and the original greedy algorithm are tested and compared on two types of problems: the thermal block problem and the geometrically parameterized Helmholtz problem.},

The mesh resolution in regions of flow discontinuities is increased by using a variational optimizer to r -adapt the mesh and cluster degrees of freedom there. In regions of smooth flow, we locally increase or decrease the local resolution through increasing or decreasing the polynomial order of the elements, respectively. This dual approach allows us to take advantage of the strengths of both methods for best computational performance, thereby reducing the overall cost of the simulation. The adaptation workflow uses a sensor for both discontinuities and smooth regions that is cheap to calculate, but the framework is general and could be used in conjunction with other feature-based sensors or error estimators. We demonstrate this proof-of-concept using two geometries in transonic and supersonic flow regimes. The method has been implemented in the open-source spectral/ hp element framework Nektar++ , and adaptivity is performed by its dedicated high-order mesh generation tool NekMesh . The results show that the proposed rp -adaptation methodology is a reasonably cost-effective way of improving simulation accuracy.},

The fluid parts ( p , φ ) are then reduced while preserving the coupling effects, resulting in improved accuracy. A combination of a priori modal contribution indicator and cumulative error estimator are derived from the moment matching approach that provides rational criteria for how many structural and fluid modes need to be retained for the construction of reduced models. An iterative MMS algorithm is then proposed by combining the modal indicators and error estimators. The performance of the proposed MMS method is illustrated via numerical examples.},

The proposed technique is able to derive a suitable match between the RB and the interpolation basis vectors, making the generation of a stable, compact and reliable ROM possible. This is achieved by adaptively adding new basis vectors or removing unnecessary ones, at each iteration of the greedy algorithm. An efficient output error indicator plays a key role in the adaptive scheme. We also propose an improved output error indicator based on previous work. Upon convergence of the POD-Greedy algorithm, the new error indicator is shown to be sharper than the existing ones, implicating that a more reliable ROM can be constructed.

Moreover, the interfacial melted polymer is squeezed flowing in the rough gap created by the fibers located on the prepreg surfaces.

The second-order accuracy of the solution is exploited to devise an automatic mesh adaptivity strategy. An efficient error indicator is obtained from the computation of one extra local problem, independent cell-by-cell, and is used to drive mesh adaptivity.

Our framework builds on the following ingredients: a discontinuous Galerkin finite element (FE) method, which provides stability for convection-dominated problems; reduced basis (RB) spaces, which provide rapidly convergent approximations; the dual-weighted residual method, which provides effective output error estimates for both the FE and RB approximations; output-based adaptive RB snapshots; and the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP), which hyperreduces the primal residual, adjoint residual, and output forms to enable online-efficient evaluations while providing quantitative control of hyperreduction errors. The framework constructs a reduced model which provides, for parameter values in the training set, output predictions that meet the user-prescribed tolerance by controlling the FE, RB, and EQP errors; in addition, the reduced model equips, for any parameter value, the output prediction with an effective, online-efficient error estimate. We demonstrate the framework for parametrized aerodynamics problems modeled by the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations; reduced models provide over two orders of magnitude online computational reduction and sharp error estimates for three-dimensional flows.},

  abstract     = {To circumvent restrictions of conventional drilling methods, such as slow control actions and inability to drill depleted reservoirs, a drilling method called managed pressure drilling (MPD) has been developed. In MPD, single-phase flow processes can be modeled as a feedback interconnection of a high-order linear system and a low-order nonlinear system. These nonlinearities appear locally both inside and at the boundaries of the computational domain. To obtain a fast simulation platform for real-time purposes (eg, online model-based controller implementation), model order reduction is required for MPD. However, the local nonlinearities render applying model order reduction techniques challenging. In this study, a new approach is proposed to deal with such nonlinearities within the reduced basis (RB) context and it is successfully tested on a model for MPD. Contrary to the classical RB technique, the proposed approach not only does not generate nonphysical spikes at the locations of these local nonlinearities but also yields high speedup factors. The obtained reduced-order model can be used for efficient online simulation and controller design for drilling systems with MPD.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a novel error estimator for the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) approximation of parametrized equations. The estimator is intrinsically random: it builds on concentration inequalities of Gaussian maps and an adjoint problem with random right-hand side, which we approximate using the PGD. The effectivity of this randomized error estimator can be arbitrarily close to unity with high probability, allowing the estimation of the error with respect to any user-defined norm as well as the error in some quantity of interest. The performance of the error estimator is demonstrated and compared with some existing error estimators for the PGD for a parametrized time-harmonic elastodynamics problem and the parametrized equations of linear elasticity with a high-dimensional parameter space.},

In this paper, a Total Lagrangian Explicit Selective Smoothed Finite Element Method (Selective S-FEM) is formulated to analyze the dynamic behavior of incompressible brain tissues undergoing extremely large deformation. The proposed Selective S-FEM deals with three-dimensional problems using four-node tetrahedron elements that can be automatically generated for geometrically complex soft tissues. It consists of the three key ingredients. (i) A visco-hyperelastic constitutive model is developed within the framework of S-FEM in the first time, allowing adequate modeling of the dynamic brain tissue behavior. (ii) Selective S-FEM strategy is used for overcome the mesh distortion and the volumetric locking that often occurs in soft tissues. (iii) Total Lagrangian formulation is used in an explicit algorithm allowing rigorous simulation of extreme large deformation. (iv) A combined implementation of Selective S-FEM with the visco-hyperelastic constitutive model for dynamic simulations. The shear deformation is calculated by Face/Edge-based S-FEM, and the volume deformation is calculated by NS-FEM. Numerical experiments show that Selective S-FEM is a robust solver with good accuracy, and excellent ability to reduce element distortion effects in simulate time-dependence behavior of bio-tissues.},

In this article, two novel Hamiltonian-based approaches are presented for efficient sensitivity analysis of general multibody systems. The developed direct differentiation and the adjoint methods are based on constrained Hamilton&#39;s canonical equations of motion. This formulation provides solutions, which are more stable as compared to the results of direct integration of equations of motion expressed in terms of accelerations due to a reduced differential index of the underlying system of differential-algebraic equations and explicit constraint imposition at the velocity level.The proposed Hamiltonian based methods are both capable of calculating the sensitivity derivatives and keeping the growth of constraint violation errors at a reasonable rate. The Hamiltonian-based procedures derived herein appear to be good alternatives to existing methods for sensitivity analysis of general multibody systems.},

In this context, a technique to couple—in a global/local sense–three-dimensional peridynamics with one-dimensional high-order finite elements based on classical elasticity is proposed. The refined finite elements employed in this work are based on the well-established Carrera Unified Formulation, which the previous literature has demonstrated to provide structural formulations with unprecedented accuracy and optimized computational efficiency.

  abstract     = {Phase-field modeling, which introduces the regularized representation of sharp crack topologies, provides a convenient strategy for tackling 3D fracture problems. In this work, an adaptive isogeometric-meshfree approach is developed for the phase-field modeling of brittle fracture in a 3D polycrystalline material. The isogeometric-meshfree approach uses moving least-squares approximations to construct the equivalence between isogeometric basis functions and meshfree shape functions, thus inheriting the flexible local mesh refinement scheme from a meshfree method. This refinement scheme is improved by introducing an error estimator that includes both the phase field and its gradient. With the present approach, numerical implementations of the adaptive phase-field modeling that introduces the anisotropy of fracture resistance in polycrystals are proposed. In this way, propagating cracks can be dynamically tracked, and the mesh near cracks is refined in a meshfree manner without requiring a priori knowledge of crack paths. Furthermore, the intergranular and transgranular crack propagation patterns in polycrystalline materials can be simulated by the present approach. A series of numerical examples that deal with the isotropic and anisotropic fracture are investigated to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The key technical argument relies on a specific subspace on which the homogenization problem is nondegenerate, and which is preserved by iterations of the basic scheme. Our line of argument is based in the nondiscretized setting, and we draw conclusions on the convergence behavior for discretized solution schemes in FFT-based computational homogenization.

However, the original critical time step formula in the standard MPM does not reflect the effect of particle position and neighboring cell interaction on stability and overestimates the critical time step so much that the CFL number has to be very small, even smaller than 0.1, to obtain a stable solution at extreme particle positions. Therefore, in many engineering applications, the standard MPM is very expensive due to the small CFL number. In this article, the effect of particle position and neighboring cell interaction on stability of the explicit MPM is studied. An explicit critical time step formula is obtained based on the system eigenvalues in one dimension, and is then extended to two and three dimensions. For extreme deformation problems, the geometric stiffness matrix is taken into consideration which modifies the sound speed of particles in the critical time step formula. Several tests are performed to verify our formula and show a decrease in amount of time steps used for simulation with our formula comparing with the original formula.},

This vulnerability manifests itself whenever a queried parameter point lies in an unexplored region of the parameter space. This article addresses this issue by presenting an in situ, adaptive framework for nonlinear model reduction where computations are performed by default online and shifted offline as needed. The framework is based on the concept of a database of local reduced-order bases (ROBs), where locality is defined in the parameter space of interest. It achieves accuracy by updating on-the-fly a precomputed ROB and approximating the solution of a dynamical system along its trajectory using a sequence of most appropriate local ROBs. It achieves efficiency by managing the dimension of a local ROB and incorporating hyperreduction in the process. While sufficiently comprehensive, the framework is described in the context of dynamic multiscale computations in solid mechanics. In this context, even in a nonparametric setting of the macroscale problem and when all offline, online, and adaptation overhead costs are accounted for, the proposed computational framework can accelerate a single three-dimensional, nonlinear, multiscale computation by an order of magnitude, without compromising accuracy.},

In this study, the structural compliance is formulated with the quadratic Taylor series expansion of multiple loading positions. As a result, the objective gradient information to the topological variables can be evaluated efficiently upon an explicit quadratic expression as the loads deviate from their ideal application points. Based on the minimum (largest absolute) value of design sensitivities, which corresponds to the most sensitive compliance to the load position variations, a two-level optimization algorithm within the non-probabilistic approach is developed upon a gradient-based optimization method. The proposed framework is then performed to achieve the robust optimal configurations of four benchmark examples, and the final designs are compared comprehensively with the traditional topology optimizations under the loading point fixation. It will be observed that the present methodology can provide a remarkably different structural layout with the auxiliary components in the design domain to counteract the load position uncertainties. The numerical results also show that the present robust topology optimization can effectively prevent the structural performance from a noticeable deterioration than the deterministic optimization in the presence of load position disturbances.},

However, in many applications, their errors of other quantities, for example, trajectory errors, are generally not bounded and increase with time. This article develops a parameter-preadjusted energy-conserving integration for rigid body dynamics in terms of convected-based vectors. To this end, we introduce the modified inertia representation into the Hamiltonian description of the rigid body dynamics, which leads to a modified formulation of Hamilton&#39;s equations including an undetermined parameter γ . After that, the direct discretization of the modified Hamilton&#39;s equations and the constraints in terms of finite increments in time gives an energy-conserving integration. Error estimation suggests that the value of γ has a great influence on the discretization errors of the Hamilton&#39;s equations. Therefore, a preadjusting stage at the beginning of the simulation is devised to optimize γ for minimizing the numerical error. Numerical results demonstrate that the PECI not only preserves the energy exactly, but also presents significant higher accuracy of trajectory errors. In particular, the PECI can achieve approximately periodic trajectory errors for long-time simulations if γ is well preadjusted.},

In the literature, only the formulation of IMB for lattice nodal cells covered by a single-solid particle was given. The treatment of situations where a nodal cell is covered by two or more solid particles is seldom discussed. It is found that some numerical instability can occur for such situations due to an inappropriate computation of the weighting function in the IMB formulation. This work presents an enhanced treatment that can resolve the issue and validates it using some benchmark tests. Furthermore, to avoid the extra costs associated with the treatment and simplify the complicated procedure introduced, a simplified IMB scheme is proposed. The accuracy of both enhanced and simplified IMB schemes are validated by test cases including single-particle sedimentation, two-particle drafting-kissing-tumbling phenomenon, and multiple-particle sedimentation. Then, the robustness of both schemes is examined and discussed using a specially designed flow past cylinders test. The simplified IMB scheme is proved to be robust and sufficiently accurate and simpler and more effective than the enhanced scheme.},

This algorithm is verified, within the limits of round-off error, through implementation in the LAMMPS code. Mechanisms for energy dissipation such as interparticle friction, damping, rotational resistance, particle crushing, or bond breakage cannot be incorporated into this algorithm without causing time irreversibility. This theoretical development is applied to critical-state soil mechanics as an exemplar. It is shown that the convergence of soil samples, which differ only in terms of their initial void ratio, to the same critical state requires the presence of shear forces and frictional dissipation within the soil system.},

  abstract     = {A novel method which combines the active learning Kriging (ALK) model with important sampling is proposed in this paper. The main aim of the proposed method is to solve problems with very small failure probability and multiple failure regions. A surrogate limit state surface (LSS) which strikes a balance between the Kriging mean and variance is proposed. In each iteration, important samples of the surrogate LSS are generated, optimal training points are chosen, the Kriging model is updated and the surrogate LSS is refined. After several iterations, the surrogate LSS will converge to the true LSS. To obtain all the local and global most probable points (MPPs) on the surrogate LSS in each iteration, a recently proposed evolutionary algorithm from the field of multimodal optimization is introduced. In this way, none of the potential failure regions is missed and the unbiasedness of the proposed method is guaranteed. The contribution factor of each MPP is defined and a weighted multimodal instrumental sampling density is formulated. In this way, more attention is paid to the more important failure regions and training points are further saved. The performance of the proposed method is verified by six case studies.},

The macroscopic constitutive law is made numerically available via an explicit formulation of the associated macroenergy density. This energy density is constructed by using a neural network architecture that mimics a high-dimensional model representation. The database for training this network is assembled through solving a set of microscopic boundary value problems with the prescribed macroscopic deformation gradients (input data) and subsequently retrieving the corresponding averaged energies (output data). Therefore, the two-scale computational procedure for nonlinear elasticity can be broken down into two solvers for microscopic and macroscopic equilibrium equations that work separately in two stages, called the offline and online stages. The finite element method is employed to solve the equilibrium equation at the macroscale. As for microscopic problems, an FFT-based collocation method is applied in tandem with the Newton-Raphson iteration and the conjugate-gradient method. Particularly, we solve the microscopic equilibrium equation in the Lippmann-Schwinger form without resorting to the reference medium. In this manner, the fixed-point iteration that might require quite strict numerical stability conditions in the nonlinear regime is avoided. In addition, we derive the projection operator used in the FFT-based method for homogenization of elasticity at finite strain.},

  abstract     = {To assess the influence of thermal stress on fracture deformation, a composite element algorithm of thermo-mechanical coupling for fractured rock mass is developed based on the composite element method (CEM). This study aims to investigate coupled processes associated with the (i) effect of temperature on mechanical deformation and (ii) effect of fracture aperture on heat transfer. The composite element contains fracture segments exhibiting arbitrary shapes with variables that can be interpolated from their mapped nodal variables; the mapped variables can be determined using the governing equations derived from the variational principle or virtual work principle. The proposed coupling algorithm can simulate the discontinuity of fractures, with consideration of the heat transfer of rock blocks and fractures, together with heat exchange among fractures and the adjacent rock mass. A computational mesh is generated without restrictions by explicitly embedding the fractures into the mapped composite elements, substantially simplifying the pre-process work. Analytic solutions to the transient temperature problem are examined to verify the proposed CEM algorithm. Two three-dimensional numerical models are developed to perform thermo-mechanical coupling analyses. These analyses are used to prove the advantage of the mesh handler and the reliability of the proposed algorithm. During coupling with the CEM model, the computational mesh requires no modification regardless of changes in fracture aperture. Results indicate that an increase in temperature leads to rock expansion, causing fracture deformation, which affects the general temperature of the fractured rock mass.},

We propose a numerical method to efficiently deal with 3D rapid transient acoustic problems set in large exterior domains. Using the -transform and the convolution quadrature method, we first present a straightforward way to reframe the problem to the solving of a large amount (the number of time steps, M ) of frequency-domain BEMs. Then, taking advantage of a well-designed high-frequency approximation, we drastically reduce the number of frequency-domain BEMs to be solved, with little loss of accuracy. The complexity of the resulting numerical procedure turns out to be O (1) in regard to the time discretization and for the spacial discretization, the latter being prescribed by the complexity of the used fast BEM solver. Examples of applications are proposed to illustrate the efficiency of the procedure in the case of fluid-structure interaction: the radiation of an acoustic wave into a fluid by a deformable structure with prescribed velocity and the scattering of an abrupt wave by simple and realistic geometries.},

Second, it yields remarkably simple, new analytical expressions of the projectors which provide computational saving during the crack propagation simulation. Finally, it can be applied to arbitrary initial elastic anisotropic media, which is not the case of other available strain tensor split operators.

This necessitates C 1 continuity of the basis functions which are used to interpolate the phase field. The basis functions which are employed in isogeometric analysis (IGA), such as nonuniform rational B-splines and T-splines naturally possess a higher order continuity and are therefore ideally suited for phase-field models which are equipped with an anisotropic surface energy. Moreover, the high accuracy of spline discretizations, also relative to their computational demand, significantly reduces the fineness of the required discretization. This holds a fortiori if adaptivity is included. Herein, we present two adaptive refinement schemes in IGA, namely, adaptive local refinement and adaptive hierarchical refinement, for phase-field simulations of anisotropic brittle fracture. The refinement is carried out using a subdivision operator and exploits the Bézier extraction operator. Illustrative examples are included, which show that the method can simulate highly complex crack patterns such as zigzag crack propagation. An excellent agreement is obtained between the solutions from global refinement and adaptive refinement, with a reasonable reduction of the computational effort when using adaptivity.},

Shifting is used to ensure compatibility with the surrounding discretization, where, different from extended finite element methods, the affected elements stretch over several rows perpendicular to the crack path. To avoid fine meshes around the crack tip in case of cohesive fracture, a blending function is used in the extension direction of the crack path. To comply with standard finite element data structures, Bézier extraction is used. The absence of the Kronecker-delta property in the higher order interpolations of isogeometric analysis impedes the enrichment scheme and compatibility enforcement.

Illustrations are presented on a two dimensional mechanical crack opening problem. Bounds on the failure probability are also post-processed.},

  abstract     = {A parametrized reduced order modeling methodology for cracked two dimensional solids is presented, where the parameters correspond to geometric properties of the crack, such as location and size. The method follows the offline-online paradigm, where in the offline, training phase, solutions are obtained for a set of parameter values, corresponding to specific crack configurations and a basis for a lower dimensional solution space is created. Then in the online phase, this basis is used to obtain solutions for configurations that do not lie in the training set. The use of the same basis for different crack geometries is rendered possible by defining a reference configuration and employing mesh morphing to map the reference to different target configurations. To enable the application to complex geometries, a mesh morphing technique is introduced, based on inverse distance weighting, which increases computational efficiency and allows for special treatment of boundaries. Applications in linear elastic fracture mechanics are considered, with the extended finite element method being used to represent discontinuous and asymptotic fields.},

The FE formulations for plate/shell elements and a shell-like cohesive zone element, both with explicit consideration of geometric nonlinearity, have been derived in detail. The geometrically nonlinear shell-like cohesive element has the essential feature of 3D but with crack displacements directly extracted from midplane shell element nodes, which enables an accurate description of crack propagation in shells and plates under large deformation. Furthermore, a novel augmentation process that can explicitly account for the discontinuous displacement fields of cracked elements without the need of extra nodes or nodal DoFs has been develop based on a nonlinear Newton-Raphson method. The numerical performance of the N-AFEM in modeling a number of benchmark shell/plate fracture problems demonstrates that the method is efficient, accurate, and robust.},

  abstract     = {Particles suspension is considerably prevalent in petroleum industry and chemical engineering. The efficient and accurate simulation of such a process is always a challenge for both the traditional computational fluid dynamics and lattice Boltzmann method. Immersed moving boundary (IMB) method is promising to resolve this issue by introducing a particle-fluid interaction term in the standard lattice Boltzmann equation, which allows for the smooth hydrodynamic force calculation even for a large grid size relative to the solid particle. Although the IMB method was proved good for stationary particles, the deviation of hydrodynamic force on moving particles exists. In this work, we reveal the physical origin of this problem first and figure out that the internal fluid effect on the hydrodynamic force calculation is not counted in the previous IMB. An improved immersed moving boundary method is therefore proposed by considering the internal fluid correction, which is easy to implement with the little extra computation cost. A 2D single elliptical particle and a 3D sphere sedimentation in Newtonian fluid is simulated directly for the validation of the corrected model by excellent agreements with the standard data.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that the sensitivity analysis of the eigenvectors corresponding to multiple eigenvalues is a difficult problem. The main difficulty is that for given multiple eigenvalues, the eigenvector derivatives can be computed for a specific eigenvector basis, the so-called adjacent eigenvector basis. These adjacent eigenvectors depend on individual variables, which makes the eigenvector derivative calculation elaborate and expensive from a computational perspective. This research presents a method that avoids passing through adjacent eigenvectors in the calculation of the partial derivatives of any prescribed eigenvector basis. As our method fits into the adjoint sensitivity analysis , it is efficient for computing the complete Jacobian matrix because the adjoint variables are independent of each variable. Thus our method clarifies and unifies existing theories on eigenvector sensitivity analysis. Moreover, it provides a highly efficient computational method with a significant saving of the computational cost. Additional benefits of our approach are that one does not have to solve a deficient linear system and that the method is independent of the existence of repeated eigenvalue derivatives of the multiple eigenvalues. Our method covers the case of eigenvectors associated to a single eigenvalue. Some examples are provided to validate the present approach.},

One of the issues that affects this representativeness is the application of appropriate boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions are the most common choice. However, when localization takes place, periodic boundary conditions tend to overconstrain the microscopic problem. Weakly periodic boundary conditions have been proposed to overcome this effect. In this study, the effectiveness of weakly periodic boundary conditions in restoring transverse isotropy of representative volume elements (RVE) for a fiber-reinforced composite with elastoplastic matrix is investigated. The formulation of weakly periodic boundary conditions is extended to allow for force-controlled simulations where a uniaxial stress can be applied. A series of simulations is performed where the orientation of applied stress is gradually varied and the influence of this orientation on the averaged response is examined. An original method is presented to test the correlation between the ultimate principal stress and average localization angle of shear bands within an RVE. It is concluded that weakly periodic boundary conditions alleviate anisotropy in the RVE response but do not remove it.},

Due to a large number of samples involved in MCS and SSA, Kriging metamodels are constructed to substitute true constraints. To avoid unnecessary computational cost on Kriging metamodel construction, a new screening criterion based on the coefficient of variation of failure probability is developed to judge active constraints in HRBDO-RI. Then a projection-outline-based active learning Kriging is achieved by sequentially select update points around the projection outlines on the limit-state surfaces of active constraints. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty of Kriging metamodel is quantified and considered in the termination of Kriging update. Several examples, including a piezoelectric energy harvester design, are presented to test the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method for HRBDO-RI.},

It can automatically satisfy the radiation boundary condition at infinity. Based on the dynamic stiffness matrix equation obtained by the modified SBFEM, a continued fraction algorithm is proposed to solve the dynamic stiffness matrix of layered soil in the frequency-domain. Then, the SBFEM was coupled with the finite element method (FEM) at the interface to solve the dynamic stiffness matrices of the rigid surface/buried foundation. Finally, the mixed-variable algorithm was used to solve the three-dimensional transient dynamic response of the foundation in the time domain. Numerical examples were performed to verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm in solving the dynamic stiffness matrix of the infinite domain in the frequency domain and the dynamic transient displacement response of the foundation in the time domain. Compared with the previous numerical integration technique, the dynamic stiffness matrix in the frequency domain calculated by using the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy and higher efficiency.},

In RCP, recovered stresses are obtained by minimizing the complementary energy of patches of elements over a set of assumed equilibrated stress modes. To this aim, the explicit knowledge of displacements is only needed along the patch boundaries and no knowledge of superconvergent points is required, so making the RCP naturally suitable for the VEM. The a posteriori error estimation is conducted by comparing the stress field of a standard displacement-based VEM solution and the stress field obtained through RCP. The procedure is simple, and it does not require ad hoc modifications for small patches. The capability of this RCP-based error estimator to drive adaptive mesh refinements is successfully demonstrated through various numerical examples.},

As topology optimization has embraced and overcome many of the obstacles of incorporating AM constraints into the underlying numerical optimization statement, there exist few solutions that directly address this fundamental void region issue. By developing computationally efficient and effective solutions to this problem, the integration of these two advanced technologies can be fully realized. Drawing on inspiration from the principles of diffusion physics, a particle diffusion void restriction (PDVR) method is presented in this work that is capable of encouraging the optimization scheme to generate final designs that are fully accessible. Additionally, this method empowers the user to choose the type of post-processing method to clear support material (eg, three-axis or five-axis milling operations, number and orientation of part set-ups) and, therefore, quantify the level of costs associated with the post-processing operation. The PDVR optimization framework is demonstrated on multiple two- and three-dimensional test problems, with physically manufactured examples depicting the real-world benefits this method admits.},

The novelty of our method is the decoupling of the two discretizations: the bulk mesh for the finite element solution and the mesh along the crack front for the numerical stress intensity factors, and hence we term it the multiple mesh interaction integral (MMII) method. Through analysis of the convergence of the functional and method, we find scalings of these two mesh sizes to guarantee convergence of the computed stress intensity factors in a variety of norms, including maximum pointwise error and total variation. We demonstrate the MMII on four examples: a semiinfinite straight crack with the asymptotic displacement fields, the same geometry with a nonuniform stress intensity factor along the crack front, a spherical cap crack in a cylinder under tension, and the elliptical crack under far-field tension and shear.},

The key point for constructing the ABC is that a new continued fraction (CF) is presented to expand dynamic stiffness of underlying half-space, and the CF-based stress-displacement relationship is then transformed into an auxiliary variable system with square of horizontal wavenumber. The ABC has only one undetermined real parameter that is the CF-order independent of frequency and incidence angle of propagating outgoing waves. The parameter can be chosen relatively small value to achieve an accurate ABC. Moreover, the ABC can couple seamlessly with finite element method of finite domain. The finite domain can be chosen very small size due to high accuracy of the ABC. Numerical examples are finally given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ABC.},

  abstract     = {A new simulation method for the vibro-acoustic simulation of poro-elastic shells is presented. The proposed methods can be used to investigate arbitrary curved layered panels, as well as their interaction with the surrounding air. We employ a high-order finite element method (FEM) for the discretization of the shell structure. We assume that the shell geometry is given parametrically or implicitly. For both cases the exact geometry is used in the simulation. In order to discretize the fluid surrounding the structure, a variational variant of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is developed. Thus, the meshing of the fluid domain can be avoided and in the case of unbounded domains the Sommerfeld radiation condition is fulfilled. In order to simulate coupled fluid-structure interaction problems, the FEM and the MFS are combined to a coupled method. The implementation of the uncoupled FEM for the shell and the uncoupled MFS is verified against numerical examples based on the method of manufactured solutions. For the verification of the coupled method an example with a known exact solution is considered. In order to show the potential of the method sound transmission from cavities to exterior half-spaces is simulated.},

The regular non-probabilistic reliability analysis assumes that experimental data are enclosed by ellipse and rectangle; however, this appears inconsistent with various types of uncertain sources. In this article, a novel definition for non-probabilistic reliability is provided for structures based on super parameteric convex model, which is formulated as the ratio of the multidimensional volume located in the safety domain to that of the total super parametric volume. Subsequently, a sampling method is proposed based on Monte Carlo simulation as a reference algorithm. To improve the efficiency, a first-order calculation method is developed to solve the reliability model using a linear approximation of the limit state function. Furthermore, a second-order calculation method is constructed to improve the reliability calculation precision with high nonlinearity, and a new non-probabilistic reliability-based design optimization method is established accordingly. Six numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {In Lagrangian particle-based methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), computing totally divergence-free velocity field in a flow domain with the smallest error possible is the most critical issue, which might be achieved through solving pressure Poisson equation implicitly with higher particle resolutions. However, implicit solutions are computationally expensive and may be particularly challenging in the solution of multiphase flows with highly nonlinear deformations as well as fluid-structure interaction problems. Augmented Lagrangian SPH (ALSPH) method is a new alternative algorithm as a prevalent pressure solver where the divergence-free velocity field is achieved by iterative calculation of velocity and pressure fields. This study investigates the performance of the ALSPH technique by solving a challenging flow problem such as two-dimensional flow around a cylinder within the Reynolds number range of 50 to 500 in terms of improved robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency. The same flow conditions are also simulated using the conventional weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) method. The results of ALSPH and WCSPH solutions are not only compared in terms of numerical validation / verification studies, but also rigorous investigations are performed for all related physical flow characteristics, namely, hydrodynamic coefficients, frequency domain analyses, and velocity divergence fields.},

In this study, a novel wall boundary treatment using analytical volume integrations has been developed for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible flow simulations with the moving particle semi-implicit method. In our approach, wall geometry is represented by a set of line segments in 2D space. Thus, arbitrary-shaped boundaries can easily be handled without auxiliary boundary particles. The wall&#39;s contributions to the spatial derivatives as well as the particle number density are formulated based on volume integrations over the solid domain. These volume integrations are analytically solved. Therefore, it does not entail an expensive calculation cost nor compromise accuracy. Numerical simulations have been carried out for several test cases including the plane Poiseuille flow, a hydrostatic pressure problem with complicated shape, a high viscous flow driven by a rotating screw, a free-surface flow driven by a rotating cylinder and a dam break in a tank with a wedge. The results obtained using the proposed method agreed well with analytical solutions, experimental observations or calculation results obtained using finite volume method (FVM), which confirms that the proposed wall boundary treatment is accurate and robust.},

This paper aims to establish a surrogate model of the LSF with higher simulation precision, and whereby proposes a response surface method based on the combination of uniform design (UD) and weighted least squares (WLS). At first, the UD method is selected as the sampling method of interval variables to realize the uniform space-filling of the initial samples, and the sample set is updated by gradually adding the approximate optimal points to increase the sampling density of critical domain. Then, the WLS method is applied to improve the precision of the response surface by adjusting the importance of samples to the function fitting. Finally, a method of constructing sample weights is developed. Two examples are applied to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method is effective for non-probabilistic reliability analysis of complex structures owning to high computational precision and low computational cost in both numerical and case study.},

Depending on the problem, the resulting system of equations may be defined by a large-dimensional matrix. Thus, sampling for a subset of the grids is essential in order to achieve an efficient grid deformation. This article presents an efficient grid deformation algorithm developed via deterministic data sampling. From the position data of the deformed grids, proper orthogonal decomposition and discrete empirical interpolation method are employed to define the subset of the grids. Herein, symmetric rank-one update is considered to choose the additional grids (oversampling). And it facilitates the deterministic data sampling approach and realizes the improved stability within the data reduction procedure. Such deterministic data sampling approach is applied to the moving submesh approach and radial basis function (RBF) interpolations. Specifically, for an RBF interpolation, boundaries of a deformable body are directly introduced within the data reduction procedure to improve the computational efficiency. Two- and three-dimensional examples are used to evaluate the relevant computational efficiency of the proposed methods. It is found that computational time consumed by the present method is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the existing method while maintaining the quality of the deformed grids.},

The objective is to model mesh independent fracture behavior of quasi-brittle materials, and to avoid the issues associated with the existing gradient-enhanced damage models. In the proposed model, an evolving anisotropic nonlocal interaction domain governs the spatial diffusive behavior, which helps to maintain a localized damage bandwidth during the final stages of loading. The anisotropy in nonlocal interactions is captured through an anisotropic gradient tensor, which defines the orientation of the diffusive interaction domain based on the principal stresses at a given material point. In this article, a smooth micromorphic stress tensor is utilized for the determination of principal stress states, to enforce a properly oriented interaction across the bandwidth of the damage process zone throughout the loading process. The proposed approach also enables the usage of low order finite elements without any oscillatory micromorphic or nonlocal equivalent strain response in the later stages of deformation. The accuracy and performance of the proposed model are demonstrated numerically in plane strain/stress for mode-I, mode-II, and mixed-mode loading conditions.},

The present method aims to suppress key numerical instabilities observed in the strong form Lagrangian particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), incompressible SPH, and moving particle semi-implicit for incompressible free surface flow simulations. It is well-known that strong form Lagrangian particle methods usually rely on ad hoc particle stabilization techniques based on particle shifting, artificial viscosity, or density-invariant condition due to some formulation inconsistency issues. In the present method, we introduce a momentum-consistent velocity smoothing algorithm which is used to combine with the second-order rotational incremental pressure-correction scheme to stabilize the pressure field as well as to enforce the consistency of Neumann boundary condition. To further impose slip-free or nonslip boundary conditions for the fluid flow, a penalty method which is free of ghost or dummy particles is developed. Finally, a particle insertion-deletion adaptive scheme is proposed when the violent fluid flow is considered. Four numerical examples are studied to validate the accuracy and stability of the present method.},

This article presents a novel adaptive substepping cutting-plane time integration scheme for elasto-viscoplastic models keeping the advantage of original cutting-plane (OCP) with only the first derivatives of loading surface required. The deficiency of OCP time integration algorithm is first discussed taking a simple overstress theory based elasto-viscoplastic modified Cam-Clay model (EVP-MCC) as example. To overcome this, a new algorithm is developed with three features: (1) an evolution function for the hardening variable of dynamic loading surface is innovatively deduced for the Taylor series approximation, (2) the elastic predictor is modified to account for the initial viscoplastic strain rate with more accuracy, and (3) a new adaptive substepping technique for restricting simultaneously both strain and time incremental sizes based on the overstress distance is proposed. For easy understanding, the proposed algorithm is first presented for one-dimensional condition, and then extended to three-dimensional condition. The new integrated EVP-MCC model using the proposed algorithm is examined by simulating laboratory tests at both levels of integration point and finite element with a good performance in terms of accuracy and convergence.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a robust topology optimization method for optical cloaks under uncertainties in the wave number and angle in the incident wave. We first discuss the governing equation derived from Maxwell&#39;s equation, and extend it to the entire domain including the dielectric material and air, based on the level set-based topology optimization method. Next, a robust optimization problem is formulated as a minimization problem of the weighted sum of the scattered wave norm and its standard deviation with respect to the wave number and angle of the incident wave. The standard deviation is mathematically expressed by the Taylor series approximation and the use of the adjoint variable method. The design sensitivity of the objective functional is also derived by the adjoint variable method. An optimization algorithm is then constructed, based on the proposed formulation for robust designs of optical cloaks. Several numerical examples are finally provided to demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed method.},

An advanced discretization scheme is also developed for the accurate evaluation of the normal derivative of potential functions on complex boundaries. Thanks to the irregular cell and the discretization scheme for the normal derivative of the potential functions, the present method can avoid the drawback of distorted stencils, that is, the possible numerical inaccuracy/instability. Furthermore, it can involve stationary or moving bodies on the Cartesian grid in an accurate and simple way. With the proper free-surface tracking methods, the HPM has been successfully applied to the accurate and stable modeling of highly nonlinear free-surface potential flows with and without moving bodies, that is, sloshing, water entry, and plunging breaker.},

This work presents a three-stage GPU-based FEA matrix generation strategy with the key idea of decoupling the computation of global matrix indices and values by use of a novel data structure referred to as the neighbor matrix. The first stage computes the neighbor matrix on the GPU based on the unstructured mesh. Using this neighbor matrix, the indices and values of the global matrix are computed separately in the second and third stages. The neighbor matrix is computed for three different element types. Two versions for performing numerical integration and assembly in the same or separate kernels are implemented and simulations are run for different mesh sizes having up to three million degrees of freedom on a single GPU. Comparison with GPU-based parallel implementation from the literature reveals speedup ranging from 4× to 6× for the proposed workload division strategy. Furthermore, the same kernel implementation is found to outperform the separate kernel implementation by 70% to 150% for different element types.},

The SaS method is based on choosing inside the layers the arbitrary number of SaS parallel to the middle surface and located at Chebyshev polynomial nodes in order to introduce the displacements and electric potentials of these surfaces as fundamental shell unknowns. The outer surfaces and interfaces are also included into a set of SaS. To circumvent shear and membrane locking, the hybrid-mixed solid-shell element on the basis of the Hu-Washizu variational principle is proposed. The tangent stiffness matrix is evaluated by 3D analytical integration throughout the finite element. This novelty provides a superior performance in the case of coarse meshes. A comparison with the SOLID226 element showed that the developed exact geometry SaS solid-shell element allows the use of load increments, which are much larger than possible with existing displacement-based finite elements. Thus, it can be recommended for the 3D stress analysis of doubly-curved laminated piezoelectric shells because the SaS formulation gives the opportunity to obtain the 3D solutions of electroelasticity with a prescribed accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an approach to resolve the dynamic fracture of brittle materials by incorporating eigenerosion into the material point method (MPM) framework. The eigenerosion approach links the crack propagation to energy conservation based on the variational theory of fracture mechanics. This idea closely resembles the conventional treatment for the phase-field method. The major difference is that the effective energy release rate of each particle that controls the crack propagation is only calculated within its neighborhood domain for the eigenerosion approach. Because evaluation of the material&#39;s fracture behavior can be decoupled from the governing equations as a separate solution step, the eigenerosion scheme allows straightforward implementation into any standard MPM solver with minor modifications. In addition, a phantom-node method is employed to handle the preexisting crack. With these settings, the proposed model can capture complex fracture behaviors. Several representative benchmark tests demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed model.},

Mixed finite elements are employed for an accurate discretization. A continuation method, similar to a standard elasto-plastic analysis, is used at structural level. It evaluates a pseudo-equilibrium path made of a sequence of safe states with a converging nondecreasing load factor. Each point of the path is obtained by finding kinematic variables corresponding to self-equilibrated stresses satisfying Melan&#39;s condition for the current load factor to be safe. The stress admissible domain is defined at fiber level as a function of the load factor using the maximum and minimum effect due to all loads. An iterative state determination provides finite element stresses corresponding to assigned kinematic variables and load factor. The overall analysis differs from previous proposals for two novelty points. Firstly, a direct application of the Newton method can be employed, without any need for constrained optimization solvers. Moreover, dimension and complexity of the load domain do not affect the computational cost of the nonlinear analysis. Numerical tests show an accurate estimate of the safety factor using a small number of fibers and an efficient solution also for large buildings.},

To overcome this weakness, in this article, the weak-form formulations are introduced to replace the original formulations of element internal nodes in EDM, which produce a new strong-weak-form method, named as weak-form element differential method (WEDM). WEDM has advantages in both the computational accuracy and the numerical stability when dealing with the abruptly changed boundary conditions.

  abstract     = {In this article, a model reduction technique is presented to solve nonlinear multiscale parabolic problems using dynamic mode decomposition. The multiple scales and nonlinearity bring great challenges for simulating the problems. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a model reduction method for the nonlinear multiscale dynamic problems by integrating constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) with dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). CEM-GMsFEM has shown great efficiency to solve linear multiscale problems in a coarse space. However, using CEM-GMsFEM to directly solve multiscale nonlinear parabolic models involves dynamically computing the residual and the Jacobian on a fine grid. This may be very computationally expensive because the evaluation of the nonlinear term is implemented in a high-dimensional fine scale space. As a data-driven method, DMD can use observation data and give an explicit expression to accurately describe the underlying nonlinear dynamic system. To efficiently compute the multiscale nonlinear parabolic problems, we propose a CEM-DMD model reduction by combing CEM-GMsFEM and DMD. The CEM-DMD reduced model is a coarsen linear model, which avoids the nonlinear solver in the fine space. It is crucial to judiciously choose observation in DMD. Only proper observation can render an accurate DMD model. In the context of CEM-DMD, we introduce two different observations: fine scale observation and coarse scale observation. In the construction of DMD model, the coarse scale observation requires much less computation than the fine scale observation. The CEM-DMD model using the coarse scale observation gives a complete coarse model for the nonlinear multiscale dynamic systems and significantly improves the computation efficiency. To show the performance of the CEM-DMD using the different observations, we present a few numerical results for the nonlinear multiscale parabolic problems in heterogeneous porous media.},

This article develops two 48-dof 4-node tetrahedral elements for 3D gradient-elasticity analyses by generalizing the discrete Kirchhoff method and a relaxed hybrid-stress method. Displacement and displacement-gradient are the only nodal dofs. Both methods start with the derivation of a C 0 quadratic-complete displacement interpolation from which the strain is derived. In the first element, displacement-gradient at the mid-edge points are approximated and then interpolated together with those at the nodes whilst the strain-gradient is derived from the displacement-gradient interpolation. In the second element, the assumed constant double-stress modes are employed to enforce the continuity of the normal derivative of the displacement. The whole formulation can be viewed as if the strain-gradient matrix derived from the displacement interpolation matrix is refined by a constant matrix. Both elements are validated by the individual element patch test and other numerical benchmark tests. To the best knowledge of the authors, the proposed elements are probably the first nonmixed/penalty 3D elements which employ only displacement and displacement-gradient as the nodal dofs for gradient-elasticity analyses.},

The new formulation is capable of achieving globally resonant lightly damped “0-1” structures for frequencies close to those of interest. The proposed strategy successfully deals with known issues like design “degeneration” and instability of the gradient-based optimization process around the resonance frequency (which is a local maximum when maximizing vibration responses) at which harmonic excitation forces shall be applied. In this work, the authors use the concept of complex input power to overcome the mentioned issues. It is proposed a topology optimization procedure where a weighted sum between the active input power (real part of the complex input power) and the static compliance is minimized with a constraint on the reactive input power (imaginary part of the complex input power), which is converted to a ratio between the time-averaged potential and kinetic energies of the system named quotient R . By this way, it is possible to ensure viability to the procedure by preventing the resonance frequency from reaching exactly the excitation frequency throughout the process, which otherwise causes difficulties on convergence. The process achieves resonance frequencies very close to given values of interest by keeping the “side” of R &lt;1 or R &gt;1. Several examples are presented to illustrate the potential of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The multiscale homogenization scheme is becoming a diffused tool for the analysis of heterogeneous materials as masonry since it allows dealing with the complexity of formulating closed-form constitutive laws by retrieving the material response from the solution of a unit cell (UC) boundary value problem (BVP). The robustness of multiscale simulations depends on the robustness of the nested macroscopic and mesoscopic models. In this study, specific attention is paid to the meshless solution of the UC BVP under plane stress conditions, comparing performances related to the application of linear displacement or periodic boundary conditions (BCs). The effect of the geometry of the UC is also investigated since the BVP is formulated for the two simpliest UCs, according to a displacement-based variational formulation assuming the block indefinitely elastic and the mortar joints as zero-thickness elasto-plastic interfaces. It will be showed that the meshless discretization allows obtaining some advantages with respect to a standard FE mesh. The influence of the UC morphology as well as the BCs on the linear and nonlinear UC macroscopic response is discussed for pure modes of failure. The results can be constructive in view of performing a general Fe·Meshless or Meshless 2 analysis.},

The nearly singular integrals of 2D potential problem in the IGABEM are addressed by a semianalytical scheme in the present work. We use the subtraction technique to separate the integrals to singular and nonsingular parts, where the singular parts can be calculated by the analytical formulae derived by utilizing a series of integration by parts, while the nonsingular parts are calculated numerically with fewer quadrature points. Comparing the present semianalytical results with the ones of exact solutions, we find that the present method can obtain precise potential and flux densities of inner points much closer to the boundary without refining the elements nearby. Sufficient comparisons with other regularization schemes, such as the exponential and sinh transformation methods, are also conducted. The results in the numerical examples show the competitiveness of the present method, especially when calculating the nearly strongly and highly singular integrals during the simulation of the flux density.},

The high computational cost required for these repeated simulations leads to a bottleneck in the design process due to an increased design time and, thus, a higher cost. To alleviate these issues, the application of reduced order modeling techniques, which are able to find a general solution to high-dimensional parametric problems in a very efficient manner, is considered. Building on the established proper orthogonal decomposition technique available in the literature, the main novelty of this work is an efficient implementation for the solution of 3D magneto-mechanical problems in the context of challenging MRI configurations.

The considered systems are subject to linear real-valued time-periodic uncertainties affecting the coefficient matrices, and the presented method is able to fully exploit structure and potential interdependencies among the uncertainties. The assessment of robustness relies on the computation of the pseudospectral radius of the monodromy operator, namely, the largest Floquet multiplier that the system can attain within a given range of perturbations. Instrumental to the adopted novel approach, a solver for the computation of Floquet multipliers is introduced, which results into the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem which is linear w.r.t.

We provide numerical simulations for popular applications modeled by time-periodic delay systems, such as the inverted pendulum subject to an act-and-wait controller, a single-degree-of-freedom milling model and a turning operation with spindle speed variation.},

The efficiency of strategies for finding optimal experimental set-ups is particularly important for experiments that are time-consuming or expensive to perform. In the situation when the experiments are modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs), multilevel methods have been proven to reduce the computational complexity of their single-level counterparts when estimating expected values. For a setting where PDEs can model experiments, we propose two multilevel methods for estimating a popular criterion known as the expected information gain (EIG) in Bayesian optimal experimental design. We propose a multilevel double loop Monte Carlo, which is a multilevel strategy with double loop Monte Carlo, and a multilevel double loop stochastic collocation, which performs a high-dimensional integration on sparse grids. For both methods, the Laplace approximation is used for importance sampling that significantly reduces the computational work of estimating inner expectations. The values of the method parameters are determined by minimizing the computational work, subject to satisfying the desired error tolerance. The efficiencies of the methods are demonstrated by estimating EIG for inference of the fiber orientation in composite laminate materials from an electrical impedance tomography experiment.},

One such tool is topology optimization (TO), which often produces designs that are impracticable to manufacture. However, recent developments in additive manufacturing (AM) have made production of such complex designs feasible. Therefore, integration of these technologies has the potential to innovate the design and manufacture of mechanical components. This work presents a novel mathematical methodology for multiobjective minimization of structural compliance and AM cost and time, in simultaneous build orientation and density-based TO. Component surface area and support volume were implemented in this method as the physical factors influencing AM cost and time. A new methodology was produced to approximate support volume throughout TO with variable build orientation, enabling direct minimization of support volume in the proposed optimization. The methodology allows derivation of sensitivity expressions, thereby permitting the use of efficient gradient-based optimization solvers. Three numerical examples demonstrated that the proposed methodology can efficiently produce optimum build orientations and topologies, which significantly reduce structural compliance and AM cost and time.},

  abstract     = {Multiquery problems such as uncertainty quantification (UQ), optimization of a dynamical system require solving a differential equation at multiple parameter values. Therefore, for large systems, the computational cost becomes prohibitive. This issue can be addressed by using a cheaper reduced order model (ROM) instead. However, the ROM entails error in the solution due to approximation in a lower dimensional subspace. Moreover, the ROM lacks robustness over a wide range of parameter values. To address these issues, first, an upper bound on the norm of the state transition matrix is derived. This bound, along with the residual in the governing equation, are then used to develop an error estimator for general nonlinear dynamical systems. Furthermore, this error estimator is used in conjunction with the modified greedy search algorithm proposed by Hossain and Ghosh (Int J Numer Methods Eng, 2018;116(12-13): 741-758) to adaptively construct a robust proper orthogonal decomposition-based ROM. This adaptive ROM is subsequently deployed for UQ by invoking it in a statistical simulation. Two numerical studies: (i) viscous Burgers&#39; equation and (ii) beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation, showed an improved accuracy of the error estimator compared to the current literature. A significant computational speed-up in UQ is achieved.},

The conventional modal decomposition techniques, such as proper orthogonal and dynamic mode decompositions, aim to represent the system response using spatially global basis vectors that span a broad spatial domain. A significant challenge facing approaches based on global domain decomposition is the rapid increase in both the amount of training data and the number of modes that must be retained for an accurate representation of convection dominated turbulent flows. An alternative generalized finite element (GFEM) based approach is explored for efficient representation of high-dimensional fluid flow data. Here, the standard finite element interpolation method is enriched with numerical functions that are learned from a small amount of high-fidelity training data over spatially localized subdomains. The GFEM approach is demonstrated on a 3D flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number of 100 000 and flows inside a 2D lid-driven cavity over a range of Reynolds numbers. Compared with a global proper orthogonal decomposition, the GFEM-based approach increases efficiency in reconstructing the datasets while also substantially reducing the amounts of training data.},

Five internal nodes, one at the elemental central and four at the middle sides, are added to ensure the quadratic completeness of the elemental displacement field. Thereafter, the total nine nodes are applied to form the shape functions of trial function, and the Lagrange interpolation functions are adopted as the incompatible test shape functions of the internal nodes. The incompatible test displacements are then revised to satisfy the patch test. Numerical tests show that the present element can provide very good numerical accuracy with badly distorted meshes.

Second, the displacement function expression in global coordinates is transformed into isoparametric coordinates, and the relationships between the two series of coefficients for the two kinds of displacement function expressions are found. Third, the displacement function expression is modified to satisfy the requirements of nodal freedom and interelement boundary continuity. The key to the new element construction is the derivation of the linear relationship expressions among 12 coefficients of element displacement interpolation polynomials in the global and isoparametric coordinate systems. As a result, the relationship between quadratic completeness and interelement continuity is explicitly given, and a proof of the completeness and the continuity was conducted to theoretically guarantee the validity of the derivation results. Furthermore, in order to verify the correctness of the theoretical work, nine numerical examples were performed. The computation results from these examples demonstrate that QH8-C1 exhibited excellent performance, including high simulation accuracy, fast convergence, insensitivity to mesh distortion, and monotonic convergence.},

  abstract     = {Modal expansion is a workhorse used in many engineering analysis algorithms. One example is the coupled boundary element-finite element computation of the backscattering target strength of underwater elastic objects. To obtain the modal basis, a free-vibration (generalized eigenvalue) problem needs to be solved, which tends to be expensive when there are many basis vectors to compute. In the above-mentioned backscattering example it could be many hundreds or thousands. Excellent algorithms exist to solve the free-vibration problem, and most use some form of the Rayleigh-Ritz (RR) procedure. The key to an efficient RR application is a low-cost transformation into a reduced basis. In this work, a novel, inexpensive a priori transformation is constructed for solid-mechanics finite element models based on the notion of coherent nodal clusters. The inexpensive RR procedure then leads to significant speedups of the computation of an approximate solution to the free vibration problem.},

  abstract     = {This contribution proposes a tribological model within a three-dimensional contact formulation considering structural anisotropy of the contact interface. A simple elastoplastic constitutive law is adopted for the description of the behavior on the anisotropic contact interface. Starting with the establishment of the thermodynamic framework of the contact problem, the dissipative, irreversible process is described. By applying the principle of maximum dissipation, the evolution equations and the expressions of the tangential contact forces for the cases of sticking and sliding are obtained and, subsequently, formulated in algorithmic form, in order to enable their implementation into finite element codes. The anisotropic behavior is incorporated through the definition of a tensor of anisotropy. The form of this tensor is defined in a general curvilinear coordinate system. The cases of both constant and nonconstant anisotropic tensor are studied. The analytical solution of a numerically computed problem, serves the validation of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Mesh-free properties are part of the superiority of cell-based smoothed finite element method (CS-FEM), but have yet to be fully exploited for computational fluid dynamics. A novel implementation of CS-FEM for incompressible viscous fluid flows in stationary and deforming domains discretized by severely distorted bilinear four-node quadrilateral (Q4) elements is presented in this article. The negative determinant of the Jacobian transformation from the Cartesian coordinates to the natural coordinates is intentionally stipulated for the corresponding mesh over which FEM inevitably fails in practice. It is found that, without ad hoc modifications, CS-FEM incurs unsatisfactory results and even a failure on fixed meshes. To cater for general computations on either a uniform or nonuniform mesh represented by these badly degenerated elements, four smoothing cells (SCs) are deployed in convex Q4 element whereas one SC in concave Q4 element. A simple hourglass control is introduced into those under-integrated quadrilaterals for stabilizing the one-SC quadrature in smoothed Galerkin weak form. Thanks to the adoption of characteristic-based split (CBS) scheme for the fluid solution, a byproduct is the unfolded equivalence of the CBS stabilization and balancing tensor diffusivity under the incompressibility constraint. Several benchmark problems involving incompressible fluid flow and fluid-structure interaction are solved. Numerical results show the good accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach that raises a seductive idea for resolving moving-mesh problems.},

The boundary representation modeling technique in CAD is the starting point of this approach. We parameterize the solid according to the scaled boundary finite element method and employ NURBS basis functions for the approximation of the solution. Therefore, solid surfaces consist of several sections, which can be regarded as patches and discretized independently. The main objective of this study is to derive an approach for the connection of independent sections in order to allow for local refinement and thus an accurate and efficient discretization of the computational domain. Nonconforming sections are coupled with a mortar approach within a master-slave framework. The coupling of adjacent sections ensures the equality of mutual deformations along the interface in a weak sense and is enforced by constraining the NURBS basis functions on the interface. We apply this approach to nonlinear problems in two dimensions and compare the results with conforming discretizations.},

The present study, focusing on scalar waves in two dimensions, for example, antiplane shear waves, aims at setting a generic optimization framework. The proposed optimization procedure relies on a number of mathematical and numerical tools. First, the two-scale asymptotic homogenization method is deployed up to second-order to provide an effective dispersive model. Simple dispersion indicators and cost functionals are then considered on the basis of this model. Then, the minimization of these functionals is performed thanks to an algorithm that relies on the concept of topological derivative to iteratively perform phase changes in the unit cell characterizing the material. Finally, fast Fourier transform-accelerated solvers are extensively used to solve the cell problems underlying the homogenized model. To illustrate the proposed approach, the resulting procedure is applied to the design of anisotropic media with maximal dispersion in specific directions, and to the reconstruction of unknown microstructures from effective phase velocity data.},

  abstract     = {Assessing the failure probability of complex aeronautical structure is a difficult task in presence of uncertainties. In this paper, active learning polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is developed for reliability analysis. The proposed method firstly assigns a Gaussian Process (GP) prior to the model response, and the covariance function of this GP is defined by the inner product of PCE basis function. Then, we show that a PCE model can be derived by the posterior mean of the GP, and the posterior variance is obtained to measure the local prediction error as Kriging model. Also, the expectation of the prediction variance is derived to measure the overall accuracy of the obtained PCE model. Then, a learning function, named expected indicator function prediction error (EIFPE), is proposed to update the design of experiment of PCE model for reliability analysis. This learning function is developed under the framework of the variance-bias decomposition. It selects new points sequentially by maximizing the EIFPE that considers both the variance and bias information, and it provides a dynamic balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, several test functions and engineering applications are investigated, and the results are compared with the widely used Kriging model combined with U and expected feasibility function learning function. Results show that the proposed method is efficient and accurate for complex engineering applications.},

Contrary to existing system-level model order reduction approaches for multibody systems simulation, this methodology allows to obtain a constant reduced order basis which can be obtained in a noninvasive fashion with respect to the original flexible multibody model. It is shown that this scheme enables an automatic joint constraint elimination which can be obtained at low computational cost through exploitation of the component level modes typically employed in flexible multibody simulation. The equations of motion are derived such that the computational cost of the resulting SLAP model is independent of the original model size. This approach results in a set of ordinary differential equations with a constant mass matrix and nonlinear internal forces. This structure makes the resulting model suitable for a range of estimation, control, and design applications. The proposed approach is validated numerically on a flexible four-bar mechanism and shows good accuracy for a very low-order SLAP model.},

The GFEM/XFEM are called extrinsic if additional functions are enriched at every node in certain domains, while they are called degree of freedom (DOF)-gathering if the singular enriched functions are gathered using cutoff functions. The DOF-gathering GFEM/XFEM save the additional DOFs compared with the extrinsic approach. Both extrinsic and DOF-gathering GFEM/XFEM suffer from difficulties of stabilities in a sense that their scaled condition numbers (SCN) of stiffness matrices could be much larger than those of the standard FEM. A GFEM/XFEM is referred to as stable GFEM (SGFEM) if it reaches optimal convergence orders, and its SCN is of same order as that of FEM. An extrinsic SGFEM was established in Zhang et al for the Poisson crack problems. Objective of this article is to propose the SGFEM for elasticity crack problems; both extrinsic and DOF-gathering schemes are addressed. The main idea is to modify the enriched functions by subtracting their FE interpolants, which was developed by Babuška and Banerjee. To remove local almost linear dependence introduced by multifold enrichments at one node, we propose a local principal component analysis technique to identify and analyze “contributions” of multifold enrichments at one node. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed SGFEM and DOF-gathering SGFEM are of optimal convergence and have the SCNs of same order as in the FEM.},

A different solution is proposed here, where an approximated numerical method is used to derive the stress from the strain data with no iterations. The method is general and can be applied to any plasticity model with a convex surface of the yield locus in nonproportional loading. The theoretical basis of the method is described and then it is implemented on two constitutive models of anisotropic plasticity, namely, Hill48 and Yld2000-2D. The accuracy of the proposed method and the advantage in terms of computational time with respect to the classical radial-return algorithm are discussed.

Our approach fully couples the material point method (MPM) and the spheropolygon discrete element method (SDEM) through the exchange of contact force information. It combines the advantage of MPM for accurately simulating elastoplastic continuum materials and the high efficiency of DEM for calculating the Newtonian dynamics of discrete near-rigid objects. The MPM-SDEM framework is demonstrated with an explicit time integration scheme. Its accuracy and efficiency are further analyzed against the analytical and experimental data. Results demonstrate this method could accurately capture the contact force and momentum exchange between materials while maintaining favorable computational stability and efficiency.

The formulation consists in penalizing the free movement of those nodes by a smooth extension of the solution from the interior of the domain, through a postprocess of the solution via a displacement recovery technique.

We study under which conditions and to what extent small time step sizes balance cut instabilities, which are present especially for high-order spatial discretizations. This is done by analyzing eigenvalues and critical time steps for representative cuts. If small time steps cannot prevent cut instabilities, stabilization by means of cell agglomeration is applied and its effects are analyzed in combination with local time step sizes.

  abstract     = {This work presents a generalized substructuring-based topology optimization method for the design hierarchical lattice structures to maximize the first eigenvalue. In this method, the macrostructure is assumed to be composed of substructures with a common artificial lattice geometry pattern. And two different yet connected scales are considered through a lattice geometry feature parameter. The feature parameter, which can control the material distribution of the substructure, determines the relative density of corresponding substructure. Each substructure is condensed into a super-element to obtain the associated density-related matrices. A surrogate model using cubic spline interpolation has been particularly built to map the density to stiffness and mass matrices of condensed super-elements. The derivatives of super-element matrices to the associated densities can be evaluated efficiently and accurately. Here, an augmented penalized density for this surrogate model is introduced. And the conventional optimality criteria method is selected as updating method of the density design variables. Numerical examples under two lattice patterns of substructures are shown to validate the correctness and superiority of this substructure-based topology optimization method.},

It is now shown that the use of nonuniform rational B-splines (NURBS) as basis functions rather than traditional Lagrange polynomials significantly reduces this oscillatory behavior. Moreover, there is no effect on the global structural behavior, as evidenced through load-displacement curves. The phase-field model imposes restrictions on the interpolation order of the NURBS used for the three different fields: displacement, phase field, and crack opening. This holds within the Bézier element, but also at the boundaries, where a reduction to 𝒞 0 -continuity yields optimal results. Application to a range of cases, including debonding of a hard fiber embedded in a soft matrix, illustrates the potential of the cohesive phase-field model.},

  abstract     = {Fracture is one of the most common failure modes in brittle materials. It can drastically decrease material integrity and structural strength. To address this issue, we propose a level-set (LS) based topology optimization procedure to optimize the distribution of reinforced inclusions within matrix materials subject to the volume constraint for maximizing structural resistance to fracture. A phase-field fracture model is formulated herein to simulate crack initiation and propagation, in which a staggered algorithm is developed to solve such time-dependent crack propagation problems. In line with diffusive damage of the phase-field approach for fracture; topological derivatives, which provide gradient information for the topology optimization in a LS framework, are derived for fracture mechanics problems. A reaction-diffusion equation is adopted to update the LS function within a finite element framework. This avoids the reinitialization by overcoming the limitation to time step with the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. In this article, three numerical examples, namely, a L-shaped section, a rectangular slab with predefined cracks, and an all-ceramic onlay dental bridge (namely, fixed partial denture), are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LS based topology optimization for enhancing fracture resistance of multimaterial composite structures in a phase-field fracture context.},

To verify the performance of LFCSA, two optimization algorithm, which is the standard CSA and the particle swarm optimization algorithm with Levy flight (LFPSO), are applied to FEMU of the simple beam. The result of the comparison shows that the LFCSA has sufficient convergence speed and global search ability in the implementation of FEMU.

To improve this scenario, a hierarchy of enriched flux approximations is considered, by adding internal shape functions up to a higher degree k + n , n &gt;0, while keeping the original normal traces of degree k . The resulting enriched approximations, using multilinear transformations, keep the original flux accuracy (of order k +1 with affine elements or reduced order k otherwise), but enhanced divergence (of order k + n +1, in the affine case, or k + n −1 otherwise) can be reached. The reduced flux accuracy due to quadrilateral face distortions cannot be corrected by including higher order internal functions. The enriched spaces are applied to the mixed finite element formulation of Darcy&#39;s model.

Iterative solvers with matrix-free operator evaluation have emerged as an attractive alternative to sparse matrices in the fluid dynamics and wave propagation communities because they significantly reduce the memory traffic, the limiting factor in classical finite element solvers. Specifically, we study different matrix-free realizations of the finite element tangent operator and determine whether generalized methods of incorporating complex constitutive behavior might be feasible. In order to improve the convergence behavior of iterative solvers, we also propose a method by which to construct level tangent operators and employ them to define a geometric multigrid preconditioner. The performance of the matrix-free operator and the geometric multigrid preconditioner is compared to the matrix-based implementation with an algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner on a single node for a representative numerical example of a heterogeneous hyperelastic material in two and three dimensions. We find that matrix-free methods for finite-strain solid mechanics are very promising, outperforming linear matrix-based schemes by two to five times, and that it is possible to develop numerically efficient implementations that are independent of the hyperelastic constitutive law.},

It is well known that the inherent characteristics of isogeometric analysis (IGA) are superior in shape optimization problems. Inheriting the characteristics of IGA, an auxiliary projection-based MG reanalysis (MGR) is proposed to construct mapping between the mesh before modification and after modification during the optimization process. Subsequently, MG-IGR is utilized to reanalyze the modified design efficiently by reusing the initial evaluated results. Moreover, the proposed MG-IGR also eliminates the restriction of mesh consistency. In this framework, the structure can be designed directly through parameterized control of the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) model, and the MG-IGR fast solver enables any metaheuristic algorithm to perform the optimization procedure. Moreover, the accuracy of the simulation can be guaranteed by the NURBS model and the convergence criterion of the MG. Finally, two geometric optimization examples are presented to validate the performance of the developed framework.},

By contrast to our previous work, several important features are included which greatly assist the optimizer in dealing with the strongly discontinuous brittle fracture process, including a new objective function, which provides additional path information to the optimizer. Increased local control of the topology is introduced via a smoothed threshold function in the phase field fracture formulation and a constraint relaxation continuation scheme is proposed to alleviate some difficulty during the initial optimization iterations. The derivation of the analytical, path-dependent sensitivities for the relevant functions is provided and the results from two benchmark numerical examples are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A cohesive-contact constitutive model is introduced to characterize the complex mechanical behavior of the fracture process zone. To avoid the stress oscillations and ill-conditioned system matrix that often occur in the conventional contact approach, the proposed algorithm employs a special dual Lagrange multiplier to impose the contact constraint. This Lagrange multiplier is constructed by means of the area-weighted average and biorthogonality conditions at the element level. The system matrix can be condensed into a positive definite matrix with an unchanged size at a very low computational cost. In addition, we illustrate solving the cohesive crack contact problem using a novel iteration strategy. Several numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the efficiency and high-quality results of our method in contact analysis of cohesive cracks.},

  abstract     = {Coupled diffusion of solvent molecules and mechanical stretching of polymeric networks induced swelling/deswelling in polymeric gels contributes to the ability of its “smart response” and “environmental sensitivity.” In this article, the coupled diffusion and large deformation of polymeric gels are clarified into three kinds of deformation conditions which all involve swelling/deswelling. The real numerical challenge is identified for simulating swelling/deswelling induced deformation of gels by solving the partial deferential control equation of a popular monophase model for gels in steady equilibrium state with a standard process of numerical discretization. To address the numerical challenge, a generalized decoupling numerical framework is developed based on a multiplicative decomposition of deformation gradient. The proposed framework is more flexible and works for almost all cases of deformation of gels no matter involving swelling/deswelling or not. Its element-free implementation is also developed using the element-free IMLS-Ritz method and is validated through analyzing the three-dimensional stable and unstable large deformation of the constrained gel cube and tube.},

There are two major innovations in the present formulation. First, the independent nodal rotation degrees of freedom (DOFs) are employed to enhance the standard 3D isoparametric interpolation for obtaining the displacement and strain test functions, as well as to approximatively design the physical rotation field for deriving the curvature test function. Second, the equilibrium stress functions instead of the analytical functions are used to formulate the stress trial function whilst the couple stress trial function is directly obtained from the curvature test function by using the constitutive relationship. Besides, the penalty function is introduced into the virtual work principle for enforcing the C 1 continuity condition in weak sense. Several benchmark examples are examined and the numerical results demonstrate that the element can simulate the size-dependent mechanical behaviors well, exhibiting satisfactory accuracy and low susceptibility to mesh distortion.},

On the contrary to what is normally done in the framework of finite-element reduced order methods, different geometries are not mapped to a common reference domain: the method relies on basis functions defined on an average deformed configuration and makes use of the discrete empirical interpolation method to handle together nonaffinity of the parametrization and nonlinearities. In the first numerical example, different mesh motion strategies, based on a Laplacian smoothing technique and on a radial basis function approach, are analyzed and compared on a heat transfer problem. Particular attention is devoted to the role of the nonorthogonal correction. In the second numerical example, the methodology is tested on a geometrically parametrized incompressible Navier-Stokes problem. In this case, the reduced order model is constructed following the same segregated approach used at the full order level.},

In this paper, two widely adopted remedies for volumetric locking (F-bar and mixed field) are evaluated, and the superior performance of the mixed field method is demonstrated. Building on the mixed field formulation, a gradient enhancement is further incorporated to resolve the mesh sensitivity. It is shown that a localizing gradient enhancement can avoid a spurious spreading of damage induced by the conventional gradient approach. A locking-free, regularized ductile fracture is first presented via a uniformly tapering plate example. Finally, a shear plate test on ferrite-bainite steel is considered.

  abstract     = {Defects such as gas pores can be formed and trapped in the fusion zone during laser welding. These defects can significantly affect the mechanical reliability of the welded joint. Current nondestructive inspection technologies are able to detect micro-voids in a mass production context. Finite element analysis can therefore be used to assess the lifetime of an observed component via image-based modeling. Unfortunately, running a simulation per component entails a huge and generally unaffordable computational cost. In addition, voids do not admit a parametric modeling. In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to study the impact of defects on the mechanical response of a welded joint. It is based on model order reduction techniques that decrease the computational cost of each simulation related to an image-based modeling. To tackle the reduction of nonparametric defects, a multiscale construction of the reduced basis is proposed, although no scale separation is assumed when computing the mechanical response of the structure. Some empirical modes are representing the structure behavior and other empirical modes are related to the defect-induced local fluctuations. They are then assembled to simulate a defective joint. Assets and limitations of the proposed method are explored through a simplified two-dimensional (2D) problem. For the sake of reproducibility, this 2D problem is fully parametric. Finally, a realistic three-dimensional (3D) industrial case is presented, where voids geometries have been measured via computed tomography. This 3D problem being nonparametric, fluctuation modes must be computed on the fly, once the computed tomography has been performed.},

Using a phenomenological material model, the thermomechanical response of the SMA structure is solved through inelastic finite element analysis, while assuming a transient but spatially uniform temperature distribution. The material distribution is parameterized via a SIMP formulation, with gradient-based optimization used to perform the optimization search. We derive a transient, bilevel adjoint formulation for analytically computing the design sensitivities. We demonstrate the proposed design framework using a series of two-dimensional thermomechanical benchmark problems. These examples include design for optimal displacement due to the TWSME, and design for maximum mechanical advantage while accounting for pseudoelasticity.},

A stable XFEM/GFEM is employed to embed the displacement and damage fields at the global scale. The proposed method accommodates approximation spaces that evolve between load steps, while preserving a fixed background mesh for the structural problem. In addition, a prediction-correction algorithm is employed to facilitate the dynamic evolution of the confined crack regions within a load step.

Abandoning H 1 -conformity allows us to construct finite elements which are—due to an application of the Piola transformation—exactly tangential. To reintroduce continuity (in a weak sense) we make use of (hybrid) discontinuous Galerkin techniques. To further improve this approach, -conforming finite elements can be used to obtain exactly divergence-free velocity solutions. We present several new finite element discretizations.

In a design under uncertainty problem, our method obtains the most robust design that is not stochastically dominated faster than a multiobjective optimization. In a car suspension design problem, our method obtains superior designs according to a k-optimality condition than previously suggested multiobjective approaches to this problem.

For this purpose the formulation of the original CEM is reorganized. The new approach is embedded in the standard framework of the Galerkin-based finite-element method (FEM), which uses disconnected element-wise crack openings for capturing crack initiation and propagation. The similarity between the proposed global cracking elements (GCEs) and the standard nine-node quadrilateral element (Q9) suggests a special procedure: the degrees of freedom of the center node of the Q9, originally defining the displacements, are “borrowed” to describe the crack openings of the GCE. The proposed approach does not need remeshing, enrichment, or a crack-tracking strategy, and it avoids a precise description of the crack tip. Several benchmark tests provide evidence that the new approach inherits from the CEM most of the advantages. The numerical stability and robustness of the GCEM are better than the ones of the CEM. However, presently only quadrilateral elements with nonlinear interpolations of the displacement field can be used.},

For linear design, compared to traditional GSM which are limited to designing slender members, the P-GSM can effectively resolve this limitation and generate functionally graded lattice structures. For additive manufacturing-oriented design, the manufacturing abilities are the key factors to constrain the feasible design space, for example, minimum length and geometry complexity. Conventional density-based method, where each element works as a variable, always results in complex geometry with large number of small intricate features, while these small features are often not manufacturable even by 3D printing and lose its geometric accuracy after postprocessing. The proposed P-GSM is an effective method for controlling geometric complexity and minimum length for optimal design, while it is capable of designing self-supporting structures naturally. In optimization progress, some bars may be disconnected from each other (floating in the air). For buckling-induced design, this issue becomes critical due to severe mesh distortion in the void space caused by disconnection between members, while P-GSM has ability to overcome this issue. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method, three different design problems ranging from compliance optimization to buckling-induced mechanism design are presented and discussed in details.},

We present a robust algorithm based on a sequence of three modified Newton procedures to solve the constrained minimization problem. In the literature, numerical integration rules for the tetrahedron are available up to order p =15. We obtain integration rules for the tetrahedron from p =2 to p =20, which are computed using multiprecision arithmetic. For p ≤15, our approach provides integration rules that have the same or fewer number of integration points than existing rules; for p =16 to p =20, our rules are new. Numerical tests are presented that verify the polynomial-precision of the cubature rules. Convergence studies are performed for the integration of exponential, rational, weakly singular and trigonometric test functions over tetrahedra with flat and curved faces. In all tests, improvements in accuracy is realized as p is increased, though in some cases nonmonotonic convergence is observed.},

The fine grid is defined in the local large-deformation regions to accurately capture the complex material responses, whereas other spatial domains are discritized by coarse grids. In the overlapping domain between the fine and coarse grids, the constraint of particle displacements obtained with different grids is enforced using the Lagrange multiplier method to eliminate the spurious stress reflection at the fine/coarse grid interface. Representative numerical examples have shown that the BSMPM simulations with the proposed local grid refinement scheme could provide the solutions in good agreement with those obtained with the uniformly fine grid, and that no significant spurious stress reflection is induced at the fine/coarse grid interface, even for the bridging domain size as small as the cell size of the fine grid. It is also found that the proposed local grid refinement method can significantly reduce the BSMPM computational time compared with the cases for uniformly fine grids.

  abstract     = {“Open-close iteration” is a crucial algorithm for handling complex contacts in numerical manifold method (NMM) and discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA). This algorithm has proved to be robust and efficient for decades. However, as some researchers have pointed out, the original open-close iteration may involve errors in sliding tests, especially in critical sliding tests with cohesive contacts. In this study, two major problems in the original algorithm are found to be nonconvergent contact force and early removed cohesive strength. The modifications are the following: (a) a frictional spring. By avoiding the trail value of normal contact force, we added a new frictional spring to the iteration scheme. This spring can apply accurate friction and can help ensure the convergence of contact forces. (b) A cohesive contact model. The original scheme can encounter an “early failure” in cohesive contacts. After investigating how contacts provide shear resistance, we found the cause and then provided a simple correction of the cohesive issue. The new algorithms in this article are essential for accurately simulating contacts by NMM/DDA.},

  abstract     = {In this work, the modally equivalent perturbed system (MEPS) which was originally developed for finding the parametrically rich solution space of linear time-invariant systems is modified for time-varying cases and applied to find the characteristically rich nonlinear solution space given arbitrary initial or boundary conditions, or system inputs. An integral form of the non-Hamiltonian Liouville equation is derived such that a rich ensemble average of its solutions covers a broad range of the modal space when a maximum uncertainty is present in the solutions. The MEPS degenerates the integrated Liouville equation into a linear differential equation with the Gauge Modal Invariance, a newly found field property that allows extending the application beyond the initial conditions or impulse inputs, making it possible to calculate the rich set of basis modes by taking snapshots of the linear responses at a considerably low computational cost. The proposed theory and algorithm are demonstrated using a computational model of a two-dimensional incompressible, viscous flow at low Reynolds numbers. It is shown that the basis modes obtained herein, when used in conjunction with a low dimensional modeling, reproduce time simulation results very accurately for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {This contribution proposes the first three-dimensional (3D) beam-beam interaction model for molecular interactions between curved slender fibers undergoing large deformations. While the general model is not restricted to a specific beam formulation, in the present work, it is combined with the geometrically exact beam theory and discretized via the finite element method. A direct evaluation of the total interaction potential for general 3D bodies requires the integration of contributions from molecule or charge distributions over the volumes of the interaction partners, leading to a six-dimensional integral (two nested 3D integrals) that has to be solved numerically. Here, we propose a novel strategy to formulate reduced section-section interaction laws for the resultant interaction potential between a pair of cross-sections of two slender fibers such that only two one-dimensional integrals along the fibers&#39; length directions have to be solved numerically. This section-section interaction potential (SSIP) approach yields a significant gain in efficiency, which is essential to enable the simulation of relevant time and length scales for many practical applications. In a first step, the generic structure of SSIP laws, which is suitable for the most general interaction scenario (eg, fibers with arbitrary cross-section shape and inhomogeneous atomic/charge density within the cross-section) is presented. Assuming circular, homogeneous cross-sections, in a next step, specific analytical expressions for SSIP laws describing short-range volume interactions (eg, van der Waals (vdW) or steric interactions) and long-range surface interactions (eg, Coulomb interactions) are proposed. Besides ready-to-use expressions for the total interaction potential, also the resulting virtual work contributions, its finite element discretizations, as well as a suitable numerical regularization for the limit of zero separation are derived. The validity of the SSIP laws, as well as the accuracy and robustness of the general SSIP approach to beam-beam interactions, is thoroughly verified by means of a set of numerical examples considering steric repulsion, electrostatic, or vdW adhesion.},

It is shown that to satisfy the kinetic energy conservation, the use of zero or negative masses for enriched degrees of freedom of lumped mass matrix may be necessary. For a completely cracked element, by lumping the mass of each side of the interface into the finite element nodes located at the same side and assigning zero masses to the enriched degrees of freedom, the kinetic energy for rigid body translations is conserved without transferring spurious energy across the interface. The time integration is performed by adopting an explicit-implicit technique, where the regular and enriched degrees of freedom are treated explicitly and implicitly, respectively. The proposed method can be viewed as a general mass lumping scheme for the variants of the extended finite element methods because it can be used irrespective of the enrichment method. It also preserves the optimal critical time step of an intact finite element by treating the enriched degrees of freedom implicitly. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed mass matrix are validated with several benchmark examples.},

Its attractiveness is due to its abilities to simulate problems, involving large deformations resulting from the absence of mesh as well as the development of the total-Lagrangian version of SPH (TLSPH) to solve tensile instabilities and an hourglass control algorithm to reduce rank-deficiency problems. However, when TLSPH is used with continuum damage mechanics, nonphysical residual forces can emerge and lead to instabilities. To solve this issue, the “pseudospring” method that scales the kernel function with damage was proposed by Chakraborty and Shaw. This method preserves local linear momentum and is stable for elastic solids but can generate instabilities when solids damage after experiencing high plastic strains. In this contribution, we present a new TLSPH approximation that conserves both linear and angular momenta, which is suitable for the simulation of damage and fracture of ductile materials. Using single-edge notched samples and tensile tests, we show that this approximation is stable whatever the stress/strain state and is in good agreement with finite element simulations and experimental results.},

In our approach, the weak form integrals are nodally integrated using nodal representative cells that carry the nodal displacements and state variables such as strains and stresses. The nodal integration is performed using the virtual element decomposition, wherein the bilinear form is decomposed into a consistency part and a stability part that ensure consistency and stability of the method. The performance of the proposed nodal integration scheme is assessed through benchmark problems in linear and nonlinear analyses of solids for small displacements and small-strain kinematics. Numerical results are presented for linear elastostatics and linear elastodynamics and viscoelasticity.

In this work, we present a reduction framework for fracture simulations that leaves out the offline training phase and instead adaptively constructs reduced solutions spaces online . We apply the framework to the thick level set (TLS) method, a novel approach for modeling fracture able to model crack initiation, propagation, branching, and merging. The analysis starts with a fully-solved load step, after which two consecutive reduction operations—the proper orthogonal decomposition and the empirical cubature method—are performed. Numerical features specific to the TLS method are used to define an adaptive domain decomposition scheme that allows for three levels of model reduction coexisting on the same finite element mesh. Special solutions are proposed that allow the framework to deal with enriched nodes and a dynamic number of integration points. We demonstrate and assess the performance of the framework with a number of numerical examples.},

In this article, two strategies are proposed to efficiently reuse previous stiffness matrix factorisations and their corresponding solutions in subsequent linear analyses, since the global system of linear equations representing the FE model changes only locally. The first is based on a direct solution method in combination with the Woodbury matrix identity, to compute the inverse of a low-rank corrected stiffness matrix relatively cheaply. The second is a variation of the traditional incomplete LU preconditioned conjugate gradient method, wherein the preconditioner is the complete factorisation of a previous analysis step&#39;s stiffness matrix. For both the approaches, optimal points at which the factorisation is recomputed are determined such that the total analysis time is minimised. Comparison and validation against a traditional parallel direct sparse solver, with regard to a two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) benchmark study, illustrates the improved performance of the Woodbury-based direct solver over its counterparts, especially for large 3D problems.},

A surrogate-based approach (Gaussian Processes) combined with adaptive experimental designs allows to iteratively increase the accuracy of the surrogate while keeping the overall number of J evaluations low. Direct use of Monte-Carlo simulation even on the surrogate model being too expensive, the key idea consists in using an importance sampling method based on an isotropic-centered Gaussian with large standard deviation permitting a cheap estimation of small quantiles based on the surrogate model. Similar to AK-MCS as presented in the work of Schöbi et al., (2016), the surrogate is adaptively refined using a parallel infill criterion of an algorithm suitable for very small failure probability estimation. Additionally, a multi-quantile selection approach is developed, allowing to further exploit high-performance computing architectures. We illustrate the performances of the proposed method on several two to eight-dimensional cases. Accurate results are obtained with less than 100 evaluations of J on the considered benchmark cases.},

Then a high-fidelity (HF) stochastic Kriging model is built on the reduced space by mapping the original high-dimensional input onto the identified AS. The effective dimensionality of the AS is estimated by maximum likelihood estimation technique. Finally, an accurate HF surrogate model is obtained for uncertainty propagation of high-dimensional stochastic problems. The proposed method is validated by two challenging high-dimensional stochastic examples, and the results demonstrate that our method is effective for high-dimensional uncertainty propagation.},

  abstract     = {In low Mach number aeroacoustics, the known disparity of length scales makes it possible to apply well-suited simulation models using different meshes for flow and acoustics. The workflow of these hybrid methodologies include performing an unsteady flow simulation, computing the acoustic sources, and simulating the acoustic field. Therefore, hybrid methods seek for robust and flexible procedures, providing a conservative mesh to mesh interpolation of the sources while ensuring high computational efficiency. We propose a highly specialized radial basis function interpolation for the challenges during hybrid simulations. First, the computationally efficient local radial basis function interpolation in conjunction with a connectivity-based neighbor search technique is presented. Second, we discuss the computation of spatial derivatives based on radial basis functions. These derivatives are computed in a local-global approach, using a Gaussian kernel on local point stencils. Third, radial basis function interpolation and derivatives are used to compute complex aeroacoustic source terms. These ingredients are necessary to provide flexible source term calculations that robustly connect flow and acoustics. Finally, the capabilities of the presented approach are shown in a numerical experiment with a co-rotating vortex pair.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses the concepts of auto- and cross-interdependence in interval field finite element analysis. In classic interval analysis, independent intervals are used to construct hyper-rectangular input spaces that correspond to the bounded uncertainty that is present on some model parameters. This is a direct result from the inability of modeling interdependence. Such assumption of complete independence might prove in some cases to be highly over-conservative. A first example is the modeling of spatial uncertainty, where the interdependence is governed by allowable spatial gradients of field realizations. Secondly, interdependence can also occur in case uncertainty in several structural quantities has the same root cause (eg, the manufacturing process). Recent work by the authors introduced concepts for modeling dependence between intervals in a spatial and multivariate context. However, it is unclear how an analyst has to deal with multiple quantities that have a spatial uncertainty component and are furthermore interdependent. This paper presents an approach to link multiple interval fields using recently introduced convex hull pair constructions and inverse distance weighting interpolation. Two case studies to illustrate the new methodology are included, proving the flexibility of the methodology in the modeling of auto- and cross-interdependence between multiple interval scalars and/or interval fields.},

The quadrilateral shell element can be utilized to consider large deformations for nearly incompressible materials, and its performance is demonstrated in small and large deformation analyses of hyperelastic materials in this study. Formulation of the proposed shell element is based on extension of the MITC4 shell element. A displacement variation in the thickness direction is introduced to evaluate the change in thickness. In the proposed approach, the thickness direction is defined using the director vectors at each midsurface node. The thickness-stretch is approximated by the movements of additional nodes, which are placed along the thickness direction from the bottom to the top surface. The transverse normal strain is calculated using these additional nodes without assuming the plane stress condition; hence, a three-dimensional constitutive equation can be employed without any modification. In this work, the authors apply an assumed strain technique to the special shell element to alleviate volumetric locking for nearly incompressible materials. Several numerical examples are presented to examine the effectiveness of the proposed element.},

Previously, a Laplace transform-based method was developed to determine initial conditions of higher order derivatives of predictor algorithms together with the corrector algorithms cast in form of higher order Newton-Raphson schemes, which are considered as consistent tangent operators that preserve quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence characteristics. For convenience, algorithms are applied to the solution of the van der Pol and Duffing&#39;s equations to show the concepts, but the procedures can also be applied to other systems such as the Bouc&#39;s, Coulomb&#39;s, and Mathieu equations.

On the one hand, the use of a FE mesh facilitates the coupling of measurements with simulation tools, while on the other hand, it provides a unique, fine description of both the geometry and the displacement, which often makes the shape measurement problem highly ill-posed. As a remedy, we propose a hybrid isogeometric-FE strategy that can measure a shape in terms of spline functions while considering as an input and output the analysis-suitable FE mesh. Making use of the appealing spline refinement procedures and of Bézier-based operators, multilevel smooth spline discretizations are built concurrently with the initial FE subspace and related to the multiscale images used for the initialization of the shape measurement. It results in a geometrically sound regularization which provides a spline parametrization of the optimal shape along with its FE twin. A noninvasive implementation from an existing FE-SDIC code is also detailed. The performance of the proposed method is assessed on real images and comparisons are made with other published techniques to prove its efficiency.},

The transverse shear stress field is assumed to follow a quadratic distribution in thick face layers and a uniform distribution in soft core. Based on stress-strain relations, transverse shear strain is obtained, and in-plane displacement field is determined by taking the integral of the transverse shear stain. By enforcing interlaminar displacement continuity, an explicit displacement field expression containing only displacement variables is formulated. In this formulation, interlaminar continuity conditions of displacement and transverse shear stress are satisfied simultaneously, and transverse shear and crosssectional warping effects in thick face layers are accurately taken account. To show characteristics and advantages of the present model, some classical theoretical models are further developed under different kinematic assumptions. The governing equations are derived using Hamilton principle, and finite element solutions for static and dynamic analysis of sandwich beams are presented. Comparisons with exact solution and other well-known solutions, well demonstrate high accuracy of the present model for sandwich beams with different features. Besides, numerical discussions further reflect accuracy advantages of the present model in static and dynamic analysis of sandwich beams.},

The subscale problem on the representative volume element (RVE) is correspondingly defined as finding the response of the RVE subjected to effective variables (strain, slip, and slip gradient) imposed from the large scale. A novel volumetric definition of effective reinforcement slip and its gradient is devised, and the corresponding subscale problem is formulated. The newly defined effective variables are imposed on the RVE in a weak sense using Lagrange multipliers. The response of the RVEs of different sizes was investigated by means of pull-through tests, and the novel boundary condition type was used in FE 2 analyses of a deep beam. Locally, prescribing the macroscopic reinforcement slip and its gradient in the proposed manner resulted in reduced RVE-size dependency of effective work conjugates, which allows for more objective description of reinforcement slip in two-scale modeling of reinforced concrete. Globally, this formulation produced more consistent amplitudes of effective slip fluctuations and more consistent maximum crack width predictions.},

As a result, the initial stiffness in the prefailure regime is omitted without having to remesh the crack path during the crack propagation. The interface model is used in combination with different discretization techniques, including matching and nonmatching meshes. This is possible due to the DG method&#39;s weak continuity constraint. Moreover, the locking problem in the bulk is cured by the application of a reduced Gaussian integration scheme on the boundary terms. The performance of the new cohesive discontinuous Galerkin elements with different integration schemes is compared with one of the standard intrinsic cohesive models.

Meanwhile, the governing equations of the coupled system are solved by the partitioned method in an iterative way to achieve a strong coupling effect. The breakthrough of the proposed resolved CFDEM method lies in the calculation of the fluid flow in fixed grids with high resolution, along with an accurate simulation of the interaction between the fluid and the discontinuous solids with arbitrary shapes and large movement. The reliability and the accuracy of the new method are validated by calculating several well-known benchmark examples. Good agreements are achieved between the present and the known results.},

  abstract     = {In this work, two well-known approaches for mixed finite elements are combined to render three novel classes of elements. First, the widely used enhanced assumed strain (EAS) method is considered. Its key idea is to enhance a compatible kinematic field with an incompatible part. The second concept is a framework for mixed elements inspired by polyconvex strain-energy functions, in which the deformation gradient, its cofactor and determinant are three principal kinematic fields. The key idea for the novel elements is to treat enhancement of those three fields separately. This approach leads to a plethora of novel enhancement strategies and promising mixed finite elements. Some key properties of the newly proposed mixed approaches are that they are based on a Hu-Washizu type variational functional, fulfill the patch test, are frame-invariant, can be constructed completely locking free and show no spurious hourglassing in elasticity. Furthermore, they give additional insight into the mechanisms of standard EAS elements. Extensive numerical investigations are performed to assess the elements&#39; behavior in elastic and elasto-plastic simulations.},

In this context, we propose two algorithms based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, one of the most powerful Quasi-Newton schemes. To be specific, we use the BFGS update formula to approximate the global Hessian or, alternatively, the local material tangent stiffness. Both for Newton and Quasi-Newton methods, a globalization technique is necessary to ensure global convergence. Specific to the FFT-based context, we promote a Dong-type line search, avoiding function evaluations altogether. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the forcing term, that is, the accuracy for solving the linear system, on the overall performance of inexact (Quasi-)Newton methods. This work concludes with numerical experiments, comparing the convergence characteristics and runtime of the proposed techniques for complex microstructures with nonlinear material behavior and finite as well as infinite material contrast.},

The proposed mass tailoring methods are applicable to elemental, substructural as well as global systems, requiring no modifications of finite element generation routines. It becomes most computationally attractive when used in conjunction with partitioned formulation as the number of higher (or lower) modes to be filtered out (or retained) are significantly reduced. Numerical experiments with the proposed method demonstrate that they are effective in filtering out higher modes in bars, beams, plain stress, and plate bending problems while preserving the dominant low-frequency contents.},

The current study focuses on the stabilization of ROMs built from high-fidelity simulation data of a supersonic flow passing a circular cylinder, which features strong interactions between shockwaves and vortices. As shown in previous literatures and the current study, an implicit subspace correction (ISC) method is efficient in the stabilization of similar problems, but its accuracy is not consistent when applied on different ROMs; on the other hand, an eigenvalue reassignment (ER) method delivers superb accuracy when the mode number is small, but becomes too expensive and less robust as the number increases. A Hybrid method is proposed here to balance the computational cost while improving the overall robustness/accuracy in ROM stabilization. The Hybrid method first handles the majority of the modes using the ISC method and then applies the ER method to fine tune a smaller number of modes under a constraint for accuracy. Furthermore, when the typical L2 inner product is changed to a symmetry inner product in both POD computation and Galerkin projection, the performance of the stabilized ROMs is substantially improved for all methods.},

  abstract     = {Microstructural patterns emerge ubiquitously during phase transformations, deformation twinning, or crystal plasticity. Challenges are the prediction of such microstructural patterns and the resulting effective material behavior. Mathematically, the experimentally observed patterns are energy-minimizing sequences produced by an underlying non-(quasi)convex strain energy. Therefore, identifying the microstructure and effective response is linked to finding the quasiconvex, relaxed energy. Due to its nonlocal nature, quasiconvexification has traditionally been limited to (semi-)analytical techniques or has been dealt with by numerical techniques such as the finite element method (FEM). Both have been restricted to primarily simple material models. We here contrast three numerical techniques—FEM, a Fourier-based spectral formulation, and a meshless maximum-entropy (max-ent) method. We demonstrate their performance by minimizing the energy of a representative volume element for both hyperelasticity and finite-strain phase transformations. Unlike FEM, which fails to converge in most scenarios, the Fourier-based spectral formulation (FFT) scheme captures microstructures of intriguingly high resolution, whereas max-ent is superior at approximating the relaxed energy. None of the methods are capable of accurately predicting both microstructures and relaxed energy; yet, both FFT and max-ent show significant advantages over FEM. Numerical errors are explained by the energy associated with microstructural interfaces in the numerical techniques compared here.},

However, one ever-present criticism of TO, and especially of multimaterial (MM) optimization, is that neither method can produce structures that are practical to manufacture. Optimal joint design is one of the main requirements for manufacturability. This article proposes a new density-based methodology for performing simultaneous MMTO and multijoint TO. This algorithm can simultaneously determine the optimum selection and placement of structural materials, as well as the optimum selection and placement of joints at material interfaces. In order to achieve this, a new solid isotropic material with penalization-based interpolation scheme is proposed. A process for identifying dissimilar material interfaces based on spatial gradients is also discussed. The capabilities of the algorithm are demonstrated using four case studies. Through these case studies, the coupling between the optimal structural material design and the optimal joint design is investigated. Total joint cost is considered as both an objective and a constraint in the optimization problem statement. Using the biobjective problem statement, the tradeoff between total joint cost and structural compliance is explored. Finally, a method for enforcing tooling accessibility constraints in joint design is presented.},

In this article, differential algebraic equations (DAEs) of a multibody system are constructed using the D&#39;Alembert&#39;s principle, and a novel nonsmooth dynamics method based on symplectic discrete format is proposed. The symplectic discrete format can maintain the energy conservation of a conservative system; this property is expected to extend to nonconservative systems with nonsmooth phenomena in this article. To evaluate the properties of the proposed method, several numerical examples are considered, and the results of the proposed method are compared with those of Moreau&#39;s midpoint rule. The results demonstrate that the solutions obtained using the proposed method, which is based on the symplectic discrete format, can realize a higher solution accuracy and lower numerical energy dissipation, even under a large time step.},

For this purpose, the point selection strategy for structures involving independent basic variables is first revisited. As an improvement, a generalized F-discrepancy diminishing oriented iterative screening algorithm is proposed. Then, combining with the conditional sampling method, a conditional point set rearrangement method and a conditional iterative screening-rearrangement method are proposed for probabilistically dependent variables. These new point selection strategies are readily incorporated into the probability density evolution method for uncertainty quantification of nonlinear structures involving dependent random parameters, which is characterized by copula function. The proposed methods are illustrated by two examples including a shear frame with hysteretic restoring forces and a reinforced concrete frame structure with the damage constitutive model of concrete, where the material parameters are probabilistically dependent. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Problems to be studied are discussed.},

Therefore, it is necessary to take uncertainty into account in structural design. This article proposes an efficient method for robust concurrent topology optimization of multiscale structure under single or multiple load cases. The weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of the structural compliance is minimized and constraints are imposed to both the volume fractions of macrostructure and microstructure. The effective properties of the microstructure are calculated via the homogenization method. An efficient sensitivity analysis method is proposed based on the superposition principle and orthogonal similarity transformation of real symmetric matrices. To further reduce the computational cost, an efficient decoupled sensitivity analysis method for microscale design variables is proposed. The bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization method is employed to obtain black and white designs for both macrostructure and microstructure. Several two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the effects of load uncertainty on the optimal design of both macrostructure and microstructure.},

These constraints are implemented for a smooth maximum function using global aggregation. A linear elastic finite element model is used, implementing solid isotropic material with penalization. Design sensitivities are determined by the adjoint method. The method of moving asymptotes is used to solve the numerical optimization problem. Two different optimization statements are used. Each requires a compliance limit and some aspect of continuation. The buckling analysis is linear, considering the generalized eigenvalue problem of the conventional and stress stiffness matrices. Various symmetries, base materials, and starting geometries are considered. This leads to novel topologies that all achieve the target effective shear modulus of 10 MPa, while staying within the stress constraint. The stress-only designs generally were susceptible to buckling failure. A family of designs (columnar, noninterconnected representative unit cells) that emerge in this study appears to exhibit favorable properties for this application.},

  abstract     = {In the context of eigenfracture scheme, the work at hand introduces a variational eigenerosion approach for inelastic materials. The theory seizes situations where the material accumulates large amounts of plastic deformations. For these cases, the surface energy entering the energy balance equation is rescaled to favor fracture, thus energy minimization delivers automatically the crack-tracking solution also for inelastic cases. The minimization approach is sound and preserves the mathematical properties necessary for the Γ-limit proof, thus the existence of (local) minimizers is guaranteed by the Γ-convergence theory. Although it is not possible to demonstrate that the obtained minimizers are global, satisfactory results are obtained with the local minimizers provided by the method. Furthermore, with the goal of addressing the constitutive behavior of concrete, a Drucker-Prager viscoplastic consistency model is introduced in the microplane setting. The model delivers a rate-dependent three-surface smooth yield function that requires hardening and hardening-rate parameters. The independent evolution of viscoplasticity in different microplanes induces anisotropy in the mechanical response. The sound performance of the model is illustrated via numerical examples for both rate-independent and rate-dependent plasticity.},

  abstract     = {This article reports a brand-new methodology based on active learning Kriging model for hybrid reliability analysis (HRA) with both random and interval variables. Unlike probabilistic reliability analysis, the limit state surface (LSS) of HRA is projected into a banded region in the domain of random variables. Only approximating the bounds of the banded region is able to meet the accuracy requirement of HRA. In the proposed methodology, the HRA problem is innovatively transformed into a traditional system reliability analysis (SRA) problem with numerous failure modes. And then a basic idea from the field of SRA is borrowed into HRA, and the so-called truncated candidate region (TCR) for HRA is proposed. In each iteration, the negligible region which probably does not influence the bounds estimation of failure probability is truncated from the original candidate region, and the optimal training point is chosen from the TCR. After several iterations, the TCR will converge to the true ideal candidate region, that is, the candidate region without the inner part of LSS, and the added training points will be driven to the region around the bounds of LSS. The performance of the proposed method is compared with relevant methods by five case studies.},

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a canonical test problem from the UQ literature and a complex multiphysics model that simulates the performance of an integrated nozzle for an unmanned aerospace vehicle.

  abstract     = {A novel smoothing particle hydrodynamics (SPH)-like Lagrangian meshfree method, named as Lagrangian gradient smoothing method (L-GSM), has been proposed to avoid the “tensile instability” issue in SPH simulation by replacing the SPH particle-summation gradient approximation technique with a local grid-based GSM gradient smoothing operator. The L-GSM model has been proven effective and efficient when applied to a wide range of large deformation problems for fluids and flowing solids in two-dimensional case. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) L-GSM numerical framework is proposed for simulating large deformation problems with the existence of free surfaces through developing a widely adaptable 3D gradient smoothing domain (GSD) constructing algorithm. It includes three key novel ingredients: (i) the localized GSD based on an efficient distance-oriented particle-searching algorithm enabling both easy implementation and efficient computation; (ii) a novel algorithm for constructing 3D GSD to guarantee the effectiveness of the 3D GSM gradient operator adaptable to any extreme cases; (iii) a robust normalized 3D GSM gradient operator formulation that can restore the accuracy of gradient approximation even on boundary interface. The effectiveness of the proposed 3D GSD-constructing algorithm is first verified under various distribution conditions of particles. The accuracy of the proposed adaptable 3D GSM gradient algorithm is then examined through conducting a series of numerical experiments with different spacing ratios. Finally, the 3D L-GSM numerical framework is applied to solve a practical problem of free surface flows with large deformation: collapse of a soil column. The results reveal that the present adaptable 3D L-GSM numerical framework can effectively handle the large deformation problems, like flowing solids, with a constantly changing arbitrary free surface profile.},

The impact event is ill-posed and requires a regularization to avoid propagating stress oscillations. A nonlinear mesh-dependent penalty regularization is used, where the stiffness of the penalty regularization increases upon mesh refinement. Explicit time integration methods are well suited for wave propagation problems, but are efficient only for diagonal mass matrices. Using a spectral element discretization in combination with a NURBS contact layer the bulk part of the mass matrix is diagonal.},

B-spline basis functions are employed for the IGA discretization procedure to improve the performance of electromagnetic wave analysis in a unit cell and topology optimization. Also, to keep the same order of continuity on the periodic boundaries as on other element edges in the domain, we propose the extended domain approach, while incorporating Floquet periodic boundary condition (FPBC). Two types of optimization problems are taken as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the standard finite element analysis (FEA).

  abstract     = {This paper presents an approach for efficient uncertainty analysis (UA) using an intrusive generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion. The key step of the gPC-based uncertainty quantification ( UQ) is the stochastic Galerkin (SG) projection, which can convert a stochastic model into a set of coupled deterministic models. The SG projection generally yields a high-dimensional integration problem with respect to the number of random variables used to describe the parametric uncertainties in a model. However, when the number of uncertainties is large and when the governing equation of the system is highly nonlinear, the SG approach-based gPC can be challenging to derive explicit expressions for the gPC coefficients because of the low convergence in the SG projection. To tackle this challenge, we propose to use a bivariate dimension reduction method (BiDRM) in this work to approximate a high-dimensional integral in SG projection with a few one- and two-dimensional integrations. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with three different examples, including chemical reactions and cell signaling. As compared to other UA methods, such as the Monte Carlo simulations and nonintrusive stochastic collocation (SC), the proposed method shows its superior performance in terms of computational efficiency and UA accuracy.},

Then, the presented fractional-order viscoelastic model is included in a variational formulation, conceived for any viscous kernel and discretized in time by employing a discontinuous Galerkin method. The accuracy of the resulting finite element (FE) scheme is analyzed through a model problem, whose exact solution is known; and the most significant variables affecting the solution quality, such as the number of Gaussian quadrature points and time subintervals, are then investigated in terms of error and computational cost. Moreover, the proposed FE integration scheme is applied to study the short- and long-term behavior of concrete structures, which, due to the severe aging exhibited during their service life, represents one of the most challenging time-dependent behavior to be investigated. Eventually, also the Euler implicit method, commonly used in commercial software, is compared.},

However, the computational costs for the setup and the application of monolithic preconditioners are typically higher. In this article, several techniques are applied to monolithic two-level generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (GDSW) preconditioners to further improve the convergence speed and the computing time. In particular, reduced dimension GDSW coarse spaces, restricted and scaled versions of the first level, hybrid, and parallel coupling of the levels, and recycling strategies are investigated. Using a combination of all these improvements, for a small time-dependent Navier-Stokes problem on 240 message passing interface (MPI) ranks, a reduction of 86% of the time-to-solution can be obtained. Even without applying recycling strategies, the time-to-solution can be reduced by more than 50% for a larger steady Stokes problem on 4608 MPI ranks. For the largest problems with 11 979 MPI ranks, the scalability deteriorates drastically for the monolithic GDSW coarse space. On the other hand, using the reduced dimension coarse spaces, good scalability up to 11 979 MPI ranks, which corresponds to the largest problem configuration fitting on the employed supercomputer, could be achieved.},

The convected particle least square interpolation (CPLS) material point method assumes the velocity field inside the material point domain as nonconstant. This velocity field in the material point domain is mapped to the background grid nodes with a moving least squares reconstruction. In this paper, we apply the improved moving least squares method to avoid the instability of the conventional moving least squares method due to a singular matrix. The proposed algorithm can improve convergence rate, as illustrated by numerical examples using the method of manufactured solutions.},

  abstract     = {Efficient inversion of noisy seismic waveform data produced due to elastic wave propagation for the estimation of a high-dimensional elastic modulus vector is achieved. Estimation is carried out in a Bayesian framework using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) that enables efficient statistical estimation over high-dimensional parameters. The truncated Karhunen-Loève (K-L) expansion is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the elastic modulus vector. Expensive computations of the gradient of the state vector with respect to the parameter vector at every step are also eliminated through the adjoint method, which is developed from a general one-step discretization of the governing second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). An Adjoint HMC algorithm that employs a truncated K-L expansion of the elastic modulus vector is presented. The efficacy of the algorithm is investigated with respect to two representative problems with varying geometric complexity. Adjoint HMC offers a significant speed up in gradient calculation time over the direct differentiation counterpart as the number of terms in the K-L expansion increases. The algorithm is able to estimate the true elastic modulus within the credible intervals for both cases.},

The deformation is described using a FDEM-specific mechanistic approach with plastic deformation being formulated in material embedded coordinate systems leading to multiplicative decomposition and plastic flow, that is, resolved in stretch space; this is combined with the FDEM fracture and fragmentation criteria. The result and main novelty of the present work is a robust framework for simulation of large strain solid deformation combined with a multiplicative decomposition-based model that simultaneously involves elasticity, plasticity, and fracture.},

  abstract     = {Free vibration characteristics of thick skew plates reinforced by functionally graded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced composite are presented. Discrete singular convolution (DSC) method is used for the numerical solution of vibration problems via geometric mapping technique. Using the geometric transformation via a four-node element, the straight-sided quadrilateral physical domain is mapped into a square domain in the computational space. Then the method of discrete singular convolution with some singular kernels such as Regularized Shannon&#39;s delta (RSD) and Lagrange&#39;s delta kernels (LDK) have been used for spatial discretizing of the resulting governing equation of motion. Calculated results have been presented in order to show the effects of volume fraction of CNT, skew angles, CNT distribution types, plate aspect ratio and length-to-thickness ratio on the frequency of CNT reinforced skew plate. The current results are compared with the related results available in the literature and obtained by different methods. It is shown that reasonable accurate results are obtained for free vibration of nanocomposite plates with less computational effort for higher modes. Several test examples for different plate have been selected to demonstrate the convergence properties, accuracy, and simplicity in numerical implementation of DSC procedures. This approach has verified the accuracy and applicability of DSC method to the class of problem considered in this study. Furthermore, in the numerical examples in the scope of the study, the results obtained with DSC method using a coarser grid are more accurate than the values obtained by finite elements and differential quadrature (DQ) methods. It is also revealed that the method of discrete singular convolution is a promising and potential approach for computational mechanics of nonrectangular plates with nanocomposite reinforced.},

Elaborating on ideas proposed by Bergan and collaborators in the 1970s, we first describe an easily computable scalar stiffness parameter whose sign and rate of change provide reliable information on the local behavior and complexity of the equilibrium path. We then derive a simple scaling law that adaptively adjusts the length of the next step based on the rate of change of the stiffness parameter at previous points on the path. We show that this scaling is equivalent to keeping a local truncation error constant in each step. We demonstrate with numerical examples that our adaptive method follows a path with a significantly reduced number of points compared to an analysis with uniform step length of the same fidelity level. A comparison with Abaqus illustrates that the truncation error criterion effectively concentrates points around the smallest-scale features of the path, which is generally not possible with automatic incrementation solely based on local convergence properties.},

It is expected that elastoplastic deformation analyses can be performed with high accuracy and efficiency by the complete implicit stress integration algorithm with a return-mapping projection. Various implicit stress integration algorithms for the subloading surface model have been proposed. However, they are applicable only to the monotonic loading behavior since they adopt the incorrect loading criterion presuming that the subloading surface expands in the plastic loading process. In fact, however, the plastic strain rate is induced even when the subloading surface contracts in the elastic trial step. Therefore, erroneous results in the descriptions of unloading-reloading and cyclic loading behaviors are caused in the calculations with the existing algorithms. The complete implicit stress integration method is formulated adopting the rigorous loading criterion and implemented in Abaqus in this study. Numerical analyses for the elastoplastic deformation behaviors in the single-element are performed by the present and the existing algorithms. In addition, the deformation analysis of the R -notched cylinder is performed by the present algorithm. High performability of the present algorithm is confirmed by these numerical calculation results.},

By employing enough quadrature nodes, this method can preserve system energy accurately for conservative system, and then the unconditional stability is achieved automatically. In addition, the energy-decaying method is developed by introducing the energy dissipation term to the energy balance equation, and two free parameters controlling the numerical dissipation are determined based on linear spectral analysis. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is checked on several examples and the results are compared with that of the trapezoidal rule.},

Hybridization offers memory and computational time advantages compared to the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method through a decoupling of elemental degrees of freedom and the introduction of face degrees of freedom that become the only globally coupled unknowns. However, the additional equations of weak flux continuity on each interior face introduce new residuals that augment output error estimates and complicate existing element-centric mesh optimization methods. This work presents techniques for converting face-based error estimates to elements and sampling their reduction with refinement in order to determine element-specific anisotropic convergence rate tensors. The error sampling uses fine-space adjoint projections and does not require additional solves on subelements. Together with a degree-of-freedom cost model, the error models drive metric-based unstructured mesh optimization. Adaptive results for inviscid and viscous two-dimensional flow problems demonstrate (i) improvement of EDG mesh optimality when using error models that incorporate face errors, (ii) the relative insensitivity of HDG mesh optimality to the incorporation of face errors, and (iii) degree of freedom and computational-time benefits of hybridized methods, particularly EDG, relative to DG.},

The RB is generally constructed by the low-rank approximation of a set of observations, taken from full-scale simulations, through truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) of the snapshot matrix. This paper revisits the selection criterion of the RB functions in the study of dynamical systems. In opposition to truncating the set of left singular vectors, taken consecutively in decreasing order of associated singular values, the proposed method takes temporality into account, resulting in a compact, sparse subset of RB functions. Selection strategies, implemented in the reduced-order version of a legacy nonlinear explicit dynamics finite element (FE) code, are compared in both offline and online phases in terms of work of internal forces reconstruction error.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a phase-field method for continuous modeling of cracks with frictional contacts. Compared with standard discrete methods for frictional contacts, the phase-field method has two attractive features: (i) it can represent arbitrary crack geometry without an explicit function or basis enrichment, and (ii) it does not require an algorithm for imposing contact constraints. The first feature, which is common in phase-field models of fracture, is attained by regularizing a sharp interface geometry using a surface density functional. The second feature, which is a unique advantage for contact problems, is achieved by a new approach that calculates the stress tensor in the regularized interface region depending on the contact condition of the interface. Particularly, under a slip condition, this approach updates stress components in the slip direction using a standard contact constitutive law, while making other stress components compatible with stress in the bulk region to ensure nonpenetrating deformation in other directions. We verify the proposed phase-field method using stationary interface problems simulated by discrete methods in the literature. Subsequently, by allowing the phase field to evolve according to brittle fracture theory, we demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s capability for modeling crack growth with frictional contact.},

The solutions are found by solving three smaller decoupled subproblems with two common time-independent coefficient matrices for all realizations, which significantly improves the efficiency for both assembling and solving the matrix systems. The fully coupled Stokes-Darcy system can be first decoupled into two smaller subphysics problems by the idea of the partitioned time stepping, which reduces the size of the linear systems and allows parallel computing for each subphysics problem. The AC further decouples the velocity and pressure which further reduces storage requirements and improves computational efficiency. We prove the long time stability and the convergence for this new ensemble method. Three numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical results and illustrate the features of the algorithm, including the convergence, stability, efficiency, and applicability.},

Such an expansion turns out to be a bottleneck for many practical cases with the size of the representative matrix greater than eight or ten even if the modern computer algebra systems are applied. In this contribution, we propose an alternative approach for low-dispersion customization that avoids explicit determinant expansion. This approach reduces the customization problem to a series of quadratic programming problems and consist of two main steps. First, the customization problem is reformulated as a rank minimization problem for the representative dynamic stiffness matrix evaluated at several discrete pairs of wavenumbers and frequencies. Second, the rank minimization problem is solved approximately via log-det heuristic. Examples for customization of reciprocal mass matrices illustrate capabilities of the proposed approach.},

The discrete systems resulting from the application of the DGMPM discretization in one and two space dimensions are first written. For these problems, a second-order Runge-Kutta and the forward Euler time discretizations are respectively considered. Moreover, the numerical fluxes are computed at cell faces by means of either the Donor-Cell Upwind or the Corner Transport Upwind methods for multidimensional problems. Second, the discrete scheme equations are derived assuming that all cells of a background grid contain at least one particle. Although a Cartesian grid is considered in two space dimensions, the results can be extended to regular grids. The von Neumann linear stability analysis then allows the computation of the critical Courant number for a given space discretization. Although the DGMPM is equivalent to the first-order finite volume method if one particle lies in each element, so that the Courant number can be set to unity, other distributions of particles may restrict the stability region of the scheme. The study of several configurations is then proposed.},

This physical model results in a nonlinear variational inequality problem. The variational inequality is rewritten as a complementary function, and a semismooth Newton method is used to solve the system of equations. For the discretization, we use a hybrid scheme where the displacements are given in terms of degrees of freedom per element, and an additional Lagrange multiplier representing the traction is added on the fracture faces. The novelty of our method comes from combining the Lagrange multiplier from the hybrid scheme with a finite volume discretization of the poroelastic Biot equation, which allows us to directly impose the inequality constraints on each subface. The convergence of the method is studied for several challenging geometries in 2D and 3D, showing that the convergence rates of the finite volume scheme do not deteriorate when it is coupled to the Lagrange multipliers. Our method is especially attractive for the poroelastic problem because it allows for a straightforward coupling between the matrix deformation, contact conditions, and fluid pressure.},

The condition number of the preconditioned operator then satisfies a bound that is independent of coefficient heterogeneities in the problem. The computational cost of the local eigenvalue problems is not negligible, and also a significant load imbalance can be introduced. As a remedy, certain eigenvalue problems are discarded by a theory-guided heuristic strategy, based on the diagonal entries of the stiffness matrices. Additionally, a lightweight pairwise dynamic load balancing strategy is implemented for the eigenvalue problems. The load balancing is supervised by an orchestrating rank using asynchronous point-to-point communication. The resulting method shows good weak and strong scalability up to thousands of cores while fast convergence is obtained even for heterogeneous problems.},

  abstract     = {In this work, an alternative machine learning methodology is proposed, which utilizes nonlinear manifold learning techniques in the frame of surrogate modeling. Under the assumption that the solutions of a parametrized physical system lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, the goal is to unveil the manifold&#39;s intrinsic dimensionality and use it for the construction of a surrogate model, which will be used as a cost-efficient emulator of the high-dimensional physical system. To this purpose, a computational framework based on the diffusion maps algorithm is put forth herein, where a set of system solutions is used to identify the geometry of a low-dimensional space called the diffusion maps space. This space is completely described by a low-dimensional basis, which is constructed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a diffusion operator on the data. The proposed approach exploits the diffusion maps space&#39;s reduced dimensionality for the construction of locally clustered interpolation schemes between the parameter space, the diffusion maps space, and the solution space, which are cheap to evaluate and highly accurate. This way, the need to formulate and solve the governing equations of the system is eliminated. In addition, a sampling methodology is proposed based on the metric of the diffusion maps space to efficiently sample the parameter space, thus ensuring the quality of the surrogate model. Even though it is exploited herein in the premises of uncertainty quantification, this methodology is applicable to any other problem type that depends on some parametric space (ie, optimization, sensitivity analysis, etc). In the numerical examples, it is shown that the proposed surrogate model is capable of high levels of accuracy, as well as significant computational gains.},

The paper details a three-dimensional algorithm that accounts for the changing direction of the tangential force within a time step, the transition from elastic to slip behavior within a time step, possible contact sliding during only part of a time step, and twirling and rotation of the tangential force during a time step. Without three of these adjustments, errors are introduced in the incremental stiffness of an assembly. Without the fourth adjustment, the resulting stress tensor is not only incorrect but it is also no longer a tensor. The algorithm also computes the work increments during a time step, both elastic and dissipative.},

This problem must be accurately solved for, eg, reliability evaluation with the multiscale stochastic stress analysis considering a microscopic geometrical variation of composites. The influence of a geometrical random variation of inclusions on the stress field is not negligible; further, a finite element mesh must be substantially updated for the evaluation of stress field for a significant realization. Therefore, the mesh superposition method based approach is adopted.

  abstract     = {We propose a new embedded finite element method to simulate partial differential equations over domains with internal interfaces. Our approach belongs to the family of surrogate/approximate interface methods and relies on the idea of shifting the location and value of jump interface conditions. This choice has the goal of preserving optimal convergence rates while avoiding small cut cells and related problematic issues, typical of traditional embedded methods. The proposed approach is accurate, robust, efficient, and simple to implement. We apply this concept to internal interface computations in the context of the mixed Poisson problem, also known as the Darcy flow problem. An extensive set of numerical tests is provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {We present the cell-based maximum entropy (CME) approximants in E 3 space by constructing the smooth approximation distance function to polyhedral surfaces. CME is a meshfree approximation method combining the properties of the maximum entropy approximants and the compact support of element-based interpolants. The method is evaluated in problems of large strain elastodynamics for three-dimensional (3D) continua using the well-established meshless total Lagrangian explicit dynamics method. The accuracy and efficiency of the method is assessed in several numerical examples in terms of computational time, accuracy in boundary conditions imposition, and strain energy density error. Due to the smoothness of CME basis functions, the numerical stability in explicit time integration is preserved for large time step. The challenging task of essential boundary condition (EBC) imposition in noninterpolating meshless methods (eg, moving least squares) is eliminated in CME due to the weak Kronecker-delta property. The EBCs are imposed directly, similar to the finite element method. CME is proven a valuable alternative to other meshless and element-based methods for large-scale elastodynamics in 3D. A naive implementation of the CME approximants in E 3 is available to download at https://www.mountris.org/software/mlab/cme .},

  abstract     = {Multiresolution topology optimization (MTO) methods involve decoupling of the design and analysis discretizations, such that a high-resolution design can be obtained at relatively low analysis costs. Recent studies have shown that the MTO method can be approximately 3 and 30 times faster than the traditional topology optimization method for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) problems, respectively. To further exploit the potential of decoupling analysis and design, we propose a d p -adaptive MTO method, which involves locally increasing/decreasing the polynomial degree of the shape functions ( p ) and the design resolution ( d ). The adaptive refinement/coarsening is performed using a composite refinement indicator that includes criteria based on analysis error, presence of intermediate densities, as well as the occurrence of design artifacts referred to as QR-patterns. While standard MTO must rely on filtering to suppress QR-patterns, the proposed adaptive method ensures efficiently that these artifacts are suppressed in the final design, without sacrificing the design resolution. The applicability of the d p -adaptive MTO method is demonstrated on several 2D mechanical design problems. For all the cases, significant speedups in computational time are obtained. In particular for design problems involving low material volume fractions, speedups of up to a factor of 10 can be obtained over the conventional MTO method.},

  abstract     = {Many models of plasticity are built using multiple, simple yield surfaces. Examples include geomechanical models and crystal plasticity. This leads to numerical difficulties, most particularly during the stress update procedure, because the combined yield surface is nondifferentiable, and when employing implicit time stepping to solve numerical models, because the Jacobian is often poorly conditioned. A method is presented that produces a single C 2 differentiable and convex yield function from a plastic model that contains multiple yield surfaces that are individually C 2 differentiable and convex. C 2 differentiability ensures quadratic convergence of implicit stress-update procedures; convexity ensures a unique solution to the stress update problem, whereas smoothness means the Jacobian is much better conditioned. The method contains just one free parameter, and the error incurred through the smoothing procedure is quantified in terms of this parameter. The method is illustrated through three different constitutive models. The method&#39;s performance is quantified in terms of the number of iterations required during stress update as a function of the smoothing parameter. Two simple finite-element models are also solved to compare this method with existing approaches. The method has been added to the open-source “MOOSE” framework, for perfect, nonperfect, associated, and nonassociated plasticity.},

The modified XFEM, a specific form of the stable generalised finite element method, is found to offer advantages in cost and complexity over other approaches, but suffers from suboptimal rates of convergence due to spurious higher-order contributions to the approximation space. An improved modified XFEM is presented, with basis functions “corrected” by projecting out higher-order contributions that cannot be represented by the standard finite element basis. The resulting corrections are independent of the equations being solved and need be pre-computed only once for geometric elements of a given order. An accurate numerical integration scheme that correctly integrates functions with curved discontinuities is also presented. Optimal rates of convergence are then recovered for Poisson problems with both straight and quadratically curved discontinuities for approximations up to order p ≤ 4. These are the first truly optimal convergence results achieved using the XFEM for a curved weak discontinuity and are also the first optimally convergent results achieved using the modified XFEM for any problem with approximations of order p &gt;1. Almost optimal rates of convergence are recovered for an elastic problem with a circular weak discontinuity for approximations up to order p ≤ 4.},

The fracture has been modelled using a subgrid scale model with a continuous pressure across the fracture. The contributions to the tangential stiffness matrix of the fracture have been investigated to assess their impact on convergence. Simulations have been carried out for different interpolation orders and for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines as interpolants vs Lagrangian polynomials. To increase the generality of the results, Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian (power-law) fluids have been considered. Unsurprisingly, a consistent linearisation invariably yields a quadratic convergence but comes at the expense of a loss of symmetry and recalculation of the contribution of the interface to the stiffness matrix at each iteration. When using a linear line search, however, the inclusion of only those terms of the interface stiffness that result in a symmetric and constant tangential stiffness matrix is sufficient to obtain a stable and convergent iterative process.},

  abstract     = {This article addresses the compliance problem along with the piezoelectric actuator design for active vibration control. The topology structural design is obtained by solving a compliance minimization problem with volume constraint, whereas the actuator design is carried out by the maximization of a control performance index written in terms of the controllability Gramian. This measure describes the ability of the actuator to move the structure from an initial condition to a desired final state, at rest for instance, in a finite time interval. The actuator design is also characterized by the polarization profile, which is defined according to the distribution of an additional design variable. Therefore, the actuators can yield both tensile and compressing fields at different points of the structure using the same applied control voltage. To achieve this goal, a material interpolation scheme based on the solid isotropic material with penalization and the piezoelectric material with penalization and polarization (PEMAP-P) models is employed, and both the optimum structure/actuator layout and polarization profile are obtained simultaneously. The sensitivities with respect to the polarization and design variables are calculated analytically. Numerical examples are presented considering the design and vibration control for a cantilever beam, a beam fixed at both ends, and an L-bracket structure to show the efficiency of the proposed formulation. The control performance of the designed structures are analyzed employing a linear-quadratic regulator simulation, and these results are compared to verify the influence of the optimized polarization profiles.},

The most important goal is to compute the stochastic characteristics of the random stress, such as the expectation value and the standard deviation. An accurate approach are Monte Carlo simulations; however, they consume drastic computational power due to the large number of stochastic realizations that have to be simulated before convergence is achieved. In this paper, we show that a recently published approach for accurate modeling of viscoelastic materials with stochastic material properties at the material point level in the work of Junker and Nagel is also valid for macroscopic bodies. The method is based on a separation of random but time-invariant variables and time-dependent but deterministic variables for the strain response at the material point (time-separated stochastic mechanics [TSM]). We recall the governing equations, derive a simplified form, and discuss the numerical implementation into a finite element routine. To validate our approach, we compare the TSM simulations with Monte Carlo simulations, which provide the “true” answer but at unaffordable computational costs. In contrast, the numerical effort of our approach is in the same range as for deterministic viscoelastic simulations.},

For the former, we consider several well-established schemes like Mori-Tanaka or self-consistent as basic models, and for the latter, as superior models, unit cell problems are solved via the FEM under an a priori chosen boundary condition. For a further stage of the model hierarchy, we consider hierarchical unit cells within the frame of the FEM toward an adaptive selection of the unit cell size.

Numerical modeling of the changes in permeability and poroelastic properties of the near-wellbore region is challenging due to the coupling between fracture dynamics and poromechanics across multiple length scales of fractures and the host rock. We present a numerical framework to model anisotropic and dynamic evolution in rock properties based on a coupled formulation of fluid flow, rock mechanics, and fracturing, where fracturing-induced damage is used to update the rock properties. A generalized fixed-stress method, which accounts for damage-induced anisotropy in flow and deformation processes, is developed to sequentially solve the equations of flow, mechanics, and fracture evolution. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework in quantifying the effects of injection rate variability, initial fracture distribution, and in-situ stress state on the evolution in permeability, elastic stiffness, and the Biot parameters. Our framework does not require the computational mesh to conform to existing or future fractures, allows simultaneous growth of multiple randomly distributed fractures, and can be implemented relatively easily in existing coupled flow-geomechanics simulators to extend them to model fracturing at the reservoir scale.},

The paper at hand presents a novel approach within the framework of phase-field models for brittle fracture. A rate-dependent fracture toughness is formulated as a function of the rate of crack driving strain components, which results in higher strength for faster loading. Beside the increased amount of energy necessary to evolve a crack at a high strain rate loading situation, the model incorporates quasi-viscous stress-type quantities that are not directly related to the formation of the crack and exist only in the phase-field transition zone between broken and sound material. The governing strong form equations for a transient simulation are derived and the relevant information for an implementation of the model into a finite element code is outlined in detail. The performance of the model is demonstrated for static and dynamic benchmark simulations and for a comparison to experimental findings.},

Among them, the iterative scheme based on the Neumann series is simple and efficient. For such schemes, a priori global error estimates on local fields and effective property are not available, and this is the concern of this article, which focuses on the simple, but illustrative, conductivity problem in laminated composites. The global error is split into an iteration error, associated with the Neumann series expansion, and a discretization error. The featured nonlocal Green&#39;s operator is expressed in terms of the averaging operator, which circumvents the use of the Fourier transform. The Neumann series is formulated in a discrete setting, and the eigendecomposition of the iterated matrix is performed. The ensuing analysis shows that the local fields are computed using a particular subset of eigenvectors, the iteration error being governed by the associated eigenvalues. Quadratic error bounds on the effective property are also discussed. The discretization error is shown to be related to the accuracy of the trapezoidal quadrature scheme. These results are illustrated numerically, and their extension to other configurations is discussed.},

  abstract     = {The solution of frequency dependent linear systems arising from the discretization of vibro-acoustic problems requires a significant computational effort in the case of rapidly varying responses. In this paper, we review the use of a greedy reduced basis scheme for the efficient solution in a frequency range. The reduced basis is spanned by responses of the system at certain frequencies that are chosen iteratively based on the response that is currently worst approximated in each step. The approximations at intermediate frequencies as well as the a posteriori estimations of associated errors are computed using a least squares solver. The proposed scheme is applied to the solution of an interior acoustic problem with boundary element method (BEM) and to the solution of coupled structural acoustic problems with finite element method and BEM. The computational times are compared to those of a conventional frequencywise strategy. The results illustrate the efficiency of the method.},

  abstract     = {We consider structural optimization (SO) under uncertainty formulated as a mathematical game between two players –– a “designer” and “nature”. The first player wants to design a structure that performs optimally, whereas the second player tries to find the worst possible conditions to impose on the structure. Several solution concepts exist for such games, including Stackelberg and Nash equilibria and Pareto optima. Pareto optimality is shown not to be a useful solution concept. Stackelberg and Nash games are, however, both of potential interest, but these concepts are hardly ever discussed in the literature on SO under uncertainty. Based on concrete examples of topology optimization of trusses and finite element-discretized continua under worst-case load uncertainty, we therefore analyze and compare the two solution concepts. In all examples, Stackelberg equilibria exist and can be found numerically, but for some cases we demonstrate nonexistence of Nash equilibria. This motivates a view of the Stackelberg solution concept as the correct one. However, we also demonstrate that existing Nash equilibria can be found using a simple so-called decomposition algorithm, which could be of interest for other instances of SO under uncertainty, where it is difficult to find a numerically efficient Stackelberg formulation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the dimension splitting reproducing kernel particle method (DSRKPM) for three-dimensional (3D) potential problems is presented. In the DSRKPM, a 3D potential problem can be transformed into a series of two-dimensional (2D) ones in the dimension splitting direction. The reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) is used to solve each 2D problem, the essential boundary conditions are imposed by penalty method, and the discretized equation is obtained from Galerkin weak form of potential problems. Finite difference method is used in the dimension splitting direction. Then, by combining a series of the equations of the RKPM for solving 2D problems, the final equation of the DSRKPM for 3D potential problems is obtained. Five example problems on regular or irregular domains are selected to show that the DSRKPM has higher computational efficiency than the RKPM and the improved element-free Galerkin method for 3D potential problems.},

  abstract     = {An extension of the probabilistic learning on manifolds (PLoM), recently introduced by the authors, has been presented: In addition to the initial data set given for performing the probabilistic learning, constraints are given, which correspond to statistics of experiments or of physical models. We consider a non-Gaussian random vector whose unknown probability distribution has to satisfy constraints. The method consists in constructing a generator using the PLoM and the classical Kullback-Leibler minimum cross-entropy principle. The resulting optimization problem is reformulated using Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints. The optimal solution of the Lagrange multipliers is computed using an efficient iterative algorithm. At each iteration, the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm developed for the PLoM is used, consisting in solving an Itô stochastic differential equation that is projected on a diffusion-maps basis. The method and the algorithm are efficient and allow the construction of probabilistic models for high-dimensional problems from small initial data sets and for which an arbitrary number of constraints are specified. The first application is sufficiently simple in order to be easily reproduced. The second one is relative to a stochastic elliptic boundary value problem in high dimension.},

  abstract     = {The classical bond-based peridynamic (BPD) model is limited with a fixed Poisson&#39;s ratio. To overcome this limitation, an improved BPD model is proposed to analyze the deformation and crack propagation of microelastic brittle materials with emphasis on varying Poisson&#39;s ratios. In the proposed model, the bond is subjected to axial and transverse pairwise forces, and the particle rotation angle is added to eliminate the additional bending moment caused by transverse forces, which is a key factor to satisfy the balance of angular momentum exactly. As a result, the bond not only has axial displacement but also has transverse displacement and particle rotation. This extension in the displacement mode overcomes the limitation of the fixed Poisson&#39;s ratio in the classical BPD model. The simulation results demonstrate the precision of the improved BPD model and prove its ability to predict deformations and crack propagations.},

An optimal A-stable linear two-step (OALTS) time integration method is revealed with desirable performance on low-frequency accuracy and high-frequency numerical dissipation properties. The OALTS time integration method is implemented in a direct integration manner for the second-order equations of structural dynamics; is implicit, A-stable, and second-order accurate in displacement, velocity, and acceleration, simultaneously; is easily started; and is numerical dissipation controllable. The OALTS time integration method shows desirable performance on spectral radius distribution, dissipation and dispersion errors, and overshooting behavior, where the results of some typical algorithms in the literature are also compared. Benchmark examples with/without physical damping are performed to validate the accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the OALTS time integration method.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we propose a framework that constructs reduced-order models for nonlinear structural mechanics in a nonintrusive fashion and can handle large-scale simulations. Three steps are carried out: (i) the production of high-fidelity solutions by commercial software, (ii) the offline stage of the model reduction, and (iii) the online stage where the reduced-order model is exploited. The nonintrusivity assumes that only the displacement field solution is known, and the proposed framework carries out operations on these simulation data during the offline phase. The compatibility with a new commercial code only needs the implementation of a routine converting the discretized solution into our in-house data format. The nonintrusive capabilities of the framework are demonstrated on numerical experiments using commercial versions of Z-set and Ansys Mechanical. The nonlinear constitutive equations are evaluated by using an external plugin. The large-scale simulations are handled using domain decomposition and parallel computing with distributed memory. The features and performances of the framework are evaluated on two numerical applications involving elastoviscoplastic materials: the second one involves a model of high-pressure blade, where the framework is used to extrapolate cyclic loadings in 6.5 hours, whereas the reference high-fidelity computation would take 9.5 days.},

  abstract     = {We present a general framework to solve elastodynamic problems by means of the virtual element method (VEM) with explicit time integration. In particular, the VEM is extended to analyze nearly incompressible solids using the B-bar method. We show that, to establish a B-bar formulation in the VEM setting, one simply needs to modify the stability term to stabilize only the deviatoric part of the stiffness matrix, which requires no additional computational effort. Convergence of the numerical solution is addressed in relation to stability, mass lumping scheme, element size, and distortion of arbitrary elements, either convex or nonconvex. For the estimation of the critical time step, two approaches are presented, ie, the maximum eigenvalue of a system of mass and stiffness matrices and an effective element length. Computational results demonstrate that small edges on convex polygonal elements do not significantly affect the critical time step, whereas convergence of the VEM solution is observed regardless of the stability term and the element shape in both two and three dimensions. This extensive investigation provides numerical recipes for elastodynamic VEMs with explicit time integration and related problems.},
